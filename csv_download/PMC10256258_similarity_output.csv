10.15252/embj.2021109221,Deciphering functional tumor states at single-cell resolution.,2021.0,"Within a tumor, cancer cells exist in different states that are associated with        distinct tumor functions, including proliferation, differentiation, invasion,        metastasis, and resistance to anti-cancer therapy. The identification of the gene        regulatory networks underpinning each state is essential for better understanding        functional tumor heterogeneity and revealing tumor vulnerabilities. Here, we        review the different studies identifying tumor states by single-cell sequencing        approaches and the mechanisms that promote and sustain these functional states        and regulate their transitions. We also describe how different tumor states are        spatially distributed and interact with the specific stromal cells that compose        the tumor microenvironment. Finally, we discuss how the understanding of tumor        plasticity and transition states can be used to develop new strategies to improve        cancer therapy.",9ff446d19ae6a6b60d2575a42e43ba52f3368b47,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9ff446d19ae6a6b60d2575a42e43ba52f3368b47,34918370,PMC8762559,background,False,The EMBO journal,8208664,0.7897205948829651,0.03125,23,14.012,0.7454545454545455,0.8363636363636363,0.48668890573761675

The ideal platform would enable rapid screening of        cell type-specific drug sensitivities directly in patient tumor tissue and reveal        strategies to overcome intratumoral heterogeneity. METHODS: We combine        multiplexed drug perturbation in acute slice culture from freshly resected tumors        with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to profile transcriptome-wide drug        responses in individual patients. We applied this approach to drug perturbations        on slices derived from six glioblastoma (GBM) resections to identify conserved        drug responses and to one additional GBM resection to identify patient-specific        responses. RESULTS: We used scRNA-seq to demonstrate that acute slice cultures        recapitulate the cellular and molecular features of the originating tumor tissue        and the feasibility of drug screening from an individual tumor. Detailed        investigation of etoposide, a topoisomerase poison, and the histone deacetylase        (HDAC) inhibitor panobinostat in acute slice cultures revealed cell type-specific        responses across multiple patients. Etoposide has a conserved impact on        proliferating tumor cells, while panobinostat treatment affects both tumor and        non-tumor populations, including unexpected effects on the immune        microenvironment. CONCLUSIONS: Acute slice cultures recapitulate the major        cellular and molecular features of GBM at the single-cell level. In combination        with scRNA-seq, this approach enables cell type-specific analysis of sensitivity        to multiple drugs in individual tumors.

Direct comparison of the epigenetic profiles of distinct cell        states revealed key switches for state transitions recapitulating        neurodevelopmental trajectories and highlighted dysregulated epigenetic        mechanisms underlying gliomagenesis. We further developed a quantitative        framework to directly measure cell state heritability and transition dynamics        based on high-resolution lineage trees in human samples. We demonstrated        heritability of malignant cell states, with key differences in hierarchal and        plastic cell state architectures in IDH-mutant glioma versus IDH-wild-type        glioblastoma, respectively.

However, little is known about        how the spatial organization of GBM genomes underlies this heterogeneity and its        effects. Here, we compile a cohort of 28 patient-derived glioblastoma stem        cell-like lines (GSCs) known to reflect the properties of their tumor-of-origin;        six of these were primary-relapse tumor pairs from the same patient. We generate        and analyze 5â€‰kbp-resolution chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) data from all        GSCs to systematically map thousands of standalone and complex structural        variants (SVs) and the multitude of neoloops arising as a result. By combining        Hi-C, histone modification, and gene expression data with chromatin folding        simulations, we explain how the pervasive, uneven, and idiosyncratic occurrence        of neoloops sustains tumor-specific transcriptional programs via the formation of        new enhancer-promoter contacts. We also show how even moderately recurrent        neoloops can relate to patient-specific vulnerabilities.

The inherently cold tumor immune        microenvironment (TIME) in gliomas, characterized by a high ratio of pro-tumor to        anti-tumor immune cell infiltrates, acts as a seemingly insurmountable barrier to        immunotherapy. Glioma stem cells (GSCs) within these tumors are key contributors        to this cold TIME, often functioning indirectly through activation and        recruitment of pro-tumor immune cell types. Furthermore, drivers of GSC        plasticity and heterogeneity (e.g., reprogramming transcription factors,        epigenetic modifications) are associated with induction of immunosuppressive cell        states. Recent studies have identified GSC-intrinsic mechanisms, including        functional mimicry of immune suppressive cell types, as key determinants of        anti-tumor immune escape. In this review, we cover recent advancements in our        understanding of GSC-intrinsic mechanisms that modulate GSC-TIME interactions and        discuss cutting-edge techniques and bioinformatics platforms available to study        immune modulation at high cellular resolution with exploration of both malignant        (i.e., GSC) and non-malignant (i.e., immune) cell fractions.

Tumors of glial origin have been the subject of intense research        because of their rapid and fatal progression. From a clinical point of view,        complete surgical resection of gliomas is highly difficult. Moreover, the        remaining tumor cells are resistant to traditional therapies such as radio- or        chemotherapy and tumors always recur. Here we have revised the new genetic and        epigenetic classification of gliomas and the description of the different        transcriptional subtypes. In order to understand the progression of the different        gliomas we have focused on the interaction of the plastic tumor cells with their        vasculature-rich microenvironment and with their distinct immune system. We        believe that a comprehensive characterization of the glioma microenvironment will        shed some light into why these tumors behave differently from other cancers.

10.3390/cancers13164004,The Renin-Angiotensin System in the Tumor Microenvironment of Glioblastoma.,2021.0,"Glioblastoma (GB) is an aggressive primary brain tumor. Despite intensive        research over the past 50 years, little advance has been made to improve the poor        outcome, with an overall median survival of 14.6 months following standard        treatment. Local recurrence is inevitable due to the quiescent cancer stem cells        (CSCs) in GB that co-express stemness-associated markers and components of the        renin-angiotensin system (RAS). The dynamic and heterogeneous tumor        microenvironment (TME) plays a fundamental role in tumor development,        progression, invasiveness, and therapy resistance. There is increasing evidence        showing the critical role of the RAS in the TME influencing CSCs via its upstream        and downstream pathways. Drugs that alter the hallmarks of cancer by modulating        the RAS present a potential new therapeutic alternative or adjunct to        conventional treatment of GB.

Increasing evidence shows that        glioblastoma (GBM) cells display prominent intrinsic plasticity and reversibly        adapt to dynamic microenvironmental conditions. Limited genetic evolution at        recurrence further suggests that resistance mechanisms also largely operate at        the phenotypic level. Here we review recent literature underpinning the role of        GBM plasticity in creating gradients of heterogeneous cells including those that        carry cancer stem cell (CSC) properties. A historical perspective from the        hierarchical to the nonhierarchical concept of CSCs towards the recent        appreciation of GBM plasticity is provided. Cellular states interact dynamically        with each other and with the surrounding brain to shape a flexible tumor        ecosystem, which enables swift adaptation to external pressure including        treatment. We present the key components regulating intra-tumoral phenotypic        heterogeneity and the equilibrium of phenotypic states, including genetic,        epigenetic, and microenvironmental factors. We further discuss plasticity in the        context of intrinsic tumor resistance, where a variable balance between        preexisting resistant cells and adaptive persisters leads to reversible        adaptation upon treatment.

Communication        between GBMs and non-glioma cells in the tumor microenvironment plays a vital        role in tumor growth and recurrence. Emerging data have suggested that neural        stem cells (NSCs) in the subventricular zone (SVZ) are the cells-of-origin of        gliomas, and SVZ NSC involvement is associated with the progression and        recurrence of GBM.

Single-cell profiling of ltGLICOs revealed an        unexpectedly long latency period prior to GSC expansion, and that normal organoid        development was unimpaired by the presence of low numbers of GSCs. However, as        organoids age they experience chronic hypoxia and oxidative stress which remodels        the tumor microenvironment to promote GSC expansion. Receptor-ligand modelling        identified astrocytes, which secreted various pro-tumorigenic ligands including        FGF1, as the primary cell type for GSC crosstalk and single-cell multi-omic        analysis revealed these astrocytes were under the control of ischemic regulatory        networks.

The recent molecular stratification of gliomas        by the World Health Organisation in 2021 is expected to improve outcomes for        patients in neuro-oncology through the development of treatments targeted to        specific tumour types. Despite this promise, research is hindered by the lack of        preclinical modelling platforms capable of recapitulating the heterogeneity and        cellular phenotypes of tumours residing in their native human brain        microenvironment. The microenvironment provides cues to subsets of glioma cells        that influence proliferation, survival, and gene expression, thus altering        susceptibility to therapeutic intervention. As such, conventional in vitro        cellular models poorly reflect the varied responses to chemotherapy and        radiotherapy seen in these diverse cellular states that differ in transcriptional        profile and differentiation status. In an effort to improve the relevance of        traditional modelling platforms, recent attention has focused on human        pluripotent stem cell-based and tissue engineering techniques, such as        three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting and microfluidic devices.

This disease state is characterized by an abundance of CD68(+)        microglia and CD163(+) bone marrow-derived macrophages with the greater the        percentage of CD163(+) cells, the poorer the prognosis. These macrophages are        ""cold,"" in that their phenotype is of an alternatively activated state        (M0-M2-like) supporting tumor growth rather than being engaged with classically        activated, pro-inflammatory, and anti-tumor activities, referred to as ""hot"", or        M1-like.

However, with the advent and explosion of        next-generation sequencing, cancer phenotypes are turning out to be far more        heterogenous than initially thought, and the classification is continually being        updated to include more subtypes. Tumors are indeed highly dynamic, and they can        evolve and undergo various changes in their characteristics during disease        progression. The picture becomes even more complex when the tumor responds to a        therapy. In all these cases, cancer cells acquire the ability to        transdifferentiate, changing subtype, and adapt to changing microenvironments.        These modifications affect the tumor's growth rate, invasiveness, response to        treatment, and overall clinical behavior. Studying tumor subtype transitions is        crucial for understanding tumor evolution, predicting disease outcomes, and        developing personalized treatment strategies.

The tumor microenvironment (TME) plays an essential role in tumor maintenance,        progression, and immunotherapy resistance. Therefore, the LGG TME deserves        comprehensive exploration for a novel therapeutic target. Methods: The ESTIMATE        algorithm was used to estimate infiltrating stromal and immune cells of LGG        patients obtained from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Kaplan-Meier        analysis was performed to classify survival differences. TME-related        differentially expressed genes were identified between the low- and        high-immune/stromal groups. Hub genes were screened by constructing        protein-protein interaction networks and performing the Cox regression analysis.        Differential analysis, survival analysis, gene set enrichment analysis, and        clinical relevance analysis specific to hub genes were evaluated by using the        TCGA and the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas datasets, and the results were validated        by qRT-PCR, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry in tissues from LGG        patients. Results: The immune and stromal components in TME were negatively        related to patient prognosis. Differentially expressed genes sharing immune score        and stromal score were mainly involved in the immune response. C-C chemokine        receptor type 5 (CCR5), as only a hub gene, was significantly higher in LGG        patients than normal patients and negatively correlated with the prognosis of        patients. High-expression CCR5 was positively related to immune-related and tumor        progression pathways. CCR5 protein expression was higher in LGG with isocitrate        dehydrogenase wildtype. Validated results showed that CCR5 was upregulated in LGG        tissues at mRNA and protein levels and could affect immune cell infiltration.        These results suggested that CCR5 was a potential indicator for the status of        TME.

We have generated UM-002, a novel brain penetrant BET        inhibitor that reduces GBM cell proliferation in vitro and in a human cerebral        brain organoid model. Since UM-002 is more potent than other BET inhibitors, it        could potentially be developed for GBM treatment. Furthermore, UM-002 treatment        reduces the expression of cell-cycle related genes in vivo and reduces the        expression of invasion related genes within the non-proliferative cells present        in tumors as measured by single cell RNA-sequencing. These studies suggest that        BET inhibition alters the transcriptional landscape of GBM tumors, which has        implications for designing combination therapies.

However, a systematic investigation        into the prognostic value of AS events in glioblastoma (GBM) is urgently        required. The gene expression profile and matched AS events data of GBM patients        were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas Project (TCGA) and TCGA SpliceSeq        database, respectively. 775 AS events were identified as prognostic factors using        univariate Cox regression analysis. The least absolute shrinkage and selection        operator (LASSO) cox model was performed to narrow down candidate AS events, and        a risk score model based on several AS events were developed subsequently. The        risk score-based signature was proved as an efficient predictor of overall        survival and was closely related to the tumor purity and immunosuppression in        GBM. Combined similarity network fusion and consensus clustering (SNF-CC)        analysis revealed two distinct GBM subtypes based on the prognostic AS events,        and the associations between this novel molecular classification and        clinicopathological factors, immune cell infiltration, as well as immunogenic        features were further explored.

GSCs can be divided into the mesenchymal        (MES) and proneural (PN) subtypes, and these two subtypes of GSCs can undergo        interconversion under certain conditions. MES GSCs have higher malignancy and        radioresistance and are closely associated with an immunosuppressive        microenvironment. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play a broad role in GBM, while        the role of GSCs subtype remains unknown. Methods: We performed RNA sequencing to        explore the lncRNA expression profile in MES- and PN-subtype GBM tissues. The        biological function of a host gene-MIR222HG-in GBM development was confirmed in        vitro and in vivo. Specifically, RNA sequencing, RNA pulldown, mass spectrometry,        RIP, ChIP, luciferase reporter assays and Co-IP were performed. Results:        MIR222HG, the expression of which can be induced by SPI1, has high levels in MES        GBM tissues. Functionally, we demonstrated that MIR222HG promotes the MES        transition and radioresistance in GSCs in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically,        MIR222HG can bind to the YWHAE/HDAC5 complex to promote the MES transition of        GSCs through H4 deacetylation. Moreover, cotranscribed miR221 and miR222 can be        delivered to macrophages via exosomes to target SOCS3, causing immunosuppressive        polarization. Finally, PLX-4720 sensitivity is associated with SPI1 expression        and acts on MES GSCs to enhance radiosensitivity. Conclusions: This study        demonstrates that targeting SPI1 to block transcription of the MIR222HG cluster        helps to reduce radioresistance and combat the immunosuppressive microenvironment        in GBM.

Almost all the        conventional and new treatments fail to hinder tumoral growth of the most        malignant brain tumors. This is due to multiple factors, such as intra-tumor        heterogeneity, the microenvironmental properties of the human brain, and the lack        of reliable models to test new therapies. Therefore, creating faithful models for        each tumor and discovering tailored treatments pose great challenges in the fight        against brain cancer.

Simplified two-dimensional (2D) cell culture and neurospheres in vitro models        fail to recapitulate the complexity of the tumor microenvironment, limiting its        ability to predict therapeutic response. Three-dimensional (3D) scaffold-based        models have emerged as a promising alternative for addressing these concerns. One        such 3D system is gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) hydrogels, and we aimed to        understand the suitability of using this system to mimic treatment-resistant        glioblastoma cells that reside in specific niches. We characterized the phenotype        of patient-derived glioma cells cultured in GelMA hydrogels (3D-GMH) for their        tumorigenic properties using invasion and chemoresponse assays. In addition, we        used integrated single-cell and spatial transcriptome analysis to compare cells        cultured in 3D-GMH to neoplastic cells in vivo. Finally, we assessed tumor-immune        cell interactions with a macrophage infiltration assay and a cytokine array. We        show that the 3D-GMH system enriches treatment-resistant mesenchymal cells that        are not represented in neurosphere cultures. Cells cultured in 3D-GMH resemble a        mesenchymal-like cellular phenotype found in perivascular and hypoxic regions and        recruit macrophages by secreting cytokines, a hallmark of the mesenchymal        phenotype. Our 3D-GMH model effectively mimics the phenotype of glioma cells that        are found in the perivascular and hypoxic niches of the glioblastoma core in        situ, in contrast to the neurosphere cultures that enrich cells of the        infiltrative edge of the tumor.

Through a cell surface marker screen, we identified that CD142 (tissue factor or        F3) is robustly induced in the senescence-associated Î²-galactosidase        (SA-Î²Gal)-positive GBM cells after irradiation. F3 promotes clonal expansion of        irradiated SA-Î²Gal(+) GBM cells and orchestrates oncogenic TME remodeling by        activating both tumor-autonomous signaling and extrinsic coagulation pathways.        Intratumoral F3 signaling induces a mesenchymal-like cell state transition and        elevated chemokine secretion. Simultaneously, F3-mediated focal hypercoagulation        states lead to activation of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and        extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling.

The        exact molecular mechanisms underlying TAMs' function in promoting glioma stem        cells (GSCs) maintenance and tumor growth remain largely unknown. We found a        candidate molecule, transforming growth factor beta-induced (TGFBI), that was        specifically expressed by TAMs and extremely low in GBM and GSC cells, and        meanwhile closely related to glioma WHO grades and patient prognosis. The exact        mechanism of TGFBI linking TAM functions to GSC-driven tumor growth was explored.        Methods: Western blot, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), enzyme-linked        immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunofluorescence (IF), immunohistochemistry        staining (IHC) and public datasets were used to evaluate TGFBI origin and level        in GBM. The response of GSCs to recombinant human TGFBI was assessed in vitro and        orthotopic xenografts were established to investigate the function and mechanism        in vivo. Results: M2-like TAMs infiltration was elevated in high-grade gliomas.        TGFBI was preferentially secreted by M2-like TAMs and associated with a poor        prognosis for patients with GBM. TGFBI promoted the maintenance of GSCs and GBM        malignant growth through integrin Î±vÎ²5-Src-Stat3 signaling in vitro and in vivo.        Of clinical relevance, TGFBI was enriched in the serum and CSF of GBM patients        and significantly decreased after tumor resection.

Many previous        studies have focused on resistance mechanisms intrinsic to cancer cells; the        microenvironment surrounding tumor cells has been found more recently to have        significant impacts on the response to chemotherapeutic agents. Extracellular        matrix (ECM) proteins may confer cell adhesion-mediated drug resistance (CAMDR).        Here, expression of the ECM proteins laminin, vitronectin, and fibronectin was        assessed in clinical GBM tumors using immunohistochemistry. Then, patient-derived        GBM cells grown in monolayers on precoated laminin, vitronectin, or fibronectin        substrates were treated with cilengitide, an integrin inhibitor, and/or        carmustine, an alkylating chemotherapy. Cell adhesion and viability were        quantified. Transcription factor (TF) activities were assessed over time using a        bioluminescent assay in which GBM cells were transduced with lentiviruses        containing consensus binding sites for specific TFs linked to expression a        firefly luciferase reporter. Apoptosis, mediated by p53, was analyzed by Western        blotting and immunocytofluorescence. Integrin Î± (v) activation of the        FAK/paxillin/AKT signaling pathway and effects on expression of the proliferative        marker Ki67 were investigated. To assess effects of integrin Î± (v) activation of        AKT and ERK pathways, which are typically deregulated in GBM, and expression of        epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which is amplified and/or mutated in        many GBM tumors, shRNA knockdown was used. Laminin, vitronectin, and fibronectin        were abundant in clinical GBM tumors and promoted CAMDR in GBM cells cultured on        precoated substrates. Cilengitide treatment induced cell detachment, which was        most pronounced for cells cultured on vitronectin. Cilengitide treatment        increased cytotoxicity of carmustine, reversing CAMDR. ECM adhesion increased        activity of NFÎºB and decreased that of p53, leading to suppression of        p53-mediated apoptosis and upregulation of multidrug resistance gene 1 (MDR1;        also known as ABCB1 or P-glycoprotein). Expression of Ki67 was correlative with        activation of the integrin Î± (v) -mediated FAK/paxillin/AKT signaling pathway.

METHODS:        Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7)        were used to investigate the psychological condition of GBM patients in our        department. To further explore the potential mechanism, bioinformatic methods        were used to screen out genes that could be indicators of outcome in GBM,        followed by gene ontology (GO) analysis, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes        (KEGG) analysis, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis. Further,        cellular experiments were conducted to evaluate the proliferation, migration        capacity of primary GBM cells from the patients. RESULTS: It was revealed that        patients with higher PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores had significantly worse prognosis        than their lower-scored counterparts. Bioinformatic mining revealed that LTBP1        could be a potential genetic mechanism in both depressive/anxiety disorder and        GBM. Primary GBM cells with different expression level of LTBP1 should        significantly different proliferation and migration capacity. GO, KEGG analysis        confirmed that extracellular matrix (ECM) was the most enriched function of        LTBP1. PPI network showed the interaction of proteins altered by LTBP1. Hub genes        COL1A2, COL5A1 and COL10A1, as well as mesenchymal marker CD44 and Vimentin were        statistically higher expressed in LTBP1 high group; while proneural marker        E-cadherin was significantly higher expressed in low LTBP1 group. CONCLUSION:        There is closely correlation between depressive/anxiety disorders and GBM. LTBP1        could be a potential bridge linking the two diseases through the regulation of        ECM.",066d9ae4f45b7f5a844694f91ed36149473015e2,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/066d9ae4f45b7f5a844694f91ed36149473015e2,33059753,PMC7566028,background,False,Journal of translational medicine,101190741,0.16599829494953156,0.0,8,8.44,0.5272727272727272,0.6909090909090909,0.2325267612121322

The        complexity of brain structure and function makes brain cancer modeling extremely        difficult, limiting pathological studies and therapeutic developments.        Advancements in human pluripotent stem cell technology have opened a window of        opportunity for brain cancer modeling, providing a wealth of customizable methods        to simulate the disease in vitro. This is achieved with the advent of genome        editing and genetic engineering technologies that can simulate germline and        somatic mutations found in human brain tumors. This review investigates induced        pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-based approaches to model human brain cancer. The        applications of iPSCs as renewable sources of individual brain cell types, brain        organoids, blood-brain barrier (BBB), and brain tumor models are discussed.

These aggressive tumours are characterised by inherent treatment        resistance and disease progression, contributing to ~â€‰190â€‰000 brain        tumour-related deaths globally each year. Current therapeutic interventions        consist of surgical resection followed by radiotherapy and temozolomide        chemotherapy, but average survival is typically around 1â€‰year, with <â€‰10% of        patients surviving more than 5â€‰years. Recently, a fourth treatment modality of        intermediate-frequency low-intensity electric fields [called tumour-treating        fields (TTFields)] was clinically approved for glioblastoma in some countries        after it was found to increase median overall survival rates by ~â€‰5â€‰months in a        phase III randomised clinical trial. However, beyond these treatments, attempts        to establish more effective therapies have yielded little improvement in survival        for patients over the last 50â€‰years. This is in contrast to many other types of        cancer and highlights glioblastoma as a recognised tumour of unmet clinical need.        Previous work has revealed that glioblastomas contain stem cell-like        subpopulations that exhibit heightened expression of DNA damage response (DDR)        factors, contributing to therapy resistance and disease relapse. Given that        radiotherapy, chemotherapy and TTFields-based therapies all impact DDR        mechanisms, this Review will focus on our current knowledge of the role of the        DDR in glioblastoma biology and treatment.

This study aims to mine fibroblast-related genes with        prognostic value and construct a corresponding prognostic model. METHODS: A        glioma-related TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) cohort and a CGGA (Chinese Glioma        Genome Atlas) cohort were incorporated into this study. Variance expression        profiling was executed via the ""limma"" R package. The ""clusterProfiler"" R package        was applied to perform a GO (Gene Ontology) analysis. The Kaplan-Meier (K-M)        curve, LASSO regression analysis, and Cox analyses were implemented to determine        the prognostic genes. A fibroblast-related risk model was created and affirmed by        independent cohorts. We derived enriched pathways between the fibroblast-related        high- and low-risk subgroups using gene set variation analysis (GSEA). The immune        infiltration cell and the stromal cell were calculated using the microenvironment        cell populations-counter (MCP-counter) method, and the immunotherapy response was        assessed with the SubMap algorithm. The chemotherapy sensitivity was estimated        using the ""pRRophetic"" R package. RESULTS: A total of 93 differentially expressed        fibroblast-related genes (DEFRGs) were uncovered in glioma. Seven prognostic        genes were filtered out to create a fibroblast-related gene signature in the        TCGA-glioma cohort training set. We then affirmed the fibroblast-related risk        model via TCGA-glioma cohort and CGGA-glioma cohort testing sets. The Cox        regression analysis proved that the fibroblast-related risk score was an        independent prognostic predictor in prediction of the overall survival of glioma        patients. The fibroblast-related gene signature revealed by the GSEA was        applicable to the immune-relevant pathways. The MCP-counter algorithm results        pointed to significant distinctions in the tumor microenvironment between        fibroblast-related high- and low-risk subgroups. The SubMap analysis proved that        the fibroblast-related risk score could predict the clinical sensitivity of        immunotherapy. The chemotherapy sensitivity analysis indicated that low-risk        patients were more sensitive to multiple chemotherapeutic drugs.

Traditional reductionist approaches have proven ineffective to ameliorate the        uniformly dismal outcomes for SCLC - survival at 5 years remains less than 5%. A        major obstacle to improving treatment is that SCLC tumor cells disseminate early,        with a strong propensity for metastasizing to the brain. Accumulating evidence        indicates that, contrary to previous textbook knowledge, virtually every SCLC        tumor is comprised of multiple subtypes. Important questions persist regarding        the role that this intra-tumor subtype heterogeneity may play in supporting the        invasive properties of SCLC. A recurrent hypothesis in the field is that subtype        interactions and/or transition dynamics are major determinants of SCLC metastatic        seeding and progression. Here, we review the advantages of cerebral organoids as        an experimentally accessible platform for SCLC brain metastasis, amenable to        genetic manipulations, drug perturbations, and assessment of subtype interactions        when coupled, e.g., to temporal longitudinal monitoring by high-content imaging        or high-throughput omics data generation.

Neural stem cells (NSCs) are the main cell type in the SVZ region and        exhibit tumor-homing ability. AIM: To evaluate the effects of conditioned medium        (CM) derived from SVZ NSCs on the cancer-related behaviors of glioma cells.        METHODS: The characteristics of SVZ hNSCs were identified by immunofluorescence.        The normoxic-hNSC-CM and hypoxic-hNSC-CM (3% O(2), oxygen-glucose deprived [OGD]        culturing) were collected from 80%-90% confluent SVZ NSCs in sterile conditions.        The CCK8 and Transwell assays were used to compare and evaluate the effects of        normoxic-CM and hypoxic-CM on glioma proliferation and invasion. Then proteins        secreted from SVZ NSCs into the CM were investigated by mass spectrometry, and        the potential effects of candidate protein NCAN in the regulation of glioma        progression were examined by CCK8 and Transwell assays. RESULTS: The CM from SVZ        NSCs significantly increased the proliferation and invasion of glioma cells,        particularly the CM from OGD NSCs induced under hypoxic conditions. Furthermore,        the secreted protein neurocan (NCAN) in CM from OGD NSCs was identified by        proteomic analysis. NCAN was expressed in glioma cells and played regulatory        roles in mediating the progression of glioma cells mainly via the        Rho/Rho-associated protein kinase pathway. CONCLUSION: Our study identified a        potential interactive mechanism between SVZ NSCs and glioma cells, in which SVZ        NSCs promote glioma progression via the secreted protein NCAN.

BTOs derived from patient        somatic cells are suitable for mimicking brain tumors caused by germline        mutations and abnormal neurodevelopment, such as the tuberous sclerosis complex.        BTOs derived from human pluripotent stem cells with genetic manipulations endow        for identifying and understanding the roles of oncogenes and processes of        oncogenesis. Brain tumoroids are the most clinically applicable BTOs, which could        be generated within clinically relevant timescale and applied for drug screening,        immunotherapy testing, biobanking, and investigating brain tumor mechanisms, such        as cancer stem cells and therapy resistance. Brain organoids co-cultured with        brain tumors (BO-BTs) own the greatest recapitulation of brain tumors. Tumor        invasion and interactions between tumor cells and brain components could be        greatly explored in this model. BO-BTs also offer a humanized platform for        testing the therapeutic efficacy and side effects on neurons in preclinical        trials. We also introduce the BTOs establishment fused with other advanced        techniques, such as 3D bioprinting. So far, over 11 brain tumor types of BTOs        have been established, especially for glioblastoma. We conclude BTOs could be a        reliable model to understand brain tumors and develop targeted therapies.",69ebec1fb1ba1dfe4db6bb0168118194156fbb78,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/69ebec1fb1ba1dfe4db6bb0168118194156fbb78,37248629,PMC10493676,,False,CNS neuroscience & therapeutics,101473265,0.08570927381515503,0.034482758620689655,4,7.035,0.36363636363636365,0.5636363636363636,0.17859679468373144

Understanding the transcriptional regulation of the        proliferation of GBM tumor cells is critical for developing novel and effective        treatments. In this study, we investigate the role of the transcription factor        TCF12 in the regulation of GBM proliferation using human and murine GBM cell        lines and an in vivo GBM xenograft model. Our study shows that TCF12 deficiency        severely impairs proliferation of tumor cells in vitro by disrupting/blocking the        G1 to S phase transition. We also discover that TCF12 loss significantly improves        animal survival and that TCF12-deficient tumors grow much slower in vivo.        Overexpression of TCF12, on the other hand, leads to an increase in the        proliferation of tumor cells in vitro and more aggressive tumor progression in        vivo. Interestingly, loss of TCF12 leads to upregulation of signature genes of        the oligodendrocytic lineage in GBM stem cells, suggesting a role for TCF12 in        inhibiting differentiation along the oligodendrocytic lineage. Transcriptomic        data also reveals that loss of TCF12 leads to dysregulation of the expression of        key genes in the cell cycle.

Accumulating evidence indicates that cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), the        most abundant stromal cells in tumor microenvironment (TME), play a crucial role        in cancer progression and response to chemotherapy. To Figure out the role of        leukemia-associated fibroblasts (LAFs) in relapsed/refractory leukemia, we        constructed the first leukemia-associated fibroblastic tumor cell line, HXWMF-1.        METHODS: A cell culture technique was used to establish the leukemia-associated        fibroblastic tumor cell line. Molecular and cellular biological techniques        including flow cytometry, MTT assay, western blotting, and short tandem repeat        (STR) analysis were used to characterize the cell line. Nude mice were used for        xenograft studies. RESULTS: We established a LAFs derived tumor cell line        HXWMF-1, originated from the subcutaneous xenografts of HXEX-ALL1, a cell line        originated from a patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) at the second        relapse. The HXWMF-1 cell line was authenticated as a tumor cell line and being        derived from CAFs based on morphologic, immunophenotypic, cytogenetic and STR        analyses and tumorigenicity test in nude mice. To clarify the reliability of the        method, we got the LAFs derived tumor cells from three different tumor mass of        HXEX-ALL1 xenografts. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, HXWMF-1 is the first        fibroblastic tumor cell line derived from LAFs or CAFs. In addition, the cell        line provided firm evidence for that leukemia cells may induce LAFs/CAFs        malignant transformation, which may help to develop brand new theory and        therapeutic strategies for patients with relapsed /refractory ALL.",2b31cc5b972d09d8bf3702c3fa0afce0670e42f7,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2b31cc5b972d09d8bf3702c3fa0afce0670e42f7,33740980,PMC7977166,,False,Cancer cell international,101139795,0.07343005388975143,0.0,3,6.429,0.2909090909090909,0.4,0.12566537980328907

Despite decades        of research, there are few effective therapies for these cancers. Although human        nervous system tumor cells and genetically engineered mouse models have served as        excellent platforms for drug discovery and preclinical testing, they have        limitations with respect to accurately recapitulating important aspects of the        pathobiology of spontaneously arising human tumors. For this reason, attention        has turned to the deployment of human stem cell engineering involving human        embryonic or induced pluripotent stem cells, in which genetic alterations        associated with nervous system cancers can be introduced. These stem cells can be        used to create self-assembling three-dimensional cerebral organoids that preserve        key features of the developing human brain. Moreover, stem cell-engineered lines        are amenable to xenotransplantation into mice as a platform to investigate the        tumor cell of origin, discover cancer evolutionary trajectories and identify        therapeutic vulnerabilities.

Our previous studies have revealed that LINC00691 is        up-regulated in serum of GC patients as a novel potential biomarker for GC        diagnosis and prognosis. However, the roles of serum exosomal LINC00691 in GC has        not been clarified. This study aimed to find the expression pattern of serum        exosomal LINC00691 in GC patients and the correlation between the level of serum        exosomal LINC00691 and the pathology of gastric cancer patients. METHODS: We        collected the serum of 94 GC patients before surgery and extracted exosomes to        detect the expression level of exosomal LINC00691, with 21 healthy volunteers and        17 patients with benign gastric diseases as controls. Surgical GC tissues and        paired healthy tissues were collected to culture primary cancer-associated        fibroblasts (CAFs) and normal fibroblasts (NFs). We then treated NFs with        LINC00691-rich GC cell culture supernatant or exosomes and detected the        activation markers and biological functions of the fibroblasts. RESULTS: The        results of real-time qPCR indicated that the serum exosomal LINC00691 of GC        patients was significantly higher than that of healthy subjects and patients with        benign gastric diseases, and was associated with the clinicopathology of GC        patients. More interestingly, when the NFs were treated with GC exosomes, the        level of LINC00691 was significantly increased, the cell proliferation and        migration were noticeably enhanced, and the ability to accelerate GC cell        proliferation and invasion was promoted, which means that the induced fibroblasts        gained the properties of CAFs. In addition, we found that knockdown of LINC00691        and the use of the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway inhibitor ruxolitinib effectively        deprived exosome-containing GC cell supernatantsÂ of the effects on NFs.
