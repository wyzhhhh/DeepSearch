Gene        regulatory networks that guide cell differentiation and function are modulated        and stabilized by modifications to DNA, RNA and proteins. In this review, we        focus on two key epigenetic changes - DNA methylation and histone modifications -        and discuss their contribution to retinal development, aging and disease,        especially in the context of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and diabetic        retinopathy. We highlight less-studied roles of DNA methylation and provide the        RNA expression profiles of epigenetic enzymes in human and mouse retina in        comparison to other tissues. We also review computational tools and emergent        technologies to profile, analyze and integrate epigenetic information. We suggest        implementation of editing tools and single-cell technologies to trace and perturb        the epigenome for delineating its role in transcriptional regulation. Finally, we        present our thoughts on exciting avenues for exploring epigenome in retinal        metabolism, disease modeling, and regeneration.",PMC6054546,Progress in retinal and eye research,9431859
38675608,"Artemisinin Confers Cytoprotection toward Hydrogen Peroxide-Induced Cell        Apoptosis in Retinal Pigment Epithelial Cells in Correlation with the Increased        Acetylation of Histone H4 at Lysine 8.",10.3390/molecules29081789,"Increased oxidative stress is one of the critical pathologies inducing        age-related macular degeneration (AMD), characterized by retinal pigment        epithelial (RPE) cell damage and death. The unbalanced acetylation and        deacetylation of histones have been implicated in AMD pathogenesis or hydrogen        peroxide (H(2)O(2))-induced cell damage. Therefore, strategies aimed at        controlling the balance between acetylation and deacetylation may effectively        protect RPE cells from oxidative damage. Artemisinin is an antimalarial lactone        drug derived from Artemisia annua, with antioxidant activity known to modulate        histone acetylation in the brain, but its effect on the retina is unknown. In        this study, we aimed to investigate whether Artemisinin exerts a cytoprotective        effect on oxidative stress-induced apoptosis in RPE cells by regulating histone        acetylation. We hypothesized that Artemisinin confers cytoprotection toward        H(2)O(2)-induced apoptosis in RPE cells through this mechanism. In the present        study, we found that Artemisinin at a sub-clinic dosage of 20 μM inhibited the        H(2)O(2)-induced cell viability decrease and B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) protein        level decrease and attenuated the H(2)O(2)-induced decrease in the histone H4        lysine (Lys) 8 acetylation [Acetyl-H4 (Lys 8)] level in the retinal RPE cell line        D407. As expected, histone deacetylase inhibitor Trichostatin A at the        concentration of 250 nM increased the Acetyl-H4 (Lys 8) level in D407 cells and        attenuated the H(2)O(2)-induced cell viability decrease and apoptosis. Similar        findings were obtained using adult RPE (ARPE)19 cells, another human RPE cell        line, and primary human RPE cell cultures. In conclusion, these results confirmed        our hypothesis and indicated that Artemisinin attenuated H(2)O(2)-induced        apoptosis in apparent correlation with the increase in the Acetyl-H4 (Lys 8)        level, which is associated with gene transcription and cell survival. By        modulating histone acetylation, Artemisinin may restore the balance between        acetylation and deacetylation and enhance the resistance and survival of RPE        cells under oxidative stress. Our study provides novel mechanistic insights into        the effect of Artemisinin on histone acetylation and apoptosis in RPE cells and        supports the potential application of Artemisinin in the prevention and/or        treatment of AMD.",PMC11051841,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",100964009

In the current study, we observed that the permissive histone mark        trimethyl histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me3) and its methyltransferase KMT2B were        significantly elevated in hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) rats, with impairment of        synaptic plasticity and cognitive function. Further research found that histone        methylation inhibited synapse-associated protein expression, by suppressing        histone acetylation. Inhibiting H3K4me3 by downregulating KMT2B could effectively        restore Hcy-inhibited H3K14ace in N2a cells. Moreover, chromatin        immunoprecipitation revealed that Hcy-induced H3K4me3 resulted in ANP32A mRNA and        protein overexpression in the hippocampus, which was regulated by increased        transcription Factor c-fos and inhibited histone acetylation and        synapse-associated protein expression, and downregulating ANP32A could reverse        these changes in Hcy-treated N2a cells. Additionally, the knockdown of KMT2B        restored histone acetylation and synapse-associated proteins in Hcy-treated        primary hippocampal neurons. These data have revealed a novel crosstalk mechanism        between KMT2B-H3K4me3-ANP32A-H3K14ace, shedding light on its role in Hcy-related        neurogenerative disorders.",,Molecular neurobiology,8900963
38345554,"5-Aza-2'-Deoxycytidine Ameliorates Choroidal Neovascularization by Inhibiting the        Wnt/β-Catenin Signaling Pathway.",10.1167/iovs.65.2.23,"PURPOSE: Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) can constitute the final pathology of        many ocular diseases and result in severe vision loss. Studies have demonstrated        that DNA methylation is critical in retinal development, aging, and disorders.        The current work investigated the effects and underlying mechanism of        5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC), a suppressor of DNA methylation, in the        pathological progression of CNV. METHODS: The DNA methylation profiles of retinal        pigment epithelial (RPE)/choroidal complexes in normal and laser-induced CNV mice        were assessed by Arraystar Mouse RefSeq Promoter Arrays. The CNV area and blood        flow density and intensity were observed by optical coherence tomography        angiography, and fluorescence leakage was examined by fundus fluorescein        angiography in CNV mice with systemic administration of 5-aza-dC. The effects of        5-aza-dC on the biological functions of bEnd.3 cells were estimated by related        assays. Notum gene promoter methylation was measured using bisulfite sequencing        PCR. Methyltransferases and Wnt signaling-related genes were detected in animal        and cell culture experiments by real-time PCR and immunoblot. RESULTS:        Methyltransferases were upregulated, but Notum (a secretion inhibitor of Wnt        signaling) was downregulated in the RPE/choroidal complexes of mice with        experimental CNV. Intraperitoneal injection of 5-aza-dC inactivated the Wnt        pathway and ameliorated the lesion area and the intensity and density of blood        flow, as well as the degree of leakage in CNV. In vitro, vascular endothelial        growth factor A (VEGFA) stimulation promoted methyltransferases expression and        suppressed Notum expression, consequently activating Wnt signaling, whereas        exogenous 5-aza-dC reversed VEGFA-induced hyperpermeability, proliferation,        migration, and tube formation in bEnd.3 cells via demethylation of Notum        promoter. CONCLUSIONS: We observed that 5-aza-dC attenuates the growth of CNV by        inhibiting the Wnt signaling pathway via promoter demethylation of the Wnt        antagonist Notum. These findings provide a theoretical basis for        methylation-based treatment with the Notum gene as a potential target for CNV        treatment.",PMC10866157,Investigative ophthalmology & visual science,7703701

DNA methylation is one of the most studied epigenetic modifications,        which plays an important role in maintaining genome stability and ensuring normal        growth and development. Studies have shown that methylation levels in bovine        primordial germ cells, the rearrangement of methylation during embryonic        development and abnormal methylation during placental development are all closely        related to their reproductive processes. In addition, the application of bovine        male sterility and assisted reproductive technology is also related to DNA        methylation. This review introduces the principle, development of detection        methods and application conditions of DNA methylation, with emphasis on the        relationship between DNA methylation dynamics and bovine spermatogenesis,        embryonic development, disease resistance and muscle and fat development, in        order to provide theoretical basis for the application of DNA methylation in        cattle breeding in the future.",PMC10419045,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791

The development and survival of hair cells are highly controlled        processes. When cells face intracellular and environmental stimuli, epigenetic        regulation controls the structure and function of the genome in response to        different cell fates. During sensory hair cell development, different histone        modifications can induce normal numbers of functional hair cells to generate.        When individuals are exposed to environmental-related hair cell damage,        epigenetic modification also plays a significant role in the regulation of hair        cell fate. Since mammalian hair cells cannot regenerate, their loss can cause        permanent sensorineural hearing loss. Many breakthroughs have been achieved in        recent years in understanding the signaling pathways that determine hair cell        regeneration, and it is fascinating to note that epigenetic regulation plays a        significant role in hair cell regeneration. In this review, we discuss the role        of epigenetics in inner ear cell development, survival and regeneration and the        significant impact on hearing protection.",PMC10300351,Frontiers in cellular neuroscience,101477935
37305686,"The role of epigenetic methylation/demethylation in the regulation of retinal        photoreceptors.",10.3389/fcell.2023.1149132,"Photoreceptors are integral and crucial for the retina, as they convert light        into electrical signals. Epigenetics plays a vital role in determining the        precise expression of genetic information in space and time during the        development and maturation of photoreceptors, cell differentiation, degeneration,        death, and various pathological processes. Epigenetic regulation has three main        manifestations: histone modification, DNA methylation, and RNA-based mechanisms,        where methylation is involved in two regulatory mechanisms-histone methylation        and DNA methylation. DNA methylation is the most studied form of epigenetic        modification, while histone methylation is a relatively stable regulatory        mechanism. Evidence suggests that normal methylation regulation is essential for        the growth and development of photoreceptors and the maintenance of their        functions, while abnormal methylation can lead to many pathological forms of        photoreceptors. However, the role of methylation/demethylation in regulating        retinal photoreceptors remains unclear. Therefore, this study aims to review the        role of methylation/demethylation in regulating photoreceptors in various        physiological and pathological situations and discuss the underlying mechanisms        involved. Given the critical role of epigenetic regulation in gene expression and        cellular differentiation, investigating the specific molecular mechanisms        underlying these processes in photoreceptors may provide valuable insights into        the pathogenesis of retinal diseases. Moreover, understanding these mechanisms        could lead to the development of novel therapies that target the epigenetic        machinery, thereby promoting the maintenance of retinal function throughout an        individual's lifespan.",PMC10251769,Frontiers in cell and developmental biology,101630250

Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is widely        used in eye care and allows the non-invasive, rapid capture of retinal        measurements in exquisite detail. We conducted genome- and phenome-wide analyses        of retinal layer thicknesses using macular OCT images from 44,823 UK Biobank        participants. We performed phenome-wide association analyses, associating retinal        thicknesses with 1,866 incident ICD-based conditions (median 10-year follow-up)        and 88 quantitative traits and blood biomarkers. We performed genome-wide        association analyses, identifying inherited genetic markers which influence the        retina, and replicated our associations among 6,313 individuals from the        LIFE-Adult Study. And lastly, we performed comparative association of phenome-        and genome- wide associations to identify putative causal links between systemic        conditions, retinal layer thicknesses, and ocular disease. Independent        associations with incident mortality were detected for photoreceptor thinning and        ganglion cell complex thinning. Significant phenotypic associations were detected        between retinal layer thinning and ocular, neuropsychiatric, cardiometabolic and        pulmonary conditions. Genome-wide association of retinal layer thicknesses        yielded 259 loci.

In conclusion,        retinal layer thinning predicts risk of future ocular and systemic disease.        Furthermore, systemic cardio-metabolic-pulmonary conditions promote retinal        thinning.

DNA methylation has been implicated in many diseases.        However, its involvement in lip tissue from NSCLP is not well understood. This        study aimed to investigate the role of dysregulated DNA methylation in NSCLP. DNA        methylation profile was determined in eight injured and five self-normal lip        tissue samples from children with NSCLP by whole-genome bisulfite sequencing. A        total of 2,711 differentially methylated regions (DMRs), corresponding to 1,231        genes were identified. Given the important role of promoter methylation in        regulating gene expression, the promoter DMR-related genes were considered.        Bioinformatics analysis demonstrated that some of them showed potential        associations with NSCLP. Therefore, the well-known NSCLP susceptibility gene, GLI        family zinc finger 2 (GLI2) with an unknown role in its DNA methylation in NSCLP,        was selected for further analysis. The promoter hypomethylation and higher mRNA        expression level of GLI2 were observed in injured lip tissues by verification in        additional samples. Moreover, dual luciferase reporter assay indicated that        promoter hypermethylation of GLI2 inhibited its transcription. Overall, this        study suggested that abnormal DNA methylation in lip tissue may be correlated        with the pathogenesis of congenital NSCLP.",PMC10092010,Birth defects research,101701004

Disruptor of telomeric silencing 1-like (Dot1L) is the catalytic enzyme        required for histone H3K79 methylation which has been demonstrated to play a role        in transcriptional activation. However, the functions of Dot1L in the process of        cardiac fibrosis still remain unknown. RESULTS: In the present study, we found        that endogenous Dot1L is upregulated in cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) treated with        angiotensin II (Ang II) or transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, along with        elevated extracellular matrix (ECM) such as fibronectin, collagen I and III.        Silencing or inhibiting Dot1L mitigated Ang II-induced myofibroblast generation        and fibrogenesis. We identified the transcription factor-forkhead box O (FoxO) 3a        as a novel substrate of Dot1L, the transcriptional activating mark H3K79me3 level        on the promoter of FoxO3a was increase in activated-CFs, and inhibition of Dot1L        markedly decreased FoxO3a transcription accompanied by a significant decrease in        the expression of fibrogenic gene. Knockdown of FoxO3a could alleviate ECM        deposition induced by Ang II, on the contrary, overexpression FoxO3a resulting in        CFs activation. Consistently, in vivo Dot1L ablation rescued myocardial        ischemia-induced cardiac fibrosis and improved cardiac function. CONCLUSIONS: Our        findings conclude that upregulation of Dot1L results in activation of the cardiac        fibroblasts to promote profibrotic gene, eventually causes cardiac fibrosis.        Pharmacological targeting for Dot1L might represent a promising therapeutic        approach for the treatment of human cardiac fibrosis and other fibrotic diseases.",PMC9392317,Cell & bioscience,101561195

Here, we compared chromatin accessibility landscapes and        transcriptomes during fetal prefrontal cortex (PFC) development between rhesus        macaques and humans. A total of 304,761 divergent DNase I-hypersensitive sites        (DHSs) are identified between rhesus macaques and humans, although many of these        sites share conserved DNA sequences.

NRL works synergistically with        homeodomain protein Cone-Rod Homeobox and other regulatory factors to control the        transcription of most genes associated with rod morphogenesis and functional        maturation, which span over a period of several weeks in the mammalian retina. We        predicted that NRL gradually establishes rod cell identity and function by        temporal and dynamic regulation of stage-specific transcriptional targets.        Therefore, we mapped the genomic occupancy of NRL at four stages of mouse        photoreceptor differentiation by CUT&RUN analysis. Dynamics of NRL binding        revealed concordance with the corresponding changes in transcriptome of the        developing rods. Notably, we identified c-Jun proto-oncogene as one of the        targets of NRL, which could bind to specific cis-elements in the c-Jun promoter        and modulate its activity in HEK293 cells.

However,        whether there is a protagonist in this cluster remains unclear. Here, we used a        mutant mouse model to study the role of miR-96, a member of miR-183C, in        photoreceptor development and functionality. METHODS: The mature miR-96 sequence        was removed using the CRISPR/Cas9 genome-editing system. Electroretinogram (ERG)        and optical coherence tomography (OCT) investigated the changes in structure and        function in mouse retinas. Immunostaining determined the localization and        morphology of the retinal cells. RNA sequencing was conducted to observe retinal        transcription alterations. RESULTS: The miR-96 mutant mice exhibited cone        developmental delay, as occurs in miR-183/96 double knockout mice. Immunostaining        of cone-specific marker genes revealed cone nucleus mislocalization and exiguous        Opn1mw/Opn1sw in the mutant (MT) mouse outer segments at postnatal day 10.        Interestingly, this phenomenon could be relieved in the adult stages.        Transcriptome analysis revealed activation of microtubule-, actin filament-, and        cilia-related pathways, further supporting the findings.

While numerous genes involved in these diseases        have been identified, many cases have still not been associated with any gene,        indicating that new mechanisms may be involved in the pathogenesis of these        photoreceptor dystrophies. Many genes associated with RPRPD regulate        photoreceptor specification and maturation in the developing retina. Since        retinal development begins with a population of equivalent, proliferating retinal        progenitor cells (RPCs) having a specific ""competence"" in generating all types of        retinal neurons, including cone and rod photoreceptors, we tested the epigenetic        changes in promoters of genes required for photoreceptor development and genes        associated with RPRPD during RPC differentiation into cone and rod        photoreceptors. We found that promoters of many of these genes are epigenetically        repressed in RPCs but have no epigenetic restrictions in photoreceptors. Our        findings also suggest that DNA methylation as an epigenetic mark, and DNA        demethylation as a process, are more important than other epigenetic marks or        mechanisms in the pathogenesis of these diseases. Most notably, irregularities in        the DNA demethylation process during the RPC-to-photoreceptor transition may        significantly contribute to retinitis pigmentosa (RP) pathogenesis since genes        with hypermethylated promoters in RPCs account for at least 40% of autosomal        recessive RP cases and at least 30% of autosomal dominant RP cases. Thus, we        proposed an epigenetic model according to which unsuccessful demethylation of        regulatory sequences (e.g., promoters, enhancers) of genes required for        photoreceptor development, maturation, and function during the        RPC-to-photoreceptor transition may reduce or even eliminate their activity,        leading to RPRPD without any inheritable mutations in these genes.",PMC8961674,Frontiers in genetics,101560621

In this study,        hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) mice model was established in cbs(+/-) mice by        feeding a high-methionine diet for 12 weeks; and cbs(+/-) mice fed with        high-methionine diet exhibited more severe liver injury compared to cbs(+/+)        mice. Mechanistically, we found that Hcy promoted ER stress and apoptosis of        hepatocytes and thereby aggravated liver injury through inhibiting ERO1α        expression; accordingly, overexpression of ERO1α remarkably alleviated ER stress        and apoptosis of hepatocytes induced by Hcy. Epigenetic modification analysis        revealed that Hcy significantly increased levels of DNA methylation and H3 lysine        9 dimethylation (H3K9me2) on ERO1α promoter, which attributed to upregulated DNA        methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) and G9a, respectively. Further study showed that        DNMT1 and G9a cooperatively regulated ERO1α expression in hepatocytes exposed to        Hcy.

Under oxidative stress conditions, some of the RPE        cells become senescent and a contributory role for RPE senescence in AMD        pathology has been proposed. The purpose of this study is to 1) characterize        senescence in human RPE; 2) investigate the effect of an αB Crystallin chaperone        peptide (mini Cry) in controlling senescence, in particular by regulating        mitochondrial function and senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP)        production and 3) develop mouse models for studying the role of RPE senescence in        dry and nAMD. Senescence was induced in human RPE cells in two ways. First,        subconfluent cells were treated with 0.2 μg/ml doxorubicin (DOX); second,        subconfluent cells were treated with 500 μM H(2)O(2). Senescence biomarkers        (senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-βgal), p21, p16) and mitochondrial        proteins (Fis1, DRP1, MFN2, PGC1-α, mtTFA) were analyzed in control and        experimental groups. The effect of mini Cry on mitochondrial bioenergetics,        glycolysis and SASP was determined. In vivo, retinal degeneration was induced by        intravenous injection of NaIO3 (20 mg/kg) and subretinal fibrosis by        laser-induced choroidal neovascularization. Increased SA-βgal staining and p16        and p21 expression was observed after DOX- or H(2)O(2)-induced senescence and        mini Cry significantly decreased senescence-positive cells. The expression of        mitochondrial biogenesis proteins PGC-1 and mTFA increased with senescence, and        mini Cry reduced expression significantly. Senescent RPE cells were metabolically        active, as evidenced by significantly enhanced oxidative phosphorylation and        anaerobic glycolysis, mini Cry markedly reduced rates of respiration and        glycolysis. Senescent RPE cells maintain a proinflammatory phenotype        characterized by significantly increased production of cytokines (IFN-ˠ, TNF-α,        IL1-α IL1-β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10), and VEGF-A; mini Cry significantly inhibited        their secretion.

Combining ChIP and gene microarray datasets, the results        showed that Mbd2 possessed potential binding sites for miR-345-5p, thereby        elevating the expression levels of miR-345-5p via the enhancement of promoter        demethylation.

Auxin and cytokinin are primary hormones involved in development of maize        endosperm transfer cells. Crosstalk between glucose and hormone signaling        regulates endosperm transfer cell development via modifying ZmMRP-1 expression.        This review summarizes the current knowledge on maize endosperm transfer cell        development, and discusses its potential molecular mechanisms. It is expected to        strengthen the theoretical basis for structural and functional optimization of        endosperm transfer cells, and yield improvement of kernels in maize.",,Plant cell reports,9880970

Current therapies for the treatment        of diabetic retinopathy are used in advanced stages of the disease and are unable        to reverse the retinal damage induced by hyperglycemia. The lack of effective        therapies without side effects means there is an urgent need to identify an early        action capable of preventing the development of the disease and its        pathophysiological consequences in order to avoid loss of vision associated with        diabetic retinopathy.

H3K4me3 has been reported to regulate rod photoreceptor differentiation;        however, the roles H3K4me3 plays in retinal progenitor cell (RPC) proliferation        and differentiation during early retinal development remain unclear. METHODS:        Using an in vitro retinal explant culture system, we suppressed the expression of        Setd1a by introducing shSetd1a. We examined the expression level and H3K4me3        level of genes by RNA Sequencing and ChIP assay, respectively. RESULTS: We found        that Setd1a depletion resulted in increased apoptosis and proliferation failure        in late RPCs. Expression of wild-type SETD1A, but not SETD1A that lacked the        catalytic SET domain, reversed the shSetd1a-induced phenotype. RNA Sequencing        revealed that proliferation-related genes were downregulated upon shSetd1a        expression. Based on publicly available H3K4me3-ChIP sequencing data of retinal        development, we identified Uhrf1 as a candidate target gene of Setd1a. The        expression of shSetd1a led to a decrease in Uhrf1 transcript levels and reduced        H3K4me3 levels at the Uhrf1 locus. Increased apoptosis and the suppression of        proliferation in late RPCs were observed in retinal explants expressing shUhrf1,        similar to the outcomes observed in shSetd1a-expressing retinas. The        overexpression of UHRF1 did not rescue shSetd1a-induced apoptosis, but reversed        the suppression of proliferation. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that Setd1a        contributes to the survival and proliferation of retinal cells by regulating        histone methylation, Setd1a regulates Uhrf1 expression, and these two molecules        cooperate to regulate RPC survival and proliferation.",PMC8107498,Investigative ophthalmology & visual science,7703701

ARPE-19 cells were        treated with the following anti-VEGF drugs: aflibercept, ranibizumab, or        bevacizumab at 1× and 2× concentrations of the clinical intravitreal dose (12.5        μL/mL and 25 μL/mL, respectively) and analyzed for transcription profiles of        genes associated with the pathogenesis age-related macular degeneration (AMD).        HDAC activity was measured using the Fluorometric Histone Deacetylase assay. TSA        downregulated HIF-1α and IL-1β genes, and upregulated BCL2L13, CASPASE-9, and        IL-18 genes. TSA alone or bevacizumab plus TSA showed a significant reduction of        HDAC activity compared to untreated ARPE-19 cells. Bevacizumab alone did not        significantly alter HDAC activity, but increased gene expression of SOD2,        BCL2L13, CASPASE-3, and IL-18 and caused downregulation of HIF-1α and IL-18.        Combination of bevacizumab plus TSA increased gene expression of SOD2, HIF-1α,        GPX3A, BCL2L13, and CASPASE-3, and reduced CASPASE-9 and IL-β.

METHODS: Four independent DNA methylation        datasets for HCC were used to screen for common differentially methylated genes        (CDMGs). Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and        Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis were used to explore the biological        roles of CDMGs in HCC. Univariate Cox analysis and least absolute shrinkage and        selection operator (LASSO) Cox analysis were performed to identify        survival-related CDMGs (SR-CDMGs) and to build a predictive model. The importance        of this model was assessed using Cox regression analysis, propensity        score-matched (PSM) analysis and stratification analysis. A validation group from        the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) was constructed to further validate the model.        RESULTS: Four SR-CDMGs were identified and used to build the predictive model.        The risk score of this model was calculated as follows: risk score = (0.01489826        × methylation level of WDR69) + (0.15868618 × methylation level of HOXB4) +        (0.16674959 × methylation level of CDKL2) + (0.16689301 × methylation level of        HOXA10).

Tissues were studied at different time points        and immunohistological analyses for TUNEL, Cleaved caspase3, AIF, CDK4 and the        epigenetic mark H3K27me3 were performed. Human and monkey eye globes with retinal        detachment served as controls. RESULTS: The number of TUNEL-positive cells,        compared between 1 and 7 days, increased with time in both retinas with RPE (from        1.2 ± 0.46 to 8 ± 0.89, n = 4) and without RPE (from 2.6 ± 0.73 to 16.3 ± 1.27, p        < 0.014). In the group without RPE, cell death peaked at day 3 (p = 0.014) and        was high until day 7. Almost no Cleaved-Caspase3 signal was observed, whereas a        transient augmentation at day 3 of AIF-positive cells was observed to be about        10-fold in comparison to the control group (n = 2). Few CDK4-positive cells were        found in both groups, but significantly more in the RD group at day 7 (1.8 ± 0.24        vs. 4.7 ± 0.58, p = 0.014).

Drug        resistance culminating in relapse continues to be associated with fatal disease.        The cancer stem cell theory posits that tumors are driven by specialized cancer        cells called cancer stem cells (CSCs). CSCs are a subpopulation of cancer cells        known to be resistant to therapy and cause metastasis. Whilst the debate on        whether CSCs are the origins of the primary tumor rages on, CSCs have been        further characterized in many cancers with data illustrating that CSCs display        great abilities to self-renew, resist therapies due to enhanced epithelial to        mesenchymal (EMT) properties, enhanced expression of ATP-binding cassette (ABC)        membrane transporters, activation of several survival signaling pathways and        increased immune evasion as well as DNA repair mechanisms.

Intensive research using        these animal models has revealed shared molecular mechanisms that make Müller        glia attractive targets for cellular reprogramming and highlighted the potential        for curing degenerative retinal diseases from intrinsic cellular sources.",PMC8384111,Annual review of vision science,101660822

To explore DNA modifications that could influence visual function with        age, we perform whole-genome bisulfite sequencing of purified mouse rod        photoreceptors at four ages and identify 2,054 differentially methylated regions        (DMRs). We detect many DMRs during early stages of aging and in rod regulatory        regions, and some of these cluster at chromosomal hotspots, especially on        chromosome 10, which includes a longevity interactome. Integration of methylome        to age-related transcriptome changes, chromatin signatures, and first-order        protein-protein interactions uncover an enrichment of DMRs in altered        pathways that are associated with rod function, aging, and energy metabolism. In        concordance, we detect reduced basal mitochondrial respiration and increased        fatty acid dependency with retinal age in ex vivo assays.

The ischemia/reperfusion        (I/R) model in mice primary culture retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and Mbd2        knockout (Mbd2-KO) mice was used in the current study. We demonstrated that Mbd2        mediates RGC apoptosis caused by I/R injury. Mechanistically, the data suggested        that Mbd2 upregulated Mbd2-associated long noncoding RNA 1 (Mbd2-AL1) via        demethylation of its promoter. Furthermore, Mbd2-AL1 sponged microRNA        (miR)-188-3p, thus preventing tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated        factor 3 (Traf3) downregulation and inducing RGC apoptosis. This was further        demonstrated by the fact that inhibition of miR-188-3p diminished the        anti-apoptosis role of Mbd2-AL1 small interfering RNA (siRNA). Finally, it showed        that the apoptosis of retinal cells was attenuated, and the visual function was        preserved in Mbd2-KO mice, which were associated with the        Mbd2-AL1/miR-188-3p/Traf3 axis.

We address the contribution of        functional genomics to the understanding of retinal biology by reviewing key        events in their historical perspective as an introduction to major findings that        were obtained through the study of the retina using genomics, transcriptomics and        proteomics. We illustrate our purpose by showing that most of the genes of        interest for retinal development and those involved in inherited retinal        degenerations have a restricted expression to the retina and most particularly to        photoreceptors cells. We show that the exponential growth of data generated by        functional genomics is a future challenge not only in terms of storage but also        in terms of accessibility to the scientific community of retinal biologists in        the future.

In        humans, however, substantial technical and ethical constraints on fetal sampling        have curtailed safe, pathogenic exploration during gestation. Evidence consistent        with in utero origins for PCOS in humans has thus been slow to amass, but the        balance now leans toward developmental fetal origins. Given that PCOS is familial        and highly heritable, difficulties encountered in discerning genetic        contributions to PCOS pathogenesis are puzzling and, to date, accounts for <10%        of PCOS presentations. Unaccounted heritability notwithstanding, molecular        commonality in pathogenic mechanisms is emerging, suggested by co-occurrence at        the same gene loci of (1) PCOS genetic variants (PCOS women), (2) epigenetic        alterations in DNA methylation (PCOS women), and (3) bioinformatics, gene        networks-identified, epigenetic alterations in DNA methylation (female rhesus        monkeys exposed to testosterone (T) in utero). In addition, naturally occurring        hyperandrogenism in female monkeys singles out individuals with PCOS-like        reproductive and metabolic traits accompanied by somatic biomarkers of in utero T        exposure.

Disruption of key regulatory genes in the early stages of        eye development can result in aborted eye formation, resulting in an absent eye        (anophthalmia) or a small underdeveloped eye (microphthalmia) phenotype.        Anophthalmia and microphthalmia (AM) are part of the same clinical spectrum and        have high genetic heterogeneity, with >90 identified associated genes. By        understanding the roles of these genes in development, including their temporal        expression, the phenotypic variation associated with AM can be better understood,        improving diagnosis and management. This review describes the genetic and        structural basis of eye development, focusing on the function of key genes known        to be associated with AM.

The data was analyzed using Hidden Markov Model- and change        point-based methods to identify methylome states in different segments of the        studied genomes following genome annotation. We found that promoters of rod and        cone phototransduction genes and rod photoreceptor genes, but not genes required        for the development and function of other retinal phenotypes, were highly        methylated in DNA isolated from human and murine fetal retinas (which mostly        contain RPCs) and postnatal murine RPCs. While these highly methylated genomic        regions were inherited by non-photoreceptor phenotypes during RPC        differentiation, the methylation of these promoters was significantly reduced        during RPC differentiation into photoreceptors and accompanied by increased        expression of these genes. Our analysis of DNA methylation during embryogenesis        revealed low methylation levels in genomic regions containing photoreceptor genes        at the inner cell mass stage, but a sharp increase in methylation at the epiblast        stage, which remained the same later on (except for DNA demethylation in        photoreceptors). Thus, our data suggest that the DNA demethylation pathway is        required for photoreceptor phenotypes in the developing retina. Meanwhile, the        role of the DNA methylation and DNA demethylation pathways during RPC        differentiation into non-photoreceptor retinal phenotypes might be less        important.",PMC6667802,Frontiers in molecular neuroscience,101477914

Considering the relatively limited effect of therapy        on early AMD, it is important to focus on the pathogenesis of AMD, especially        early AMD. Ageing is one of the strongest risk factors for AMD, and analysis of        the impact of ageing on AMD development is valuable. Among all the ageing        hallmarks, increased DNA damage accumulation is regarded as the beginning of        cellular senescence and is related to abnormal expression of inflammatory        cytokines, which is called the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP).        The exact pathway for DNA damage that triggers senescence-associated hallmarks is        poorly understood. Recently, mounting evidence has shown that the cGAS/STING        pathway is an important DNA sensor related to proinflammatory factor secretion        and is associated with another hallmark of ageing, SASP. Thus, we hypothesized        that the cGAS/STING pathway is a vital signalling pathway for early AMD        development and that inhibition of STING might be a potential therapeutic        strategy for AMD cases.",PMC6628971,Clinical interventions in aging,101273480

While mammals have no inherent        regenerative capacity to functionally repair neuronal tissue, other species such        as amphibians and teleost fish readily replace damaged tissue. The exploration of        development and native regeneration can thus inform the process of inducing        regeneration in non-regenerative systems, which can be used to develop new        therapeutics. Increasing evidence points to an epigenetic component in the        regulation of the changes in cellular gene expression necessary for regeneration.        In this review, we compare evidence of epigenetic roles in development and        regeneration of neuronal tissue. We have focused on three key systems of        important clinical significance: the neural retina, the inner ear, and the spinal        cord in regenerative and non-regenerative species. While evidence for epigenetic        regulation of regeneration is still limited, changes in DNA accessibility,        histone acetylation and DNA methylation have all emerged as key elements in this        process. To date, most studies have used broadly acting experimental        manipulations to establish a role for epigenetics in regeneration, but the advent        of more targeted approaches to modify the epigenome will be critical to        dissecting the relative contributions of these regulatory factors in this process        and the development of methods to stimulate the regeneration in those organisms        like ourselves where only limited regeneration occurs in these neural systems.",PMC6952058,Seminars in cell & developmental biology,9607332

While        it is a familial and highly prevalent endocrine disorder, progress towards a cure        is hindered by absence of a definitive pathogenic mechanism and lack of an animal        model of naturally occurring PCOS. AREAS COVERED: These include an overview of        PCOS and its potential etiology, and an examination of insights gained into its        pathogenic origins. Animal models derived from experimentally-induced        hyperandrogenism during gestation, or from naturally-occurring PCOS-like traits,        most reliably demonstrate reproductive, neuroendocrine and metabolic        pathogenesis. EXPERT OPINION: Genetic studies, while identifying at least 17 PCOS        risk genes, account for <10% of women with PCOS. A number of PCOS risk genes        involve regulation of gonadotropin secretion or action, suggesting a reproductive        neuroendocrine basis for PCOS pathogenesis. Consistent with this notion, a number        of animal models employing fetal androgen excess demonstrate epigenetic induction        of PCOS-like traits, including reproductive neuroendocrine and metabolic        dysfunction. Monkey models are most comprehensive, while mouse models provide        molecular insight, including identifying the androgen receptor, particularly in        neurons, as mediating androgen-induced PCOS-like programming. Naturally-occurring        female hyperandrogenism is also demonstrated in monkeys.

It is known that diabetes-induced        cardiac fibrosis is a key pathogenic factor contributing topathological changes        in DCM. However, pathogenetic mechanisms underlying diabetes cardiac fibrosis        arestill elusive. Recent studies have indicated that noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) play        a key role in diabetescardiac fibrosis. The increasing complexity of epigenetic        regulator poses great challenges to ourconventional conceptions regarding how        ncRNAs regulate diabetes cardiac fibrosis. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Web of        Science, and Scopus for manuscripts published prior to April 2018 using keywords        ""Diabetic cardiomyopathy"" AND "" diabetes cardiac fibrosis "" OR "" noncoding RNAs ""        OR "" longnoncoding RNAs "" OR "" microRNAs "" OR ""epigenetic"". Manuscripts were        collated, studied and carriedforward for discussion where appropriate. RESULTS:        Based on the view that during diabetic cardiac fibrosis, ncRNAs are able to        regulate diabetic cardiac fibrosisby targeting genes involved in epigenetic        pathways. Many studies have focused on ncRNAs, an epigeneticregulator        deregulating protein-coding genes in diabetic cardiac fibrosis, to identify        potential therapeutictargets. Recent advances and new perspectives have found        that long noncoding RNAs and microRNAs,exert their own effects on the progression        of diabetic cardiac fibrosis. CONCLUSION: We firstly examine the growing role of        ncRNAs characteristics and ncRNAs-regulated genes involved indiabetic cardiac        fibrosis. Then, we provide several possible therapeutic strategies and highlight        the potentialof molecular mechanisms in which targeting epigenetic regulators are        considered as an effective means of treating diabetic cardiac fibrosis.",,Endocrine,9434444
