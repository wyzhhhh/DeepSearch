Multi-Omics Data Analysis Identifies Prognostic Biomarkers across Cancers,"Combining omics data from different layers using integrative methods provides a better understanding of the biology of a complex disease such as cancer. The discovery of biomarkers related to cancer development or prognosis helps to find more effective treatment options. This study integrates multi-omics data of different cancer types with a network-based approach to explore common gene modules among different tumors by running community detection methods on the integrated network. The common modules were evaluated by several biological metrics adapted to cancer. Then, a new prognostic scoring method was developed by weighting mRNA expression, methylation, and mutation status of genes. The survival analysis pointed out statistically significant results forGNG11,CBX2,CDKN3,ARHGEF10,CLN8,SEC61GandPTDSS1genes. The literature search reveals that the identified biomarkers are associated with the same or different types of cancers. Our method does not only identify known cancer-specific biomarker genes, but also proposes new potential biomarkers. Thus, this study provides a rationale for identifying new gene targets and expanding treatment options across cancer types.",37489460,PMC10366886,10.3390/medsci11030044,3,"Medical sciences (Basel, Switzerland)",101629322,0.0,0.9447912573814392,0.38127090301003347,0.0,0.6431289350308702
Integrative Analysis of Incongruous Cancer Genomics and Proteomics Datasets,"Cancer is a complex disease characterized by molecular heterogeneity and the involvement of several cellular mechanisms throughout its evolution and pathogenesis. Despite the great efforts made to untangle these mechanisms, cancer pathophysiology remains far from clear. So far, panels of biomarkers have been reported from high-throughput data generated through different platforms. These biomarkers are primarily focused on one type of coding molecules such as transcripts or proteins, mainly due to the apparent heterogeneity of output data resulting from the use of various techniques specific to the molecular type. Hence, there is a major need to understand how these molecules interact and complement each other to be able to explain the deregulated processes involved. The breadth of large-scale data availability as well as the lack of in-depth analysis of publicly available data has raised concerns and enabled opportunities for new strategies to analyze ""Big data"" more comprehensively. Here, a new protocol to perform integrative analysis based on a systems biology approach is described. The foundation of the approach relies on groups of datasets from published studies compared within the original described groups and organized in a designated format to allow the integration and cross-comparison among different studies and different platforms. This approach follows an unbiased hypothesis-free methodology that will facilitate the identification of commonalities among different data-set sources, and ultimately map and characterize specific molecular pathways using significantly deregulated molecules. This in turn will generate novel insights about the mechanisms deregulated in complex diseases such as cancer.",34236668,,10.1007/978-1-0716-1641-3_17,1,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,0.0,0.8613050580024719,0.1939799331103679,0.0033444816053511705,0.556247917744627
Integrative Analysis of Multi-omics Data for Discovery and Functional Studies of Complex Human Diseases,"Complex and dynamic networks of molecules are involved in human diseases. High-throughput technologies enable omics studies interrogating thousands to millions of makers with similar biochemical properties (eg, transcriptomics for RNA transcripts). However, a single layer of ""omics"" can only provide limited insights into the biological mechanisms of a disease. In the case of genome-wide association studies, although thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms have been identified for complex diseases and traits, the functional implications and mechanisms of the associated loci are largely unknown. Additionally, the genomic variants alone are not able to explain the changing disease risk across the life span. DNA, RNA, protein, and metabolite often have complementary roles to jointly perform a certain biological function. Such complementary effects and synergistic interactions between omic layers in the life course can only be captured by integrative study of multiple molecular layers. Building upon the success in single-omics discovery research, population studies started adopting the multi-omics approach to better understanding the molecular function and disease etiology. Multi-omics approaches integrate data obtained from different omic levels to understand their interrelation and combined influence on the disease processes. Here, we summarize major omics approaches available in population research, and review integrative approaches and methodologies interrogating multiple omic layers, which enhance the gene discovery and functional analysis of human diseases. We seek to provide analytical recommendations for different types of multi-omics data and study designs to guide the emerging multi-omic research, and to suggest improvement of the existing analytical methods.",26915271,PMC5742494,10.1016/bs.adgen.2015.11.004,161,Advances in genetics,370421,3.88,0.822474479675293,0.9933110367892977,0.22073578595317725,0.7362940523536707
"Integrative, multi-omics, analysis of blood samples improves model predictions: applications to cancer","Background:Cancer genomic studies often include data collected from several omics platforms. Each omics data source contributes to the understanding of the underlying biological process via source specific (""individual"") patterns of variability. At the same time, statistical associations and potential interactions among the different data sources can reveal signals from common biological processes that might not be identified by single source analyses. These common patterns of variability are referred to as ""shared"" or ""joint"". In this work, we show how the use of joint and individual components can lead to better predictive models, and to a deeper understanding of the biological process at hand. We identify joint and individual contributions of DNA methylation, miRNA and mRNA expression collected from blood samples in a lung cancer case-control study nested within the Norwegian Women and Cancer (NOWAC) cohort study, and we use such components to build prediction models for case-control and metastatic status. To assess the quality of predictions, we compare models based on simultaneous, integrative analysis of multi-source omics data to a standard non-integrative analysis of each single omics dataset, and to penalized regression models. Additionally, we apply the proposed approach to a breast cancer dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas.Results:Our results show how an integrative analysis that preserves both components of variation is more appropriate than standard multi-omics analyses that are not based on such a distinction. Both joint and individual components are shown to contribute to a better quality of model predictions, and facilitate the interpretation of the underlying biological processes in lung cancer development.Conclusions:In the presence of multiple omics data sources, we recommend the use of data integration techniques that preserve the joint and individual components across the omics sources. We show how the inclusion of such components increases the quality of model predictions of clinical outcomes.",34353282,PMC8340537,10.1186/s12859-021-04296-0,7,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,3.307,0.7828285694122314,0.6187290969899666,0.12374581939799331,0.6181921249249308
Integrated analysis of multi-omics data for the discovery of biomarkers and therapeutic targets for colorectal cancer,"The considerable burden of colorectal cancer and the rising trend in young adults emphasize the necessity of understanding its underlying mechanisms, providing new diagnostic and prognostic markers, and improving therapeutic approaches. Precision medicine is a new trend all over the world and identification of novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets is a step forward towards this trend. In this context, multi-omics data and integrated analysis are being investigated to develop personalized medicine in the management of colorectal cancer. Given the large amount of data from multi-omics approach, data integration and analysis is a great challenge. In this Review, we summarize how statistical and machine learning techniques are applied to analyze multi-omics data and how it contributes to the discovery of useful diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Moreover, we discuss the importance of these biomarkers and therapeutic targets in the clinical management of colorectal cancer in the future. Taken together, integrated analysis of multi-omics data has great potential for finding novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets, however, there are still challenges to overcome in future studies.",36805214,,10.1016/j.compbiomed.2023.106639,6,Computers in biology and medicine,1250250,6.698,0.7652426362037659,0.6053511705685619,0.5618729096989966,0.6925903977757712
DIABLO: an integrative approach for identifying key molecular drivers from multi-omics assays,"Motivation:In the continuously expanding omics era, novel computational and statistical strategies are needed for data integration and identification of biomarkers and molecular signatures. We present Data Integration Analysis for Biomarker discovery using Latent cOmponents (DIABLO), a multi-omics integrative method that seeks for common information across different data types through the selection of a subset of molecular features, while discriminating between multiple phenotypic groups.Results:Using simulations and benchmark multi-omics studies, we show that DIABLO identifies features with superior biological relevance compared with existing unsupervised integrative methods, while achieving predictive performance comparable to state-of-the-art supervised approaches. DIABLO is versatile, allowing for modular-based analyses and cross-over study designs. In two case studies, DIABLO identified both known and novel multi-omics biomarkers consisting of mRNAs, miRNAs, CpGs, proteins and metabolites.Availability and implementation:DIABLO is implemented in the mixOmics R Bioconductor package with functions for parameters' choice and visualization to assist in the interpretation of the integrative analyses, along with tutorials on http://mixomics.org and in our Bioconductor vignette.Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",30657866,PMC6735831,10.1093/bioinformatics/bty1054,284,"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",9808944,6.931,0.7492707371711731,0.9966555183946488,0.5919732441471572,0.767288194811065
A semi-supervised approach for the integration of multi-omics data based on transformer multi-head self-attention mechanism and graph convolutional networks,"Background and objectives:Comprehensive analysis of multi-omics data is crucial for accurately formulating effective treatment plans for complex diseases. Supervised ensemble methods have gained popularity in recent years for multi-omics data analysis. However, existing research based on supervised learning algorithms often fails to fully harness the information from unlabeled nodes and overlooks the latent features within and among different omics, as well as the various associations among features. Here, we present a novel multi-omics integrative method MOSEGCN, based on the Transformer multi-head self-attention mechanism and Graph Convolutional Networks(GCN), with the aim of enhancing the accuracy of complex disease classification. MOSEGCN first employs the Transformer multi-head self-attention mechanism and Similarity Network Fusion (SNF) to separately learn the inherent correlations of latent features within and among different omics, constructing a comprehensive view of diseases. Subsequently, it feeds the learned crucial information into a self-ensembling Graph Convolutional Network (SEGCN) built upon semi-supervised learning methods for training and testing, facilitating a better analysis and utilization of information from multi-omics data to achieve precise classification of disease subtypes.Results:The experimental results show that MOSEGCN outperforms several state-of-the-art multi-omics integrative analysis approaches on three types of omics data: mRNA expression data, microRNA expression data, and DNA methylation data, with accuracy rates of 83.0% for Alzheimer's disease and 86.7% for breast cancer subtyping. Furthermore, MOSEGCN exhibits strong generalizability on the GBM dataset, enabling the identification of important biomarkers for related diseases.Conclusion:MOSEGCN explores the significant relationship information among different omics and within each omics' latent features, effectively leveraging labeled and unlabeled information to further enhance the accuracy of complex disease classification. It also provides a promising approach for identifying reliable biomarkers, paving the way for personalized medicine.",38254021,PMC10802018,10.1186/s12864-024-09985-7,0,BMC genomics,100965258,4.547,0.7446563243865967,0.0,0.2809364548494983,0.5029810856018576
Identification of cancer risk groups through multi-omics integration using autoencoder and tensor analysis,"Identifying cancer risk groups by multi-omics has attracted researchers in their quest to find biomarkers from diverse risk-related omics. Stratifying the patients into cancer risk groups using genomics is essential for clinicians for pre-prevention treatment to improve the survival time for patients and identify the appropriate therapy strategies. This study proposes a multi-omics framework that can extract the features from various omics simultaneously. The framework employs autoencoders to learn the non-linear representation of the data and applies tensor analysis for feature learning. Further, the clustering method is used to stratify the patients into multiple cancer risk groups. Several omics were included in the experiments, namely methylation, somatic copy-number variation (SCNV), micro RNA (miRNA) and RNA sequencing (RNAseq) from two cancer types, including Glioma and Breast Invasive Carcinoma from the TCGA dataset. The results of this study are promising, as evidenced by the survival analysis and classification models, which outperformed the state-of-the-art. The patients can be significantly (p-value<0.05) divided into risk groups using extracted latent variables from the fused multi-omics data. The pipeline is open source to help researchers and clinicians identify the patients' risk groups using genomics.",38760420,PMC11101416,10.1038/s41598-024-59670-8,0,Scientific reports,101563288,4.996,0.7405498623847961,0.0033444816053511705,0.38461538461538464,0.5219218906750249
Integrative analysis of multi-omics data for liquid biopsy,"The innovation of liquid biopsy holds great potential to revolutionise cancer management through early diagnosis and timely treatment of cancer. Integrative analysis of different tumour-derived omics data (such as genomics, epigenetics, fragmentomics, and proteomics) from body fluids for cancer detection and monitoring could outperform the analysis of single modality data alone. In this review, we focussed on the discussion of early cancer detection and molecular residual disease surveillance based on multi-omics data of blood. We summarised diverse types of tumour-derived components, current popular platforms for profiling cancer-associated signals, machine learning approaches for joint analysis of liquid biopsy data, as well as multi-omics-based early detection of cancers, molecular residual disease monitoring, and treatment response surveillance. We also discussed the challenges and future directions of multi-omics-based liquid biopsy. With the development of both experimental protocols and computational methods dedicated to liquid biopsy, the implementation of multi-omics strategies into the clinical workflow will likely benefit the clinical management of cancers including decision-making guidance and patient outcome improvement.",36357703,PMC9938261,10.1038/s41416-022-02048-2,5,British journal of cancer,370635,9.075,0.7299049496650696,0.5351170568561873,0.802675585284281,0.7055014982271354
Characterization of cancer subtypes associated with clinical outcomes by multi-omics integrative clustering,"Cancer patients show heterogeneous phenotypes and very different outcomes and responses even to common treatments, such as standard chemotherapy. This state-of-affairs has motivated the need for the comprehensive characterization of cancer phenotypes and fueled the generation of large omics datasets, comprising multiple omics data reported for the same patients, which might now allow us to start deciphering cancer heterogeneity and implement personalized therapeutic strategies. In this work, we performed the analysis of four cancer types obtained from the latest efforts by The Cancer Genome Atlas, for which seven distinct omics data were available for each patient, in addition to curated clinical outcomes. We performed a uniform pipeline for raw data preprocessing and adopted the Cancer Integration via MultIkernel LeaRning (CIMLR) integrative clustering method to extract cancer subtypes. We then systematically review the discovered clusters for the considered cancer types, highlighting novel associations between the different omics and prognosis.",37267828,,10.1016/j.compbiomed.2023.107064,1,Computers in biology and medicine,1250250,6.698,0.7285552024841309,0.19732441471571907,0.5652173913043478,0.5896414826944919
Multi-OMICS approaches in cancer biology: New era in cancer therapy,"Innovative multi-omics frameworks integrate diverse datasets from the same patients to enhance our understanding of the molecular and clinical aspects of cancers. Advanced omics and multi-view clustering algorithms present unprecedented opportunities for classifying cancers into subtypes, refining survival predictions and treatment outcomes, and unravelling key pathophysiological processes across various molecular layers. However, with the increasing availability of cost-effective high-throughput technologies (HTT) that generate vast amounts of data, analyzing single layers often falls short of establishing causal relations. Integrating multi-omics data spanning genomes, epigenomes, transcriptomes, proteomes, metabolomes, and microbiomes offers unique prospects to comprehend the underlying biology of complex diseases like cancer. This discussion explores algorithmic frameworks designed to uncover cancer subtypes, disease mechanisms, and methods for identifying pivotal genomic alterations. It also underscores the significance of multi-omics in tumor classifications, diagnostics, and prognostications. Despite its unparalleled advantages, the integration of multi-omics data has been slow to find its way into everyday clinics. A major hurdle is the uneven maturity of different omics approaches and the widening gap between the generation of large datasets and the capacity to process this data. Initiatives promoting the standardization of sample processing and analytical pipelines, as well as multidisciplinary training for experts in data analysis and interpretation, are crucial for translating theoretical findings into practical applications.",38484941,,10.1016/j.bbadis.2024.167120,0,Biochimica et biophysica acta.

Practicing precision medicine with intelligently integrative clinical and multi-omics data analysis,"Precision medicine aims to empower clinicians to predict the most appropriate course of action for patients with complex diseases like cancer, diabetes, cardiomyopathy, and COVID-19. With a progressive interpretation of the clinical, molecular, and genomic factors at play in diseases, more effective and personalized medical treatments are anticipated for many disorders. Understanding patient's metabolomics and genetic make-up in conjunction with clinical data will significantly lead to determining predisposition, diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive biomarkers and paths ultimately providing optimal and personalized care for diverse, and targeted chronic and acute diseases. In clinical settings, we need to timely model clinical and multi-omics data to find statistical patterns across millions of features to identify underlying biologic pathways, modifiable risk factors, and actionable information that support early detection and prevention of complex disorders, and development of new therapies for better patient care. It is important to calculate quantitative phenotype measurements, evaluate variants in unique genes and interpret using ACMG guidelines, find frequency of pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants without disease indicators, and observe autosomal recessive carriers with a phenotype manifestation in metabolome. Next, ensuring security to reconcile noise, we need to build and train machine-learning prognostic models to meaningfully process multisource heterogeneous data to identify high-risk rare variants and make medically relevant predictions. The goal, today, is to facilitate implementation of mainstream precision medicine to improve the traditional symptom-driven practice of medicine, and allow earlier interventions using predictive diagnostics and tailoring better-personalized treatments. We strongly recommend automated implementation of cutting-edge technologies, utilizing machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) approaches for the multimodal data aggregation, multifactor examination, development of knowledgebase of clinical predictors for decision support, and best strategies for dealing with relevant ethical issues.",33008459,PMC7530549,10.1186/s40246-020-00287-z,27,Human genomics,101202210,6.481,0.7231139540672302,0.8729096989966555,0.5451505016722408,0.7174804125741174
Multi-omics integration with weighted affinity and self-diffusion applied for cancer subtypes identification,"Background:Characterizing cancer molecular subtypes is crucial for improving prognosis and individualized treatment. Integrative analysis of multi-omics data has become an important approach for disease subtyping, yielding better understanding of the complex biology. Current multi-omics integration tools and methods for cancer subtyping often suffer challenges of high computational efficiency as well as the problem of weight assignment on data types.Results:Here, we present an efficient multi-omics integration via weighted affinity and self-diffusion (MOSD) to dissect cancer heterogeneity. MOSD first construct local scaling affinity on each data type and then integrate all affinities by weighted linear combination, followed by the self-diffusion to further improve the patients' similarities for the downstream clustering analysis. To demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness for cancer subtyping, we apply MOSD across ten cancer types with three measurements (Gene expression, DNA methylation, miRNA).Conclusions:Our approach exhibits more significant differences in patient survival and computationally efficient benchmarking against several state-of-art integration methods and the identified molecular subtypes reveal strongly biological interpretability.

A Detailed Catalogue of Multi-Omics Methodologies for Identification of Putative Biomarkers and Causal Molecular Networks in Translational Cancer Research,"Recent advances in sequencing and biotechnological methodologies have led to the generation of large volumes of molecular data of different omics layers, such as genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics. Integration of these data with clinical information provides new opportunities to discover how perturbations in biological processes lead to disease. Using data-driven approaches for the integration and interpretation of multi-omics data could stably identify links between structural and functional information and propose causal molecular networks with potential impact on cancer pathophysiology. This knowledge can then be used to improve disease diagnosis, prognosis, prevention, and therapy. This review will summarize and categorize the most current computational methodologies and tools for integration of distinct molecular layers in the context of translational cancer research and personalized therapy. Additionally, the bioinformatics tools Multi-Omics Factor Analysis (MOFA) and netDX will be tested using omics data from public cancer resources, to assess their overall robustness, provide reproducible workflows for gaining biological knowledge from multi-omics data, and to comprehensively understand the significantly perturbed biological entities in distinct cancer types.

ioSearch: An approach for identifying interacting multiomics biomarkers using a novel algorithm with application on breast cancer data sets,"Identification of biomarkers by integrating multiple omics together is important because complex diseases occur due to an intricate interplay of various genetic materials. Traditional single-omics association tests neither explore this crucial interomics dependence nor identify moderately weak signals due to the multiple-testing burden. Conversely, multiomics data integration imparts complementary information but suffers from an increased multiple-testing burden, data diversity inherent with different omics features, high-dimensionality, and so forth. Most of the available methods address subtype classification using dimension-reduction techniques to circumvent the sample size issue but interacting multiomics biomarker identification methods are unavailable. We propose a two-step model that first investigates phenotype-omics association using logistic regression. Then, selects disease-associated omics using sparse principal components which explores the interrelationship of multiple variables from two omics in a multivariate multiple regression framework. On the basis of this model, we developed a multiomics biomarker identification algorithm, interacting omics search (ioSearch), that jointly tests the effect of multiple omics with disease and between-omics associations by using pathway information that subsequently reduces the multiple-testing burden. Further, inference in terms of p values potentially makes it an easily interpretable biomarker identification tool. Extensive simulation demonstrates ioSearch as statistically powerful with a controlled Type-I error rate. Its application to publicly available breast cancer data sets identified relevant omics features in important pathways.",37795815,,10.1002/gepi.22536,0,Genetic epidemiology,8411723,2.344,0.7173089981079102,0.013377926421404682,0.08695652173913043,0.4504522884968531

[Study design and statistical methods used for integrative analysis on multi-omics in cancer epidemiology],"Rapid development of biotechnology provides us with large number of omics data from different angles in biological research, including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and epigenetics. However, any single technology cannot reflect the entire picture of the biological complexity of most tumors. The integration of multiple technologies has emerged as a new approach to provide a more comprehensive view on the biological aspects of tumors. Despite the maturing of acquisition and processing approaches regarding the various omics data, integration of multi-omics data still needs to be developed.

[Identification of disease targets for precision medicine by integrative analysis of multi-omics data],"With the development and improvement of high-throughput sequencing technologies, the acquisition and processing approaches of various biological omics data on different levels are becoming more mature. Despite several new disease-associated factors have been discovered based on single omics data analysis, identification of disease targets by integrative analysis of multi-omics data is still growing. Since life is a complex regulatory system in which the regulation of gene mutations, epigenetic alterations, abnormal gene expression as well as anomalous variations in signal pathway are related with the occurrence and development of diseases, it is obvious that finding therapeutic factors using single omics data analysis has its limitation. Systematical studies of clinical and pathological mechanisms and identification of optimal therapeutic targets through integrative analysis of multi-omics data from different levels and resources have become an important research direction of precision medicine, which would provide innovative perspectives on disease study and new theoretical basis for early diagnosis, personalized treatment and medicine guide. In this review, we introduce new technologies and research progresses in screening therapeutic targets using systematic omics such as genomics, transcriptomics and epigenomics, and also discusse new strategies and advantages of integrative analysis among them.",26351165,,10.16288/j.yczz.15-061,0,Yi chuan = Hereditas,9436478,0.0,0.7145284414291382,0.016722408026755852,0.010033444816053512,0.4340682354260449
A multi-omics data simulator for complex disease studies and its application to evaluate multi-omics data analysis methods for disease classification,"Background:An integrative multi-omics analysis approach that combines multiple types of omics data including genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and microbiomics has become increasing popular for understanding the pathophysiology of complex diseases. Although many multi-omics analysis methods have been developed for complex disease studies, only a few simulation tools that simulate multiple types of omics data and model their relationships with disease status are available, and these tools have their limitations in simulating the multi-omics data.Results:We developed the multi-omics data simulator OmicsSIMLA, which simulates genomics (i.e., single-nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs] and copy number variations), epigenomics (i.e., bisulphite sequencing), transcriptomics (i.e., RNA sequencing), and proteomics (i.e., normalized reverse phase protein array) data at the whole-genome level. Furthermore, the relationships between different types of omics data, such as methylation quantitative trait loci (SNPs influencing methylation), expression quantitative trait loci (SNPs influencing gene expression), and expression quantitative trait methylations (methylations influencing gene expression), were modeled. More importantly, the relationships between these multi-omics data and the disease status were modeled as well. We used OmicsSIMLA to simulate a multi-omics dataset for breast cancer under a hypothetical disease model and used the data to compare the performance among existing multi-omics analysis methods in terms of disease classification accuracy and runtime. We also used OmicsSIMLA to simulate a multi-omics dataset with a scale similar to an ovarian cancer multi-omics dataset. The neural network-based multi-omics analysis method ATHENA was applied to both the real and simulated data and the results were compared. Our results demonstrated that complex disease mechanisms can be simulated by OmicsSIMLA, and ATHENA showed the highest prediction accuracy when the effects of multi-omics features (e.g., SNPs, copy number variations, and gene expression levels) on the disease were strong. Furthermore, similar results can be obtained from ATHENA when analyzing the simulated and real ovarian multi-omics data.Conclusions:OmicsSIMLA will be useful to evaluate the performace of different multi-omics analysis methods. Sample sizes and power can also be calculated by OmicsSIMLA when planning a new multi-omics disease study.",31029063,PMC6486474,10.1093/gigascience/giz045,14,GigaScience,101596872,7.658,0.7136312127113342,0.7792642140468228,0.725752508361204,0.7291820721084059
Identification of novel prognostic biomarkers by integrating multi-omics data in gastric cancer,"Background:Gastric cancer is a fatal gastrointestinal cancer with high morbidity and poor prognosis. The dismal 5-year survival rate warrants reliable biomarkers to assess and improve the prognosis of gastric cancer. Distinguishing driver mutations that are required for the cancer phenotype from passenger mutations poses a formidable challenge for cancer genomics.Methods:We integrated the multi-omics data of 293 primary gastric cancer patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to identify key driver genes by establishing a prognostic model of the patients. Analyzing both copy number alteration and somatic mutation data helped us to comprehensively reveal molecular markers of genomic variation. Integrating the transcription level of genes provided a unique perspective for us to discover dysregulated factors in transcriptional regulation.Results:We comprehensively identified 31 molecular markers of genomic variation. For instance, the copy number alteration of WASHC5 (also known as KIAA0196) frequently occurred in gastric cancer patients, which cannot be discovered using traditional methods based on significant mutations. Furthermore, we revealed that several dysregulation factors played a hub regulatory role in the process of biological metabolism based on dysregulation networks. Cancer hallmark and functional enrichment analysis showed that these key driver (KD) genes played a vital role in regulating programmed cell death. The drug response patterns and transcriptional signatures of KD genes reflected their clinical application value.Conclusions:These findings indicated that KD genes could serve as novel prognostic biomarkers for further research on the pathogenesis of gastric cancers. Our study elucidated a multidimensional and comprehensive genomic landscape and highlighted the molecular complexity of GC.",33902514,PMC8073914,10.1186/s12885-021-08210-y,9,BMC cancer,100967800,4.638,0.7093212604522705,0.6956521739130435,0.3076923076923077,0.6262616525924326
HCNM: Heterogeneous Correlation Network Model for Multi-level Integrative Study of Multi-omics Data for Cancer Subtype Prediction,"Integrative analysis of multi-omics data is important for biomedical applications, as it is required for a comprehensive understanding of biological function. Integrating multi-omics data serves multiple purposes, such as, an integrated data model, dimensionality reduction of omic features, patient clustering, etc. For oncological data, patient clustering is synonymous to cancer subtype prediction. However, there is a gap in combining some of the widely used integrative analyses to build more powerful tools. To bridge the gap, we propose a multi-level integration algorithm to identify representative integrative subspace and use it for cancer subtype prediction. The three integrative approaches we implement on multi-omics features are, (1) multivariate multiple (linear) regression of the features from a cohort of patients/samples, (2) network construction using different omics features, and (3) fusion of sample similarity networks across the features. We use a type of multilayer network, called heterogeneous network, as a data model to transition between a network-free (NF) regression model and a network-based (NB) model, which uses correlation networks. The heterogeneous networks consist of intra- and inter-layer graphs. Our proposed heterogeneous correlation network model, HCNM, is central to our algorithm for gene-ranking, integrative subspace identification, and tumor-specific subtypes prediction. The genes of our representative integrative subspace have been enriched with gene-ontology and found to exhibit significant gene-disease association (GDA) scores. The subspace in genes which is less than 5% of the total gene-set of each genomic feature is used with NB fusion integrative model to predict sample subtypes. As the identified integrative subspace data of multi-omics is less prone to noise, bias, and outliers, our experiments show that the subtypes in our results agree with previous benchmark studies and exhibit better classification between poor and good survival of patient cohorts.Clinical relevance: Finding significant cancer-specific genes and subtypes of cancer is vital for early prognosis, and personalized treatment; therefore, improves survival probability of a patient.",34891654,,10.1109/EMBC46164.2021.9630781,2,Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology,101763872,0.0,0.7093212604522705,0.3076923076923077,0.013377926421404682,0.48980680309410474
IMIX: a multivariate mixture model approach to association analysis through multi-omics data integration,"Motivation:Integrative genomic analysis is a powerful tool used to study the biological mechanisms underlying a complex disease or trait across multiplatform high-dimensional data, such as DNA methylation, copy number variation and gene expression. It is common to perform large-scale genome-wide association analysis of an outcome for each data type separately and combine the results ad hoc, leading to loss of statistical power and uncontrolled overall false discovery rate (FDR).Results:We propose a multivariate mixture model (IMIX) framework that integrates multiple types of genomic data and allows modeling of inter-data-type correlations. We investigated the across-data-type FDR control in IMIX and demonstrated lower misclassification rates at controlled overall FDR than established individual data type analysis strategies, such as the Benjamini-Hochberg FDR control, the q-value and the local FDR control by extensive simulations. IMIX features statistically principled model selection, FDR control and computational efficiency. Applications to The Cancer Genome Atlas data provided novel multi-omics insights into the genes and mechanisms associated with the luminal and basal subtypes of bladder cancer and the prognosis of pancreatic cancer.Availabilityand implementation:We have implemented our method in R package 'IMIX' available at https://github.com/ziqiaow/IMIX, as well as CRAN soon.Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",33258948,PMC8016490,10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa1001,3,"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",9808944,6.931,0.7059877514839172,0.38461538461538464,0.5953177257525084,0.6195792729639289
Multi-omics study for interpretation of genome-wide association study,"Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified thousands of genetic loci associated with complex traits, including a wide variety of diseases. Despite the successful identification of associated loci, interpreting GWAS findings remains challenging and requires other biological resources. Omics, including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and epigenomics, are increasingly used in a broad range of research fields. Integrative analyses applying GWAS with these omics data are expected to expand our knowledge of complex traits and provide insight into the pathogenesis of complex diseases and their causative factors. Recently, associations between genetic variants and omics data have been comprehensively evaluated, providing new information on the influence of genetic variants on omics. Furthermore, recent advances in analytic methods, including single-cell technologies, have revealed previously unknown disease mechanisms. To advance our understanding of complex traits, integrative analysis using GWAS with multi-omics data is needed. In this review, I describe successful examples of integrative analyses based on omics and GWAS, discuss the limitations of current multi-omics analyses, and provide a perspective on future integrative studies.",32948838,,10.1038/s10038-020-00842-5,18,Journal of human genetics,9808008,3.755,0.7026321291923523,0.8160535117056856,0.2140468227424749,0.6275993444050434
Statistical Methods for Integrative Clustering of Multi-omics Data,"Cancers are heterogeneous diseases caused by accumulated mutations or abnormal alterations at multi-levels of biological processes including genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics. There is a great clinical interest in identifying cancer molecular subtypes for disease prognosis and personalized medicine. Integrative clustering is a powerful unsupervised learning method that has been increasingly used to identify cancer molecular subtypes using multi-omics data including somatic mutations, DNA copy numbers, DNA methylation, and gene expression. Integrative clustering methods are generally classified into model-based or nonparametric approaches. In this chapter, we will give an overview of the frequently used model-based methods, including iCluster, iClusterPlus, and iClusterBayes, and the nonparametric method, integrative nonnegative matrix factorization (intNMF). We will use the integrative analyses of uveal melanoma and lower-grade glioma to illustrate these representative methods. Finally, we will discuss the strengths and limitations of these representative methods and give suggestions for performing integrative analyses of cancer multi-omics data in practice.",36929074,PMC10950392,10.1007/978-1-0716-2986-4_5,0,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,0.0,0.7023258805274963,0.020066889632107024,0.016722408026755852,0.42875338784827044
MDICC: novel method for multi-omics data integration and cancer subtype identification,"Each type of cancer usually has several subtypes with distinct clinical implications, and therefore the discovery of cancer subtypes is an important and urgent task in disease diagnosis and therapy. Using single-omics data to predict cancer subtypes is difficult because genomes are dysregulated and complicated by multiple molecular mechanisms, and therefore linking cancer genomes to cancer phenotypes is not an easy task. Using multi-omics data to effectively predict cancer subtypes is an area of much interest; however, integrating multi-omics data is challenging. Here, we propose a novel method of multi-omics data integration for clustering to identify cancer subtypes (MDICC) that integrates new affinity matrix and network fusion methods. Our experimental results show the effectiveness and generalization of the proposed MDICC model in identifying cancer subtypes, and its performance was better than those of currently available state-of-the-art clustering methods. Furthermore, the survival analysis demonstrates that MDICC delivered comparable or even better results than many typical integrative methods.",35437603,,10.1093/bib/bbac132,7,Briefings in bioinformatics,100912837,13.994,0.7002802491188049,0.6220735785953178,0.8260869565217391,0.7098002564946944
Integrative Exploratory Analysis of Two or More Genomic Datasets,"Exploratory analysis is an essential step in the analysis of high throughput data. Multivariate approaches such as correspondence analysis (CA), principal component analysis, and multidimensional scaling are widely used in the exploratory analysis of single dataset. Modern biological studies often assay multiple types of biological molecules (e.g., mRNA, protein, phosphoproteins) on a same set of biological samples, thereby creating multiple different types of omics data or multiassay data. Integrative exploratory analysis of these multiple omics data is required to leverage the potential of multiple omics studies. In this chapter, we describe the application of co-inertia analysis (CIA; for analyzing two datasets) and multiple co-inertia analysis (MCIA; for three or more datasets) to address this problem. These methods are powerful yet simple multivariate approaches that represent samples using a lower number of variables, allowing a more easily identification of the correlated structure in and between multiple high dimensional datasets. Graphical representations can be employed to this purpose. In addition, the methods simultaneously project samples and variables (genes, proteins) onto the same lower dimensional space, so the most variant variables from each dataset can be selected and associated with samples, which can be further used to facilitate biological interpretation and pathway analysis. We applied CIA to explore the concordance between mRNA and protein expression in a panel of 60 tumor cell lines from the National Cancer Institute. In the same 60 cell lines, we used MCIA to perform a cross-platform comparison of mRNA gene expression profiles obtained on four different microarray platforms. Last, as an example of integrative analysis of multiassay or multi-omics data we analyzed transcriptomic, proteomic, and phosphoproteomic data from pluripotent (iPS) and embryonic stem (ES) cell lines.",27008008,,10.1007/978-1-4939-3578-9_2,3,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,0.0,0.6991516947746277,0.3879598662207358,0.020066889632107024,0.5010963680353452
Multi-Omics Data Analysis Uncovers Molecular Networks and Gene Regulators for Metabolic Biomarkers,"The insulin-like growth factors (IGFs)/insulin resistance (IR) axis is the major metabolic hormonal pathway mediating the biologic mechanism of several complex human diseases, including type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and cancers. The genomewide association study (GWAS)-based approach has neither fully characterized the phenotype variation nor provided a comprehensive understanding of the regulatory biologic mechanisms. We applied systematic genomics to integrate our previous GWAS data for IGF-I and IR with multi-omics datasets, e.g., whole-blood expression quantitative loci, molecular pathways, and gene network, to capture the full range of genetic functionalities associated with IGF-I/IR and key drivers (KDs) in gene-regulatory networks. We identified both shared (e.g., T2DM, lipid metabolism, and estimated glomerular filtration signaling) and IR-specific (e.g., mechanistic target of rapamycin, phosphoinositide 3-kinases, and erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 4 signaling) molecular biologic processes of IGF-I/IR axis regulation. Next, by using tissue-specific gene-gene interaction networks, we identified both well-established (e.g.,IRS1andIGF1R) and novel (e.g.,AKT1,HRAS, andJAK1) KDs in the IGF-I/IR-associated subnetworks. Our results, if validated in additional genomic studies, may provide robust, comprehensive insights into the mechanisms of IGF-I/IR regulation and highlight potential novel genetic targets as preventive and therapeutic strategies for the associated diseases, e.g., T2DM and cancers.",33801830,PMC8001935,10.3390/biom11030406,1,Biomolecules,101596414,6.064,0.6981236934661865,0.2040133779264214,0.48494983277591974,0.5566668582201801
Integrative Analysis of Multi-Omics Data Based on Blockwise Sparse Principal Components,"The recent development of high-throughput technology has allowed us to accumulate vast amounts of multi-omics data. Because even single omics data have a large number of variables, integrated analysis of multi-omics data suffers from problems such as computational instability and variable redundancy. Most multi-omics data analyses apply single supervised analysis, repeatedly, for dimensional reduction and variable selection. However, these approaches cannot avoid the problems of redundancy and collinearity of variables. In this study, we propose a novel approach using blockwise component analysis. This would solve the limitations of current methods by applying variable clustering and sparse principal component (sPC) analysis. Our approach consists of two stages. The first stage identifies homogeneous variable blocks, and then extracts sPCs, for each omics dataset. The second stage merges sPCs from each omics dataset, and then constructs a prediction model. We also propose a graphical method showing the results of sparse PCA and model fitting, simultaneously. We applied the proposed methodology to glioblastoma multiforme data from The Cancer Genome Atlas. The comparison with other existing approaches showed that our proposed methodology is more easily interpretable than other approaches, and has comparable predictive power, with a much smaller number of variables.",33147797,PMC7663540,10.3390/ijms21218202,5,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,6.208,0.6966810822486877,0.5384615384615384,0.5217391304347826,0.6300487831284769
A Systemic Analysis of Transcriptomic and Epigenomic Data To Reveal Regulation Patterns for Complex Disease,"Integrating diverse genomics data can provide a global view of the complex biological processes related to the human complex diseases. Although substantial efforts have been made to integrate different omics data, there are at least three challenges for multi-omics integration methods: (i) How to simultaneously consider the effects of various genomic factors, since these factors jointly influence the phenotypes; (ii) How to effectively incorporate the information from publicly accessible databases and omics datasets to fully capture the interactions among (epi)genomic factors from diverse omics data; and (iii) Until present, the combination of more than two omics datasets has been poorly explored. Current integration approaches are not sufficient to address all of these challenges together. We proposed a novel integrative analysis framework by incorporating sparse model, multivariate analysis, Gaussian graphical model, and network analysis to address these three challenges simultaneously. Based on this strategy, we performed a systemic analysis for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) integrating genome-wide gene expression, DNA methylation, and miRNA expression data. We identified three regulatory modules of genomic factors associated with GBM survival time and revealed a global regulatory pattern for GBM by combining the three modules, with respect to the common regulatory factors. Our method can not only identify disease-associated dysregulated genomic factors from different omics, but more importantly, it can incorporate the information from publicly accessible databases and omics datasets to infer a comprehensive interaction map of all these dysregulated genomic factors. Our work represents an innovative approach to enhance our understanding of molecular genomic mechanisms underlying human complex diseases.",28500050,PMC5499134,10.1534/g3.117.042408,4,"G3 (Bethesda, Md.)",101566598,3.542,0.6964746713638306,0.4414715719063545,0.15719063545150502,0.5376172442898703
"Multi-omics analysis based on integrated genomics, epigenomics and transcriptomics in pancreatic cancer","Aim:Integrated analysis of genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics and clinical information contributes to identify specific molecular subgroups and find novel biomarkers for pancreatic cancer.Materials & methods:The DNA copy number variation, the simple nucleotide variation, methylation and mRNA data of pancreatic cancer patients were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Four molecular subgroups (iC1, iC2, iC3 and iC4) of pancreatic cancer were identified by integrating analysis.Results:The iC1 subgroup harbors better prognosis, higher immune score, lesser DNA copy number variation mutations and better genomic stability compared with iC2, iC3 and iC4 subgroups.

Survey and comparative assessments of computational multi-omics integrative methods with multiple regulatory networks identifying distinct tumor compositions across pan-cancer data sets,"The significance of pan-cancer categories has recently been recognized as widespread in cancer research. Pan-cancer categorizes a cancer based on its molecular pathology rather than an organ. The molecular similarities among multi-omics data found in different cancer types can play several roles in both biological processes and therapeutic developments. Therefore, an integrated analysis for various genomic data is frequently used to reveal novel genetic and molecular mechanisms. However, a variety of algorithms for multi-omics clustering have been proposed in different fields. The comparison of different computational clustering methods in pan-cancer analysis performance remains unclear. To increase the utilization of current integrative methods in pan-cancer analysis, we first provide an overview of five popular computational integrative tools: similarity network fusion, integrative clustering of multiple genomic data types (iCluster), cancer integration via multi-kernel learning (CIMLR), perturbation clustering for data integration and disease subtyping (PINS) and low-rank clustering (LRACluster). Then, a priori interactions in multi-omics data were incorporated to detect prominent molecular patterns in pan-cancer data sets. Finally, we present comparative assessments of these methods, with discussion over key issues in applying these algorithms. We found that all five methods can identify distinct tumor compositions. The pan-cancer samples can be reclassified into several groups by different proportions. Interestingly, each method can classify the tumors into categories that are different from original cancer types or subtypes, especially for ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma (OV) and breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA) tumors. In addition, all clusters of the five computational methods show notable prognostic values. Furthermore, both the 9 recurrent differential genes and the 15 common pathway characteristics were identified across all the methods. The results and discussion can help the community select appropriate integrative tools according to different research tasks or aims in pan-cancer analysis.",32533167,,10.1093/bib/bbaa102,5,Briefings in bioinformatics,100912837,13.994,0.6912890076637268,0.5418060200668896,0.8294314381270903,0.6890208962370321
A Customizable Analysis Flow in Integrative Multi-Omics,"The number of researchers using multi-omics is growing. Though still expensive, every year it is cheaper to perform multi-omic studies, often exponentially so. In addition to its increasing accessibility, multi-omics reveals a view of systems biology to an unprecedented depth. Thus, multi-omics can be used to answer a broad range of biological questions in finer resolution than previous methods. We used six omic measurements-four nucleic acid (i.e., genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomics, and metagenomic) and two mass spectrometry (proteomics and metabolomics) based-to highlight an analysis workflow on this type of data, which is often vast. This workflow is not exhaustive of all the omic measurements or analysis methods, but it will provide an experienced or even a novice multi-omic researcher with the tools necessary to analyze their data. This review begins with analyzing a single ome and study design, and then synthesizes best practices in data integration techniques that include machine learning. Furthermore, we delineate methods to validate findings from multi-omic integration. Ultimately, multi-omic integration offers a window into the complexity of molecular interactions and a comprehensive view of systems biology.",33260881,PMC7760368,10.3390/biom10121606,7,Biomolecules,101596414,6.064,0.6907677054405212,0.6254180602006689,0.4882943143812709,0.6372030981807008
Multiomics technologies: role in disease biomarker discoveries and therapeutics,"Medical research has been revolutionized after the publication of the full human genome. This was the major landmark that paved the way for understanding the biological functions of different macro and micro molecules. With the advent of different high-throughput technologies, biomedical research was further revolutionized. These technologies constitute genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, etc. Collectively, these high-throughputs are referred to as multi-omics technologies. In the biomedical field, these omics technologies act as efficient and effective tools for disease diagnosis, management, monitoring, treatment and discovery of certain novel disease biomarkers. Genotyping arrays and other transcriptomic studies have helped us to elucidate the gene expression patterns in different biological states, i.e. healthy and diseased states. Further omics technologies such as proteomics and metabolomics have an important role in predicting the role of different biological molecules in an organism. It is because of these high throughput omics technologies that we have been able to fully understand the role of different genes, proteins, metabolites and biological pathways in a diseased condition. To understand a complex biological process, it is important to apply an integrative approach that analyses the multi-omics data in order to highlight the possible interrelationships of the involved biomolecules and their functions. Furthermore, these omics technologies offer an important opportunity to understand the information that underlies disease. In the current review, we will discuss the importance of omics technologies as promising tools to understand the role of different biomolecules in diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative diseases and diabetes.",35809340,,10.1093/bfgp/elac017,5,Briefings in functional genomics,101528229,4.84,0.689723789691925,0.5451505016722408,0.35785953177257523,0.5944362805041182
Multi-omics cluster defines the subtypes of CRC with distinct prognosis and tumor microenvironment,"Background:Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a complex malignancy characterized by diverse molecular profiles, clinical outcomes, and limited precision in prognostic markers. Addressing these challenges, this study utilized multi-omics data to define consensus molecular subtypes in CRC and elucidate their association with clinical outcomes and underlying biological processes.Methods:Consensus molecular subtypes were obtained by applying ten integrated multi-omics clustering algorithms to analyze TCGA-CRC multi-omics data, including mRNA, lncRNA, miRNA, DNA methylation CpG sites, and somatic mutation data. The association of subtypes with prognoses, enrichment functions, immune status, and genomic alterations were further analyzed. Next, we conducted univariate Cox and Lasso regression analyses to investigate the potential prognostic application of biomarkers associated with multi-omics subtypes derived from weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). The function of one of the biomarkers MID2 was validated in CRC cell lines.Results:Two CRC subtypes linked to distinct clinical outcomes were identified in TCGA-CRC cohort and validated with three external datasets. The CS1 subtype exhibited a poor prognosis and was characterized by higher tumor-related Hallmark pathway activity and lower metabolism pathway activity. In addition, the CS1 was predicted to have less immunotherapy responder and exhibited more genomic alteration compared to CS2. Then a prognostic model comprising five genes was established, with patients in the high-risk group showing substantial concordance with the CS1 subtype, and those in the low-risk group with the CS2 subtype. The gene MID2, included in the prognostic model, was found to be correlated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway and distinct DNA methylation patterns. Knockdown of MID2 in CRC cells resulted in reduced colony formation, migration, and invasion capacities.Conclusion:The integrative multi-omics subtypes proposed potential biomarkers for CRC and provided valuable knowledge for precision oncology.",38549156,PMC10976740,10.1186/s40001-024-01805-8,1,European journal of medical research,9517857,4.981,0.6888871788978577,0.20735785953177258,0.3779264214046823,0.5303891635260055
A comparative study of multi-omics integration tools for cancer driver gene identification and tumour subtyping,"Oncogenesis and cancer can arise as a consequence of a wide range of genomic aberrations including mutations, copy number alterations, expression changes and epigenetic modifications encompassing multiple omics layers. Integrating genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic and epigenomic datasets via multi-omics analysis provides the opportunity to derive a deeper and holistic understanding of the development and progression of cancer. There are two primary approaches to integrating multi-omics data: multi-staged (focused on identifying genes driving cancer) and meta-dimensional (focused on establishing clinically relevant tumour or sample classifications). A number of ready-to-use bioinformatics tools are available to perform both multi-staged and meta-dimensional integration of multi-omics data. In this study, we compared nine different integration tools using real and simulated cancer datasets. The performance of the multi-staged integration tools were assessed at the gene, function and pathway levels, while meta-dimensional integration tools were assessed based on the sample classification performance. Additionally, we discuss the influence of factors such as data representation, sample size, signal and noise on multi-omics data integration.

Integrative Analysis of Cancer Omics Data for Prognosis Modeling,"Prognosis modeling plays an important role in cancer studies. With the development of omics profiling, extensive research has been conducted to search for prognostic markers for various cancer types. However, many of the existing studies share a common limitation by only focusing on a single cancer type and suffering from a lack of sufficient information. With potential molecular similarity across cancer types, one cancer type may contain information useful for the analysis of other types. The integration of multiple cancer types may facilitate information borrowing so as to more comprehensively and more accurately describe prognosis. In this study, we conduct marginal and joint integrative analysis of multiple cancer types, effectively introducing integration in the discovery process. For accommodating high dimensionality and identifying relevant markers, we adopt the advanced penalization technique which has a solid statistical ground. Gene expression data on nine cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) are analyzed, leading to biologically sensible findings that are different from the alternatives. Overall, this study provides a novel venue for cancer prognosis modeling by integrating multiple cancer types.",31405076,PMC6727084,10.3390/genes10080604,3,Genes,101551097,4.141,0.6854233145713806,0.391304347826087,0.2408026755852843,0.5376753934251026
STATegra: Multi-Omics Data Integration - A Conceptual Scheme With a Bioinformatics Pipeline,"Technologies for profiling samples using different omics platforms have been at the forefront since the human genome project. Large-scale multi-omics data hold the promise of deciphering different regulatory layers. Yet, while there is a myriad of bioinformatics tools, each multi-omics analysis appears to start from scratch with an arbitrary decision over which tools to use and how to combine them. Therefore, it is an unmet need to conceptualize how to integrate such data and implement and validate pipelines in different cases. We have designed a conceptual framework (STATegra), aiming it to be as generic as possible for multi-omics analysis, combining available multi-omic anlaysis tools (machine learning component analysis, non-parametric data combination, and a multi-omics exploratory analysis) in a step-wise manner. While in several studies, we have previously combined those integrative tools, here, we provide a systematic description of the STATegra framework and its validation using two The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) case studies. For both, the Glioblastoma and the Skin Cutaneous Melanoma (SKCM) cases, we demonstrate an enhanced capacity of the framework (and beyond the individual tools) to identify features and pathways compared to single-omics analysis. Such an integrative multi-omics analysis framework for identifying features and components facilitates the discovery of new biology. Finally, we provide several options for applying the STATegra framework when parametric assumptions are fulfilled and for the case when not all the samples are profiled for all omics. The STATegra framework is built using several tools, which are being integrated step-by-step as OpenSource in the STATegRa Bioconductor package.",33747045,PMC7970106,10.3389/fgene.2021.620453,10,Frontiers in genetics,101560621,4.772,0.6831024885177612,0.7190635451505016,0.34448160535117056,0.6225705232109913
Network approaches to systems biology analysis of complex disease: integrative methods for multi-omics data,"In the past decade, significant progress has been made in complex disease research across multiple omics layers from genome, transcriptome and proteome to metabolome. There is an increasing awareness of the importance of biological interconnections, and much success has been achieved using systems biology approaches. However, because of the typical focus on one single omics layer at a time, existing systems biology findings explain only a modest portion of complex disease. Recent advances in multi-omics data collection and sharing present us new opportunities for studying complex diseases in a more comprehensive fashion, and yet simultaneously create new challenges considering the unprecedented data dimensionality and diversity. Here, our goal is to review extant and emerging network approaches that can be applied across multiple biological layers to facilitate a more comprehensive and integrative multilayered omics analysis of complex diseases.",28679163,PMC6454489,10.1093/bib/bbx066,127,Briefings in bioinformatics,100912837,13.994,0.6743722558021545,0.9765886287625418,0.8361204013377926,0.7671651595013597
Integrative analysis of omics summary data reveals putative mechanisms underlying complex traits,"The identification of genes and regulatory elements underlying the associations discovered by GWAS is essential to understanding the aetiology of complex traits (including diseases). Here, we demonstrate an analytical paradigm of prioritizing genes and regulatory elements at GWAS loci for follow-up functional studies. We perform an integrative analysis that uses summary-level SNP data from multi-omics studies to detect DNA methylation (DNAm) sites associated with gene expression and phenotype through shared genetic effects (i.e., pleiotropy). We identify pleiotropic associations between 7858 DNAm sites and 2733 genes. These DNAm sites are enriched in enhancers and promoters, and >40% of them are mapped to distal genes. Further pleiotropic association analyses, which link both the methylome and transcriptome to 12 complex traits, identify 149 DNAm sites and 66 genes, indicating a plausible mechanism whereby the effect of a genetic variant on phenotype is mediated by genetic regulation of transcription through DNAm.",29500431,PMC5834629,10.1038/s41467-018-03371-0,157,Nature communications,101528555,17.694,0.6698528528213501,0.9866220735785953,0.9230769230769231,0.7838515110239138
Prioritization of therapeutic targets for cancers using integrative multi-omics analysis,"Background:The integration of transcriptomic, proteomic, druggable genetic and metabolomic association studies facilitated a comprehensive investigation of molecular features and shared pathways for cancers' development and progression.Methods:Comprehensive approaches consisting of transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS), proteome-wide association studies (PWAS), summary-data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR) and MR were performed to identify genes significantly associated with cancers. The results identified in above analyzes were subsequently involved in phenotype scanning and enrichment analyzes to explore the possible health effects and shared pathways. Additionally, we also conducted MR analysis to investigate metabolic pathways related to cancers.Results:Totally 24 genes (18 transcriptomic, 1 proteomic and 5 druggable genetic) showed significant associations with cancers risk. All genes identified in multiple methods were mainly enriched in nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) pathway. Additionally, biosynthesis of ubiquinol and urate were found to play an important role in gastrointestinal tumors.Conclusions:A set of putatively causal genes and pathways relevant to cancers were identified in this study, shedding light on the shared biological processes for tumorigenesis and providing compelling genetic evidence to prioritize anti-cancer drugs development.",38659038,PMC11040978,10.1186/s40246-024-00571-2,0,Human genomics,101202210,6.481,0.6694207787513733,0.023411371237458192,0.5484949832775919,0.516033738153834
CAS-viewer: web-based tool for splicing-guided integrative analysis of multi-omics cancer data,"Background:The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project is a public resource that provides transcriptomic, DNA sequence, methylation, and clinical data for 33 cancer types. Transforming the large size and high complexity of TCGA cancer genome data into integrated knowledge can be useful to promote cancer research. Alternative splicing (AS) is a key regulatory mechanism of genes in human cancer development and in the interaction with epigenetic factors. Therefore, AS-guided integration of existing TCGA data sets will make it easier to gain insight into the genetic architecture of cancer risk and related outcomes. There are already existing tools analyzing and visualizing alternative mRNA splicing patterns for large-scale RNA-seq experiments. However, these existing web-based tools are limited to the analysis of individual TCGA data sets at a time, such as only transcriptomic information.Results:We implemented CAS-viewer (integrative analysis of Cancer genome data based on Alternative Splicing), a web-based tool leveraging multi-cancer omics data from TCGA. It illustrates alternative mRNA splicing patterns along with methylation, miRNAs, and SNPs, and then provides an analysis tool to link differential transcript expression ratio to methylation, miRNA, and splicing regulatory elements for 33 cancer types. Moreover, one can analyze AS patterns with clinical data to identify potential transcripts associated with different survival outcome for each cancer.Conclusions:CAS-viewer is a web-based application for transcript isoform-driven integration of multi-omics data in multiple cancer types and will aid in the visualization and possible discovery of biomarkers for cancer by integrating multi-omics data from TCGA.",29697367,PMC5918456,10.1186/s12920-018-0348-8,7,BMC medical genomics,101319628,3.622,0.6632328629493713,0.6287625418060201,0.1605351170568562,0.5557992495421981
Multi-omics enrichment analysis using the GeneTrail2 web service,"Motivation:Gene set analysis has revolutionized the interpretation of high-throughput transcriptomic data. Nowadays, with comprehensive studies that measure multiple -omics from the same sample, powerful tools for the integrative analysis of multi-omics datasets are required.Results:Here, we present GeneTrail2, a web service allowing the integrated analysis of transcriptomic, miRNomic, genomic and proteomic datasets. It offers multiple statistical tests, a large number of predefined reference sets, as well as a comprehensive collection of biological categories and enables direct comparisons between the computed results. We used GeneTrail2 to explore pathogenic mechanisms of Wilms tumors. We not only succeeded in revealing signaling cascades that may contribute to the malignancy of blastemal subtype tumors but also identified potential biomarkers for nephroblastoma with adverse prognosis. The presented use-case demonstrates that GeneTrail2 is well equipped for the integrative analysis of comprehensive -omics data and may help to shed light on complex pathogenic mechanisms in cancer and other diseases.Availability and implementation:GeneTrail2 can be freely accessed under https://genetrail2.bioinf.uni-sb.deContact:: dstoeckel@bioinf.uni-sb.deSupplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",26787660,,10.1093/bioinformatics/btv770,85,"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",9808944,6.931,0.659624457359314,0.959866220735786,0.5986622073578596,0.7074803600343176
A probabilistic multi-omics data matching method for detecting sample errors in integrative analysis,"Background:Data errors, including sample swapping and mis-labeling, are inevitable in the process of large-scale omics data generation. Data errors need to be identified and corrected before integrative data analyses where different types of data are merged on the basis of the annotated labels. Data with labeling errors dampen true biological signals. More importantly, data analysis with sample errors could lead to wrong scientific conclusions. We developed a robust probabilistic multi-omics data matching procedure, proMODMatcher, to curate data and identify and correct data annotation and errors in large databases.Results:Application to simulated datasets suggests that proMODMatcher achieved robust statistical power even when the number of cis-associations was small and/or the number of samples was large. Application of our proMODMatcher to multi-omics datasets in The Cancer Genome Atlas and International Cancer Genome Consortium identified sample errors in multiple cancer datasets. Our procedure was not only able to identify sample-labeling errors but also to unambiguously identify the source of the errors. Our results demonstrate that these errors should be identified and corrected before integrative analysis.Conclusions:Our results indicate that sample-labeling errors were common in large multi-omics datasets. These errors should be corrected before integrative analysis.",31289834,PMC6615984,10.1093/gigascience/giz080,4,GigaScience,101596872,7.658,0.6591858267784119,0.44481605351170567,0.7290969899665551,0.6302941047626993
Sliced inverse regression for integrative multi-omics data analysis,"Advancement in next-generation sequencing, transcriptomics, proteomics and other high-throughput technologies has enabled simultaneous measurement of multiple types of genomic data for cancer samples. These data together may reveal new biological insights as compared to analyzing one single genome type data. This study proposes a novel use of supervised dimension reduction method, called sliced inverse regression, to multi-omics data analysis to improve prediction over a single data type analysis. The study further proposes an integrative sliced inverse regression method (integrative SIR) for simultaneous analysis of multiple omics data types of cancer samples, including MiRNA, MRNA and proteomics, to achieve integrative dimension reduction and to further improve prediction performance. Numerical results show that integrative analysis of multi-omics data is beneficial as compared to single data source analysis, and more importantly, that supervised dimension reduction methods possess advantages in integrative data analysis in terms of classification and prediction as compared to unsupervised dimension reduction methods.",30685747,,10.1515/sagmb-2018-0028,1,Statistical applications in genetics and molecular biology,101176023,0.676,0.6584175229072571,0.21070234113712374,0.06354515050167224,0.4499000120721135
A comprehensive survey of the approaches for pathway analysis using multi-omics data integration,"Pathway analysis has been widely used to detect pathways and functions associated with complex disease phenotypes. The proliferation of this approach is due to better interpretability of its results and its higher statistical power compared with the gene-level statistics. A plethora of pathway analysis methods that utilize multi-omics setup, rather than just transcriptomics or proteomics, have recently been developed to discover novel pathways and biomarkers. Since multi-omics gives multiple views into the same problem, different approaches are employed in aggregating these views into a comprehensive biological context. As a result, a variety of novel hypotheses regarding disease ideation and treatment targets can be formulated. In this article, we review 32 such pathway analysis methods developed for multi-omics and multi-cohort data. We discuss their availability and implementation, assumptions, supported omics types and databases, pathway analysis techniques and integration strategies. A comprehensive assessment of each method's practicality, and a thorough discussion of the strengths and drawbacks of each technique will be provided.

"Framework for the Integration of Genomics, Epigenomics and Transcriptomics in Complex Diseases","Objectives:Different types of '-omics' data are becoming available in the post-genome era; still a single -omics assessment provides limited insights to understand the biological mechanism of complex diseases. Genomics, epigenomics and transcriptomics data provide insight into the molecular dysregulation of neoplastic diseases, among them urothelial bladder cancer (UBC). Here, we propose a detailed analytical framework necessary to achieve an adequate integration of the three sets of -omics data to ultimately identify previously hidden genetic mechanisms in UBC.Methods:We built a multi-staged framework to study possible pair-wise combinations and integrated the data in three-way relationships. SNP genotypes, CpG methylation levels and gene expression levels were determined for a total of 70 individuals with UBC and with fresh tumour tissue available.Results:We suggest two main hypothesis-based scenarios for gene regulation based on the -omics integration analysis, where DNA methylation affects gene expression and genetic variants co-regulate gene expression and DNA methylation. We identified several three-way trans-association 'hotspots' that are found at the molecular level and that deserve further studies.Conclusions:The proposed integrative framework allowed us to identify relationships at the whole-genome level providing some new biological insights and highlighting the importance of integrating -omics data.",26201698,,10.1159/000381184,9,Human heredity,200525,1.455,0.6501341462135315,0.7023411371237458,0.07357859531772576,0.5452644342164132
Integrated multi-omics analysis reveals the molecular interplay between circadian clocks and cancer pathogenesis,"Circadian rhythms (CRs) are fundamental biological processes that significantly impact human well-being. Disruption of these rhythms can trigger insufficient neurocognitive development, insomnia, mental disorders, cardiovascular diseases, metabolic dysfunctions, and cancer. The field of chronobiology has increased our understanding of how rhythm disturbances contribute to cancer pathogenesis, and how circadian timing influences the efficacy of cancer treatments. As the circadian clock steadily gains recognition as an emerging factor in tumorigenesis, a thorough and comprehensive multi-omics analysis of CR genes/proteins has never been performed. To shed light on this, we performed, for the first time, an integrated data analysis encompassing genomic/transcriptomic alterations across 32 cancer types (n = 10,918 tumors) taken from the PanCancer Atlas, unfavorable prognostic protein analysis, protein-protein interactomics, and shortest distance score pathways to cancer hallmark phenotypes. This data mining strategy allowed us to unravel 31 essential CR-related proteins involved in the signaling crossroad between circadian rhythms and cancer. In the context of drugging the clock, we identified pharmacogenomic clinical annotations and drugs currently in late phase clinical trials that could be considered as potential cancer therapeutic strategies. These findings highlight the diverse roles of CR-related genes/proteins in the realm of cancer research and therapy.",37648722,PMC10469199,10.1038/s41598-023-39401-1,4,Scientific reports,101563288,4.996,0.6494675278663635,0.44816053511705684,0.3879598662207358,0.5569045969873767
"Integrative multi-omics analysis of genomic, epigenomic, and metabolomics data leads to new insights for Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder","The evolving field of multi-omics combines data and provides methods for simultaneous analysis across several omics levels. Here, we integrated genomics (transmitted and non-transmitted polygenic scores [PGSs]), epigenomics, and metabolomics data in a multi-omics framework to identify biomarkers for Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and investigated the connections among the three omics levels. We first trained single- and next multi-omics models to differentiate between cases and controls in 596 twins (cases = 14.8%) from the Netherlands Twin Register (NTR) demonstrating reasonable in-sample prediction through cross-validation. The multi-omics model selected 30 PGSs, 143 CpGs, and 90 metabolites. We confirmed previous associations of ADHD with glucocorticoid exposure and the transmembrane protein family TMEM, show that the DNA methylation of the MAD1L1 gene associated with ADHD has a relation with parental smoking behavior, and present novel findings including associations between indirect genetic effects and CpGs of the STAP2 gene. However, out-of-sample prediction in NTR participants (N = 258, cases = 14.3%) and in a clinical sample (N = 145, cases = 51%) did not perform well (range misclassification was [0.40, 0.57]). The results highlighted connections between omics levels, with the strongest connections between non-transmitted PGSs, CpGs, and amino acid levels and show that multi-omics designs considering interrelated omics levels can help unravel the complex biology underlying ADHD.",37534875,,10.1002/ajmg.b.32955,5,"American journal of medical genetics.

"Multi-omic data integration and analysis using systems genomics approaches: methods and applications in animal production, health and welfare","In the past years, there has been a remarkable development of high-throughput omics (HTO) technologies such as genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics across all facets of biology. This has spearheaded the progress of the systems biology era, including applications on animal production and health traits. However, notwithstanding these new HTO technologies, there remains an emerging challenge in data analysis. On the one hand, different HTO technologies judged on their own merit are appropriate for the identification of disease-causing genes, biomarkers for prevention and drug targets for the treatment of diseases and for individualized genomic predictions of performance or disease risks. On the other hand, integration of multi-omic data and joint modelling and analyses are very powerful and accurate to understand the systems biology of healthy and sustainable production of animals. We present an overview of current and emerging HTO technologies each with a focus on their applications in animal and veterinary sciences before introducing an integrative systems genomics framework for analysing and integrating multi-omic data towards improved animal production, health and welfare. We conclude that there are big challenges in multi-omic data integration, modelling and systems-level analyses, particularly with the fast emerging HTO technologies. We highlight existing and emerging systems genomics approaches and discuss how they contribute to our understanding of the biology of complex traits or diseases and holistic improvement of production performance, disease resistance and welfare.",27130220,PMC4850674,10.1186/s12711-016-0217-x,68,"Genetics, selection, evolution : GSE",9114088,5.1,0.6452316641807556,0.9464882943143813,0.42474916387959866,0.6613864901472494
Multi-modal meta-analysis of cancer cell line omics profiles identifies ECHDC1 as a novel breast tumor suppressor,"Molecular and functional profiling of cancer cell lines is subject to laboratory-specific experimental practices and data analysis protocols. The current challenge therefore is how to make an integrated use of the omics profiles of cancer cell lines for reliable biological discoveries. Here, we carried out a systematic analysis of nine types of data modalities using meta-analysis of 53 omics studies across 12 research laboratories for 2,018 cell lines. To account for a relatively low consistency observed for certain data modalities, we developed a robust data integration approach that identifies reproducible signals shared among multiple data modalities and studies. We demonstrated the power of the integrative analyses by identifying a novel driver gene, ECHDC1, with tumor suppressive role validated both in breast cancer cells and patient tumors. The multi-modal meta-analysis approach also identified synthetic lethal partners of cancer drivers, including a co-dependency of PTEN deficient endometrial cancer cells on RNA helicases.",33750001,PMC7983037,10.15252/msb.20209526,5,Molecular systems biology,101235389,13.068,0.6407482624053955,0.5518394648829431,0.8193979933110368,0.6586964490820333
Evaluation of integrative clustering methods for the analysis of multi-omics data,"Recent advances in sequencing, mass spectrometry and cytometry technologies have enabled researchers to collect large-scale omics data from the same set of biological samples. The joint analysis of multiple omics offers the opportunity to uncover coordinated cellular processes acting across different omic layers. In this work, we present a thorough comparison of a selection of recent integrative clustering approaches, including Bayesian (BCC and MDI) and matrix factorization approaches (iCluster, moCluster, JIVE and iNMF). Based on simulations, the methods were evaluated on their sensitivity and their ability to recover both the correct number of clusters and the simulated clustering at the common and data-specific levels. Standard non-integrative approaches were also included to quantify the added value of integrative methods. For most matrix factorization methods and one Bayesian approach (BCC), the shared and specific structures were successfully recovered with high and moderate accuracy, respectively. An opposite behavior was observed on non-integrative approaches, i.e. high performances on specific structures only. Finally, we applied the methods on the Cancer Genome Atlas breast cancer data set to check whether results based on experimental data were consistent with those obtained in the simulations.",31220206,,10.1093/bib/bbz015,27,Briefings in bioinformatics,100912837,13.994,0.6391732096672058,0.8762541806020067,0.842809364548495,0.7273166348304237
A Bayesian integrative approach for multi-platform genomic data: A kidney cancer case study,"Integration of genomic data from multiple platforms has the capability to increase precision, accuracy, and statistical power in the identification of prognostic biomarkers. A fundamental problem faced in many multi-platform studies is unbalanced sample sizes due to the inability to obtain measurements from all the platforms for all the patients in the study. We have developed a novel Bayesian approach that integrates multi-regression models to identify a small set of biomarkers that can accurately predict time-to-event outcomes. This method fully exploits the amount of available information across platforms and does not exclude any of the subjects from the analysis. Through simulations, we demonstrate the utility of our method and compare its performance to that of methods that do not borrow information across regression models.

MOGSA: Integrative Single Sample Gene-set Analysis of Multiple Omics Data,"Gene-set analysis (GSA) summarizes individual molecular measurements to more interpretable pathways or gene-sets and has become an indispensable step in the interpretation of large-scale omics data. However, GSA methods are limited to the analysis of single omics data. Here, we introduce a new computation method termed multi-omics gene-set analysis (MOGSA), a multivariate single sample gene-set analysis method that integrates multiple experimental and molecular data types measured over the same set of samples. The method learns a low dimensional representation of most variant correlated features (genes, proteins, etc.) across multiple omics data sets, transforms the features onto the same scale and calculates an integrated gene-set score from the most informative features in each data type. MOGSA does not require filtering data to the intersection of features (gene IDs), therefore, all molecular features, including those that lack annotation may be included in the analysis. Using simulated data, we demonstrate that integrating multiple diverse sources of molecular data increases the power to discover subtle changes in gene-sets and may reduce the impact of unreliable information in any single data type. Using real experimental data, we demonstrate three use-cases of MOGSA. First, we show how to remove a source of noise (technical or biological) in integrative MOGSA of NCI60 transcriptome and proteome data. Second, we apply MOGSA to discover similarities and differences in mRNA, protein and phosphorylation profiles of a small study of stem cell lines and assess the influence of each data type or feature on the total gene-set score. Finally, we apply MOGSA to cluster analysis and show that three molecular subtypes are robustly discovered when copy number variation and mRNA data of 308 bladder cancers from The Cancer Genome Atlas are integrated using MOGSA.

wMKL: multi-omics data integration enables novel cancer subtype identification via weight-boosted multi-kernel learning,"Background:Cancer is a heterogeneous disease driven by complex molecular alterations. Cancer subtypes determined from multi-omics data can provide novel insight into personalised precision treatment. It is recognised that incorporating prior weight knowledge into multi-omics data integration can improve disease subtyping.Methods:We develop a weighted method, termed weight-boosted Multi-Kernel Learning (wMKL) which incorporates heterogeneous data types as well as flexible weight functions, to boost subtype identification. Given a series of weight functions, we propose an omnibus combination strategy to integrate different weight-related P-values to improve subtyping precision.Results:wMKL models each data type with multiple kernel choices, thus alleviating the sensitivity and robustness issue due to selecting kernel parameters. Furthermore, wMKL integrates different data types by learning weights of different kernels derived from each data type, recognising the heterogeneous contribution of different data types to the final subtyping performance. The proposed wMKL outperforms existing weighted and non-weighted methods. The utility and advantage of wMKL are illustrated through extensive simulations and applications to two TCGA datasets. Novel subtypes are identified followed by extensive downstream bioinformatics analysis to understand the molecular mechanisms differentiating different subtypes.Conclusions:The proposed wMKL method provides a novel strategy for disease subtyping.

The promise of multi-omics and clinical data integration to identify and target personalized healthcare approaches in autism spectrum disorders,"Complex diseases are caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, creating a difficult challenge for diagnosis and defining subtypes. This review article describes how distinct disease subtypes can be identified through integration and analysis of clinical and multi-omics data. A broad shift toward molecular subtyping of disease using genetic and omics data has yielded successful results in cancer and other complex diseases. To determine molecular subtypes, patients are first classified by applying clustering methods to different types of omics data, then these results are integrated with clinical data to characterize distinct disease subtypes. An example of this molecular-data-first approach is in research on Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), a spectrum of social communication disorders marked by tremendous etiological and phenotypic heterogeneity. In the case of ASD, omics data such as exome sequences and gene and protein expression data are combined with clinical data such as psychometric testing and imaging to enable subtype identification. Novel ASD subtypes have been proposed, such as CHD8, using this molecular subtyping approach. Broader use of molecular subtyping in complex disease research is impeded by data heterogeneity, diversity of standards, and ineffective analysis tools. The future of molecular subtyping for ASD and other complex diseases calls for an integrated resource to identify disease mechanisms, classify new patients, and inform effective treatment options. This in turn will empower and accelerate precision medicine and personalized healthcare.",25831060,PMC4389910,10.1089/omi.2015.0020,31,Omics : a journal of integrative biology,101131135,3.978,0.6332968473434448,0.8996655518394648,0.23076923076923078,0.6060650649278061
Identification of candidate cancer drivers by integrative Epi-DNA and Gene Expression (iEDGE) data analysis,"The emergence of large-scale multi-omics data warrants method development for data integration. Genomic studies from cancer patients have identified epigenetic and genetic regulators - such as methylation marks, somatic mutations, and somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs), among others - as predictive features of cancer outcome. However, identification of ""driver genes"" associated with a given alteration remains a challenge. To this end, we developed a computational tool, iEDGE, to model cis and trans effects of (epi-)DNA alterations and identify potential cis driver genes, where cis and trans genes denote those genes falling within and outside the genomic boundaries of a given (epi-)genetic alteration, respectively. iEDGE first identifies the cis and trans gene expression signatures associated with the presence/absence of a particular epi-DNA alteration across samples. It then applies tests of statistical mediation to determine the cis genes predictive of the trans gene expression. Finally, cis and trans effects are annotated by pathway enrichment analysis to gain insights into the underlying regulatory networks. We used iEDGE to perform integrative analysis of SCNAs and gene expression data from breast cancer and 18 additional cancer types included in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Notably, cis gene drivers identified by iEDGE were found to be significantly enriched for known driver genes from multiple compendia of validated oncogenes and tumor suppressors, suggesting that the remainder are of equal importance. Furthermore, predicted drivers were enriched for functionally relevant cancer genes with amplification-driven dependencies, which are of potential prognostic and therapeutic value. All the analyses results are accessible at https://montilab.bu.edu/iEDGE. In summary, integrative analysis of SCNAs and gene expression using iEDGE successfully identified known cancer driver genes and putative cancer therapeutic targets across 19 cancer types in the TCGA.

Identification of seven-gene marker to predict the survival of patients with lung adenocarcinoma using integrated multi-omics data analysis,"Background:The mechanism of cancer occurrence and development could be understood with multi-omics data analysis. Discovering genetic markers is highly necessary for predicting clinical outcome of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD).Methods:Clinical follow-up information, copy number variation (CNV) data, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), and RNA-Seq were acquired from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). To obtain robust biomarkers, prognostic-related genes, genes with SNP variation, and copy number differential genes in the training set were selected and further subjected to feature selection using random forests. Finally, a gene-based prediction model for LUAD was validated in validation datasets.Results:The study filtered 2071 prognostic-related genes and 230 genomic variants, 1878 copy deletions, and 438 significant mutations. 218 candidate genes were screened through integrating genomic variation genes and prognosis-related genes. 7 characteristic genes (RHOV, CSMD3, FBN2, MAGEL2, SMIM4, BCKDHB, and GANC) were identified by random forest feature selection, and many genes were found to be tumor progression-related. A 7-gene signature constructed by Cox regression analysis was an independent prognostic factor for LUAD patients, and at the same time a risk factor in the test set, external validation set, and training set. Noticeably, the 5-year AUC of survival in the validation set and training set was all Ë 0.67. Similar results were obtained from multi-omics validation datasets.Conclusions:The study builds a novel 7-gene signature as a prognostic marker for the survival prediction of patients with LUAD. The current findings provided a set of new prognostic and diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets.",34951053,PMC8841135,10.1002/jcla.24190,6,Journal of clinical laboratory analysis,8801384,3.124,0.6306849718093872,0.6120401337792643,0.11036789297658862,0.522892588436803
Sparse overlapping group lasso for integrative multi-omics analysis,"Gene networks and graphs are crucial tools for understanding a heterogeneous system of cancer, since cancer is a disease that does not involve individual genes but combinations of genes associated with oncogenic process. A goal of genomic data analysis via gene networks is to identify both gene networks and individual genes within the selected networks. Existing methods, however, perform only network selection, and thus all genes in selected networks are included in models. This leads to overfitting when uncovering driver genes, and the results are not biologically interpretable. To accomplish both ""groupwise sparsity"" and ""within group sparsity"" for identifying driver genes based on biological knowledge (i.e., predefined overlapping groups of features), we propose a sparse overlapping group lasso via duplicated predictors in extended space. The proposed method effectively identifies driver genes and their interactions using known biological pathway information. Monte Carlo simulations and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project data analysis indicate that the proposed method is effective for fitting a regression model (i.e., feature selection and prediction accuracy) constructed with duplicated predictors in overlapping groups. In the TCGA data analysis, we uncover potential cancer driver genes via expression modules and gene networks constructed by multi-omics data and identify that the uncovered genes have strong evidences as a cancer driver gene. The proposed method is a useful tool for identifying cancer driver genes and for integrative multi-omics analysis.",25629319,,10.1089/cmb.2014.0197,5,Journal of computational biology : a journal of computational molecular cell,9433358,1.549,0.6296607851982117,0.5551839464882943,0.07692307692307693,0.5042178758012013
"Integrated multiomics analyses unveil the implication of a costimulatory molecule score on tumor aggressiveness and immune evasion in breast cancer: A large-scale study through over 8,000 patients","Background:Although immunotherapy has revolutionised cancer management, reliable genomic biomarkers for identifying eligible patient subpopulations are lacking. Costimulatory molecules play a crucial role in mounting anti-tumour responses, and clinical trials targeting these novel biomarkers are underway. However, whether these molecules can determine tumour aggressiveness and the risk of tumour evasion in breast cancer (BC) remains largely unknown.Methods:The whole-tissue transcriptomic data of 8236 patients with BC from 15 independent cohorts were extracted. An integrated scoring system named 'costimulatory molecule score' (CMS) was constructed and sufficient validated using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression (1000 iterations) and the random survival forest algorithm (1000 trees). The correlation among CMSs, cancer genotypes and clinicopathological characteristics was examined. Extensive multiomics and immunogenomic analyses were performed to investigate and verify the association among CMSs, enriched pathways, potential intrinsic and extrinsic immune escape mechanisms, immunotherapy response and therapeutic options.Results:The predictive role of CMS model that relies on expression pattern of merely 5 costimulatory genes for prognosis is almost universally applicable to BC patients in a platform-independent manner. Through internal and external in silico validation, high CMS was characterized by favorable genotypes but decreased tumor immunogenicity, activation of stroma, immune-suppressive states and potential immunotherapeutic resistance. Similar results were observed in a real-world immunotherapy cohort and Pan-Cancer analysis.Conclusion:This comprehensive characterization indicates CMS model may be complemented for predicting tumor aggressiveness and immune evasion in BC patients, underlining the future clinical potential for further exploration of resistance mechanisms and optimization of immunotherapeutic strategies.",37068318,,10.1016/j.compbiomed.2023.106866,0,Computers in biology and medicine,1250250,6.698,0.6285214424133301,0.030100334448160536,0.568561872909699,0.4968453069195699
Capturing the latent space of an Autoencoder for multi-omics integration and cancer subtyping,"Background and objective:The motivation behind cancer subtyping is to identify subgroups of cancer patients with distinguishable phenotypes of clinical importance. It can assist in advancement of subtype-targeted based treatments. Subtype identification is a complicated task, therefore requires multi-omics data integration to identify the precise patients' subgroup. Over the years, several computational attempts have been made to identify the cancer subtypes accurately using integrative multi-omics analysis. Some studies have used Autoencoders (AE) to capture multi-omics feature integration in lower dimensions for identifying subtypes in specific types of cancer. However, capturing the highly informative latent space by learning the deep architectures of AE to attain a satisfactory generalized performance is required. Therefore, in this study, a novel AE-assisted cancer subtyping framework is presented that utilizes the compressed latent space of a Sparse AE neural network for multi-omics clustering.Methods:The proposed framework first performs a supervised feature selection based on the survival status of the patients. The selected features from each of the omic data are passed to the AE. The information embedded in the latent space of the trained AE neural networks are then used for cancer subtyping using Spectral clustering. The AE architecture designed in this study exhaustively searches the best compression for multi-omics data by varying the number of neurons in the hidden layers and penalizing activations within the layers.Results and conclusion:The proposed framework is applied to five different multi-omics cancer datasets taken from The Cancer Genome Atlas. It is observed that for getting a robust information bottleneck, a compression of 10-20% of the input features along with an L1 regularization penalty of 0.01 or 0.001 performs well for most of the cancer datasets. Clustering performed on this latent representation generates clusters with better silhouette scores and significantly varying survival patterns. For further biological assessment, differential expression analysis is performed between the identified subtypes of Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), followed by enrichment analysis of the differentially expressed biomarkers. Several pathways and disease ontology terms coherent to GBM are found to be significantly associated. Varying responses of the identified GBM subtypes towards the drug Temozolomide is also tested to demonstrate its clinical importance. Hence, the study shows that AE-assisted multi-omics integration can be used for the prediction of clinically significant cancer subtypes.",35834966,,10.1016/j.compbiomed.2022.105832,3,Computers in biology and medicine,1250250,6.698,0.6273806691169739,0.3979933110367893,0.5719063545150501,0.5704083345805522
An unsupervised learning approach to identify novel signatures of health and disease from multimodal data,"Background:Modern medicine is rapidly moving towards a data-driven paradigm based on comprehensive multimodal health assessments. Integrated analysis of data from different modalities has the potential of uncovering novel biomarkers and disease signatures.Methods:We collected 1385 data features from diverse modalities, including metabolome, microbiome, genetics, and advanced imaging, from 1253 individuals and from a longitudinal validation cohort of 1083 individuals. We utilized a combination of unsupervised machine learning methods to identify multimodal biomarker signatures of health and disease risk.Results:Our method identified a set of cardiometabolic biomarkers that goes beyond standard clinical biomarkers. Stratification of individuals based on the signatures of these biomarkers identified distinct subsets of individuals with similar health statuses. Subset membership was a better predictor for diabetes than established clinical biomarkers such as glucose, insulin resistance, and body mass index. The novel biomarkers in the diabetes signature included 1-stearoyl-2-dihomo-linolenoyl-GPC and 1-(1-enyl-palmitoyl)-2-oleoyl-GPC. Another metabolite, cinnamoylglycine, was identified as a potential biomarker for both gut microbiome health and lean mass percentage. We identified potential early signatures for hypertension and a poor metabolic health outcome. Additionally, we found novel associations between a uremic toxin, p-cresol sulfate, and the abundance of the microbiome genera Intestinimonas and an unclassified genus in the Erysipelotrichaceae family.Conclusions:Our methodology and results demonstrate the potential of multimodal data integration, from the identification of novel biomarker signatures to a data-driven stratification of individuals into disease subtypes and stages-an essential step towards personalized, preventative health risk assessment.",31924279,PMC6953286,10.1186/s13073-019-0705-z,18,Genome medicine,101475844,15.266,0.6230328679084778,0.8193979933110368,0.8996655518394648,0.717632429775187
DRAMS: A tool to detect and re-align mixed-up samples for integrative studies of multi-omics data,"Studies of complex disorders benefit from integrative analyses of multiple omics data. Yet, sample mix-ups frequently occur in multi-omics studies, weakening statistical power and risking false findings. Accurately aligning sample information, genotype, and corresponding omics data is critical for integrative analyses. We developed DRAMS (https://github.com/Yi-Jiang/DRAMS) to Detect and Re-Align Mixed-up Samples to address the sample mix-up problem. It uses a logistic regression model followed by a modified topological sorting algorithm to identify the potential true IDs based on data relationships of multi-omics. According to tests using simulated data, the more types of omics data used or the smaller the proportion of mix-ups, the better that DRAMS performs. Applying DRAMS to real data from the PsychENCODE BrainGVEX project, we detected and corrected 201 (12.5% of total data generated) mix-ups. Of the 21 mix-ups involving errors of racial identity, DRAMS re-assigned all data to the correct racial group in the 1000 Genomes project. In doing so, quantitative trait loci (QTL) (FDR<0.01) increased by an average of 1.62-fold. The use of DRAMS in multi-omics studies will strengthen statistical power of the study and improve quality of the results. Even though very limited studies have multi-omics data in place, we expect such data will increase quickly with the needs of DRAMS.",32282793,PMC7179940,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007522,4,PLoS computational biology,101238922,4.779,0.6204491853713989,0.45484949832775917,0.34782608695652173,0.5328046282796957
Deep-Learning Algorithm and Concomitant Biomarker Identification for NSCLC Prediction Using Multi-Omics Data Integration,"Early diagnosis of lung cancer to increase the survival rate, which is currently at a low range of mid-30%, remains a critical need. Despite this, multi-omics data have rarely been applied to non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) diagnosis. We developed a multi-omics data-affinitive artificial intelligence algorithm based on the graph convolutional network that integrates mRNA expression, DNA methylation, and DNA sequencing data. This NSCLC prediction model achieved a 93.7% macro F1-score, indicating that values for false positives and negatives were substantially low, which is desirable for accurate classification. Gene ontology enrichment and pathway analysis of features revealed that two major subtypes of NSCLC, lung adenocarcinoma and lung squamous cell carcinoma, have both specific and common GO biological processes. Numerous biomarkers (i.e., microRNA, long non-coding RNA, differentially methylated regions) were newly identified, whereas some biomarkers were consistent with previous findings in NSCLC (e.g.,SPRR1B). Thus, using multi-omics data integration, we developed a promising cancer prediction algorithm.",36551266,PMC9775093,10.3390/biom12121839,5,Biomolecules,101596414,6.064,0.6198165416717529,0.5585284280936454,0.4916387959866221,0.5819233698191052
Integrative cross-omics and cross-context analysis elucidates molecular links underlying genetic effects on complex traits,"Genetic effects on functionally related 'omic' traits often co-occur in relevant cellular contexts, such as tissues. Motivated by the multi-tissue methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTLs) and expression QTLs (eQTLs) analysis, we propose X-ING (Cross-INtegrative Genomics) for cross-omics and cross-context integrative analysis. X-ING takes as input multiple matrices of association statistics, each obtained from different omics data types across multiple cellular contexts. It models the latent binary association status of each statistic, captures the major association patterns among omics data types and contexts, and outputs the posterior mean and probability for each input statistic. X-ING enables the integration of effects from different omics data with varying effect distributions. In the multi-tissue cis-association analysis, X-ING shows improved detection and replication of mQTLs by integrating eQTL maps. In the trans-association analysis, X-ING reveals an enrichment of trans-associations in many disease/trait-relevant tissues.",38493154,PMC10944527,10.1038/s41467-024-46675-0,0,Nature communications,101528555,17.694,0.6185500621795654,0.033444816053511704,0.9264214046822743,0.5631032814548964
Recursive integration of synergised graph representations of multi-omics data for cancer subtypes identification,"Cancer subtypes identification is one of the critical steps toward advancing personalized anti-cancerous therapies. Accumulation of a massive amount of multi-platform omics data measured across the same set of samples provides an opportunity to look into this deadly disease from several views simultaneously. Few integrative clustering approaches are developed to capture shared information from all the views to identify cancer subtypes. However, they have certain limitations. The challenge here is identifying the most relevant feature space from each omic view and systematically integrating them. Both the steps should lead toward a global clustering solution with biological significance. In this respect, a novel multi-omics clustering algorithm named RISynG (Recursive Integration of Synergised Graph-representations) is presented in this study. RISynG represents each omic view as two representation matrices that are Gramian and Laplacian. A parameterised combination function is defined to obtain a synergy matrix from these representation matrices. Then a recursive multi-kernel approach is applied to integrate the most relevant, shared, and complementary information captured via the respective synergy matrices. At last, clustering is applied to the integrated subspace. RISynG is benchmarked on five multi-omics cancer datasets taken from The Cancer Genome Atlas. The experimental results demonstrate RISynG's efficiency over the other approaches in this domain.",36115864,PMC9482647,10.1038/s41598-022-17585-2,1,Scientific reports,101563288,4.996,0.6130049228668213,0.2140468227424749,0.39464882943143814,0.4895420841548754
Bayesian integrative model for multi-omics data with missingness,"Motivation:Integrative analysis of multi-omics data from different high-throughput experimental platforms provides valuable insight into regulatory mechanisms associated with complex diseases, and gains statistical power to detect markers that are otherwise overlooked by single-platform omics analysis. In practice, a significant portion of samples may not be measured completely due to insufficient tissues or restricted budget (e.g. gene expression profile are measured but not methylation). Current multi-omics integrative methods require complete data. A common practice is to ignore samples with any missing platform and perform complete case analysis, which leads to substantial loss of statistical power.Methods:In this article, inspired by the popular Integrative Bayesian Analysis of Genomics data (iBAG), we propose a full Bayesian model that allows incorporation of samples with missing omics data.Results:Simulation results show improvement of the new full Bayesian approach in terms of outcome prediction accuracy and feature selection performance when sample size is limited and proportion of missingness is large. When sample size is large or the proportion of missingness is low, incorporating samples with missingness may introduce extra inference uncertainty and generate worse prediction and feature selection performance. To determine whether and how to incorporate samples with missingness, we propose a self-learning cross-validation (CV) decision scheme. Simulations and a real application on child asthma dataset demonstrate superior performance of the CV decision scheme when various types of missing mechanisms are evaluated.Availability and implementation:Freely available on the GitHub at https://github.com/CHPGenetics/FBM.Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",30184058,PMC6223369,10.1093/bioinformatics/bty775,12,"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",9808944,6.931,0.6125994324684143,0.745819397993311,0.6020066889632107,0.637124876872353
Attention-based GCN integrates multi-omics data for breast cancer subtype classification and patient-specific gene marker identification,"Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease and can be divided into several subtypes with unique prognostic and molecular characteristics. The classification of breast cancer subtypes plays an important role in the precision treatment and prognosis of breast cancer. Benefitting from the relation-aware ability of a graph convolution network (GCN), we present a multi-omics integrative method, the attention-based GCN (AGCN), for breast cancer molecular subtype classification using messenger RNA expression, copy number variation and deoxyribonucleic acid methylation multi-omics data. In the extensive comparative studies, our AGCN models outperform state-of-the-art methods under different experimental conditions and both attention mechanisms and the graph convolution subnetwork play an important role in accurate cancer subtype classification. The layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) algorithm is used for the interpretation of model decision, which can identify patient-specific important biomarkers that are reported to be related to the occurrence and development of breast cancer. Our results highlighted the effectiveness of the GCN and attention mechanisms in multi-omics integrative analysis and the implement of the LRP algorithm can provide biologically reasonable insights into model decision.",37114942,,10.1093/bfgp/elad013,1,Briefings in functional genomics,101528229,4.84,0.612193763256073,0.21739130434782608,0.3612040133779264,0.48303532149879425
Adaptive Sparse Multi-Block PLS Discriminant Analysis: An Integrative Method for Identifying Key Biomarkers from Multi-Omics Data,"With the growing use of high-throughput technologies, multi-omics data containing various types of high-dimensional omics data is increasingly being generated to explore the association between the molecular mechanism of the host and diseases. In this study, we present an adaptive sparse multi-block partial least square discriminant analysis (asmbPLS-DA), an extension of our previous work, asmbPLS. This integrative approach identifies the most relevant features across different types of omics data while discriminating multiple disease outcome groups. We used simulation data with various scenarios and a real dataset from the TCGA project to demonstrate that asmbPLS-DA can identify key biomarkers from each type of omics data with better biological relevance than existing competitive methods. Moreover, asmbPLS-DA showed comparable performance in the classification of subjects in terms of disease status or phenotypes using integrated multi-omics molecular profiles, especially when combined with other classification algorithms, such as linear discriminant analysis and random forest. We have made the R package calledasmbPLSthat implements this method publicly available on GitHub. Overall, asmbPLS-DA achieved competitive performance in terms of feature selection and classification. We believe that asmbPLS-DA can be a valuable tool for multi-omics research.",37239321,PMC10218045,10.3390/genes14050961,1,Genes,101551097,4.141,0.6119039058685303,0.22073578595317725,0.24414715719063546,0.4601189321498807
Integrative phenotyping framework (iPF): integrative clustering of multiple omics data identifies novel lung disease subphenotypes,"Background:The increased multi-omics information on carefully phenotyped patients in studies of complex diseases requires novel methods for data integration. Unlike continuous intensity measurements from most omics data sets, phenome data contain clinical variables that are binary, ordinal and categorical.Results:In this paper we introduce an integrative phenotyping framework (iPF) for disease subtype discovery. A feature topology plot was developed for effective dimension reduction and visualization of multi-omics data. The approach is free of model assumption and robust to data noises or missingness. We developed a workflow to integrate homogeneous patient clustering from different omics data in an agglomerative manner and then visualized heterogeneous clustering of pairwise omics sources. We applied the framework to two batches of lung samples obtained from patients diagnosed with chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) or interstitial lung disease (ILD) with well-characterized clinical (phenomic) data, mRNA and microRNA expression profiles. Application of iPF to the first training batch identified clusters of patients consisting of homogenous disease phenotypes as well as clusters with intermediate disease characteristics. Analysis of the second batch revealed a similar data structure, confirming the presence of intermediate clusters. Genes in the intermediate clusters were enriched with inflammatory and immune functional annotations, suggesting that they represent mechanistically distinct disease subphenotypes that may response to immunomodulatory therapies. The iPF software package and all source codes are publicly available.Conclusions:Identification of subclusters with distinct clinical and biomolecular characteristics suggests that integration of phenomic and other omics information could lead to identification of novel mechanism-based disease sub-phenotypes.",26560100,PMC4642618,10.1186/s12864-015-2170-4,46,BMC genomics,100965258,4.547,0.6119039058685303,0.9230769230769231,0.2842809364548495,0.6086139154274728
Topological integration of RPPA proteomic data with multi-omics data for survival prediction in breast cancer via pathway activity inference,"Background:The analysis of integrated multi-omics data enables the identification of disease-related biomarkers that cannot be identified from a single omics profile. Although protein-level data reflects the cellular status of cancer tissue more directly than gene-level data, past studies have mainly focused on multi-omics integration using gene-level data as opposed to protein-level data. However, the use of protein-level data (such as mass spectrometry) in multi-omics integration has some limitations. For example, the correlation between the characteristics of gene-level data (such as mRNA) and protein-level data is weak, and it is difficult to detect low-abundance signaling proteins that are used to target cancer. The reverse phase protein array (RPPA) is a highly sensitive antibody-based quantification method for signaling proteins. However, the number of protein features in RPPA data is extremely low compared to the number of gene features in gene-level data. In this study, we present a new method for integrating RPPA profiles with RNA-Seq and DNA methylation profiles for survival prediction based on the integrative directed random walk (iDRW) framework proposed in our previous study. In the iDRW framework, each omics profile is merged into a single pathway profile that reflects the topological information of the pathway. In order to address the sparsity of RPPA profiles, we employ the random walk with restart (RWR) approach on the pathway network.Results:Our model was validated using survival prediction analysis for a breast cancer dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Our proposed model exhibited improved performance compared with other methods that utilize pathway information and also out-performed models that did not include the RPPA data utilized in our study. The risk pathways identified for breast cancer in this study were closely related to well-known breast cancer risk pathways.Conclusions:Our results indicated that RPPA data is useful for survival prediction for breast cancer patients under our framework. We also observed that iDRW effectively integrates RNA-Seq, DNA methylation, and RPPA profiles, while variation in the composition of the omics data can affect both prediction performance and risk pathway identification. These results suggest that omics data composition is a critical parameter for iDRW.",31296204,PMC6624183,10.1186/s12920-019-0511-x,2,BMC medical genomics,101319628,3.622,0.6078377962112427,0.3110367892976589,0.16387959866220736,0.45968595531871886
Modeling and integration of N-glycan biomarkers in a comprehensive biomarker data model,"Molecular biomarkers measure discrete components of biological processes that can contribute to disorders when impaired. Great interest exists in discovering early cancer biomarkers to improve outcomes. Biomarkers represented in a standardized data model, integrated with multi-omics data, may improve the understanding and use of novel biomarkers such as glycans and glycoconjugates. Among altered components in tumorigenesis, N-glycans exhibit substantial biomarker potential, when analyzed with their protein carriers. However, such data are distributed across publications and databases of diverse formats, which hamper their use in research and clinical application. Mass spectrometry measures of 50 N-glycans on 7 serum proteins in liver disease were integrated (as a panel) into a cancer biomarker data model, providing a unique identifier, standard nomenclature, links to glycan resources, and accession and ontology annotations to standard protein, gene, disease, and biomarker information. Data provenance was documented with a standardized United States Food and Drug Administration-supported BioCompute Object. Using the biomarker data model allows the capture of granular information, such as glycans with different levels of abundance in cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and transplant groups. Such representation in a standardized data model harmonizes glycomics data in a unified framework, making glycan-protein biomarker data exploration more available to investigators and to other data resources. The biomarker data model we describe can be used by researchers to describe their novel glycan and glycoconjugate biomarkers; it can integrate N-glycan biomarker data with multi-source biomedical data and can foster discovery and insight within a unified data framework for glycan biomarker representation, thereby making the data FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) (https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/).",35925813,PMC9487899,10.1093/glycob/cwac046,2,Glycobiology,9104124,5.954,0.607313871383667,0.31438127090301005,0.4682274247491639,0.520910061960635
A survey on single and multi omics data mining methods in cancer data classification,"Data analytics is routinely used to support biomedical research in all areas, with particular focus on the most relevant clinical conditions, such as cancer. Bioinformatics approaches, in particular, have been used to characterize the molecular aspects of diseases. In recent years, numerous studies have been performed on cancer based upon single and multi-omics data. For example, Single-omics-based studies have employed a diverse set of data, such as gene expression, DNA methylation, or miRNA, to name only a few instances. Despite that, a significant part of literature reports studies on gene expression with microarray datasets. Single-omics data have high numbers of attributes and very low sample counts. This characteristic makes them paradigmatic of an under-sampled, small-n large-p machine learning problem. An important goal of single-omics data analysis is to find the most relevant genes, in terms of their potential use in clinics and research, in the batch of available data. This problem has been addressed in gene selection as one of the pre-processing steps in data mining. An analysis that use only one type of data (single-omics) often miss the complexity of the landscape of molecular phenomena underlying the disease. As a result, they provide limited and sometimes poorly reliable information about the disease mechanisms. Therefore, in recent years, researchers have been eager to build models that are more complex, obtaining more reliable results using multi-omics data. However, to achieve this, the most important challenge is data integration. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of the challenges in single and multi-omics data analysis of cancer data, focusing on gene selection and data integration methods.",32525020,,10.1016/j.jbi.2020.103466,5,Journal of biomedical informatics,100970413,8.0,0.6042822003364563,0.5618729096989966,0.745819397993311,0.6241077817403353
Multi-omics approaches for biomarker discovery in predicting the response of esophageal cancer to neoadjuvant therapy: A multidimensional perspective,"Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NCRT) followed by surgery has been established as the standard treatment strategy for operable locally advanced esophageal cancer (EC). However, achieving pathologic complete response (pCR) or near pCR to NCRT is significantly associated with a considerable improvement in survival outcomes, while pCR patients may help organ preservation for patients by active surveillance to avoid planned surgery. Thus, there is an urgent need for improved biomarkers to predict EC chemoradiation response in research and clinical settings. Advances in multiple high-throughput technologies such as next-generation sequencing have facilitated the discovery of novel predictive biomarkers, specifically based on multi-omics data, including genomic/transcriptomic sequencings and proteomic/metabolomic mass spectra. The application of multi-omics data has shown the benefits in improving the understanding of underlying mechanisms of NCRT sensitivity/resistance in EC. Particularly, the prominent development of artificial intelligence (AI) has introduced a new direction in cancer research. The integration of multi-omics data has significantly advanced our knowledge of the disease and enabled the identification of valuable biomarkers for predicting treatment response from diverse dimension levels, especially with rapid advances in biotechnological and AI methodologies. Herein, we summarize the current status of research on the use of multi-omics technologies in predicting NCRT response for EC patients. Current limitations, challenges, and future perspectives of these multi-omics platforms will be addressed to assist in experimental designs and clinical use for further integrated analysis.",38286161,,10.1016/j.pharmthera.2024.108591,0,Pharmacology & therapeutics,7905840,13.4,0.6036397814750671,0.03678929765886288,0.822742474916388,0.5340902234000905
A general framework for integrative analysis of incomplete multiomics data,"There is a tremendous current interest in measuring multiple types of omics features (e.g., DNA sequences, RNA expressions, methylation profiles, metabolic profiles, protein expressions) on a large number of subjects. Although genotypes are typically available for all study subjects, other data types may be measured only on a subset of subjects due to cost or other constraints. In addition, quantitative omics measurements, such as metabolite levels and protein expressions, are subject to detection limits in that the measurements below (or above) certain thresholds are not detectable. In this article, we propose a rigorous and powerful approach to handle missing values and detection limits in integrative analysis of multiomics data. We relate quantitative omics variables to genetic variants and other variables through linear regression models and relate phenotypes to quantitative omics variables and other variables through generalized linear models. We derive the joint-likelihood for the two sets of models by allowing arbitrary patterns of missing values and detection limits for quantitative omics variables. We carry out maximum-likelihood estimation through computationally fast and stable algorithms. The resulting estimators are approximately unbiased and statistically efficient.

"Big data, integrative omics and network biology","A cell integrates various signals through a network of biomolecules that crosstalk to synergistically regulate the replication, transcription, translation and other metabolic activities of a cell. These networks regulate signal perception and processing that drives biological functions. The biological complexity cannot be fully captured by a single -omics discipline. The holistic study of an organism-in health, perturbation, exposure to environment and disease, is studied under systems biology. The bottom-up molecular approaches (genes, mRNA, protein, metabolite, etc.) have laid the foundation of current biological knowledge covering the horizon from viruses, bacteria, fungi, plants and animals. Yet, these techniques provide a rather myopic view of biology at the molecular level. To understand how the interconnected molecular components are formed and rewired in disease or exposure to environmental stimuli is the holy grail of modern biology. The omics era was heralded by the genomics revolution but advanced sequencing techniques are now also ubiquitous in transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and lipidomics. Multi-omics data analysis and integration techniques are driving the quest for deeper insights into how the different layers of biomolecules talk to each other in diverse contexts.",34340766,,10.1016/bs.apcsb.2021.03.006,10,Advances in protein chemistry and structural biology,101497281,5.447,0.6032308340072632,0.7224080267558528,0.45819397993311034,0.5980589017421505
"Multiomics Analysis Reveals Novel Genetic Determinants for Lens Differentiation, Structure, and Transparency","Recent advances in next-generation sequencing and data analysis have provided new gateways for identification of novel genome-wide genetic determinants governing tissue development and disease. These advances have revolutionized our understanding of cellular differentiation, homeostasis, and specialized function in multiple tissues. Bioinformatic and functional analysis of these genetic determinants and the pathways they regulate have provided a novel basis for the design of functional experiments to answer a wide range of long-sought biological questions. A well-characterized model for the application of these emerging technologies is the development and differentiation of the ocular lens and how individual pathways regulate lens morphogenesis, gene expression, transparency, and refraction. Recent applications of next-generation sequencing analysis on well-characterized chicken and mouse lens differentiation models using a variety of omics techniques including RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS), chip-seq, and CUT&RUN have revealed a wide range of essential biological pathways and chromatin features governing lens structure and function. Multiomics integration of these data has established new gene functions and cellular processes essential for lens formation, homeostasis, and transparency including the identification of novel transcription control pathways, autophagy remodeling pathways, and signal transduction pathways, among others. This review summarizes recent omics technologies applied to the lens, methods for integrating multiomics data, and how these recent technologies have advanced our understanding ocular biology and function.

"Integrating Multi-Omics Data to Construct Reliable Interconnected Models of Signaling, Gene Regulatory, and Metabolic Pathways","Alteration of the status of the metabolic enzymes could be a probable way to regulate metabolic reprogramming, which is a critical cellular adaptation mechanism especially for cancer cells. Coordination among biological pathways, such as gene-regulatory, signaling, and metabolic pathways is crucial for regulating metabolic adaptation. Also, incorporation of resident microbial metabolic potential in human body can influence the interplay between the microbiome and the systemic or tissue metabolic environments. Systemic framework for model-based integration of multi-omics data can ultimately improve our understanding of metabolic reprogramming at holistic level. However, the interconnectivity and novel meta-pathway regulatory mechanisms are relatively lesser explored and understood. Hence, we propose a computational protocol that utilizes multi-omics data to identify probable cross-pathway regulatory and protein-protein interaction (PPI) links connecting signaling proteins or transcription factors or miRNAs to metabolic enzymes and their metabolites using network analysis and mathematical modeling. These cross-pathway links were shown to play important roles in metabolic reprogramming in cancer scenarios.",37074577,,10.1007/978-1-0716-3008-2_6,0,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,0.0,0.5984882116317749,0.04013377926421405,0.023411371237458192,0.3718019570793994
Identification of a 6-gene signature for the survival prediction of breast cancer patients based on integrated multi-omics data analysis,"Purpose:To identify a gene signature for the prognosis of breast cancer using high-throughput analysis.Methods:RNASeq, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), copy number variation (CNV) data and clinical follow-up information were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and randomly divided into training set or verification set. Genes related to breast cancer prognosis and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with CNV or SNP were screened from training set, then integrated together for feature selection of identify robust biomarkers using RandomForest. Finally, a gene-related prognostic model was established and its performance was verified in TCGA test set, Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) validation set and breast cancer subtypes.Results:A total of 2287 prognosis-related genes, 131 genes with amplified copy numbers, 724 gens with copy number deletions, and 280 genes with significant mutations screened from Genomic Variants were closely correlated with the development of breast cancer. A total of 120 candidate genes were obtained by integrating genes from Genomic Variants and those related to prognosis, then 6 characteristic genes (CD24, PRRG1, IQSEC3, MRGPRX, RCC2, and CASP8) were top-ranked by RandomForest for feature selection, noticeably, several of these have been previously reported to be associated with the progression of breast cancer. Cox regression analysis was performed to establish a 6-gene signature, which can stratify the risk of samples from training set, test set and external validation set, moreover, the five-year survival AUC of the model in the training set and validation set was both higher than 0.65. Thus, the 6-gene signature developed in the current study could serve as an independent prognostic factor for breast cancer patients.Conclusion:This study constructed a 6-gene signature as a novel prognostic marker for predicting the survival of breast cancer patients, providing new diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for breast cancer patients.",33170908,PMC7654770,10.1371/journal.pone.0241924,4,PloS one,101285081,3.752,0.5960805416107178,0.46488294314381273,0.1939799331103679,0.48942090021726675
Deep structure integrative representation of multi-omics data for cancer subtyping,"Motivation:Cancer is a heterogeneous group of diseases. Cancer subtyping is a crucial and critical step to diagnosis, prognosis and treatment. Since high-throughput sequencing technologies provide an unprecedented opportunity to rapidly collect multi-omics data for the same individuals, an urgent need in current is how to effectively represent and integrate these multi-omics data to achieve clinically meaningful cancer subtyping.Results:We propose a novel deep learning model, called Deep Structure Integrative Representation (DSIR), for cancer subtypes dentification by integrating representation and clustering multi-omics data. DSIR simultaneously captures the global structures in sparse subspace and local structures in manifold subspace from multi-omics data and constructs a consensus similarity matrix by utilizing deep neural networks. Extensive tests are performed in 12 different cancers on three levels of omics data from The Cancer Genome Atlas.

Knowledge boosting: a graph-based integration approach with multi-omics data and genomic knowledge for cancer clinical outcome prediction,"Objective:Cancer can involve gene dysregulation via multiple mechanisms, so no single level of genomic data fully elucidates tumor behavior due to the presence of numerous genomic variations within or between levels in a biological system. We have previously proposed a graph-based integration approach that combines multi-omics data including copy number alteration, methylation, miRNA, and gene expression data for predicting clinical outcome in cancer. However, genomic features likely interact with other genomic features in complex signaling or regulatory networks, since cancer is caused by alterations in pathways or complete processes.Methods:Here we propose a new graph-based framework for integrating multi-omics data and genomic knowledge to improve power in predicting clinical outcomes and elucidate interplay between different levels. To highlight the validity of our proposed framework, we used an ovarian cancer dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas for predicting stage, grade, and survival outcomes.Results:Integrating multi-omics data with genomic knowledge to construct pre-defined features resulted in higher performance in clinical outcome prediction and higher stability. For the grade outcome, the model with gene expression data produced an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.7866. However, models of the integration with pathway, Gene Ontology, chromosomal gene set, and motif gene set consistently outperformed the model with genomic data only, attaining AUCs of 0.7873, 0.8433, 0.8254, and 0.8179, respectively.Conclusions:Integrating multi-omics data and genomic knowledge to improve understanding of molecular pathogenesis and underlying biology in cancer should improve diagnostic and prognostic indicators and the effectiveness of therapies.",25002459,PMC4433357,10.1136/amiajnl-2013-002481,41,Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,9430800,7.942,0.5957277417182922,0.9130434782608695,0.7391304347826086,0.687871427639671
Nano-omics: nanotechnology-based multidimensional harvesting of the blood-circulating cancerome,"Over the past decade, the development of 'simple' blood tests that enable cancer screening, diagnosis or monitoring and facilitate the design of personalized therapies without the need for invasive tumour biopsy sampling has been a core ambition in cancer research. Data emerging from ongoing biomarker development efforts indicate that multiple markers, used individually or as part of a multimodal panel, are required to enhance the sensitivity and specificity of assays for early stage cancer detection. The discovery of cancer-associated molecular alterations that are reflected in blood at multiple dimensions (genome, epigenome, transcriptome, proteome and metabolome) and integration of the resultant multi-omics data have the potential to uncover novel biomarkers as well as to further elucidate the underlying molecular pathways.

iODA: An integrated tool for analysis of cancer pathway consistency from heterogeneous multi-omics data,"The latest advances in the next generation sequencing technology have greatly facilitated the extensive research of genomics and transcriptomics, thereby promoting the decoding of carcinogenesis with unprecedented resolution. Considering the contribution of analyzing high-throughput multi-omics data to the exploration of cancer molecular mechanisms, an integrated tool for heterogeneous multi-omics data analysis (iODA) is proposed for the systems-level interpretation of multi-omics data, i.e., transcriptomic profiles (mRNA or miRNA expression data) and protein-DNA interactions (ChIP-Seq data). Considering the data heterogeneity, iODA can compare six statistical algorithms in differential analysis for the selected sample data and assist users in choosing the globally optimal one for dysfunctional mRNA or miRNA identification. Since molecular signatures are more consistent at the pathway level than at the gene level, the tool is able to enrich the identified dysfunctional molecules onto the KEGG pathways and extracted the consistent items as key components for further pathogenesis investigation. Compared with other tools, iODA is multi-functional for the systematic analysis of different level of omics data, and its analytical power was demonstrated through case studies of single and cross-level prostate cancer omics data. iODA is open source under GNU GPL and can be downloaded from http://www.sysbio.org.cn/iODA.",33096244,,10.1016/j.jbi.2020.103605,4,Journal of biomedical informatics,100970413,8.0,0.5951396822929382,0.4682274247491639,0.7491638795986622,0.6005620702453282
TCGAplot: an R package for integrative pan-cancer analysis and visualization of TCGA multi-omics data,"Background:Pan-cancer analysis examines both the commonalities and heterogeneity among genomic and cellular alterations across numerous types of tumors. Pan-cancer analysis of gene expression, tumor mutational burden (TMB), microsatellite instability (MSI), and tumor immune microenvironment (TIME), and methylation becomes available based on the multi-omics data from The Cancer Genome Atlas Program (TCGA). Some online tools provide analysis of gene and protein expression, mutation, methylation, and survival for TCGA data. However, these online tools were either Uni-functional or were not able to perform analysis of user-defined functions. Therefore, we created the TCGAplot R package to facilitate perform pan-cancer analysis and visualization of the built-in multi-omic TCGA data.Results:TCGAplot provides several functions to perform pan-cancer paired/unpaired differential gene expression analysis, pan-cancer correlation analysis between gene expression and TMB, MSI, TIME, and promoter methylation. Functions for visualization include paired/unpaired boxplot, survival plot, ROC curve, heatmap, scatter, radar chart, and forest plot. Moreover, gene set based pan-cancer and tumor specific analyses were also available. Finally, all these built-in multi-omic data could be extracted for implementation for user-defined functions, making the pan-cancer analysis much more convenient.\ CONCLUSIONS: We developed an R-package for integrative pan-cancer analysis and visualization of TCGA multi-omics data.

A new high-throughput screening methodology for the discovery of cancer-testis antigen using multi-omics data,"Background:Cancer/testis antigens (CTAs), also known as tumor-specific antigens (TSAs) are specifically expressed in cancer cells and exhibit high immunogenicity, making them promising targets for immunotherapy and cancer vaccines.Methods:A new integrated high-throughput screening methodology for CTAs was proposed in this study through combining DNA methylation and RNA sequencing data. Briefly, the genes with increased transcript level and decreased DNA methylation were identified by multi-omics analysis. RNA sequencing studies in cell lines exposed to DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors were performed to validate the inherent causal relationship between DNA hypomethylation and gene expression upregulation.Results:We proposed a new integrated high-throughput screening methodology for identification of CTAs using multi-omics analysis. In addition, we tested the feasibility of this method using gastric cancer (GC) as an example. In GC, we identified over 2000 primary candidate CTAs and ultimately identified 20 CTAs with significant tissue-specificity, including a testis-specific serine protease TESSP1/PRSS41. Integrated analysis confirmed that PRSS41 expression was reactivated in gastrointestinal cancers by promoter DNA hypomethylation at the CpG site (cg08104780). Additionally, DNA hypomethylation of PRSS41 predicted a poor prognosis in GC.Conclusion:We propose a new high-throughput screening method for the identification of CTAs in cancer and validate its effectiveness. Our work emphasizes that serine protease PRSS41 is a novel TSA that is reactivated in GC due to promoter DNA hypomethylation.",38678957,,10.1016/j.cmpb.2024.108193,1,Computer methods and programs in biomedicine,8506513,7.027,0.5933147668838501,0.22408026755852842,0.6755852842809364,0.535921970498203
Novel secretome-to-transcriptome integrated or secreto-transcriptomic approach to reveal liquid biopsy biomarkers for predicting individualized prognosis of breast cancer patients,"Background:Presently, a 50-gene expression model (PAM50) serves as a breast cancer (BC) subtype classifier that is insufficient to distinguish, within each single PAM50-classified subtype, patient subpopulations having different prognosis. There is a pressing need for inexpensive and minimally invasive biomarker tests to easily and accurately predict individuals' clinical outcomes and response to treatments. Although quantitative proteomic approaches have been developed to identify/profile proteins secreted (secretome) from various cancer cell lines in vitro, missing are the clinicopathological relevance and the associated prognostic value of these secretomic identifications.Methods:To discover biomarkers to predict individualized prognosis we introduce a new multi-omics (secreto-transcriptomics) method that identifies, in their oncogenically secreted states, candidate markers of BC subtypes whose genes bear patient-specific mRNA expression alterations of prognostic significance. First, we used label-free quantitative (LFQ) proteomics to identify the proteins showing BC-subtypic secretion from a series of BC cell lines representing major BC-subtypes. To determine and externally validate the prognostic value of these secreted proteins, we developed a secreto-transcriptomic approach that discovered a PAM50-subtypic Secretion-Correlated mRNA Expression Pattern (SeCEP) wherein the PAM50-subtypic secretion of select proteins statistically correlated with cis-mRNA expression of their encoding genes in patients of the corresponding PAM50-subtypes. Kaplan-Meier analysis of SeCEP genes was used to identify new liquid biopsy biomarkers for predicting individualized prognosis.Results:The mRNA expression-to-secretion correlation (SeCEP) pinpointed multiple genes that are fully translated into the oncogenically active secretome in a PAM50-subtypic manner. Further, multiple SeCEP genes in distinct combinations or panels of multiple SeCEP genes were identified as 'systems prognostic markers' that showed mRNA co-overexpression patterns in the distinct subpopulations of PAM50-subtypic patients with poor prognosis or high-risk of relapse. Thus, our secreto-transcriptomic approach statistically linked BC subtypic secretome genes with patient-specific information about their mRNA expression alterations and significantly improved the sensitivity and specificity in patient stratification in the context of clinical outcomes or prognosis.Conclusions:By combining LFQ secretome screening with proteo-transcriptomic retrospective analysis of patient data our integrated multi-omics approach bypasses costly, tedious, genome-wide fishing and predictive modeling that are commonly required to distinguish a few prognostically altered genes from thousands of other non-BC related genes in a genome.",31146747,PMC6543675,10.1186/s12920-019-0530-7,8,BMC medical genomics,101319628,3.622,0.5927844643592834,0.6688963210702341,0.16722408026755853,0.5228947588831285

Robust pathway-based multi-omics data integration using directed random walks for survival prediction in multiple cancer studies,"Background:Integrating the rich information from multi-omics data has been a popular approach to survival prediction and bio-marker identification for several cancer studies. To facilitate the integrative analysis of multiple genomic profiles, several studies have suggested utilizing pathway information rather than using individual genomic profiles.Methods:We have recently proposed an integrative directed random walk-based method utilizing pathway information (iDRW) for more robust and effective genomic feature extraction. In this study, we applied iDRW to multiple genomic profiles for two different cancers, and designed a directed gene-gene graph which reflects the interaction between gene expression and copy number data. In the experiments, the performances of the iDRW method and four state-of-the-art pathway-based methods were compared using a survival prediction model which classifies samples into two survival groups.Results:The results show that the integrative analysis guided by pathway information not only improves prediction performance, but also provides better biological insights into the top pathways and genes prioritized by the model in both the neuroblastoma and the breast cancer datasets. The pathways and genes selected by the iDRW method were shown to be related to the corresponding cancers.Conclusions:In this study, we demonstrated the effectiveness of a directed random walk-based multi-omics data integration method applied to gene expression and copy number data for both breast cancer and neuroblastoma datasets. We revamped a directed gene-gene graph considering the impact of copy number variation on gene expression and redefined the weight initialization and gene-scoring method. The benchmark result for iDRW with four pathway-based methods demonstrated that the iDRW method improved survival prediction performance and jointly identified cancer-related pathways and genes for two different cancer datasets.Reviewers:This article was reviewed by Helena Molina-Abril and Marta Hidalgo.",31036036,PMC6489180,10.1186/s13062-019-0239-8,29,Biology direct,101258412,7.173,0.5882388353347778,0.8862876254180602,0.6923076923076923,0.6686623647460171
An integrated Bayesian framework for multi-omics prediction and classification,"With the growing commonality of multi-omics datasets, there is now increasing evidence that integrated omics profiles lead to more efficient discovery of clinically actionable biomarkers that enable better disease outcome prediction and patient stratification. Several methods exist to perform host phenotype prediction from cross-sectional, single-omics data modalities but decentralized frameworks that jointly analyze multiple time-dependent omics data to highlight the integrative and dynamic impact of repeatedly measured biomarkers are currently limited. In this article, we propose a novel Bayesian ensemble method to consolidate prediction by combining information across several longitudinal and cross-sectional omics data layers. Unlike existing frequentist paradigms, our approach enables uncertainty quantification in prediction as well as interval estimation for a variety of quantities of interest based on posterior summaries. We apply our method to four published multi-omics datasets and demonstrate that it recapitulates known biology in addition to providing novel insights while also outperforming existing methods in estimation, prediction, and uncertainty quantification.

Characterizing the Survival-Associated Interactions Between Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes and Tumors From Pathological Images and Multi-Omics Data,"The tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and its correlation with tumors have shown significant values in the development of cancers. Many observations indicated that the combination of the whole-slide pathological images (WSIs) and genomic data can better characterize the immunological mechanisms of TILs. However, the existing image-genomic studies evaluated the TILs by the combination of pathological image and single-type of omics data (e.g., mRNA), which is difficulty in assessing the underlying molecular processes of TILs holistically. Additionally, it is still very challenging to characterize the intersections between TILs and tumor regions in WSIs and the high dimensional genomic data also brings difficulty for the integrative analysis with WSIs. Based on the above considerations, we proposed an end-to-end deep learning framework i.e., IMO-TILs that can integrate pathological image with multi-omics data (i.e., mRNA and miRNA) to analyze TILs and explore the survival-associated interactions between TILs and tumors. Specifically, we firstly apply the graph attention network to describe the spatial interactions between TILs and tumor regions in WSIs. As to genomic data, the Concrete AutoEncoder (i.e., CAE) is adopted to select survival-associated Eigengenes from the high-dimensional multi-omics data. Finally, the deep generalized canonical correlation analysis (DGCCA) accompanied with the attention layer is implemented to fuse the image and multi-omics data for prognosis prediction of human cancers. The experimental results on three cancer cohorts derived from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) indicated that our method can both achieve higher prognosis results and identify consistent imaging and multi-omics bio-markers correlated strongly with the prognosis of human cancers.",37159321,,10.1109/TMI.2023.3274652,1,IEEE transactions on medical imaging,8310780,11.037,0.583025336265564,0.22742474916387959,0.8127090301003345,0.5578419576121811
PanDrugs2: prioritizing cancer therapies using integrated individual multi-omics data,"Genomics studies routinely confront researchers with long lists of tumor alterations detected in patients. Such lists are difficult to interpret since only a minority of the alterations are relevant biomarkers for diagnosis and for designing therapeutic strategies. PanDrugs is a methodology that facilitates the interpretation of tumor molecular alterations and guides the selection of personalized treatments. To do so, PanDrugs scores gene actionability and drug feasibility to provide a prioritized evidence-based list of drugs. Here, we introduce PanDrugs2, a major upgrade of PanDrugs that, in addition to somatic variant analysis, supports a new integrated multi-omics analysis which simultaneously combines somatic and germline variants, copy number variation and gene expression data. Moreover, PanDrugs2 now considers cancer genetic dependencies to extend tumor vulnerabilities providing therapeutic options for untargetable genes. Importantly, a novel intuitive report to support clinical decision-making is generated. PanDrugs database has been updated, integrating 23 primary sources that support >74K drug-gene associations obtained from 4642 genes and 14 659 unique compounds.

In 645 twins (cases = 42%), we trained single- and integrative multi-omics models to identify biomarkers for subclinical aggression and investigated the connections among these biomarkers. Our data comprised transmitted and two non-transmitted polygenic scores (PGSs) for 15 traits, 78,772 CpGs, and 90 metabolites. The single-omics models selected 31 PGSs, 1614 CpGs, and 90 metabolites, and the multi-omics model comprised 44 PGSs, 746 CpGs, and 90 metabolites. The predictive accuracy for these models in the test (N = 277, cases = 42%) and independent clinical data (N = 142, cases = 45%) ranged from 43 to 57%. We observed strong connections between DNA methylation, amino acids, and parental non-transmitted PGSs for ADHD, Autism Spectrum Disorder, intelligence, smoking initiation, and self-reported health. Aggression-related omics traits link to known and novel risk factors, including inflammation, carcinogens, and smoking.",36344863,PMC9922241,10.1007/s10519-022-10126-7,3,Behavior genetics,251711,2.965,0.5817189812660217,0.4013377926421405,0.10033444816053512,0.4493658369201482
"The diagnosis of inborn errors of metabolism by an integrative ""multi-omics"" approach: A perspective encompassing genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics","Given the rapidly decreasing cost and increasing speed and accessibility of massively parallel technologies, the integration of comprehensive genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data into a ""multi-omics"" diagnostic pipeline is within reach. Even though genomic analysis has the capability to reveal all possible perturbations in our genetic code, analysis typically reaches a diagnosis in just 35% of cases, with a diagnostic gap arising due to limitations in prioritization and interpretation of detected variants. Here we review the utility of complementing genetic data with transcriptomic data and give a perspective for the introduction of proteomics into the diagnostic pipeline. Together these methodologies enable comprehensive capture of the functional consequence of variants, unobtainable by the analysis of each methodology in isolation. This facilitates functional annotation and reprioritization of candidate genes and variants-a promising approach to shed light on the underlying molecular cause of a patient's disease, increasing diagnostic rate, and allowing actionability in clinical practice.",31119744,,10.1002/jimd.12130,24,Journal of inherited metabolic disease,7910918,4.75,0.5816001296043396,0.8528428093645485,0.3411371237458194,0.5877560643846774
Network medicine for patients' stratification: From single-layer to multi-omics,"Precision medicine research increasingly relies on the integrated analysis of multiple types of omics. In the era of big data, the large availability of different health-related information represents a great, but at the same time untapped, chance with a potentially fundamental role in the prevention, diagnosis and prognosis of diseases. Computational methods are needed to combine this data to create a comprehensive view of a given disease. Network science can model biomedical data in terms of relationships among molecular players of different nature and has been successfully proposed as a new paradigm for studying human diseases. Patient stratification is an open challenge aimed at identifying subtypes with different disease manifestations, severity, and expected survival time. Several stratification approaches based on high-throughput gene expression measurements have been successfully applied. However, few attempts have been proposed to exploit the integration of various genotypic and phenotypic data to discover novel sub-types or improve the detection of known groupings.

Molecular Biology Networks and Key Gene Regulators for Inflammatory Biomarkers Shared by Breast Cancer Development: Multi-Omics Systems Analysis,"As key inflammatory biomarkers C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL6) play an important role in the pathogenesis of non-inflammatory diseases, including specific cancers, such as breast cancer (BC). Previous genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have neither explained the large proportion of genetic heritability nor provided comprehensive understanding of the underlying regulatory mechanisms. We adopted an integrative genomic network approach by incorporating our previous GWAS data for CRP and IL6 with multi-omics datasets, such as whole-blood expression quantitative loci, molecular biologic pathways, and gene regulatory networks to capture the full range of genetic functionalities associated with CRP/IL6 and tissue-specific key drivers (KDs) in gene subnetworks. We applied another systematic genomics approach for BC development to detect shared gene sets in enriched subnetworks across BC and CRP/IL6. We detected the topmost significant common pathways across CRP/IL6 (e.g., immune regulatory; chemokines and their receptors; interferon Î³, JAK-STAT, and ERBB4 signaling), several of which overlapped with BC pathways. Further, in gene-gene interaction networks enriched by those topmost pathways, we identified KDs-both well-established (e.g., JAK1/2/3, STAT3) and novel (e.g., CXCR3, CD3D, CD3G, STAT6)-in a tissue-specific manner, for mechanisms shared in regulating CRP/IL6 and BC risk. Our study may provide robust, comprehensive insights into the mechanisms of CRP/IL6 regulation and highlight potential novel genetic targets as preventive and therapeutic strategies for associated disorders, such as BC.",34572592,PMC8469138,10.3390/biom11091379,2,Biomolecules,101596414,6.064,0.5789243578910828,0.3277591973244147,0.4983277591973244,0.5125720060389976
Randomized singular value decomposition for integrative subtype analysis of 'omics data' using non-negative matrix factorization,"Integration of multiple 'omics datasets for differentiating cancer subtypes is a powerful technic that leverages the consistent and complementary information across multi-omics data. Matrix factorization is a common technique used in integrative clustering for identifying latent subtype structure across multi-omics data. High dimensionality of the omics data and long computation time have been common challenges of clustering methods. In order to address the challenges, we propose randomized singular value decomposition (RSVD) for integrative clustering using Non-negative Matrix Factorization:intNMF-rsvd. The method utilizes RSVD to reduce the dimensionality by projecting the data into eigen vector space with user specified lower rank. Then, clustering analysis is carried out by estimating common basis matrix across the projected multi-omics datasets. The performance of the proposed method was assessed using the simulated datasets and compared with six state-of-the-art integrative clustering methods using real-life datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas Study.intNMF-rsvdwas found working efficiently and competitively as compared to standard intNMF and other multi-omics clustering methods. Most importantly,intNMF-rsvdcan handle large number of features and significantly reduce the computation time. The identified subtypes can be utilized for further clinical association studies to understand the etiology of the disease.",37937887,,10.1515/sagmb-2022-0047,0,Statistical applications in genetics and molecular biology,101176023,0.676,0.5774357914924622,0.046822742474916385,0.06688963210702341,0.3692039498118652
Cancer subtyping with heterogeneous multi-omics data via hierarchical multi-kernel learning,"Differentiating cancer subtypes is crucial to guide personalized treatment and improve the prognosis for patients. Integrating multi-omics data can offer a comprehensive landscape of cancer biological process and provide promising ways for cancer diagnosis and treatment. Taking the heterogeneity of different omics data types into account, we propose a hierarchical multi-kernel learning (hMKL) approach, a novel cancer molecular subtyping method to identify cancer subtypes by adopting a two-stage kernel learning strategy. In stage 1, we obtain a composite kernel borrowing the cancer integration via multi-kernel learning (CIMLR) idea by optimizing the kernel parameters for individual omics data type. In stage 2, we obtain a final fused kernel through a weighted linear combination of individual kernels learned from stage 1 using an unsupervised multiple kernel learning method. Based on the final fusion kernel, k-means clustering is applied to identify cancer subtypes. Simulation studies show that hMKL outperforms the one-stage CIMLR method when there is data heterogeneity. hMKL can estimate the number of clusters correctly, which is the key challenge in subtyping. Application to two real data sets shows that hMKL identified meaningful subtypes and key cancer-associated biomarkers. The proposed method provides a novel toolkit for heterogeneous multi-omics data integration and cancer subtypes identification.",36433785,,10.1093/bib/bbac488,2,Briefings in bioinformatics,100912837,13.994,0.5767803192138672,0.3311036789297659,0.8461538461538461,0.5815196965450428
MOBCdb: a comprehensive database integrating multi-omics data on breast cancer for precision medicine,"Background:Breast cancer is one of the most frequently diagnosed cancers among women worldwide, characterized by diverse biological heterogeneity. It is well known that complex and combined gene regulation of multi-omics is involved in the occurrence and development of breast cancer.Results:In this paper, we present the Multi-Omics Breast Cancer Database (MOBCdb), a simple and easily accessible repository that integrates genomic, transcriptomic, epigenomic, clinical, and drug response data of different subtypes of breast cancer. MOBCdb allows users to retrieve simple nucleotide variation (SNV), gene expression, microRNA expression, DNA methylation, and specific drug response data by various search fashions. The genome-wide browser /navigation facility in MOBCdb provides an interface for visualizing multi-omics data of multi-samples simultaneously. Furthermore, the survival module provides survival analysis for all or some of the samples by using data of three omics.

MODEC: an unsupervised clustering method integrating omics data for identifying cancer subtypes,"The identification of cancer subtypes can help researchers understand hidden genomic mechanisms, enhance diagnostic accuracy and improve clinical treatments. With the development of high-throughput techniques, researchers can access large amounts of data from multiple sources. Because of the high dimensionality and complexity of multiomics and clinical data, research into the integration of multiomics data is needed, and developing effective tools for such purposes remains a challenge for researchers. In this work, we proposed an entirely unsupervised clustering method without harnessing any prior knowledge (MODEC). We used manifold optimization and deep-learning techniques to integrate multiomics data for the identification of cancer subtypes and the analysis of significant clinical variables. Since there is nonlinearity in the gene-level datasets, we used manifold optimization methodology to extract essential information from the original omics data to obtain a low-dimensional latent subspace. Then, MODEC uses a deep learning-based clustering module to iteratively define cluster centroids and assign cluster labels to each sample by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence loss. MODEC was applied to six public cancer datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas database and outperformed eight competing methods in terms of the accuracy and reliability of the subtyping results. MODEC was extremely competitive in the identification of survival patterns and significant clinical features, which could help doctors monitor disease progression and provide more suitable treatment strategies.",36094092,,10.1093/bib/bbac372,3,Briefings in bioinformatics,100912837,13.994,0.5730811953544617,0.40468227424749165,0.8494983277591973,0.5946848376140148
A Bayesian framework for pathway-guided identification of cancer subgroups by integrating multiple types of genomic data,"In recent years, comprehensive cancer genomics platforms, such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), provide access to an enormous amount of high throughput genomic datasets for each patient, including gene expression, DNA copy number alterations, DNA methylation, and somatic mutation. While the integration of these multi-omics datasets has the potential to provide novel insights that can lead to personalized medicine, most existing approaches only focus on gene-level analysis and lack the ability to facilitate biological findings at the pathway-level. In this article, we propose Bayes-InGRiD (Bayesian Integrative Genomics Robust iDentification of cancer subgroups), a novel pathway-guided Bayesian sparse latent factor model for the simultaneous identification of cancer patient subgroups (clustering) and key molecular features (variable selection) within a unified framework, based on the joint analysis of continuous, binary, and count data. By utilizing pathway (gene set) information, Bayes-InGRiD does not only enhance the accuracy and robustness of cancer patient subgroup and key molecular feature identification, but also promotes biological understanding and interpretation. Finally, to facilitate an efficient posterior sampling, an alternative Gibbs sampler for logistic and negative binomial models is proposed using PÃ³lya-Gamma mixtures of normal to represent latent variables for binary and count data, which yields a conditionally Gaussian representation of the posterior. The R package ""INGRID"" implementing the proposed approach is currently available in our research group GitHub webpage (https://dongjunchung.github.io/INGRID/).",37715500,,10.1002/sim.9911,0,Statistics in medicine,8215016,2.497,0.5727227926254272,0.05016722408026756,0.09698996655518395,0.37306511370234663
Fast dimension reduction and integrative clustering of multi-omics data using low-rank approximation: application to cancer molecular classification,"Background:One major goal of large-scale cancer omics study is to identify molecular subtypes for more accurate cancer diagnoses and treatments. To deal with high-dimensional cancer multi-omics data, a promising strategy is to find an effective low-dimensional subspace of the original data and then cluster cancer samples in the reduced subspace. However, due to data-type diversity and big data volume, few methods can integrative and efficiently find the principal low-dimensional manifold of the high-dimensional cancer multi-omics data.Results:In this study, we proposed a novel low-rank approximation based integrative probabilistic model to fast find the shared principal subspace across multiple data types: the convexity of the low-rank regularized likelihood function of the probabilistic model ensures efficient and stable model fitting. Candidate molecular subtypes can be identified by unsupervised clustering hundreds of cancer samples in the reduced low-dimensional subspace. On testing datasets, our method LRAcluster (low-rank approximation based multi-omics data clustering) runs much faster with better clustering performances than the existing method. Then, we applied LRAcluster on large-scale cancer multi-omics data from TCGA. The pan-cancer analysis results show that the cancers of different tissue origins are generally grouped as independent clusters, except squamous-like carcinomas. While the single cancer type analysis suggests that the omics data have different subtyping abilities for different cancer types.Conclusions:LRAcluster is a very useful method for fast dimension reduction and unsupervised clustering of large-scale multi-omics data.

Analysis of cancer omics data: a selective review of statistical techniques,"Cancer is an omics disease. The development in high-throughput profiling has fundamentally changed cancer research and clinical practice. Compared with clinical, demographic and environmental data, the analysis of omics data-which has higher dimensionality, weaker signals and more complex distributional properties-is much more challenging. Developments in the literature are often 'scattered', with individual studies focused on one or a few closely related methods. The goal of this review is to assist cancer researchers with limited statistical expertise in establishing the 'overall framework' of cancer omics data analysis. To facilitate understanding, we mainly focus on intuition, concepts and key steps, and refer readers to the original publications for mathematical details. This review broadly covers unsupervised and supervised analysis, as well as individual-gene-based, gene-set-based and gene-network-based analysis. We also briefly discuss 'special topics' including interaction analysis, multi-datasets analysis and multi-omics analysis.",35039832,,10.1093/bib/bbab585,1,Briefings in bioinformatics,100912837,13.994,0.5698526501655579,0.23411371237458195,0.8528428093645485,0.5593028944471607
Integrated multi-omics data analyses for exploring the co-occurring and mutually exclusive gene alteration events in colorectal cancer,"Co-occurring and mutually exclusive gene alteration events are helpful for understanding carcinogenesis but systematic screening for such events is quite limited. We conducted pairwise screening tests to identify ""hit pairs"" in colorectal cancer (CRC) by utilizing the cross-omics data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Numerous hit pairs involving somatic mutations, copy number variations, and DNA methylation were found to occur nonrandomly in CRC, such as KRAS and HOXB6, SMAD4 and PMEPA1. Based on these hit pairs, we identified 32 synthetic lethal pairs and 7,527 co-occurring pairs relating to drug response. Our further biological experiments showed that the co-occurrence of mutant FCGBP and NUDT12 silencing (or mutant TMC3 and RPS6KA6 silencing) with small interfering RNA reduced cell viability. Moreover, novel hit pairs could influence prognosis. The patients who carried concurrent mutations of IRF5 and NEFH, SYNE1 and TTN, or MUC16 and NEFH had worse survival outcomes. Particularly, the presence of mutant SYNE1 and TTN pair not only affects prognosis, but also is related to CRC patients' response to drug treatment. Our ""hit pair"" genes may provide insights into colorectal carcinogenesis and help open new avenues for CRC therapy.",32485022,,10.1002/humu.24059,7,Human mutation,9215429,4.7,0.5693738460540771,0.6321070234113713,0.33444816053511706,0.5349353444217438
PIntMF: Penalized Integrative Matrix Factorization method for multi-omics data,"Motivation:It is more and more common to perform multi-omics analyses to explore the genome at diverse levels and not only at a single level. Through integrative statistical methods, multi-omics data have the power to reveal new biological processes, potential biomarkers and subgroups in a cohort. Matrix factorization (MF) is an unsupervised statistical method that allows a clustering of individuals, but also reveals relevant omics variables from the various blocks.Results:Here, we present PIntMF (Penalized Integrative Matrix Factorization), an MF model with sparsity, positivity and equality constraints. To induce sparsity in the model, we used a classical Lasso penalization on variable and individual matrices. For the matrix of samples, sparsity helps in the clustering, while normalization (matching an equality constraint) of inferred coefficients is added to improve interpretation. Moreover, we added an automatic tuning of the sparsity parameters using the famous glmnet package. We also proposed three criteria to help the user to choose the number of latent variables. PIntMF was compared with other state-of-the-art integrative methods including feature selection techniques in both synthetic and real data. PIntMF succeeds in finding relevant clusters as well as variables in two types of simulated data (correlated and uncorrelated). Next, PIntMF was applied to two real datasets (Diet and cancer), and it revealed interpretable clusters linked to available clinical data. Our method outperforms the existing ones on two criteria (clustering and variable selection). We show that PIntMF is an easy, fast and powerful tool to extract patterns and cluster samples from multi-omics data.Availability and implementation:An R package is available at https://github.com/mpierrejean/pintmf.Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",34849583,PMC8796362,10.1093/bioinformatics/btab786,5,"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",9808944,6.931,0.5687152743339539,0.5652173913043478,0.6086956521739131,0.5760117732960245
Multi-omics integration analysis unveils heterogeneity in breast cancer at the individual level,"Identifying robust breast cancer subtypes will help to reveal the cancer heterogeneity. However, previous breast cancer subtypes were based on population-level quantitative gene expression, which is affected by batch effects and cannot be applied to individuals. We detected differential gene expression, genomic, and epigenomic alterations to identify driver differential expression at the individual level. The individual driver differential expression reflected the breast cancer patients' heterogeneity and revealed four subtypes. Mesenchymal subtype as the most aggressive subtype harbored deletion and downregulated expression of genes in chromosome 11q23 region. Specifically, silencing of theSDHDgene in 11q23 promoted the invasion and migration of breast cancer cells in vitro by the epithelial-mesenchymal transition. The immunologically hot subtype displayed an immune-hot microenvironment, including high T-cell infiltration and upregulated PD-1 and CTLA4. Luminal and genomic-unstable subtypes showed opposite macrophage polarization, which may be regulated by the ligand-receptor pairs of CD99. The integration of multi-omics data at the individual level provides a powerful framework for elucidating the heterogeneity of breast cancer.",37974462,PMC10730166,10.1080/15384101.2023.2281816,0,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,5.173,0.5685356259346008,0.05351170568561873,0.43478260869565216,0.4387802384370147
Discovery of Bladder Cancer-related Genes Using Integrative Heterogeneous Network Modeling of Multi-omics Data,"In human health, a fundamental challenge is the identification of disease-related genes. Bladder cancer (BC) is a worldwide malignant tumor, which has resulted in 170,000 deaths in 2010 up from 114,000 in 1990. Moreover, with the emergence of multi-omics data, more comprehensive analysis of human diseases become possible. In this study, we propose a multi-step approach for the identification of BC-related genes by using integrative Heterogeneous Network Modeling of Multi-Omics data (iHNMMO). The heterogeneous network model properly and comprehensively reflects the multiple kinds of relationships between genes in the multi-omics data of BC, including general relationships, unique relationships under BC condition, correlational relationships within each omics and regulatory relationships between different omics. Besides, a network-based propagation algorithm with resistance is utilized to quantize the relationships between genes and BC precisely. The results of comprehensive performance evaluation suggest that iHNMMO significantly outperforms other approaches. Moreover, further analysis suggests that the top ranked genes may be functionally implicated in BC, which also confirms the superiority of iHNMMO. In summary, this study shows that disease-related genes can be better identified through reasonable integration of multi-omics data.",29142286,PMC5688092,10.1038/s41598-017-15890-9,7,Scientific reports,101563288,4.996,0.566917896270752,0.6354515050167224,0.3979933110367893,0.5468397009731535
MRGCN: cancer subtyping with multi-reconstruction graph convolutional network using full and partial multi-omics dataset,"Motivation:Cancer is a molecular complex and heterogeneous disease. Each type of cancer is usually composed of several subtypes with different treatment responses and clinical outcomes. Therefore, subtyping is a crucial step in cancer diagnosis and therapy. The rapid advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies provide an increasing amount of multi-omics data, which benefits our understanding of cancer genetic architecture, and yet poses new challenges in multi-omics data integration.Results:We propose a graph convolutional network model, called MRGCN for multi-omics data integrative representation. MRGCN simultaneously encodes and reconstructs multiple omics expression and similarity relationships into a shared latent embedding space. In addition, MRGCN adopts an indicator matrix to denote the situation of missing values in partial omics, so that the full and partial multi-omics processing procedures are combined in a unified framework.

Integrating multi-omics data through deep learning for accurate cancer prognosis prediction,"Background:Genomic information is nowadays widely used for precise cancer treatments. Since the individual type of omics data only represents a single view that suffers from data noise and bias, multiple types of omics data are required for accurate cancer prognosis prediction. However, it is challenging to effectively integrate multi-omics data due to the large number of redundant variables but relatively small sample size. With the recent progress in deep learning techniques, Autoencoder was used to integrate multi-omics data for extracting representative features. Nevertheless, the generated model is fragile from data noises. Additionally, previous studies usually focused on individual cancer types without making comprehensive tests on pan-cancer. Here, we employed the denoising Autoencoder to get a robust representation of the multi-omics data, and then used the learned representative features to estimate patients' risks.Results:By applying to 15 cancers from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), our method was shown to improve the C-index values over previous methods by 6.5% on average. Considering the difficulty to obtain multi-omics data in practice, we further used only mRNA data to fit the estimated risks by training XGboost models, and found the models could achieve an average C-index value of 0.627. As a case study, the breast cancer prognosis prediction model was independently tested on three datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), and shown able to significantly separate high-risk patients from low-risk ones (C-index>0.6, p-values<0.05). Based on the risk subgroups divided by our method, we identified nine prognostic markers highly associated with breast cancer, among which seven genes have been proved by literature review.Conclusion:Our comprehensive tests indicated that we have constructed an accurate and robust framework to integrate multi-omics data for cancer prognosis prediction.

However, identifying the modules of driver genetic alterations and characterizing their functional mechanisms are still major challenges for cancer studies. Here, we developed an integrative multi-omics method CMDD to identify the driver modules and their affecting dysregulated genes through characterizing genetic alteration-induced dysregulated networks. Applied to glioblastoma (GBM), the CMDD identified a core gene module of 17 genes, including seven known GBM drivers, and their dysregulated genes. The module showed significant association with shorter survival of GBM. When classifying driver genes in the module into two gene sets according to their genetic alteration patterns, we found that one gene set directly participated in the glioma pathway, while the other indirectly regulated the glioma pathway, mostly, via their dysregulated genes. Both of the two gene sets were significant contributors to survival and helpful for classifying GBM subtypes, suggesting their critical roles in GBM pathogenesis. Also, by applying the CMDD to other six cancers, we identified some novel core modules associated with overall survival of patients. Together, these results demonstrate integrative multi-omics data can identify driver modules and uncover their dysregulated genes, which is useful for interpreting cancer genome.",25653168,PMC4344511,10.1093/nar/gkv074,21,Nucleic acids research,411011,19.16,0.56391841173172,0.842809364548495,0.9498327759197325,0.6968794751326775
PathwayPCA: an R/Bioconductor Package for Pathway Based Integrative Analysis of Multi-Omics Data,"The authors present pathwayPCA, an R/Bioconductor package for integrative pathway analysis that utilizes modern statistical methodology, including supervised and adaptive, elastic-net, sparse principal component analysis. pathwayPCA can be applied to continuous, binary, and survival outcomes in studies with multiple covariates and/or interaction effects. It outperforms several alternative methods at identifying disease-associated pathways in integrative analysis using both simulated and real datasets. In addition, several case studies are provided to illustrate pathwayPCA analysis with gene selection, estimating, and visualizing sample-specific pathway activities, identifying sex-specific pathway effects in kidney cancer, and building integrative models for predicting patient prognosis. pathwayPCA is an open-source R package, freely available through the Bioconductor repository. pathwayPCA is expected to be a useful tool for empowering the wider scientific community to analyze and interpret the wealth of available proteomics data, along with other types of molecular data recently made available by Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium and other large consortiums.",32430990,PMC7677175,10.1002/pmic.201900409,7,Proteomics,101092707,5.393,0.5613651275634766,0.6387959866220736,0.451505016722408,0.5548792772069823
A powerful framework for an integrative study with heterogeneous omics data: from univariate statistics to multi-block analysis,"High-throughput data generated by new biotechnologies require specific and adapted statistical treatment in order to be efficiently used in biological studies. In this article, we propose a powerful framework to manage and analyse multi-omics heterogeneous data to carry out an integrative analysis. We have illustrated this using the mixOmics package for R software as it specifically addresses data integration issues. Our work also aims at applying the most recent functionalities of mixOmics to real datasets. Although multi-block integrative methodologies exist, we hope to encourage a more widespread use of such approaches in an operational framework by biologists. We have used natural populations of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana in this work, but the framework proposed is not limited to this plant and can be deployed whatever the organisms of interest and the biological question may be. Four omics datasets (phenomics, metabolomics, cell wall proteomics and transcriptomics) were collected, analysed and integrated to study the cell wall plasticity of plants exposed to sub-optimal temperature growth conditions. The methodologies presented here start from basic univariate statistics leading to multi-block integration analysis. We have also highlighted the fact that each method, either unsupervised or supervised, is associated with one biological issue. Using this powerful framework enabled us to arrive at novel conclusions on the biological system, which would not have been possible using standard statistical approaches.",32778869,,10.1093/bib/bbaa166,8,Briefings in bioinformatics,100912837,13.994,0.5601022839546204,0.6755852842809364,0.8561872909698997,0.6424158854229394
Integrated analysis of multi-omics data reveals T cell exhaustion in sepsis,"Background:Sepsis is a heterogeneous disease, therefore the single-gene-based biomarker is not sufficient to fully understand the disease. Higher-level biomarkers need to be explored to identify important pathways related to sepsis and evaluate their clinical significance.Methods:Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was used to analyze the sepsis transcriptome to obtain the pathway-level expression. Limma was used to identify differentially expressed pathways. Tumor IMmune Estimation Resource (TIMER) was applied to estimate immune cell abundance. The Spearman correlation coefficient was used to find the relationships between pathways and immune cell abundance. Methylation and single-cell transcriptome data were also employed to identify important pathway genes. Log-rank test was performed to test the prognostic significance of pathways for patient survival probability. DSigDB was used to mine candidate drugs based on pathways. PyMol was used for 3-D structure visualization. LigPlot was used to plot the 2-D pose view for receptor-ligand interaction.Results:Eighty-four KEGG pathways were differentially expressed in sepsis patients compared to healthy controls. Of those, 10 pathways were associated with 28-day survival. Some pathways were significantly correlated with immune cell abundance and five pathways could be used to distinguish between systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), bacterial sepsis, and viral sepsis with Area Under the Curve (AUC) above 0.80. Seven related drugs were screened using survival-related pathways.Conclusion:Sepsis-related pathways can be utilized for disease subtyping, diagnosis, prognosis, and drug screening.",37077915,PMC10108839,10.3389/fimmu.2023.1110070,4,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,8.786,0.5588687658309937,0.47157190635451507,0.7725752508361204,0.5841506909367233
Multi-omics data integration and drug screening of AML cancer using Generative Adversarial Network,"In the era of precision medicine, accurate disease phenotype prediction for heterogeneous diseases, such as cancer, is emerging due to advanced technologies that link genotypes and phenotypes. However, it is difficult to integrate different types of biological data because they are so varied. In this study, we focused on predicting the traits of a blood cancer called Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) by combining different kinds of biological data. We used a recently developed method called Omics Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to better classify cancer outcomes. The primary advantages of a GAN include its ability to create synthetic data that is nearly indistinguishable from real data, its high flexibility, and its wide range of applications, including multi-omics data analysis. In addition, the GAN was effective at combining two types of biological data. We created synthetic datasets for gene activity and DNA methylation. Our method was more accurate in predicting disease traits than using the original data alone. The experimental results provided evidence that the creation of synthetic data through interacting multi-omics data analysis using GANs improves the overall prediction quality. Furthermore, we identified the top-ranked significant genes through statistical methods and pinpointed potential candidate drug agents through in-silico studies. The proposed drugs, also supported by other independent studies, might play a crucial role in the treatment of AML cancer.

Computational Analysis of Phosphoproteomics Data in Multi-Omics Cancer Studies,"Multiple types of molecular data for the same set of clinical samples are increasingly available and may be analyzed jointly in an integrative analysis to maximize comprehensive biological insight. This analysis is important as separate analyses of individual omics data types usually do not fully explain disease phenotypes. An increasing number of studies have now been focusing on multi-omics data integration, yet not many studies have included phosphoproteomics data, an important layer for understanding signaling pathways. Multi-omics integration methods with phosphoproteomics data are reviewed in the context of cancer research as well as multi-omics methods papers that would be promising to apply to phosphoproteomics data. Analysis of individual data types is still the major approach even in large cohort proteogenomics studies. Hence, a section is dedicated on possible integrative methods for multi-omics and phosphoproteomics data. In summary, this review provides the readers with both currently used integrative methods previously applied to phosphoproteomics and multi-omics data integration and other algorithms for multi-omics data integration promising for future application to phosphoproteomics data.",32875713,,10.1002/pmic.201900312,7,Proteomics,101092707,5.393,0.5565201044082642,0.6421404682274248,0.45484949832775917,0.5533100559559954
Perspectives of using Cloud computing in integrative analysis of multi-omics data,"Integrative analysis of multi-omics data is usually computationally demanding. It frequently requires building complex, multi-step analysis pipelines, applying dedicated techniques for data processing and combining several data sources. These efforts lead to a better understanding of life processes, current health state or the effects of therapeutic activities. However, many omics data analysis solutions focus only on a selected problem, disease, types of data or organisms. Moreover, they are implemented for general-purpose scientific computational platforms that most often do not easily scale the calculations natively. These features are not conducive to advances in understanding genotype-phenotypic relationships. Fortunately, with new technological paradigms, including Cloud computing, virtualization and containerization, these functionalities could be orchestrated for easy scaling and building independent analysis pipelines for omics data. Therefore, solutions can be re-used for purposes that they were not primarily designed. This paper shows perspectives of using Cloud computing advances and containerization approach for such a purpose. We first review how the Cloud computing model is utilized in multi-omics data analysis and show weak points of the adopted solutions. Then, we introduce containerization concepts, which allow both scaling and linking of functional services designed for various purposes. Finally, on the Bioconductor software package example, we disclose a verified concept model of a universal solution that exhibits the potentials for performing integrative analysis of multiple omics data sources.",33676373,,10.1093/bfgp/elab007,1,Briefings in functional genomics,101528229,4.84,0.5543196797370911,0.23745819397993312,0.36454849498327757,0.4529931456348968
Metabolic and signalling network maps integration: application to cross-talk studies and omics data analysis in cancer,"Background:The interplay between metabolic processes and signalling pathways remains poorly understood. Global, detailed and comprehensive reconstructions of human metabolism and signalling pathways exist in the form of molecular maps, but they have never been integrated together. We aim at filling in this gap by integrating of both signalling and metabolic pathways allowing a visual exploration of multi-level omics data and study of cross-regulatory circuits between these processes in health and in disease.Results:We combined two comprehensive manually curated network maps. Atlas of Cancer Signalling Network (ACSN), containing mechanisms frequently implicated in cancer; and ReconMap 2.0, a comprehensive reconstruction of human metabolic network. We linked ACSN and ReconMap 2.0 maps via common players and represented the two maps as interconnected layers using the NaviCell platform for maps exploration ( https://navicell.curie.fr/pages/maps_ReconMap%202.html ). In addition, proteins catalysing metabolic reactions in ReconMap 2.0 were not previously visually represented on the map canvas. This precluded visualisation of omics data in the context of ReconMap 2.0. We suggested a solution for displaying protein nodes on the ReconMap 2.0 map in the vicinity of the corresponding reaction or process nodes. This permits multi-omics data visualisation in the context of both map layers. Exploration and shuttling between the two map layers is possible using Google Maps-like features of NaviCell. The integrated networks ACSN-ReconMap 2.0 are accessible online and allows data visualisation through various modes such as markers, heat maps, bar-plots, glyphs and map staining. The integrated networks were applied for comparison of immunoreactive and proliferative ovarian cancer subtypes using transcriptomic, copy number and mutation multi-omics data. A certain number of metabolic and signalling processes specifically deregulated in each of the ovarian cancer sub-types were identified.Conclusions:As knowledge evolves and new omics data becomes more heterogeneous, gathering together existing domains of biology under common platforms is essential. We believe that an integrated ACSN-ReconMap 2.0 networks will help in understanding various disease mechanisms and discovery of new interactions at the intersection of cell signalling and metabolism. In addition, the successful integration of metabolic and signalling networks allows broader systems biology approach application for data interpretation and retrieval of intervention points to tackle simultaneously the key players coordinating signalling and metabolism in human diseases.",30999838,PMC6471697,10.1186/s12859-019-2682-z,7,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,3.307,0.5521473288536072,0.6454849498327759,0.13377926421404682,0.4871412401215288
Multi-omics data fusion using adaptive GTO guided Non-negative matrix factorization for cancer subtype discovery,"Background and objective:Cancer subtype discovery is essential for personalized clinical treatment. With the onset of progressive profile techniques for cancer, a large amount of heterogeneous and high-dimensional transcriptomic, proteomic and genomic datasets are easily accumulated. Integrative clustering of such multi-omics data is crucial to recognize their latent structure and to acknowledge the correlation within and across them. Although the integrative analysis of diversified multi-omics data is informative, it is challenging when multiplicity in data inflicts poor accordance w.r.t. clustering structure. The objective of this work is to develop an effective integrative analysis framework that encapsulates the heterogeneity of various biological mechanisms and predicts homogeneous subgroups of cancer patients.Method:In this paper, improved sparse-joint non-negative matrix factorization (sparse-jNMF) has been devised for the problem of cancer-subtype discovery. The initial points of sparse-jNMF have improved using a novel meta-heuristic algorithm adaptive gorilla troops optimizer (Ada-GTO). Improving the initialization of sparse-jNMF enhances its convergence behavior and further strengthens the clustering performance. In addition, the consensus clustering approach has been adopted to construct a patient-patient similarity matrix for obtaining stable clusters of patient samples.Result:The proposed framework has been applied to 4 different real-life multi-omics cancer datasets, namely colon adenocarcinoma, breast-invasive carcinoma, kidney-renal clear-cell carcinoma, and lung adenocarcinoma. The proposed method results in patient clusters with better silhouette scores and cluster purity than classical initialization and similar meta-heuristics for initial point estimation approaches. Survival probabilities estimated using Kaplan-Meier (KM) curve show statistically significant difference (p < 0.05) for the homogenous cancer patient clusters obtained using the proposed method as compared to iCluster. The presented approach further identified the somatic mutations for the classified subgroups, which is beneficial to provide targeted treatments.Conclusion:This paper proposes Ada-GTO guided sparse-jNMF framework for cancer subtype discovery, considering the information from multiple omic features that provide comprehension. The proposed meta-guided framework outperforms all other state-of-the-art counterparts. It also has great potential for obtaining the homogeneous subgroups of other diseases.",36434961,,10.1016/j.cmpb.2022.107246,0,Computer methods and programs in biomedicine,8506513,7.027,0.5519359707832336,0.06020066889632107,0.6789297658862876,0.47898766942646187
Interactive gene identification for cancer subtyping based on multi-omics clustering,"Recent advances in multi-omics databases offer the opportunity to explore complex systems of cancers across hierarchical biological levels. Some methods have been proposed to identify the genes that play a vital role in disease development by integrating multi-omics. However, the existing methods identify the related genes separately, neglecting the gene interactions that are related to the multigenic disease. In this study, we develop a learning framework to identify the interactive genes based on multi-omics data including gene expression. Firstly, we integrate different omics based on their similarities and apply spectral clustering for cancer subtype identification. Then, a gene co-expression network is construct for each cancer subtype. Finally, we detect the interactive genes in the co-expression network by learning the dense subgraphs based on the L1prosperities of eigenvectors in the modularity matrix. We apply the proposed learning framework on a multi-omics cancer dataset to identify the interactive genes for each cancer subtype. The detected genes are examined by DAVID and KEGG tools for systematic gene ontology enrichment analysis. The analysis results show that the detected genes have relationships to cancer development and the genes in different cancer subtypes are related to different biological processes and pathways, which are expected to yield important references for understanding tumor heterogeneity and improving patient survival.",36804215,,10.1016/j.ymeth.2023.02.005,0,"Methods (San Diego, Calif.)",9426302,4.647,0.5519359707832336,0.06354515050167224,0.3210702341137124,0.4080846593930171
Integration of Multi-omics Data for Expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTL) Analysis and eQTL Epistasis,"Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) mapping studies identify genetic loci that regulate gene expression. eQTL mapping studies can capture gene regulatory interactions and provide insight into the genetic mechanism of biological systems. Recently, the integration of multi-omics data, such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), copy number variations (CNVs), DNA methylation, and gene expression, plays an important role in elucidating complex biological systems, since biological systems involve a sequence of complex interactions between various biological processes. This chapter introduces multi-omics data that have been used in many eQTL studies and integrative methodologies that incorporate multi-omics data for eQTL studies. Furthermore, we describe a statistical approach that can detect nonlinear causal relationships between eQTLs, called eQTL epistasis, and its importance.",31849014,,10.1007/978-1-0716-0026-9_11,0,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,0.0,0.5505469441413879,0.06688963210702341,0.030100334448160536,0.3497261597958695
"Integrated multi-omics analysis of genomics, epigenomics, and transcriptomics in ovarian carcinoma","In this study, we identified prognostic biomarkers in ovarian carcinoma by integrating multi-omics DNA copy number variation (CNV) and methylation variation (MET) data. CNV, MET, and messenger RNA (mRNA) expression were examined in 351 ovarian carcinoma patients. Genes for which expression was correlated with DNA copy-number or DNA methylation were identified; three ovarian carcinoma gene subtypes were defined based on these correlations. Overall survival and B cell scores were lower, while the macrophage cell score was higher, in the DNA imprinting centre 1 (iC1) subtype than in the iC2 and iC3 subtypes. Comparison of CNV, MET, and mRNA expression among the subtypes identified two genes, ubiquitin B (UBB) and interleukin 18 binding protein (IL18BP), that were associated with prognosis. Mutation spectrum results based on subtype indicated that UBB and IL18BP expression may be influenced by mutation loci. Mutation levels were higher in iC1 samples than in iC2 or iC3 samples, indicating that the iC1 subtype is associated with disease progression. This integrated multi-omics analysis of genomics, epigenomics, and transcriptomics provides new insight into the molecular mechanisms of ovarian carcinoma and may help identify biomolecular markers for early disease diagnosis.",31257224,PMC6629004,10.18632/aging.102047,12,Aging,101508617,5.955,0.5437113642692566,0.7491638795986622,0.47157190635451507,0.5703739757521894
'Multi-omic' data analysis using O-miner,"Innovations in -omics technologies have driven advances in biomedical research. However, integrating and analysing the large volumes of data generated from different high-throughput -omics technologies remain a significant challenge to basic and clinical scientists without bioinformatics skills or access to bioinformatics support. To address this demand, we have significantly updated our previous O-miner analytical suite, to incorporate several new features and data types to provide an efficient and easy-to-use Web tool for the automated analysis of data from '-omics' technologies. Created from a biologist's perspective, this tool allows for the automated analysis of large and complex transcriptomic, genomic and methylomic data sets, together with biological/clinical information, to identify significantly altered pathways and prioritize novel biomarkers/targets for biological validation. Our resource can be used to analyse both in-house data and the huge amount of publicly available information from array and sequencing platforms.

Diagnosis and treatment of cancer using genomics,"The field of cancer diagnostics is in constant flux as a result of the rapid discovery of new genes associated with cancer, improvements in laboratory techniques for identifying disease causing events, and novel analytic methods that enable the integration of many different types of data. These advances have helped in the identification of novel, informative biomarkers. As more whole genome sequence data are generated and analyzed, emerging information on the baseline variability of the human genome has shown the importance of the ancestral genomic background in patients with a potential disease causing variant. The recent discovery of many novel DNA sequence variants, advances in sequencing and genomic technology, and improved analytic methods enable the impact of germline and somatic genome variation on tumorigenesis and metastasis to be determined.

Cancer Subtype Discovery Based on Integrative Model of Multigenomic Data,"One major goal of large-scale cancer omics study is to understand molecular mechanisms of cancer and find new biomedical targets. To deal with the high-dimensional multidimensional cancer omics data (DNA methylation, mRNA expression, etc.), which can be used to discover new insight on identifying cancer subtypes, clustering methods are usually used to find an effective low-dimensional subspace of the original data and then cluster cancer samples in the reduced subspace. However, due to data-type diversity and big data volume, few methods can integrate these data and map them into an effective low-dimensional subspace. In this paper, we develop a dimension-reduction and data-integration method for indentifying cancer subtypes, named Scluster. First, Scluster, respectively, projects the different original data into the principal subspaces by an adaptive sparse reduced-rank regression method. Then, a fused patient-by-patient network is obtained for these subgroups through a scaled exponential similarity kernel method. Finally, candidate cancer subtypes are identified using spectral clustering method. We demonstrate the efficiency of our Scluster method using three cancers by jointly analyzing mRNA expression, miRNA expression, and DNA methylation data. The evaluation results and analyses show that Scluster is effective for predicting survival and identifies novel cancer subtypes of large-scale multi-omics data.",28113782,,10.1109/TCBB.2016.2621769,14,IEEE/ACM transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics,101196755,3.702,0.5415300726890564,0.782608695652174,0.17725752508361203,0.516891287760591

Cancer Target Gene Screening: a web application for breast cancer target gene screening using multi-omics data analysis,"Breast cancer comprises several molecular subtypes with distinct clinical features and treatment responses, and a substantial portion of each subtype remains incurable. A comprehensive analysis of multi-omics data and clinical profiles is required in order to better understand the biological complexity of this cancer type and to identify new prognostic and therapeutic markers. Thus, there arises a need for useful analytical tools to assist in the investigation and clinical management of the disease. We developed Cancer Target Gene Screening (CTGS), a web application that provides rapid and user-friendly analysis of multi-omics data sets from a large number of primary breast tumors. It allows the investigation of genomic and epigenomic aberrations, evaluation of transcriptomic profiles and performance of survival analyses and of bivariate correlations between layers of omics data. Notably, the genome-wide screening function of CTGS prioritizes candidate genes of clinical and biological significance among genes with copy number alteration, DNA methylation and dysregulated expression by the integrative analysis of different types of omics data in customized subgroups of breast cancer patients. These features may help in the identification of druggable cancer driver genes in a specific subtype or the clinical condition of human breast cancer.

PICan: An integromics framework for dynamic cancer biomarker discovery,"Modern cancer research on prognostic and predictive biomarkers demands the integration of established and emerging high-throughput technologies. However, these data are meaningless unless carefully integrated with patient clinical outcome and epidemiological information.

We have developed a novel approach and set of methods for integrating and interrogating phenomic, genomic and clinical data sets to facilitate cancer biomarker discovery and patient stratification.

Spatial transformation of multi-omics data unlocks novel insights into cancer biology,"The application of next-generation sequencing (NGS) has transformed cancer research. As costs have decreased, NGS has increasingly been applied to generate multiple layers of molecular data from the same samples, covering genomics, transcriptomics, and methylomics. Integrating these types of multi-omics data in a combined analysis is now becoming a common issue with no obvious solution, often handled on an ad hoc basis, with multi-omics data arriving in a tabular format and analyzed using computationally intensive statistical methods. These methods particularly ignore the spatial orientation of the genome and often apply stringent p-value corrections that likely result in the loss of true positive associations. Here, we present GENIUS (GEnome traNsformatIon and spatial representation of mUltiomicS data), a framework for integrating multi-omics data using deep learning models developed for advanced image analysis. The GENIUS framework is able to transform multi-omics data into images with genes displayed as spatially connected pixels and successfully extract relevant information with respect to the desired output. We demonstrate the utility of GENIUS by applying the framework to multi-omics datasets from the Cancer Genome Atlas. Our results are focused on predicting the development of metastatic cancer from primary tumors, and demonstrate how through model inference, we are able to extract the genes which are driving the model prediction and are likely associated with metastatic disease progression.

Evaluation and comparison of multi-omics data integration methods for cancer subtyping,"Computational integrative analysis has become a significant approach in the data-driven exploration of biological problems. Many integration methods for cancer subtyping have been proposed, but evaluating these methods has become a complicated problem due to the lack of gold standards. Moreover, questions of practical importance remain to be addressed regarding the impact of selecting appropriate data types and combinations on the performance of integrative studies. Here, we constructed three classes of benchmarking datasets of nine cancers in TCGA by considering all the eleven combinations of four multi-omics data types. Using these datasets, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of ten representative integration methods for cancer subtyping in terms of accuracy measured by combining both clustering accuracy and clinical significance, robustness, and computational efficiency. We subsequently investigated the influence of different omics data on cancer subtyping and the effectiveness of their combinations. Refuting the widely held intuition that incorporating more types of omics data always produces better results, our analyses showed that there are situations where integrating more omics data negatively impacts the performance of integration methods. Our analyses also suggested several effective combinations for most cancers under our studies, which may be of particular interest to researchers in omics data analysis.",34383739,PMC8384175,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009224,24,PLoS computational biology,101238922,4.779,0.538285493850708,0.8561872909698997,0.3511705685618729,0.5644428682167792
Using machine learning approaches for multi-omics data analysis: A review,"With the development of modern high-throughput omic measurement platforms, it has become essential for biomedical studies to undertake an integrative (combined) approach to fully utilise these data to gain insights into biological systems. Data from various omics sources such as genetics, proteomics, and metabolomics can be integrated to unravel the intricate working of systems biology using machine learning-based predictive algorithms. Machine learning methods offer novel techniques to integrate and analyse the various omics data enabling the discovery of new biomarkers. These biomarkers have the potential to help in accurate disease prediction, patient stratification and delivery of precision medicine. This review paper explores different integrative machine learning methods which have been used to provide an in-depth understanding of biological systems during normal physiological functioning and in the presence of a disease. It provides insight and recommendations for interdisciplinary professionals who envisage employing machine learning skills in multi-omics studies.",33794304,,10.1016/j.biotechadv.2021.107739,157,Biotechnology advances,8403708,17.681,0.5367681980133057,0.9899665551839465,0.9163879598662207,0.7033318218180169
Multiomics Screening Identifies Molecular Biomarkers Causally Associated With the Risk of Coronary Artery Disease,"Background:In this study, we aimed to investigate functional mechanisms underlying coronary artery disease (CAD) loci and find molecular biomarkers for CAD.Methods:We devised a multiomics data analysis approach based on Mendelian randomization and utilized it to search for molecular biomarkers causally associated with the risk of CAD within genomic regions known to be associated with CAD.Results:Through our CAD-centered multiomics data analysis approach, we identified 33 molecular biomarkers (probes) that were causally associated with the risk of CAD. The majority of these (N=19) were methylation probes; moreover, methylation was often behind the causal effect of expression/protein probes. We identified a number of novel loci that have a causal impact on CAD includingC5orf38,SF3A3,DHX36, andMRPL33. Furthermore, by integrating the risk factors of CAD in our analysis, we were able to investigate the clinical pathways whereby several of our probes exert their effect. We found that the SELE protein level in the blood is under the trans-regulatory impact of methylation sites within theABOgene and that SELE exerts its effect on CAD through immune, glycemic, and lipid metabolism, making it a candidate of interest for therapeutic interventions. We found the methylation site, cg05126514 within theBSNgene exert its effect on CAD through central nervous system-lifestyle risk factors. Finally, genes with a transcriptional regulatory role (SF3A3,ILF3, andN4BP2L2) exert their effect on CAD through height.Conclusions:We demonstrate that multiomics data analysis is a powerful approach to unravel the functional mechanisms underlying CAD loci and to identify novel molecular biomarkers. Our results indicate epigenetic modifications are important in the pathogenesis of CAD and identifying and targeting these sites is of potential therapeutic interest to address the detrimental effects of both environmental and genetic factors.",32969717,,10.1161/CIRCGEN.119.002876,8,Circulation.

Cell-free multi-omics analysis reveals potential biomarkers in gastrointestinal cancer patients' blood,"During cancer progression, tumorigenic and immune signals are spread through circulating molecules, such as cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and cell-free RNA (cfRNA) in the blood. So far, they have not been comprehensively investigated in gastrointestinal cancers. Here, we profile 4 categories of cell-free omics data from patients with colorectal cancer and patients with stomach adenocarcinoma and then assay 15 types of genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic variations. We find that multi-omics data are more appropriate for detection of cancer genes compared with single-omics data. In particular, cfRNAs are more sensitive and informative than cfDNAs in terms of detection rate, enriched functional pathways, etc. Moreover, we identify several peripheral immune signatures that are suppressed in patients with cancer. Specifically, we establish a Î³Î´-T cell score and a cancer-associated-fibroblast (CAF) score, providing insights into clinical statuses like cancer stage and survival. Overall, we reveal a cell-free multi-molecular landscape that is useful for blood monitoring in personalized cancer treatment.",37992683,PMC10694666,10.1016/j.xcrm.2023.101281,1,Cell reports.

Identification of early and intermediate biomarkers for ARDS mortality by multi-omic approaches,"The lack of successful clinical trials in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has highlighted the unmet need for biomarkers predicting ARDS mortality and for novel therapeutics to reduce ARDS mortality. We utilized a systems biology multi-""omics"" approach to identify predictive biomarkers for ARDS mortality. Integrating analyses were designed to differentiate ARDS non-survivors and survivors (568 subjects, 27% overall 28-day mortality) using datasets derived from multiple 'omics' studies in a multi-institution ARDS cohort (54% European descent, 40% African descent). 'Omics' data was available for each subject and included genome-wide association studies (GWAS, n = 297), RNA sequencing (n = 93), DNA methylation data (n = 61), and selective proteomic network analysis (n = 240). Integration of available ""omic"" data identified a 9-gene set (TNPO1, NUP214, HDAC1, HNRNPA1, GATAD2A, FOSB, DDX17, PHF20, CREBBP) that differentiated ARDS survivors/non-survivors, results that were validated utilizing a longitudinal transcription dataset. Pathway analysis identified TP53-, HDAC1-, TGF-Î²-, and IL-6-signaling pathways to be associated with ARDS mortality. Predictive biomarker discovery identified transcription levels of the 9-gene set (AUC-0.83) and Day 7 angiopoietin 2 protein levels as potential candidate predictors of ARDS mortality (AUC-0.70). These results underscore the value of utilizing integrated ""multi-omics"" approaches in underpowered datasets from racially diverse ARDS subjects.",34556700,PMC8460799,10.1038/s41598-021-98053-1,4,Scientific reports,101563288,4.996,0.5330328941345215,0.47491638795986624,0.4013377926421405,0.4950705726011143
The molecular pathophysiology of mood disorders: From the analysis of single molecular layers to multi-omic integration,"Next-generation sequencing now enables the rapid and affordable production of reliable biological data at multiple molecular levels, collectively referred to as ""omics"". To maximize the potential for discovery, computational biologists have created and adapted integrative multi-omic analytical methods. When applied to diseases with traceable pathophysiology such as cancer, these new algorithms and statistical approaches have enabled the discovery of clinically relevant molecular mechanisms and biomarkers. In contrast, these methods have been much less applied to the field of molecular psychiatry, although diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers are similarly needed. In the present review, we first briefly summarize main findings from two decades of studies that investigated single molecular processes in relation to mood disorders. Then, we conduct a systematic review of multi-omic strategies that have been proposed and used more recently. We also list databases and types of data available to researchers for future work. Finally, we present the newest methodologies that have been employed for multi-omics integration in other medical fields, and discuss their potential for molecular psychiatry studies.",35104608,,10.1016/j.pnpbp.2022.110520,3,Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry,8211617,5.201,0.532759428024292,0.411371237458194,0.43812709030100333,0.48955532236641464
A novel integrative multi-omics approach to unravel the genetic determinants of rare diseases with application in sinusoidal obstruction syndrome,"Background:Genotype-phenotype analyses of rare diseases often suffer from a lack of power, due to small sample size, which makes identifying significant associations difficult. Sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS) of the liver is a rare but life-threatening complication of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The alkylating agent busulfan is commonly used in HSCT and known to trigger SOS. We developed a novel pipeline to identify genetic determinants in rare diseases by combining in vitro information with clinical whole-exome sequencing (WES) data and applied it in SOS patients and controls.Methods:First, we analysed differential gene expression in six lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) before and after incubation with busulfan. Second, we used WES data from 87 HSCT patients and estimated the association with SOS at the SNP and the gene levels. We then combined the results of the expression and the association analyses into an association statistic at the gene level. We used an over-representation analysis to functionally characterize the genes that were associated with a significant combined test statistic.Results:After treatment of LCLs with busulfan, 1708 genes were significantly up-, and 1385 down-regulated. The combination of the expression experiment and the association analysis of WES data into a single test statistic revealed 35 genes associated with the outcome. These genes are involved in various biological functions and processes, such as ""Cell growth and death"", ""Signalling molecules and interaction"", ""Cancer"", and ""Infectious disease"".Conclusions:This novel data analysis pipeline integrates two independent omics datasets and increases statistical power for identifying genotype-phenotype associations. The analysis of the transcriptomics profile of cell lines treated with busulfan and WES data from HSCT patients allowed us to identify potential genetic contributors to SOS. Our pipeline could be useful for identifying genetic contributors to other rare diseases where limited power renders genome-wide analyses unpromising.Trial registration:For the clinical dataset: Clinicaltrials.gov:NCT01257854. https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/history/NCT01257854.",37018234,PMC10075428,10.1371/journal.pone.0281892,0,PloS one,101285081,3.752,0.5321212410926819,0.07357859531772576,0.19732441471571907,0.3734533466622981
Integrative multi-omics analyses unravel the immunological implication and prognostic significance of CXCL12 in breast cancer,"Background:CXCL12 is a vital factor in physiological and pathological processes, by inducing migration of multiple cells. We aimed to comprehensively detect the role of CXCL12 in breast cancer, and explore novel CXCL12-related biomarkers through integrative multi-omics analyses to build a powerful prognostic model for breast cancer patients.Methods:Immunohistochemistry analysis of the tissue microarray was performed to evaluate the correlation between CXCL12 expression levels and breast cancer patient outcomes. Combined single-nucleus and spatial transcriptomics data was used to uncover the expression distribution of CXCL12 in breast cancer microenvironment. CXCL12-related genes were identified by WGCNA analysis. Univariate Cox and LASSO regression analyses were then conducted to screen prognostic genes from above CXCL12-related genes, followed by the construction of the CXCL12-related prognostic signature, identification of risk groups, and external validation of the prognostic signature. Analyses of biological function, mutation landscape, immune checkpoint genes and immune cells, were performed to further reveal the differences between high/low-risk groups. Paired single-cell RNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq were analyzed to further disclose the association between the risk score and the complex tumor immune microenvironment. To screen potential therapeutic agents for breast cancer patients, analyses of gene-drug correlation and sensitivity to immunotherapy were conducted.Results:High expression of CXCL12 was linked with a prolonged survival in breast cancer. A total of 402 genes were identified by WGCNA analysis and 11 genes, coveringVAT1L, TMEM92, SDC1, RORB, PCSK9, NRN1, NACAD, JPH3, GJA1, BMP8BandADAMTS2, were screened as the candidate prognostic genes. Next, the prognostic signature was built and validated using these genes to predict the outcomes of breast cancers. The high-risk group patients exhibited significantly inferior prognoses. The combination of the risk score and tumor mutational burden (TMB) had remarkably improved performance in predicting patient outcomes. Besides, high-risk group patients showed higher infiltration of M2-like macrophages. Finally, several potential anticancer drugs were identified. The high-risk group patients were more sensitive to immunotherapy but resistant to docetaxel.Conclusions:CXCL12 has important immunological implication and prognostic significance in breast cancer. The CXCL12-related prognostic model could well predict the prognosis and treatment response of breast cancers.",37564657,PMC10410148,10.3389/fimmu.2023.1188351,1,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,8.786,0.5320300459861755,0.24749163879598662,0.7759197324414716,0.523900301839197
Dealing with dimensionality: the application of machine learning to multi-omics data,"Motivation:Machine learning (ML) methods are motivated by the need to automate information extraction from large datasets in order to support human users in data-driven tasks. This is an attractive approach for integrative joint analysis of vast amounts of omics data produced in next generation sequencing and other -omics assays. A systematic assessment of the current literature can help to identify key trends and potential gaps in methodology and applications. We surveyed the literature on ML multi-omic data integration and quantitatively explored the goals, techniques and data involved in this field. We were particularly interested in examining how researchers use ML to deal with the volume and complexity of these datasets.Results:Our main finding is that the methods used are those that address the challenges of datasets with few samples and many features. Dimensionality reduction methods are used to reduce the feature count alongside models that can also appropriately handle relatively few samples. Popular techniques include autoencoders, random forests and support vector machines. We also found that the field is heavily influenced by the use of The Cancer Genome Atlas dataset, which is accessible and contains many diverse experiments.Availability and implementation:All data and processing scripts are available at this GitLab repository: https://gitlab.com/polavieja_lab/ml_multi-omics_review/ or in Zenodo: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7361807.Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",36637211,PMC9907220,10.1093/bioinformatics/btad021,13,"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",9808944,6.931,0.5304645299911499,0.7759197324414716,0.6153846153846154,0.5965395875599073
Executable Network Models of Integrated Multiomics Data,"Multiomics profiling provides a holistic picture of a condition being examined and captures the complexity of signaling events, beginning from the original cause (environmental or genetic), to downstream functional changes at multiple molecular layers. Pathway enrichment analysis has been used with multiomics data sets to characterize signaling mechanisms. However, technical and biological variability between these layered data limit an integrative computational analyses. We present a Boolean network-based method, multiomics Boolean Omics Network Invariant-Time Analysis (mBONITA), to integrate omics data sets that quantify multiple molecular layers. mBONITA utilizes prior knowledge networks to perform topology-based pathway analysis. In addition, mBONITA identifies genes that are consistently modulated across molecular measurements by combining observed fold-changes and variance, with a measure of node (i.e., gene or protein) influence over signaling, and a measure of the strength of evidence for that gene across data sets. We used mBONITA to integrate multiomics data sets from RAMOS B cells treated with the immunosuppressant drug cyclosporine A under varying O2tensions to identify pathways involved in hypoxia-mediated chemotaxis. We compare mBONITA's performance with 6 other pathway analysis methods designed for multiomics data and show that mBONITA identifies a set of pathways with evidence of modulation across all omics layers. mBONITA is freely available at https://github.com/Thakar-Lab/mBONITA.",37000949,PMC10167691,10.1021/acs.jproteome.2c00730,1,Journal of proteome research,101128775,5.37,0.5299020409584045,0.2508361204013378,0.44816053511705684,0.4577405556787217
Multi-Omics Data Integration and Mapping of Altered Kinases to Pathways Reveal Gonadotropin Hormone Signaling in Glioblastoma,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is one of the most lethal brain tumors with an inadequately understood pathophysiology. Biomarkers that guide accurate diagnosis and treatment decisions would greatly support precision medicine for GBM. Previous studies of GBM have focused on signaling pathways such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFRs), notch, wnt, and others, identified with single omics technology platforms (genomics, transcriptomics, or proteomics), but not with their integrated use. In this context, we report here a multi-omics pathway view, expanded through integration of the expression data at transcriptomic and proteomic levels, followed by selection of a functionally related group of proteins such as kinases deregulated in GBM. By using this strategy, we observed a highly significant enrichment of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) signaling pathway that was not deciphered with single omics datasets. The curation of the GnRH pathway with extensive literature analysis brought about a comprehensive annotation of the pathway, which included several additional pathway members that were not previously annotated. A targeted search resulted in identification of additional nonkinase members of the pathway in the GBM multi-omics datasets. We found evidence of GnRH receptor expression in GBM and other cancers. We offer here an updated generic pathway map of GnRH signaling, show its enrichment in the context of GBM, and discuss its plausible cross-connectivity with EGFR, wnt, calcium, and focal adhesion kinase signaling pathways that were earlier shown to be the top deregulated pathways in GBM. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the promise of multi-omics research and analyses to better understand complex cancers and suggests continued efforts and research in this direction in the field of integrative biology.",27930095,,10.1089/omi.2016.0142,8,Omics : a journal of integrative biology,101131135,3.978,0.5278337001800537,0.6822742474916388,0.23411371237458195,0.49997781208127634
Multilevel omics for the discovery of biomarkers and therapeutic targets for stroke,"Despite many years of research, no biomarkers for stroke are available to use in clinical practice. Progress in high-throughput technologies has provided new opportunities to understand the pathophysiology of this complex disease, and these studies have generated large amounts of data and information at different molecular levels. The integration of these multi-omics data means that thousands of proteins (proteomics), genes (genomics), RNAs (transcriptomics) and metabolites (metabolomics) can be studied simultaneously, revealing interaction networks between the molecular levels. Integrated analysis of multi-omics data will provide useful insight into stroke pathogenesis, identification of therapeutic targets and biomarker discovery.

Multi-omics integration in the age of million single-cell data,"An explosion in single-cell technologies has revealed a previously underappreciated heterogeneity of cell types and novel cell-state associations with sex, disease, development and other processes. Starting with transcriptome analyses, single-cell techniques have extended to multi-omics approaches and now enable the simultaneous measurement of data modalities and spatial cellular context. Data are now available for millions of cells, for whole-genome measurements and for multiple modalities. Although analyses of such multimodal datasets have the potential to provide new insights into biological processes that cannot be inferred with a single mode of assay, the integration of very large, complex, multimodal data into biological models and mechanisms represents a considerable challenge. An understanding of the principles of data integration and visualization methods is required to determine what methods are best applied to a particular single-cell dataset. Each class of method has advantages and pitfalls in terms of its ability to achieve various biological goals, including cell-type classification, regulatory network modelling and biological process inference. In choosing a data integration strategy, consideration must be given to whether the multi-omics data are matched (that is, measured on the same cell) or unmatched (that is, measured on different cells) and, more importantly, the overall modelling and visualization goals of the integrated analysis.",34417589,PMC9191639,10.1038/s41581-021-00463-x,56,Nature reviews.

These data may yield unprecedented knowledge about molecular pathways in cells and their role in disease. Dimension reduction approaches have been widely used in exploratory analysis of single omics data sets. This review will focus on dimension reduction approaches for simultaneous exploratory analyses of multiple data sets. These methods extract the linear relationships that best explain the correlated structure across data sets, the variability both within and between variables (or observations) and may highlight data issues such as batch effects or outliers.

Onco-Multi-OMICS Approach: A New Frontier in Cancer Research,"The acquisition of cancer hallmarks requires molecular alterations at multiple levels including genome, epigenome, transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome. In the past decade, numerous attempts have been made to untangle the molecular mechanisms of carcinogenesis involving single OMICS approaches such as scanning the genome for cancer-specific mutations and identifying altered epigenetic-landscapes within cancer cells or by exploring the differential expression of mRNA and protein through transcriptomics and proteomics techniques, respectively. While these single-level OMICS approaches have contributed towards the identification of cancer-specific mutations, epigenetic alterations, and molecular subtyping of tumors based on gene/protein-expression, they lack the resolving-power to establish the casual relationship between molecular signatures and the phenotypic manifestation of cancer hallmarks. In contrast, the multi-OMICS approaches involving the interrogation of the cancer cells/tissues in multiple dimensions have the potential to uncover the intricate molecular mechanism underlying different phenotypic manifestations of cancer hallmarks such as metastasis and angiogenesis. Moreover, multi-OMICS approaches can be used to dissect the cellular response to chemo- or immunotherapy as well as discover molecular candidates with diagnostic/prognostic value. In this review, we focused on the applications of different multi-OMICS approaches in the field of cancer research and discussed how these approaches are shaping the field of personalized oncomedicine. We have highlighted pioneering studies from ""The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)"" consortium encompassing integrated OMICS analysis of over 11,000 tumors from 33 most prevalent forms of cancer. Accumulation of huge cancer-specific multi-OMICS data in repositories like TCGA provides a unique opportunity for the systems biology approach to tackle the complexity of cancer cells through the unification of experimental data and computational/mathematical models. In future, systems biology based approach is likely to predict the phenotypic changes of cancer cells upon chemo-/immunotherapy treatment. This review is sought to encourage investigators to bring these different approaches together for interrogating cancer at molecular, cellular, and systems levels.",30402498,PMC6192166,10.1155/2018/9836256,120,BioMed research international,101600173,3.246,0.5242424607276917,0.9732441471571907,0.11371237458193979,0.5319367807844411
Multi-omics integration analysis of GPCRs in pan-cancer to uncover inter-omics relationships and potential driver genes,"G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest drug target family. Unfortunately, applications of GPCRs in cancer therapy are scarce due to very limited knowledge regarding their correlations with cancers. Multi-omics data enables systematic investigations of GPCRs, yet their effective integration remains a challenge due to the complexity of the data. Here, we adopt two types of integration strategies, multi-staged and meta-dimensional approaches, to fully characterize somatic mutations, somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs), DNA methylations, and mRNA expressions of GPCRs in 33 cancers. Results from the multi-staged integration reveal that GPCR mutations cannot well predict expression dysregulation. The correlations between expressions and SCNAs are primarily positive, while correlations of the methylations with expressions and SCNAs are bimodal with negative correlations predominating. Based on these correlations, 32 and 144 potential cancer-related GPCRs driven by aberrant SCNA and methylation are identified, respectively. In addition, the meta-dimensional integration analysis is carried out by using deep learning models, which predict more than one hundred GPCRs as potential oncogenes. When comparing results between the two integration strategies, 165 cancer-related GPCRs are common in both, suggesting that they should be prioritized in future studies. However, 172 GPCRs emerge in only one, indicating that the two integration strategies should be considered concurrently to complement the information missed by the other such that obtain a more comprehensive understanding. Finally, correlation analysis further reveals that GPCRs, in particular for the class A and adhesion receptors, are generally immune-related. In a whole, the work is for the first time to reveal the associations between different omics layers and highlight the necessity of combing the two strategies in identifying cancer-related GPCRs.",37201441,,10.1016/j.compbiomed.2023.106988,4,Computers in biology and medicine,1250250,6.698,0.5202069282531738,0.4782608695652174,0.5785953177257525,0.5234953944100982
Holomics - a user-friendly R shiny application for multi-omics data integration and analysis,"An organism's observable traits, or phenotype, result from intricate interactions among genes, proteins, metabolites and the environment. External factors, such as associated microorganisms, along with biotic and abiotic stressors, can significantly impact this complex biological system, influencing processes like growth, development and productivity. A comprehensive analysis of the entire biological system and its interactions is thus crucial to identify key components that support adaptation to stressors and to discover biomarkers applicable in breeding programs or disease diagnostics. Since the genomics era, several other 'omics' disciplines have emerged, and recent advances in high-throughput technologies have facilitated the generation of additional omics datasets. While traditionally analyzed individually, the last decade has seen an increase in multi-omics data integration and analysis strategies aimed at achieving a holistic understanding of interactions across different biological layers. Despite these advances, the analysis of multi-omics data is still challenging due to their scale, complexity, high dimensionality and multimodality. To address these challenges, a number of analytical tools and strategies have been developed, including clustering and differential equations, which require advanced knowledge in bioinformatics and statistics. Therefore, this study recognizes the need for user-friendly tools by introducing Holomics, an accessible and easy-to-use R shiny application with multi-omics functions tailored for scientists with limited bioinformatics knowledge. Holomics provides a well-defined workflow, starting with the upload and pre-filtering of single-omics data, which are then further refined by single-omics analysis focusing on key features. Subsequently, these reduced datasets are subjected to multi-omics analyses to unveil correlations between 2-n datasets. This paper concludes with a real-world case study where microbiomics, transcriptomics and metabolomics data from previous studies that elucidate factors associated with improved sugar beet storability are integrated using Holomics. The results are discussed in the context of the biological background, underscoring the importance of multi-omics insights. This example not only highlights the versatility of Holomics in handling different types of omics data, but also validates its consistency by reproducing findings from preceding single-omics studies.",38438871,PMC10913680,10.1186/s12859-024-05719-4,0,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,3.307,0.5199021697044373,0.07692307692307693,0.13712374581939799,0.3547506663711573
"Accurate cancer phenotype prediction with AKLIMATE, a stacked kernel learner integrating multimodal genomic data and pathway knowledge","Advancements in sequencing have led to the proliferation of multi-omic profiles of human cells under different conditions and perturbations. In addition, many databases have amassed information about pathways and gene ""signatures""-patterns of gene expression associated with specific cellular and phenotypic contexts. An important current challenge in systems biology is to leverage such knowledge about gene coordination to maximize the predictive power and generalization of models applied to high-throughput datasets. However, few such integrative approaches exist that also provide interpretable results quantifying the importance of individual genes and pathways to model accuracy. We introduce AKLIMATE, a first kernel-based stacked learner that seamlessly incorporates multi-omics feature data with prior information in the form of pathways for either regression or classification tasks. AKLIMATE uses a novel multiple-kernel learning framework where individual kernels capture the prediction propensities recorded in random forests, each built from a specific pathway gene set that integrates all omics data for its member genes. AKLIMATE has comparable or improved performance relative to state-of-the-art methods on diverse phenotype learning tasks, including predicting microsatellite instability in endometrial and colorectal cancer, survival in breast cancer, and cell line response to gene knockdowns. We show how AKLIMATE is able to connect feature data across data platforms through their common pathways to identify examples of several known and novel contributors of cancer and synthetic lethality.",33861732,PMC8081343,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008878,5,PLoS computational biology,101238922,4.779,0.5179061889648438,0.568561872909699,0.35451505016722407,0.4953590979942909
From Omics to Multi-Omics Approaches for In-Depth Analysis of the Molecular Mechanisms of Prostate Cancer,"Cancer arises following alterations at different cellular levels, including genetic and epigenetic modifications, transcription and translation dysregulation, as well as metabolic variations. High-throughput omics technologies that allow one to identify and quantify processes involved in these changes are now available and have been instrumental in generating a wealth of steadily increasing data from patient tumors, liquid biopsies, and from tumor models. Extensive investigation and integration of these data have led to new biological insights into the origin and development of multiple cancer types and helped to unravel the molecular networks underlying this complex pathology. The comprehensive and quantitative analysis of a molecule class in a biological sample is named omics and large-scale omics studies addressing different prostate cancer stages have been performed in recent years. Prostate tumors represent the second leading cancer type and a prevalent cause of cancer death in men worldwide. It is a very heterogenous disease so that evaluating inter- and intra-tumor differences will be essential for a precise insight into disease development and plasticity, but also for the development of personalized therapies. There is ample evidence for the key role of the androgen receptor, a steroid hormone-activated transcription factor, in driving early and late stages of the disease, and this led to the development and approval of drugs addressing diverse targets along this pathway. Early genomic and transcriptomic studies have allowed one to determine the genes involved in prostate cancer and regulated by androgen signaling or other tumor-relevant signaling pathways. More recently, they have been supplemented by epigenomic, cistromic, proteomic and metabolomic analyses, thus, increasing our knowledge on the intricate mechanisms involved, the various levels of regulation and their interplay. The comprehensive investigation of these omics approaches and their integration into multi-omics analyses have led to a much deeper understanding of the molecular pathways involved in prostate cancer progression, and in response and resistance to therapies. This brings the hope that novel vulnerabilities will be identified, that existing therapies will be more beneficial by targeting the patient population likely to respond best, and that bespoke treatments with increased efficacy will be available soon.",35682963,PMC9181488,10.3390/ijms23116281,8,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,6.208,0.5154674649238586,0.68561872909699,0.5284280936454849,0.5520898435028101

A latent unknown clustering integrating multi-omics data (LUCID) with phenotypic traits,"Motivation:Epidemiologic, clinical and translational studies are increasingly generating multiplatform omics data. Methods that can integrate across multiple high-dimensional data types while accounting for differential patterns are critical for uncovering novel associations and underlying relevant subgroups.Results:We propose an integrative model to estimate latent unknown clusters (LUCID) aiming to both distinguish unique genomic, exposure and informative biomarkers/omic effects while jointly estimating subgroups relevant to the outcome of interest. Simulation studies indicate that we can obtain consistent estimates reflective of the true simulated values, accurately estimate subgroups and recapitulate subgroup-specific effects. We also demonstrate the use of the integrated model for future prediction of risk subgroups and phenotypes.

MyeloDB: a multi-omics resource for multiple myeloma,"Multiple myeloma (MM) is a common type of blood cancer affecting plasma cells originating from the lymphoid B-cell lineage. It accounts for about 10% of all hematological malignancies and can cause significant end-organ damage. The emergence of genomic technologies such as next-generation sequencing and gene expression analysis has opened new possibilities for early detection of multiple myeloma and identification of personalized treatment options. However, there remain significant challenges to overcome in MM research, including integrating multi-omics data, achieving a comprehensive understanding of the disease, and developing targeted therapies and biomarkers. The extensive data generated by these technologies presents another challenge for data analysis and interpretation. To bridge this gap, we have developed a multi-omics open-access database called MyeloDB. It includes gene expression profiling, high-throughput CRISPR-Cas9 screens, drug sensitivity resources profile, and biomarkers. MyeloDB contains 47 expression profiles, 3 methylation profiles comprising a total of 5630 patient samples and 25 biomarkers which were reported in previous studies. In addition to this, MyeloDB can provide significant insight of gene mutations in MM on drug sensitivity. Furthermore, users can download the datasets and conduct their own analyses. Utilizing this database, we have identified five novel genes, i.e., CBFB, MANF, MBNL1, SEPHS2, and UFM1 as potential drug targets for MM. We hope MyeloDB will serve as a comprehensive platform for researchers and foster novel discoveries in MM.

Artificial intelligence-based multi-omics analysis fuels cancer precision medicine,"With biotechnological advancements, innovative omics technologies are constantly emerging that have enabled researchers to access multi-layer information from the genome, epigenome, transcriptome, proteome, metabolome, and more. A wealth of omics technologies, including bulk and single-cell omics approaches, have empowered to characterize different molecular layers at unprecedented scale and resolution, providing a holistic view of tumor behavior. Multi-omics analysis allows systematic interrogation of various molecular information at each biological layer while posing tricky challenges regarding how to extract valuable insights from the exponentially increasing amount of multi-omics data. Therefore, efficient algorithms are needed to reduce the dimensionality of the data while simultaneously dissecting the mysteries behind the complex biological processes of cancer. Artificial intelligence has demonstrated the ability to analyze complementary multi-modal data streams within the oncology realm.

Machine learning based combination of multi-omics data for subgroup identification in non-small cell lung cancer,"Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) is a heterogeneous disease with a poor prognosis. Identifying novel subtypes in cancer can help classify patients with similar molecular and clinical phenotypes. This work proposes an end-to-end pipeline for subgroup identification in NSCLC. Here, we used a machine learning (ML) based approach to compress the multi-omics NSCLC data to a lower dimensional space. This data is subjected to consensus K-means clustering to identify the five novel clusters (C1-C5). Survival analysis of the resulting clusters revealed a significant difference in the overall survival of clusters (p-value: 0.019). Each cluster was then molecularly characterized to identify specific molecular characteristics. We found that cluster C3 showed minimal genetic aberration with a high prognosis. Next, classification models were developed using data from each omic level to predict the subgroup of unseen patients. Decisionâlevel fused classification models were then built using these classifiers, which were used to classify unseen patients into five novel clusters. We also showed that the multi-omics-based classification model outperformed single-omic-based models, and the combination of classifiers proved to be a more accurate prediction model than the individual classifiers. In summary, we have used ML models to develop a classification method and identified five novel NSCLC clusters with different genetic and clinical characteristics.",36944673,PMC10030850,10.1038/s41598-023-31426-w,3,Scientific reports,101563288,4.996,0.5053938031196594,0.41471571906354515,0.40468227424749165,0.46711588053400305
BioSTD: A New Tensor Multi-View Framework via Combining Tensor Decomposition and Strong Complementarity Constraint for Analyzing Cancer Omics Data,"Advances in omics technology have enriched the understanding of the biological mechanisms of diseases, which has provided a new approach for cancer research. Multi-omics data contain different levels of cancer information, and comprehensive analysis of them has attracted wide attention. However, limited by the dimensionality of matrix models, traditional methods cannot fully use the key high-dimensional global structure of multi-omics data. Moreover, besides global information, local features within each omics are also critical. It is necessary to consider the potential local information together with the high-dimensional global information, ensuring that the shared and complementary features of the omics data are comprehensively observed. In view of the above, this article proposes a new tensor integrative framework called the strong complementarity tensor decomposition model (BioSTD) for cancer multi-omics data. It is used to identify cancer subtype specific genes and cluster subtype samples. Different from the matrix framework, BioSTD utilizes multi-view tensors to coordinate each omics to maximize high-dimensional spatial relationships, which jointly considers the different characteristics of different omics data. Meanwhile, we propose the concept of strong complementarity constraint applicable to omics data and introduce it into BioSTD. Strong complementarity is used to explore the potential local information, which can enhance the separability of different subtypes, allowing consistency and complementarity in the omics data to be fully represented. Experimental results on real cancer datasets show that our model outperforms other advanced models, which confirms its validity.",37498764,,10.1109/JBHI.2023.3299274,0,IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics,101604520,7.021,0.5050047039985657,0.08361204013377926,0.6688963210702341,0.453504494639942
Integrated multi-omics analysis of ovarian cancer using variational autoencoders,"Cancer is a complex disease that deregulates cellular functions at various molecular levels (e.g., DNA, RNA, and proteins). Integrated multi-omics analysis of data from these levels is necessary to understand the aberrant cellular functions accountable for cancer and its development. In recent years, Deep Learning (DL) approaches have become a useful tool in integrated multi-omics analysis of cancer data. However, high dimensional multi-omics data are generally imbalanced with too many molecular features and relatively few patient samples. This imbalance makes a DL based integrated multi-omics analysis difficult. DL-based dimensionality reduction technique, including variational autoencoder (VAE), is a potential solution to balance high dimensional multi-omics data. However, there are few VAE-based integrated multi-omics analyses, and they are limited to pancancer. In this work, we did an integrated multi-omics analysis of ovarian cancer using the compressed features learned through VAE and an improved version of VAE, namely Maximum Mean Discrepancy VAE (MMD-VAE). First, we designed and developed a DL architecture for VAE and MMD-VAE. Then we used the architecture for mono-omics, integrated di-omics and tri-omics data analysis of ovarian cancer through cancer samples identification, molecular subtypes clustering and classification, and survival analysis. The results show that MMD-VAE and VAE-based compressed features can respectively classify the transcriptional subtypes of the TCGA datasets with an accuracy in the range of 93.2-95.5% and 87.1-95.7%. Also, survival analysis results show that VAE and MMD-VAE based compressed representation of omics data can be used in cancer prognosis. Based on the results, we can conclude that (i) VAE and MMD-VAE outperform existing dimensionality reduction techniques, (ii) integrated multi-omics analyses perform better or similar compared to their mono-omics counterparts, and (iii) MMD-VAE performs better than VAE in most omics dataset.",33737557,PMC7973750,10.1038/s41598-021-85285-4,24,Scientific reports,101563288,4.996,0.5034675002098083,0.8595317725752508,0.4080267558528428,0.5555922058115038
A Multiview Clustering Method With Low-Rank and Sparsity Constraints for Cancer Subtyping,"Multiomics data clustering is one of the major challenges in the field of precision medicine. Integration of multiomics data for cancer subtyping can improve the understanding on cancer and reveal systems-level insights. How to integrate multiomics data for accurate cancer subtyping is an interesting and challenging research problem. To capture the global and the local structure of omics data, a novel framework for integrating multiomics data is proposed for cancer subtyping. Multiview clustering with low-rank and sparsity constraints (MVCLRS) can measure the local similarities of samples in each omics data and obtain global consensus structures by integrating the multiomics data. The main insight provided by MVCLRS is that low-rank sparse subspace clustering for the construction of an affinity matrix can best capture the local similarities in omics data. Extensive testing is conducted on 10 real world cancer datasets with multiomics from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Compared with 10 state-of-the-art multiomics clustering algorithms, the MVCLRS performs better in the 10 cancer datasets by providing its clustering results with at least one enriched clinical label in nine of ten cancer subtypes, the most of any method.",34705654,,10.1109/TCBB.2021.3122917,1,IEEE/ACM transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics,101196755,3.702,0.5030288100242615,0.25752508361204013,0.1806020066889632,0.38944270407475756

A Translational Pipeline for Overall Survival Prediction of Breast Cancer Patients by Decision-Level Integration of Multi-Omics Data,"Breast cancer is the most prevalent and among the most deadly cancers in females. Patients with breast cancer have highly variable survival rates, indicating a need to identify prognostic biomarkers. By integrating multi-omics data (e.g., gene expression, DNA methylation, miRNA expression, and copy number variations (CNVs)), it is likely to improve the accuracy of patient survival predictions compared to prediction using single modality data. Therefore, we propose to develop a machine learning pipeline using decision-level integration of multi-omics tumor data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to predict the overall survival of breast cancer patients. With multi-omics data consisting of gene expression, methylation, miRNA expression, and CNVs, the top performing model predicted survival with an accuracy of 85% and area under the curve (AUC) of 87%. Furthermore, the model was able to identify which modalities best contributed to prediction performance, identifying methylation, miRNA, and gene expression as the best integrated classification combination. Our method not only recapitulated several breast cancer-specific prognostic biomarkers that were previously reported in the literature but also yielded several novel biomarkers. Further analysis of these biomarkers could lend insight into the molecular mechanisms that lead to poor survival.",32601549,PMC7324293,10.1109/bibm47256.2019.8983243,5,Proceedings.

Integrative approaches based on genomic techniques in the functional studies on enhancers,"With the development of sequencing technology and the dramatic drop in sequencing cost, the functions of noncoding genes are being characterized in a wide variety of fields (e.g. biomedicine). Enhancers are noncoding DNA elements with vital transcription regulation functions. Tens of thousands of enhancers have been identified in the human genome; however, the location, function, target genes and regulatory mechanisms of most enhancers have not been elucidated thus far. As high-throughput sequencing techniques have leapt forwards, omics approaches have been extensively employed in enhancer research. Multidimensional genomic data integration enables the full exploration of the data and provides novel perspectives for screening, identification and characterization of the function and regulatory mechanisms of unknown enhancers. However, multidimensional genomic data are still difficult to integrate genome wide due to complex varieties, massive amounts, high rarity, etc. To facilitate the appropriate methods for studying enhancers with high efficacy, we delineate the principles, data processing modes and progress of various omics approaches to study enhancers and summarize the applications of traditional machine learning and deep learning in multi-omics integration in the enhancer field.

Integrated multi-omics analysis of Alzheimer's disease shows molecular signatures associated with disease progression and potential therapeutic targets,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by the formation of amyloid plaques implicated in neuronal death. Genetics, age, and sex are the risk factors attributed to AD. Though omics studies have helped to identify pathways associated with AD, an integrated systems analysis with the available data could help to understand mechanisms, potential biomarkers, and therapeutic targets. Analysis of transcriptomic data sets from the GEO database, and proteomic and metabolomic data sets from literature was performed to identify deregulated pathways and commonality analysis identified overlapping pathways among the data sets. The deregulated pathways included those of neurotransmitter synapses, oxidative stress, inflammation, vitamins, complement, and coagulation pathways. Cell type analysis of GEO data sets showed microglia, endothelial, myeloid, and lymphoid cells are affected. Microglia are associated with inflammation and pruning of synapses with implications for memory and cognition. Analysis of the protein-cofactor network of B2, B6,and pantothenate shows metabolic pathways modulated by these vitamins which overlap with the deregulated pathways from the multi-omics analysis. Overall, the integrated analysis identified the molecular signature associated with AD.

Integration of single-cell regulon atlas and multi-omics data for prognostic stratification and personalized treatment prediction in human lung adenocarcinoma,"Transcriptional programs are often dysregulated in cancers. A comprehensive investigation of potential regulons is critical to the understanding of tumorigeneses. We first constructed the regulatory networks from single-cell RNA sequencing data in human lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). We next introduce LPRI (Lung Cancer Prognostic Regulon Index), a precision oncology framework to identify new biomarkers associated with prognosis by leveraging the single cell regulon atlas and bulk RNA sequencing or microarray datasets. We confirmed that LPRI could be a robust biomarker to guide prognosis stratification across lung adenocarcinoma cohorts.

Identification of immunotherapy and chemotherapy-related molecular subtypes in colon cancer by integrated multi-omics data analysis,"Background:Colon cancer is a highly heterogeneous disease, and identifying molecular subtypes can provide insights into deregulated pathways within tumor subsets, which may lead to personalized treatment options. However, most prognostic models are based on single-pathway genes.Methods:In this study, we aimed to identify three clinically relevant subtypes of colon cancer based on multiple signaling pathways-related genes. Integrative multi-omics analysis was used to explain the biological processes contributing to colon cancer aggressiveness, recurrence, and progression. Machine learning methods were employed to identify the subtypes and provide medication guidance for distinct subtypes using the L1000 platform. We developed a robust prognostic model (MKPC score) based on gene pairs and validated it in one internal test set and three external test sets. Risk-related genes were extracted and verified by qPCR.Results:Three clinically relevant subtypes of colon cancer were identified based on multiple signaling pathways-related genes, which had significantly different survival state (Log-Rank test, p<0.05). Integrative multi-omics analysis revealed biological processes contributing to colon cancer aggressiveness, recurrence, and progression. The developed MKPC score, based on gene pairs, was robust in predicting prognosis state (Log-Rank test, p<0.05), and risk-related genes were successfully verified by qPCR (t test, p<0.05). An easy-to-use web tool was created for risk scoring and therapy stratification in colon cancer patients, and the practical nomogram can be extended to other cancer types.Conclusion:In conclusion, our study identified three clinically relevant subtypes of colon cancer and developed a robust prognostic model based on gene pairs. The developed web tool is a valuable resource for researchers and clinicians in risk scoring and therapy stratification in colon cancer patients, and the practical nomogram can be extended to other cancer types.",37020539,PMC10067602,10.3389/fimmu.2023.1142609,4,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,8.786,0.4969215989112854,0.48494983277591974,0.7792642140468228,0.5509957687113197
Sarcoidosis Related Novel Candidate Genes Identified by Multi-Omics Integrative Analyses,"Sarcoidosis is a multifactorial systemic disease characterized by granulomatous inflammation and greatly impacting on global public health. The etiology and mechanisms of sarcoidosis are not fully understood. Recent high-throughput biological research has generated vast amounts of multi-omics big data on sarcoidosis, but their significance remains to be determined. We sought to identify novel candidate regions, and genes consistently altered in heterogeneous omics studies so as to reveal the underlying molecular mechanisms. We conducted a comprehensive integrative literature analysis on global data on sarcoidosis, including genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and phenomic studies. We performed positional integration analysis of 38 eligible datasets originating from 17 different biological layers. Using the integration interval length of 50 kb, we identified 54 regions reaching significance value p â¤ 0.0001 and 15 regions with significance value p â¤ 0.00001, when applying more stringent criteria. Secondary literature analysis of the top 20 regions, with the most significant accumulation of signals, revealed several novel candidate genes for which associations with sarcoidosis have not yet been established, but have considerable support for their involvement based on omic data. These new plausible candidate genes include NELFE, CFB, EGFL7, AGPAT2, FKBPL, NRC3, and NEU1. Furthermore, annotated data were prepared to enable custom visualization and browsing of these sarcoidosis related omics evidence in the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) Genome Browser. Further multi-omics approaches are called for sarcoidosis biomarkers and diagnostic and therapeutic innovation. Our approach for harnessing multi-omics data and the findings presented herein reflect important steps toward understanding the etiology and underlying pathological mechanisms of sarcoidosis.",29688803,,10.1089/omi.2018.0027,5,Omics : a journal of integrative biology,101131135,3.978,0.4967671036720276,0.5752508361204013,0.23745819397993312,0.4606020682232835
Integrative multi-omics characterization reveals sex differences in glioblastoma,"Background:Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and lethal primary brain tumor in adults, with limited treatment modalities and poor prognosis. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of considering sex differences in cancer incidence, prognosis, molecular disparities, and treatment outcomes across various tumor types, including colorectal adenocarcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, and GBM.Methods:We performed comprehensive analyses of large-scale multi-omics data (genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data) from TCGA, GLASS, and CPTAC to investigate the genetic and molecular determinants that contribute to the unique clinical properties of male and female GBM patients.Results:Our results revealed several key differences, including enrichments of MGMT promoter methylation, which correlated with increased overall and post-recurrence survival and improved response to chemotherapy in female patients. Moreover, female GBM exhibited a higher degree of genomic instability, including aneuploidy and tumor mutational burden. Integrative proteomic and phosphor-proteomic characterization uncovered sex-specific protein abundance and phosphorylation activities, including EGFR activation in males and SPP1 hyperphosphorylation in female patients. Lastly, the identified sex-specific biomarkers demonstrated prognostic significance, suggesting their potential as therapeutic targets.Conclusions:Collectively, our study provides unprecedented insights into the fundamental modulators of tumor progression and clinical outcomes between male and female GBM patients and facilitates sex-specific treatment interventions. Highlights Female GBM patients were characterized by increased MGMT promoter methylation and favorable clinical outcomes compared to male patients. Female GBMs exhibited higher levels of genomic instability, including aneuploidy and TMB. Each sex-specific GBM is characterized by unique pathway dysregulations and molecular subtypes.

Multi-Omics Analysis of NCI-60 Cell Line Data Reveals Novel Metabolic Processes Linked with Resistance to Alkylating Anti-Cancer Agents,"This study aimed to elucidate the molecular determinants influencing the response of cancer cells to alkylating agents, a major class of chemotherapeutic drugs used in cancer treatment. The study utilized data from the National Cancer Institute (NCI)-60 cell line screening program and employed a comprehensive multi-omics approach integrating transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic, and SNP data. Through integrated pathway analysis, the study identified key metabolic pathways, such as cysteine and methionine metabolism, starch and sucrose metabolism, pyrimidine metabolism, and purine metabolism, that differentiate drug-sensitive and drug-resistant cancer cells. The analysis also revealed potential druggable targets within these pathways. Furthermore, copy number variant (CNV) analysis, derived from SNP data, between sensitive and resistant cells identified notable differences in genes associated with metabolic changes (WWOX, CNTN5, DDAH1, PGR), protein trafficking (ARL17B, VAT1L), and miRNAs (MIR1302-2, MIR3163, MIR1244-3, MIR1302-9).

PROMO: an interactive tool for analyzing clinically-labeled multi-omic cancer datasets,"Background:Analysis of large genomic datasets along with their accompanying clinical information has shown great promise in cancer research over the last decade. Such datasets typically include thousands of samples, each measured by one or several high-throughput technologies ('omics') and annotated with extensive clinical information. While instrumental for fulfilling the promise of personalized medicine, the analysis and visualization of such large datasets is challenging and necessitates programming skills and familiarity with a large array of software tools to be used for the various steps of the analysis.Results:We developed PROMO (Profiler of Multi-Omic data), a friendly, fully interactive stand-alone software for analyzing large genomic cancer datasets together with their associated clinical information. The tool provides an array of built-in methods and algorithms for importing, preprocessing, visualizing, clustering, clinical label enrichment testing, and survival analysis that can be performed on a single or multi-omic dataset. The tool can be used for quick exploration and stratification of tumor samples taken from patients into clinically significant molecular subtypes. Identification of prognostic biomarkers and generation of simple subtype classifiers are additional important features. We review PROMO's main features and demonstrate its analysis capabilities on a breast cancer cohort from TCGA.Conclusions:PROMO provides a single integrated solution for swiftly performing a complete analysis of cancer genomic data for subtype discovery and biomarker identification without writing a single line of code, and can, therefore, make the analysis of these data much easier for cancer biologists and biomedical researchers.

Advancing neuro-oncology of glial tumors from big data and multidisciplinary studies,"Introduction:Multidisciplinary studies for glial tumors has produced an enormous amount of information including imaging, histology, and a large cohort of molecular data (i.e. genomics, epigenomics, metabolomics, proteomics, etc.). The big data resources are made possible through open access that offers great potential for new biomarker or therapeutic intervention via deep-learning and/or machine learning for integrated multi-omics analysis. An equally important effort to define the hallmarks of glial tumors will also advance precision neuro-oncology and inform patient-specific therapeutics. This review summarizes past studies regarding tumor classification, hallmarks of cancer, and hypothetical mechanisms. Leveraging on advanced big data approaches and ongoing cross-disciplinary endeavors, this review also discusses how to integrate multiple layers of big data toward the goal of precision medicine.Results:In addition to basic research of cancer biology, the results from integrated multi-omics analysis will highlight biological processes and potential candidates as biomarkers or therapeutic targets. Ultimately, these collective resources built upon an armamentarium of accessible data can re-form clinical and molecular data to stratify patient-tailored therapy.Conclusion:We envision that a comprehensive understanding of the link between molecular signatures, tumor locations, and patients' history will identify a molecular taxonomy of glial tumors to advance the improvements in early diagnosis, prevention, and treatment.",31853838,,10.1007/s11060-019-03369-8,2,Journal of neuro-oncology,8309335,4.506,0.49161607027053833,0.33444816053511706,0.27759197324414714,0.4173776689181758
Serverless computing in omics data analysis and integration,"A comprehensive analysis of omics data can require vast computational resources and access to varied data sources that must be integrated into complex, multi-step analysis pipelines. Execution of many such analyses can be accelerated by applying the cloud computing paradigm, which provides scalable resources for storing data of different types and parallelizing data analysis computations. Moreover, these resources can be reused for different multi-omics analysis scenarios. Traditionally, developers are required to manage a cloud platform's underlying infrastructure, configuration, maintenance and capacity planning. The serverless computing paradigm simplifies these operations by automatically allocating and maintaining both servers and virtual machines, as required for analysis tasks. This paradigm offers highly parallel execution and high scalability without manual management of the underlying infrastructure, freeing developers to focus on operational logic. This paper reviews serverless solutions in bioinformatics and evaluates their usage in omics data analysis and integration. We start by reviewing the application of the cloud computing model to a multi-omics data analysis and exposing some shortcomings of the early approaches. We then introduce the serverless computing paradigm and show its applicability for performing an integrative analysis of multiple omics data sources in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.",34505137,PMC8499876,10.1093/bib/bbab349,5,Briefings in bioinformatics,100912837,13.994,0.4910593032836914,0.5785953177257525,0.8729096989966555,0.5849365853146964
Multi-omics analysis reveals that ferroptosis-related gene CISD2 is a prognostic biomarker of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,"Background:Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a prevalent malignancy, with high mortality rate and unavailability of accurate therapies. However, its early prevention remains a challenge. In the purview of predictive, preventive, and personalized medicine (PPPM), it is paramount to identify novel and powerful biomarkers. CISD2 is a crucial regulator of iron homeostasis and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Recent studies showed that the NEET protein (NAF-1) encoded by CISD2 is involved in regulating the proliferation and metastasis of tumor cells. Nevertheless, the prognostic value and immunological correlations of CISD2 remain unclear.Methods:Bioinformatics analyses conducted utilizing data from comprehensive databases The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). All statistical evaluations were executed employing R software.Results:Our investigation of biological function, enrichment pathway, and immune correlation revealed a discernable linkage between CISD2 and the immune response. Moreover, we found that the suppression of CISD2 is associated with immune cell infiltration and various immune signatures.Conclusions:The present study successfully revealed the potential prognostic and biological function of CISD2 in HNSCC.

Estimating gene expression from DNA methylation and copy number variation: A deep learning regression model for multi-omics integration,"Gene expression analysis plays a significant role for providing molecular insights in cancer. Various genetic and epigenetic factors (being dealt under multi-omics) affect gene expression giving rise to cancer phenotypes. A recent growth in understanding of multi-omics seems to provide a resource for integration in interdisciplinary biology since they altogether can draw the comprehensive picture of an organism's developmental and disease biology in cancers. Such large scale multi-omics data can be obtained from public consortium like The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and several other platforms. Integrating these multi-omics data from varied platforms is still challenging due to high noise and sensitivity of the platforms used. Currently, a robust integrative predictive model to estimate gene expression from these genetic and epigenetic data is lacking. In this study, we have developed a deep learning-based predictive model using Deep Denoising Auto-encoder (DDAE) and Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) that can quantitatively capture how genetic and epigenetic alterations correlate with directionality of gene expression for liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC). The DDAE used in the study has been trained to extract significant features from the input omics data to estimate the gene expression. These features have then been used for back-propagation learning by the multilayer perceptron for the task of regression and classification. We have benchmarked the proposed model against state-of-the-art regression models. Finally, the deep learning-based integration model has been evaluated for its disease classification capability, where an accuracy of 95.1% has been obtained.",32234433,,10.1016/j.ygeno.2020.03.021,16,Genomics,8800135,4.31,0.4901365041732788,0.802675585284281,0.25752508361204013,0.5061220362832315

A multi-omic approach offers a holistic view to better understand the mechanisms of COVID-19. We used state-of-the-art statistical learning methods to integrate genomics, metabolomics, proteomics, and lipidomics data obtained from 123 patients experiencing COVID-19 or COVID-19-like symptoms for the purpose of identifying molecular signatures and corresponding pathways associated with the disease.Results:We constructed and validated molecular scores and evaluated their utility beyond clinical factors known to impact disease status and severity. We identified inflammation- and immune response-related pathways, and other pathways, providing insights into possible consequences of the disease.Conclusions:The molecular scores we derived were strongly associated with disease status and severity and can be used to identify individuals at a higher risk for developing severe disease. These findings have the potential to provide further, and needed, insights into why certain individuals develop worse outcomes.",37308820,PMC10259816,10.1186/s12864-023-09410-5,2,BMC genomics,100965258,4.547,0.4892289936542511,0.3377926421404682,0.29431438127090304,0.41995880087482484
"Integrative analysis of genomic, epigenomic and transcriptomic data identified molecular subtypes of esophageal carcinoma","Esophageal cancer (EC) involves many genomic, epigenetic and transcriptomic disorders, which play key roles in the heterogeneous progression of cancer. However, the study of EC with multi-omics has not been conducted. This study identified a high consistency between DNA copy number variations and abnormal methylations in EC by analyzing genomics, epigenetics and transcriptomics data and investigating mutual correlations of DNA copy number variation, methylation and gene expressions, and stratified copy number variation genes (CNV-Gs) and methylation genes (MET-Gs). The methylation, CNVs and expression profiles of CNV-Gs and MET-Gs were analyzed by consistent clustering using iCluster integration, here, we determined three subtypes (iC1, iC2, iC3) with different molecular traits, prognostic characteristics and tumor immune microenvironment features. We also identified 4 prognostic genes (CLDN3, FAM221A, GDF15 and YBX2) differentially expressed in the three subtypes, and could therefore be used as representative biomarkers for the three subtypes of EC. In conclusion, by performing comprehensive analysis on genomic, epigenetic and transcriptomic regulations, the current study provided new insights into the multilayer molecular and pathological traits of EC, and contributed to the precision medication for EC patients.",33638948,PMC7993659,10.18632/aging.202556,4,Aging,101508617,5.955,0.48705580830574036,0.4882943143812709,0.47491638795986624,0.4848756254516717
Integrative multi-omics analysis reveals novel idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis endotypes associated with disease progression,"Background:Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is characterized by the accumulation of extracellular matrix in the pulmonary interstitium and progressive functional decline. We hypothesized that integration of multi-omics data would identify clinically meaningful molecular endotypes of IPF.Methods:The IPF-PRO Registry is a prospective registry of patients with IPF. Proteomic and transcriptomic (including total RNA [toRNA] and microRNA [miRNA]) analyses were performed using blood collected at enrollment. Molecular data were integrated using Similarity Network Fusion, followed by unsupervised spectral clustering to identify molecular subtypes. Cox proportional hazards models tested the relationship between these subtypes and progression-free and transplant-free survival. The molecular subtypes were compared to risk groups based on a previously described 52-gene (toRNA expression) signature. Biological characteristics of the molecular subtypes were evaluated via linear regression differential expression and canonical pathways (Ingenuity Pathway Analysis [IPA]) over-representation analyses.Results:Among 232 subjects, two molecular subtypes were identified. Subtype 1 (n = 105, 45.3%) and Subtype 2 (n = 127, 54.7%) had similar distributions of age (70.1 +/- 8.1 vs. 69.3 +/- 7.6 years; p = 0.31) and sex (79.1% vs. 70.1% males, p = 0.16). Subtype 1 had more severe disease based on composite physiologic index (CPI) (55.8 vs. 51.2; p = 0.002). After adjusting for CPI and antifibrotic treatment at enrollment, subtype 1 experienced shorter progression-free survival (HR 1.79, 95% CI 1.28,2.56; p = 0.0008) and similar transplant-free survival (HR 1.30, 95% CI 0.87,1.96; p = 0.20) as subtype 2. There was little agreement in the distribution of subjects to the molecular subtypes and the risk groups based on 52-gene signature (kappa = 0.04, 95% CI= -0.08, 0.17), and the 52-gene signature risk groups were associated with differences in transplant-free but not progression-free survival. Based on heatmaps and differential expression analyses, proteins and miRNAs (but not toRNA) contributed to classification of subjects to the molecular subtypes. The IPA showed enrichment in pulmonary fibrosis-relevant pathways, including mTOR, VEGF, PDGF, and B-cell receptor signaling.Conclusions:Integration of transcriptomic and proteomic data from blood enabled identification of clinically meaningful molecular endotypes of IPF. If validated, these endotypes could facilitate identification of individuals likely to experience disease progression and enrichment of clinical trials.Trial registration:NCT01915511.",37344825,PMC10283254,10.1186/s12931-023-02435-0,3,Respiratory research,101090633,7.162,0.48595795035362244,0.4180602006688963,0.6889632107023411,0.512979452486421

Cancer subtype identification by consensus guided graph autoencoders,"Motivation:Cancer subtype identification aims to divide cancer patients into subgroups with distinct clinical phenotypes and facilitate the development for subgroup specific therapies. The massive amount of multi-omics datasets accumulated in the public databases have provided unprecedented opportunities to fulfill this task. As a result, great computational efforts have been made to accurately identify cancer subtypes via integrative analysis of these multi-omics datasets.Results:In this article, we propose a Consensus Guided Graph Autoencoder (CGGA) to effectively identify cancer subtypes. First, we learn for each omic a new feature matrix by using graph autoencoders, where both structure information and node features can be effectively incorporated during the learning process. Second, we learn a set of omic-specific similarity matrices together with a consensus matrix based on the features obtained in the first step. The learned omic-specific similarity matrices are then fed back to the graph autoencoders to guide the feature learning. By iterating the two steps above, our method obtains a final consensus similarity matrix for cancer subtyping. To comprehensively evaluate the prediction performance of our method, we compare CGGA with several approaches ranging from general-purpose multi-view clustering algorithms to multi-omics-specific integrative methods. The experimental results on both generic datasets and cancer datasets confirm the superiority of our method. Moreover, we validate the effectiveness of our method in leveraging multi-omics datasets to identify cancer subtypes. In addition, we investigate the clinical implications of the obtained clusters for glioblastoma and provide new insights into the treatment for patients with different subtypes.Availabilityand implementation:The source code of our method is freely available at https://github.com/alcs417/CGGA.Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",34289034,,10.1093/bioinformatics/btab535,5,"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",9808944,6.931,0.4853557348251343,0.5819397993311036,0.6220735785953178,0.5320161164803648
Integrative Omics to Characterize and Classify Pulmonary Vascular Disease,"Advances in high-throughput biotechnologies have facilitated omics profiling, a key component of precision phenotyping, in patients with pulmonary vascular disease. Omics provides comprehensive information pertaining to genes, transcripts, proteins, and metabolites. The resulting omics big datasets may be integrated for more robust results and are amenable to analysis using machine learning or newer analytical methodologies, such as network analysis.

Omics-Based Investigations of Breast Cancer,"Breast cancer (BC) is characterized by an extensive genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity. In-depth investigations into the molecular bases of BC phenotypes, carcinogenesis, progression, and metastasis are necessary for accurate diagnoses, prognoses, and therapy assessments in predictive, precision, and personalized oncology. This review discusses both classic as well as several novel omics fields that are involved or should be used in modern BC investigations, which may be integrated as a holistic term, onco-breastomics. Rapid and recent advances in molecular profiling strategies and analytical techniques based on high-throughput sequencing and mass spectrometry (MS) development have generated large-scale multi-omics datasets, mainly emerging from the three ""big omics"", based on the central dogma of molecular biology: genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics. Metabolomics-based approaches also reflect the dynamic response of BC cells to genetic modifications. Interactomics promotes a holistic view in BC research by constructing and characterizing protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks that provide a novel hypothesis for the pathophysiological processes involved in BC progression and subtyping. The emergence of new omics- and epiomics-based multidimensional approaches provide opportunities to gain insights into BC heterogeneity and its underlying mechanisms. The three main epiomics fields (epigenomics, epitranscriptomics, and epiproteomics) are focused on the epigenetic DNA changes, RNAs modifications, and posttranslational modifications (PTMs) affecting protein functions for an in-depth understanding of cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Novel omics fields, such as epichaperomics or epimetabolomics, could investigate the modifications in the interactome induced by stressors and provide PPI changes, as well as in metabolites, as drivers of BC-causing phenotypes. Over the last years, several proteomics-derived omics, such as matrisomics, exosomics, secretomics, kinomics, phosphoproteomics, or immunomics, provided valuable data for a deep understanding of dysregulated pathways in BC cells and their tumor microenvironment (TME) or tumor immune microenvironment (TIMW). Most of these omics datasets are still assessed individually using distinct approches and do not generate the desired and expected global-integrative knowledge with applications in clinical diagnostics. However, several hyphenated omics approaches, such as proteo-genomics, proteo-transcriptomics, and phosphoproteomics-exosomics are useful for the identification of putative BC biomarkers and therapeutic targets. To develop non-invasive diagnostic tests and to discover new biomarkers for BC, classic and novel omics-based strategies allow for significant advances in blood/plasma-based omics. Salivaomics, urinomics, and milkomics appear as integrative omics that may develop a high potential for early and non-invasive diagnoses in BC. Thus, the analysis of the tumor circulome is considered a novel frontier in liquid biopsy. Omics-based investigations have applications in BC modeling, as well as accurate BC classification and subtype characterization. The future in omics-based investigations of BC may be also focused on multi-omics single-cell analyses.",37375323,PMC10302907,10.3390/molecules28124768,8,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",100964009,4.927,0.4839532673358917,0.6923076923076923,0.3712374581939799,0.5030809905018695
Performance analysis of data resampling on class imbalance and classification techniques on multi-omics data for cancer classification,"Cancer, in any of its forms, remains a significant public health concern worldwide. Advances in early detection and treatment could lead to a decline in the overall death rate from cancer in recent decades. Therefore, tumor prediction and classification play an important role in fighting cancer. This study built computational models for a joint analysis of RNA seq, copy number variation (CNV), and DNA methylation to classify normal and tumor samples across liver cancer, breast cancer, and colon adenocarcinoma from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset. Total of 18 machine learning methods were evaluated based on the AUC, precision, recall, and F-measure. Besides, five techniques were compared to ameliorate problems of class imbalance in the cancer datasets. Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) demonstrated the best performance. The results indicate that the model applying Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) for learning binary class SVM with hinge loss has the highest classification results on liver cancer and breast cancer datasets, with accuracy over 99% and AUC greater than or equal to 0.999. For colon adenocarcinoma dataset, both SGD and Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) that implements John Platt's sequential minimal optimization algorithm for training a support vector machine shows an outstanding classification performance with accuracy of 100%, AUC, precision, recall, and F-measure all at 1.000.",38422094,PMC10903850,10.1371/journal.pone.0293607,0,PloS one,101285081,3.752,0.4826424717903137,0.10033444816053512,0.20066889632107024,0.34978615197050933
Identification of three lncRNA-related prognostic signatures in gastric cancer by integrated multi-omics analysis,"Aims:The systematic identification of molecular features correlated with the clinical status of gastric cancer (GC) in patients is significant, although such investigation remains insufficient.Methods:GC subtyping based on RNA sequencing, copy number variation and DNA methylation data were derived from The Cancer Genome Atlas program. Prognostics lncRNA biomarkers for GC were identified by univariate Cox, LASSO and SVM-RFE analysis.Results:Three molecular subtypes with significant survival discrepancies, and their specific DEmRNAs and DElncRNAs were identified.

Multi-omics integrative modelling for stereotactic body radiotherapy in early-stage non-small cell lung cancer: clinical trial protocol of the MONDRIAN study,"Background:Currently, main treatment strategies for early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (ES-NSCLC) disease are surgery or stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), with successful local control rates for both approaches. However, regional and distant failure remain critical in SBRT, and it is paramount to identify predictive factors of response to identify high-risk patients who may benefit from more aggressive approaches. The main endpoint of the MONDRIAN trial is to identify multi-omic biomarkers of SBRT response integrating information from the individual fields of radiomics, genomics and proteomics.Methods:MONDRIAN is a prospective observational explorative cohort clinical study, with a data-driven, bottom-up approach. It is expected to enroll 100 ES-NSCLC SBRT candidates treated at an Italian tertiary cancer center with well-recognized expertise in SBRT and thoracic surgery. To identify predictors specific to SBRT, MONDRIAN will include data from 200 patients treated with surgery, in a 1:2 ratio, with comparable clinical characteristics. The project will have an overall expected duration of 60 months, and will be structured into five main tasks: (i) Clinical Study; (ii) Imaging/ Radiomic Study, (iii) Gene Expression Study, (iv) Proteomic Study, (v) Integrative Model Building.Discussion:Thanks to its multi-disciplinary nature, MONDRIAN is expected to provide the opportunity to characterize ES-NSCLC from a multi-omic perspective, with a Radiation Oncology-oriented focus. Other than contributing to a mechanistic understanding of the disease, the study will assist the identification of high-risk patients in a largely unexplored clinical setting. Ultimately, this would orient further clinical research efforts on the combination of SBRT and systemic treatments, such as immunotherapy, with the perspective of improving oncological outcomes in this subset of patients.Trial registration:The study was prospectively registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT05974475).",38102575,PMC10722797,10.1186/s12885-023-11701-9,0,BMC cancer,100967800,4.638,0.4816671311855316,0.10702341137123746,0.3110367892976589,0.3726123188450982
Multi-omics research strategies in ischemic stroke: A multidimensional perspective,"Ischemic stroke (IS) is a multifactorial and heterogeneous neurological disorder with high rate of death and long-term impairment. Despite years of studies, there are still no stroke biomarkers for clinical practice, and the molecular mechanisms of stroke remain largely unclear. The high-throughput omics approach provides new avenues for discovering biomarkers of IS and explaining its pathological mechanisms. However, single-omics approaches only provide a limited understanding of the biological pathways of diseases. The integration of multiple omics data means the simultaneous analysis of thousands of genes, RNAs, proteins and metabolites, revealing networks of interactions between multiple molecular levels. Integrated analysis of multi-omics approaches will provide helpful insights into stroke pathogenesis, therapeutic target identification and biomarker discovery. Here, we consider advances in genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics and outline their use in discovering the biomarkers and pathological mechanisms of IS. We then delineate strategies for achieving integration at the multi-omics level and discuss how integrative omics and systems biology can contribute to our understanding and management of IS.",36087702,,10.1016/j.arr.2022.101730,12,Ageing research reviews,101128963,11.788,0.4809814989566803,0.7525083612040134,0.8160535117056856,0.602301273955948
Multi-omic analysis of the tumor microenvironment shows clinical correlations in Ph1 study of atezolizumab +/- SoC in MM,"Multiple myeloma (MM) remains incurable, and treatment of relapsed/refractory (R/R) disease is challenging. There is an unmet need for more targeted therapies in this setting; deep cellular and molecular phenotyping of the tumor and microenvironment in MM could help guide such therapies. This phase 1b study (NCT02431208) evaluated the safety and efficacy of the anti-programmed death-ligand 1 monoclonal antibody atezolizumab (Atezo) alone or in combination with the standard of care (SoC) treatments lenalidomide (Len) or pomalidomide (Pom) and/or daratumumab (Dara) in patients with R/R MM. Study endpoints included incidence of adverse events (AEs) and overall response rate (ORR). A novel unsupervised integrative multi-omic analysis was performed using RNA sequencing, mass cytometry immunophenotyping, and proteomic profiling of baseline and on-treatment bone marrow samples from patients receiving Atezo monotherapy or Atezo+Dara. A similarity network fusion (SNF) algorithm was applied to preprocessed data. Eighty-five patients were enrolled. Treatment-emergent deaths occurred in 2 patients; both deaths were considered unrelated to study treatment. ORRs ranged from 11.1% (Atezo+Len cohorts, n=18) to 83.3% (Atezo+Dara+Pom cohort, n=6). High-dimensional multi-omic profiling of the tumor microenvironment and integrative SNF analysis revealed novel correlations between cellular and molecular features of the tumor and immune microenvironment, patient selection criteria, and clinical outcome. Atezo monotherapy and SoC combinations were safe in this patient population and demonstrated some evidence of clinical efficacy. Integrative analysis of high dimensional genomics and immune data identified novel clinical correlations that may inform patient selection criteria and outcome assessment in future immunotherapy studies for myeloma.",37559718,PMC10408441,10.3389/fimmu.2023.1085893,1,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,8.786,0.4798540472984314,0.26755852842809363,0.782608695652174,0.4979458731951124
Network-based integrative analysis of single-cell transcriptomic and epigenomic data for cell types,"Advances in single-cell biotechnologies simultaneously generate the transcriptomic and epigenomic profiles at cell levels, providing an opportunity for investigating cell fates. Although great efforts have been devoted to either of them, the integrative analysis of single-cell multi-omics data is really limited because of the heterogeneity, noises and sparsity of single-cell profiles. In this study, a network-based integrative clustering algorithm (aka NIC) is present for the identification of cell types by fusing the parallel single-cell transcriptomic (scRNA-seq) and epigenomic profiles (scATAC-seq or DNA methylation). To avoid heterogeneity of multi-omics data, NIC automatically learns the cell-cell similarity graphs, which transforms the fusion of multi-omics data into the analysis of multiple networks. Then, NIC employs joint non-negative matrix factorization to learn the shared features of cells by exploiting the structure of learned cell-cell similarity networks, providing a better way to characterize the features of cells. The graph learning and integrative analysis procedures are jointly formulated as an optimization problem, and then the update rules are derived. Thirteen single-cell multi-omics datasets from various tissues and organisms are adopted to validate the performance of NIC, and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of various measurements. The proposed algorithm provides an effective strategy for the integrative analysis of single-cell multi-omics data (The software is coded using Matlab, and is freely available for academic https://github.com/xkmaxidian/NIC ).",35043143,,10.1093/bib/bbab546,4,Briefings in bioinformatics,100912837,13.994,0.47907713055610657,0.49498327759197325,0.8762541806020067,0.5616937699724599
Integrated multi-omics profiling yields a clinically relevant molecular classification for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma,"Integrated molecular analysis of human cancer has yielded molecular classification for precise management of cancer patients. Here, we analyzed the whole genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data of 155 esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCCs). Multi-omics analysis led to the classification of ESCCs into four subtypes: cell cycle pathway activation, NRF2 oncogenic activation, immune suppression (IS), and immune modulation (IM). IS and IM cases were highly immune infiltrated but differed in the type and distribution of immune cells. IM cases showed better response to immune checkpoint blockade therapy than other subtypes in a clinical trial. We further developed a classifier with 28 features to identify the IM subtype, which predicted anti-PD-1 therapy response with 85.7% sensitivity and 90% specificity. These results emphasize the clinical value of unbiased molecular classification based on multi-omics data and have the potential to further improve the understanding and treatment of ESCC.",36584672,,10.1016/j.ccell.2022.12.004,23,Cancer cell,101130617,38.585,0.4789096415042877,0.8461538461538461,0.9832775919732442,0.6532320725279908
Interpretation of network-based integration from multi-omics longitudinal data,"Multi-omics integration is key to fully understand complex biological processes in an holistic manner. Furthermore, multi-omics combined with new longitudinal experimental design can unreveal dynamic relationships between omics layers and identify key players or interactions in system development or complex phenotypes. However, integration methods have to address various experimental designs and do not guarantee interpretable biological results. The new challenge of multi-omics integration is to solve interpretation and unlock the hidden knowledge within the multi-omics data. In this paper, we go beyond integration and propose a generic approach to face the interpretation problem. From multi-omics longitudinal data, this approach builds and explores hybrid multi-omics networks composed of both inferred and known relationships within and between omics layers. With smart node labelling and propagation analysis, this approach predicts regulation mechanisms and multi-omics functional modules. We applied the method on 3 case studies with various multi-omics designs and identified new multi-layer interactions involved in key biological functions that could not be revealed with single omics analysis. Moreover, we highlighted interplay in the kinetics that could help identify novel biological mechanisms. This method is available as an R package netOmics to readily suit any application.",34883510,PMC8934642,10.1093/nar/gkab1200,20,Nucleic acids research,411011,19.16,0.4787572920322418,0.8327759197324415,0.959866220735786,0.6457828033129906
Deep learning based feature-level integration of multi-omics data for breast cancer patients survival analysis,"Background:Breast cancer is the most prevalent and among the most deadly cancers in females. Patients with breast cancer have highly variable survival lengths, indicating a need to identify prognostic biomarkers for personalized diagnosis and treatment. With the development of new technologies such as next-generation sequencing, multi-omics information are becoming available for a more thorough evaluation of a patient's condition. In this study, we aim to improve breast cancer overall survival prediction by integrating multi-omics data (e.g., gene expression, DNA methylation, miRNA expression, and copy number variations (CNVs)).Methods:Motivated by multi-view learning, we propose a novel strategy to integrate multi-omics data for breast cancer survival prediction by applying complementary and consensus principles. The complementary principle assumes each -omics data contains modality-unique information. To preserve such information, we develop a concatenation autoencoder (ConcatAE) that concatenates the hidden features learned from each modality for integration. The consensus principle assumes that the disagreements among modalities upper bound the model errors. To get rid of the noises or discrepancies among modalities, we develop a cross-modality autoencoder (CrossAE) to maximize the agreement among modalities to achieve a modality-invariant representation. We first validate the effectiveness of our proposed models on the MNIST simulated data. We then apply these models to the TCCA breast cancer multi-omics data for overall survival prediction.Results:For breast cancer overall survival prediction, the integration of DNA methylation and miRNA expression achieves the best overall performance of 0.641 Â± 0.031 with ConcatAE, and 0.63 Â± 0.081 with CrossAE. Both strategies outperform baseline single-modality models using only DNA methylation (0.583 Â± 0.058) or miRNA expression (0.616 Â± 0.057).Conclusions:In conclusion, we achieve improved overall survival prediction performance by utilizing either the complementary or consensus information among multi-omics data. The proposed ConcatAE and CrossAE models can inspire future deep representation-based multi-omics integration techniques. We believe these novel multi-omics integration models can benefit the personalized diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer patients.",32933515,PMC7493161,10.1186/s12911-020-01225-8,26,BMC medical informatics and decision making,101088682,3.298,0.47731050848960876,0.8695652173913043,0.11705685618729098,0.4837107198094843
Two-step multi-omics modelling of drug sensitivity in cancer cell lines to identify driving mechanisms,"Drug sensitivity prediction models for human cancer cell lines constitute important tools in identifying potential computational biomarkers for responsiveness in a pre-clinical setting. Integrating information derived from a range of heterogeneous data is crucial, but remains non-trivial, as differences in data structures may hinder fitting algorithms from assigning adequate weights to complementary information that is contained in distinct omics data. In order to counteract this effect that tends to lead to just one data type dominating supposedly multi-omics models, we developed a novel tool that enables users to train single-omics models separately in a first step and to integrate them into a multi-omics model in a second step. Extensive ablation studies are performed in order to facilitate an in-depth evaluation of the respective contributions of singular data types and of combinations thereof, effectively identifying redundancies and interdependencies between them. Moreover, the integration of the single-omics models is realized by a range of distinct classification algorithms, thus allowing for a performance comparison. Sets of molecular events and tissue types found to be related to significant shifts in drug sensitivity are returned to facilitate a comprehensive and straightforward analysis of potential computational biomarkers for drug responsiveness. Our two-step approach yields sets of actual multi-omics pan-cancer classification models that are highly predictive for a majority of drugs in the GDSC data base. In the context of targeted drugs with particular modes of action, its predictive performances compare favourably to those of classification models that incorporate multi-omics data in a simple one-step approach. Additionally, case studies demonstrate that it succeeds both in correctly identifying known key biomarkers for sensitivity towards specific drug compounds as well as in providing sets of potential candidates for additional computational biomarkers.",33226984,PMC7682852,10.1371/journal.pone.0238961,3,PloS one,101285081,3.752,0.47662535309791565,0.4214046822742475,0.2040133779264214,0.41105882389888315
Ovarian cancer beyond imaging: integration of AI and multiomics biomarkers,"High-grade serous ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynaecological malignancy. Detailed molecular studies have revealed marked intra-patient heterogeneity at the tumour microenvironment level, likely contributing to poor prognosis. Despite large quantities of clinical, molecular and imaging data on ovarian cancer being accumulated worldwide and the rise of high-throughput computing, data frequently remain siloed and are thus inaccessible for integrated analyses. Only a minority of studies on ovarian cancer have set out to harness artificial intelligence (AI) for the integration of multiomics data and for developing powerful algorithms that capture the characteristics of ovarian cancer at multiple scales and levels. Clinical data, serum markers, and imaging data were most frequently used, followed by genomics and transcriptomics. The current literature proves that integrative multiomics approaches outperform models based on single data types and indicates that imaging can be used for the longitudinal tracking of tumour heterogeneity in space and potentially over time. This review presents an overview of studies that integrated two or more data types to develop AI-based classifiers or prediction models.Relevance statement Integrative multiomics models for ovarian cancer outperform models using single data types for classification, prognostication, and predictive tasks.Key pointsâ¢ This review presents studies using multiomics and artificial intelligence in ovarian cancer.â¢ Current literature proves that integrative multiomics outperform models using single data types.â¢ Around 60% of studies used a combination of imaging with clinical data.â¢ The combination of genomics and transcriptomics with imaging data was infrequently used.",37700218,PMC10497482,10.1186/s41747-023-00364-7,3,European radiology experimental,101721752,0.0,0.47636649012565613,0.42474916387959866,0.046822742474916385,0.3801342753462967
Integrative pathway-based survival prediction utilizing the interaction between gene expression and DNA methylation in breast cancer,"Background:Integrative analysis on multi-omics data has gained much attention recently. To investigate the interactive effect of gene expression and DNA methylation on cancer, we propose a directed random walk-based approach on an integrated gene-gene graph that is guided by pathway information.Methods:Our approach first extracts a single pathway profile matrix out of the gene expression and DNA methylation data by performing the random walk over the integrated graph. We then apply a denoising autoencoder to the pathway profile to further identify important pathway features and genes. The extracted features are validated in the survival prediction task for breast cancer patients.Results:The results show that the proposed method substantially improves the survival prediction performance compared to that of other pathway-based prediction methods, revealing that the combined effect of gene expression and methylation data is well reflected in the integrated gene-gene graph combined with pathway information. Furthermore, we show that our joint analysis on the methylation features and gene expression profile identifies cancer-specific pathways with genes related to breast cancer.Conclusions:In this study, we proposed a DRW-based method on an integrated gene-gene graph with expression and methylation profiles in order to utilize the interactions between them. The results showed that the constructed integrated gene-gene graph can successfully reflect the combined effect of methylation features on gene expression profiles. We also found that the selected features by DA can effectively extract topologically important pathways and genes specifically related to breast cancer.",30255812,PMC6157196,10.1186/s12920-018-0389-z,11,BMC medical genomics,101319628,3.622,0.47557488083839417,0.7391304347826086,0.1705685618729097,0.46728472783414016

MOMA vectorizes features and modules using a geometric approach and focuses on important modules in multi-omics data via an attention mechanism.

Vertical and horizontal integration of multi-omics data with miodin,"Background:Studies on multiple modalities of omics data such as transcriptomics, genomics and proteomics are growing in popularity, since they allow us to investigate complex mechanisms across molecular layers. It is widely recognized that integrative omics analysis holds the promise to unlock novel and actionable biological insights into health and disease. Integration of multi-omics data remains challenging, however, and requires combination of several software tools and extensive technical expertise to account for the properties of heterogeneous data.Results:This paper presents the miodin R package, which provides a streamlined workflow-based syntax for multi-omics data analysis. The package allows users to perform analysis of omics data either across experiments on the same samples (vertical integration), or across studies on the same variables (horizontal integration).

Integrated Transcriptomic-Proteomic Analysis Using a Proteogenomic Workflow Refines Rat Genome Annotation,"Proteogenomic re-annotation and mRNA splicing information can lead to the discovery of various protein forms for eukaryotic model organisms like rat. However, detection of novel proteoforms using mass spectrometry proteomics data remains a formidable challenge. We developed EuGenoSuite, an open source multiple algorithmic proteomic search tool and utilized it in our in-house integrated transcriptomic-proteomic pipeline to facilitate automated proteogenomic analysis. Using four proteogenomic pipelines (integrated transcriptomic-proteomic, Peppy, Enosi, and ProteoAnnotator) on publicly available RNA-sequence and MS proteomics data, we discovered 363 novel peptides in rat brain microglia representing novel proteoforms for 249 gene loci in the rat genome. These novel peptides aided in the discovery of novel exons, translation of annotated untranslated regions, pseudogenes, and splice variants for various loci; many of which have known disease associations, including neurological disorders like schizophrenia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, etc. Novel isoforms were also discovered for genes implicated in cardiovascular diseases and breast cancer for which rats are considered model organisms.

Deciphering the omicron variant: integrated omics analysis reveals critical biomarkers and pathophysiological pathways,"Background:The rapid emergence and global dissemination of the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 have posed formidable challenges in public health. This scenario underscores the urgent need for an enhanced understanding of Omicron's pathophysiological mechanisms to guide clinical management and shape public health strategies. Our study is aimed at deciphering the intricate molecular mechanisms underlying Omicron infections, particularly focusing on the identification of specific biomarkers.Methods:This investigation employed a robust and systematic approach, initially encompassing 15 Omicron-infected patients and an equal number of healthy controls, followed by a validation cohort of 20 individuals per group. The study's methodological framework included a comprehensive multi-omics analysis that integrated proteomics and metabolomics, augmented by extensive bioinformatics. Proteomic exploration was conducted via an advanced Ultra-High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (UHPLC) system linked with mass spectrometry. Concurrently, metabolomic profiling was executed using an Ultra-Performance Liquid Chromatography (UPLC) system. The bioinformatics component, fundamental to this research, entailed an exhaustive analysis of protein-protein interactions, pathway enrichment, and metabolic network dynamics, utilizing state-of-the-art tools such as the STRING database and Cytoscape software, ensuring a holistic interpretation of the data.Results:Our proteomic inquiry identified eight notably dysregulated proteins (THBS1, ACTN1, ACTC1, POTEF, ACTB, TPM4, VCL, ICAM1) in individuals infected with the Omicron variant. These proteins play critical roles in essential physiological processes, especially within the coagulation cascade and hemostatic mechanisms, suggesting their significant involvement in the pathogenesis of Omicron infection. Complementing these proteomic insights, metabolomic analysis discerned 146 differentially expressed metabolites, intricately associated with pivotal metabolic pathways such as tryptophan metabolism, retinol metabolism, and steroid hormone biosynthesis. This comprehensive metabolic profiling sheds light on the systemic implications of Omicron infection, underscoring profound alterations in metabolic equilibrium.Conclusions:This study substantially enriches our comprehension of the physiological ramifications induced by the Omicron variant, with a particular emphasis on the pivotal roles of coagulation and platelet pathways in disease pathogenesis.

A multi-omics approach reveals mechanisms of nanomaterial toxicity and structure-activity relationships in alveolar macrophages,"In respect to the high number of released nanomaterials and their highly variable properties, novel grouping approaches are required based on the effects of nanomaterials. Proper grouping calls for a combination of an experimental setup with a higher number of structurally similar nanomaterials and for employing integrated omics approaches to identify the mode of action. Here, we analyzed the effects of seven well-characterized NMs comprising different chemical compositions, sizes and chemical surface modifications on the rat alveolar macrophage cell line NR8383. The NMs were investigated at three doses ranging from 2.5 to 10 Âµg/cm2after 24 h incubation using an integrated multi-omics approach involving untargeted proteomics, targeted metabolomics, and src homology 2 (SH2) profiling. By using Weighted Gene Correlation Network Analysis (WGCNA) for the integrative data, we identified correlations of molecular pathways with physico-chemical properties and toxicological endpoints. The three investigated SiO2 variants induced strong alterations in all three omics approaches and were, therefore, be classified as ""active."" Two organic phthalocyanines showed minor responses and Mn2O3 induced a different molecular response pattern than the other NMs. WGCNA revealed that agglomerate size and surface area as well as LDH release are among the most important parameters correlating with nanotoxicology. Moreover, we identified key drivers that can serve as representative biomarker candidates, supporting the value of multi-omics approaches to establish integrated approaches to testing and assessment (IATAs).",31774342,,10.1080/17435390.2019.1684592,10,Nanotoxicology,101233132,5.881,0.4734898805618286,0.7324414715719063,0.46488294314381273,0.523558811280241
ADAS-viewer: web-based application for integrative analysis of multi-omics data in Alzheimer's disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder and is represented by complicated biological mechanisms and complexity of brain tissue. Our understanding of the complicated molecular architecture that contributes to AD progression benefits from performing comprehensive and systemic investigations with multi-layered molecular and biological data from different brain regions. Since recently different independent studies generated various omics data in different brain regions of AD patients, multi-omics data integration can be a useful resource for better comprehensive understanding of AD. Here we present a web platform, ADAS-viewer, that provides researchers with the ability to comprehensively investigate and visualize multi-omics data from multiple brain regions of AD patients. ADAS-viewer offers means to identify functional changes in transcript and exon expression (i.e., alternative splicing) along with associated genetic or epigenetic regulatory effects. Specifically, it integrates genomic, transcriptomic, methylation, and miRNA data collected from seven different brain regions (cerebellum, temporal cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, frontal pole, inferior frontal gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus, and superior temporal gyrus) across three independent cohort datasets. ADAS-viewer is particularly useful as a web-based application for analyzing and visualizing multi-omics data across multiple brain regions at both transcript and exon level, allowing the identification of candidate biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease.",33741983,PMC7979890,10.1038/s41540-021-00177-7,4,NPJ systems biology and applications,101677786,4.671,0.47180119156837463,0.4983277591973244,0.3311036789297659,0.44896700256644284
Multi-omics integration method based on attention deep learning network for biomedical data classification,"Background and objective:Integrating multi-omics data for the comprehensive analysis of the biological processes in human diseases has become one of the most challenging tasks of bioinformatics. Deep learning (DL) algorithms have recently become one of the most promising multi-omics data integration analysis methods. However, existing DL-based studies almost integrate the multi-omics data by concatenation in the input data space or the learned feature space, ignoring the correlations between patients and omics.Methods:We propose a novel multi-omics integration method, called Multi-omics Attention Deep Learning Network (MOADLN), which is used for biomedical data classification. Firstly, for each type of omics data, we use three fully-connected layers and the self-attention mechanism to reduce dimensionality, and construct the correlations between patients, respectively. Then, we apply the feature vector learned from self-attention to generate the initial category labels. Secondly, for the initial label predicted of each omics data, we use an effective Multi-Omics Correlation Discovery Network (MOCDN) to learn the cross-omic correlations in the label space. Finally, we use the softmax classifier for label prediction.Results:We demonstrate that our method outperforms several state-of-the-art methods on two datasets with mRNA expression data, DNA methylation data, and miRNA expression data. In addition, we identified essential biomarkers of relevant diseases by MOADLN, and the generality of MOADLN is also demonstrated in the KIRP and KIRC datasets.Conclusions:MOADLN jointly explores correlations between patients in intra-omics and correlations of cross-omics in label space, which is an effective DL-based classification of biomedical data.",36739624,,10.1016/j.cmpb.2023.107377,5,Computer methods and programs in biomedicine,8506513,7.027,0.46994590759277344,0.5852842809364549,0.6822742474916388,0.5354792502412827
An integrated multi-omics analysis of topoisomerase family in pan-cancer: Friend or foe?,"Background:Topoisomerases are nuclear enzymes that get to the bottom of topological troubles related with DNA all through a range of genetic procedures. More and more studies have shown that topoisomerase-mediated DNA cleavage plays crucial roles in tumor cell death and carcinogenesis. There is however still a lack of comprehensive multi-omics studies related to topoisomerase family genes from a pan-cancer perspective.Methods:In this study, a multiomics pan-cancer analysis of topoisomerase family genes was conducted by integrating over 10,000 multi-dimensional cancer genomic data across 33 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), 481 small molecule drug response data from cancer therapeutics response portal (CTRP) as well as normal tissue data from Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx). Finally, overall activity-level analyses of topoisomerase in pan-cancers were performed by gene set variation analysis (GSVA), together with differential expression, clinical relevancy, immune cell infiltration and regulation of cancer-related pathways.Results:Dysregulated gene expression of topoisomerase family were related to genomic changes and abnormal epigenetic modifications. The expression levels of topoisomerase family genes could significantly impact cancer progression, intratumoral heterogeneity, alterations in the immunological condition and regulation of the cancer marker-related pathways, which in turn caused the differences in potential drugs sensitivity and the distinct prognosis of patients.Conclusion:It was anticipated that topoisomerase family genes would become novel prognostic biomarkers for cancer patients and provide new insights for the diagnosis and treatment of tumors.",36288358,PMC9604985,10.1371/journal.pone.0274546,3,PloS one,101285081,3.752,0.46982431411743164,0.4280936454849498,0.20735785953177258,0.40898488947380346
An integrative analysis of the age-associated multi-omic landscape across cancers,"Age is the most important risk factor for cancer, as cancer incidence and mortality increase with age. However, how molecular alterations in tumours differ among patients of different age remains largely unexplored. Here, using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we comprehensively characterise genomic, transcriptomic and epigenetic alterations in relation to patients' age across cancer types. We show that tumours from older patients present an overall increase in genomic instability, somatic copy-number alterations (SCNAs) and somatic mutations. Age-associated SCNAs and mutations are identified in several cancer-driver genes across different cancer types. The largest age-related genomic differences are found in gliomas and endometrial cancer. We identify age-related global transcriptomic changes and demonstrate that these genes are in part regulated by age-associated DNA methylation changes. This study provides a comprehensive, multi-omics view of age-associated alterations in cancer and underscores age as an important factor to consider in cancer research and clinical practice.",33879792,PMC8058097,10.1038/s41467-021-22560-y,41,Nature communications,101528555,17.694,0.4696875214576721,0.9163879598662207,0.9297658862876255,0.6510432821053724
Proteogenomic studies on cancer drug resistance: towards biomarker discovery and target identification,"Chemoresistance is a major obstacle for current cancer treatment. Proteogenomics is a powerful multi-omics research field that uses customized protein sequence databases generated by genomic and transcriptomic information to identify novel genes (e.g. noncoding, mutation and fusion genes) from mass spectrometry-based proteomic data. By identifying aberrations that are differentially expressed between tumor and normal pairs, this approach can also be applied to validate protein variants in cancer, which may reveal the response to drug treatment. Areas covered: In this review, we will present recent advances in proteogenomic investigations of cancer drug resistance with an emphasis on integrative proteogenomic pipelines and the biomarker discovery which contributes to achieving the goal of using precision/personalized medicine for cancer treatment. Expert commentary: The discovery and comprehensive understanding of potential biomarkers help identify the cohort of patients who may benefit from particular treatments, and will assist real-time clinical decision-making to maximize therapeutic efficacy and minimize adverse effects.

Science for the Next Century: Deep Phenotyping,"Our ability to unravel the mysteries of human health and disease have changed dramatically over the past 2 decades. Decoding health and disease has been facilitated by the recent availability of high-throughput genomics and multi-omics analyses and the companion tools of advanced informatics and computational science. Understanding of the human genome and its influence on phenotype continues to advance through genotyping large populations and using ""light phenotyping"" approaches in combination with smaller subsets of the population being evaluated using ""deep phenotyping"" approaches. Using our capability to integrate and jointly analyze genomic data with other multi-omic data, the knowledge of genotype-phenotype relationships and associated genetic pathways and functions is being advanced. Understanding genotype-phenotype relationships that discriminate human health from disease is speculated to facilitate predictive, precision health care and change modes of health care delivery. The American Association for Dental Research Fall Focused Symposium assembled experts to discuss how studies of genotype-phenotype relationships are illuminating the pathophysiology of craniofacial diseases and developmental biology. Although the breadth of the topic did not allow all areas of dental, oral, and craniofacial research to be addressed (e.g., cancer), the importance and power of integrating genomic, phenomic, and other -omic data are illustrated using a variety of examples. The 8 Fall Focused talks presented different methodological approaches for ascertaining study populations and evaluating population variance and phenotyping approaches. These advances are reviewed in this summary.",33749358,PMC8258723,10.1177/00220345211001850,2,Journal of dental research,354343,8.924,0.46666330099105835,0.3411371237458194,0.7993311036789298,0.5080916260795848
Integrative analysis of multi-omics and imaging data with incorporation of biological information via structural Bayesian factor analysis,"Motivation:With the rapid development of modern technologies, massive data are available for the systematic study of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Though many existing AD studies mainly focus on single-modality omics data, multi-omics datasets can provide a more comprehensive understanding of AD. To bridge this gap, we proposed a novel structural Bayesian factor analysis framework (SBFA) to extract the information shared by multi-omics data through the aggregation of genotyping data, gene expression data, neuroimaging phenotypes and prior biological network knowledge. Our approach can extract common information shared by different modalities and encourage biologically related features to be selected, guiding future AD research in a biologically meaningful way.Method:Our SBFA model decomposes the mean parameters of the data into a sparse factor loading matrix and a factor matrix, where the factor matrix represents the common information extracted from multi-omics and imaging data. Our framework is designed to incorporate prior biological network information. Our simulation study demonstrated that our proposed SBFA framework could achieve the best performance compared with the other state-of-the-art factor-analysis-based integrative analysis methods.Results:We apply our proposed SBFA model together with several state-of-the-art factor analysis models to extract the latent common information from genotyping, gene expression and brain imaging data simultaneously from the ADNI biobank database. The latent information is then used to predict the functional activities questionnaire score, an important measurement for diagnosis of AD quantifying subjects' abilities in daily life. Our SBFA model shows the best prediction performance compared with the other factor analysis models.Availability:Code are publicly available at https://github.com/JingxuanBao/SBFA.Contact:qlong@upenn.edu.",36882008,PMC10387302,10.1093/bib/bbad073,2,Briefings in bioinformatics,100912837,13.994,0.46487119793891907,0.34448160535117056,0.8795986622073578,0.5237387722750572
Graph Neural Networks With Multiple Prior Knowledge for Multi-Omics Data Analysis,"With the development of biotechnology, a large amount of multi-omics data have been collected for precision medicine. There exists multiple graph-based prior biological knowledge about omics data, such as gene-gene interaction networks. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in introducing graph neural networks (GNNs) into multi-omics learning. However, existing methods have not fully exploited these graphical priors since none have been able to integrate knowledge from multiple sources simultaneously. To solve this problem, we propose a multi-omics data analysis framework by incorporating multiple prior knowledge into graph neural network (MPK-GNN). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to introduce multiple prior graphs into multi-omics data analysis. Specifically, the proposed method contains four parts: (1) a feature-level learning module to aggregate information from prior graphs; (2) a projection module to maximize the agreement among prior networks by optimizing a contrastive loss; (3) a sample-level module to learn a global representation from input multi-omics features; (4) a task-specific module to flexibly extend MPK-GNN for various downstream multi-omics analysis tasks. Finally, we verify the effectiveness of the proposed multi-omics learning algorithm on the cancer molecular subtype classification task. Experimental results show that MPK-GNN outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms, including multi-view learning methods and multi-omics integrative approaches.",37307177,,10.1109/JBHI.2023.3284794,1,IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics,101604520,7.021,0.4636263847351074,0.2709030100334448,0.6722408026755853,0.46680459338287045
"Analysis, identification and visualization of subgroups in genomics","Motivation:Cancer is a complex and heterogeneous disease involving multiple somatic mutations that accumulate during its progression. In the past years, the wide availability of genomic data from patients' samples opened new perspectives in the analysis of gene mutations and alterations. Hence, visualizing and further identifying genes mutated in massive sets of patients are nowadays a critical task that sheds light on more personalized intervention approaches.Results:Here, we extensively review existing tools for visualization and analysis of alteration data. We compare different approaches to study mutual exclusivity and sample coverage in large-scale omics data. We complement our review with the standalone software AVAtar ('analysis and visualization of alteration data') that integrates diverse aspects known from different tools into a comprehensive platform. AVAtar supplements customizable alteration plots by a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm for subset identification and provides an innovative and user-friendly interface for the evaluation of concurrent solutions.

Identifying biomarkers associated with immunotherapy response in melanoma by multi-omics analysis,"Despite immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have shown the greatest success in melanoma treatment, only a subset of melanoma patients responds well to ICIs. Thus, identifying predictive biomarkers for immunotherapy response is crucial. In this study, we took complementary advantages of immunotherapy data and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) multi-omics data to explore the predictive biomarkers for the response to immunotherapy in melanoma. We first predicted responsive and non-responsive melanomas in the TCGA skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) cohort based on both somatic mutation and transcriptome datasets which involved immunotherapy data for melanoma. This method identified 170 responsive and 56 non-responsive melanomas in TCGA-SKCM. Based on the TCGA-SKCM data, we performed a comprehensive comparison of multi-omics molecular features between responsive and non-responsive melanomas. We identified the molecular features significantly associated with immunotherapy response in melanoma at the genome, transcriptome, epigenome, and proteome levels, respectively. Our analysis confirmed certain immunotherapy response-associated biomarkers, such as tumor mutation burden (TMB), copy number alteration (CNA), intratumor heterogeneity (ITH), PD-L1 expression, and tumor immunity. Moreover, we identified some novel molecular features associated with immunotherapy response: (1) the activation of mast cells and dendritic cells correlating negatively with immunotherapy response; (2) the enrichment of many oncogenic pathways correlating positively with immunotherapy response, such as JAK-STAT, RAS, MAPK, HIF-1, PI3K-Akt, and VEGF pathways; and (3) a number of microRNAs and proteins whose expression correlates with immunotherapy response. In addition, the mTOR signaling pathway has a negative association with immunotherapy response. The novel biomarkers have potential predictive values in immunotherapy response and warrant further investigation.",37875043,,10.1016/j.compbiomed.2023.107591,2,Computers in biology and medicine,1250250,6.698,0.46292823553085327,0.34782608695652173,0.5819397993311036,0.463710118576037
Knowledge Generation with Rule Induction in Cancer Omics,"The explosion of omics data availability in cancer research has boosted the knowledge of the molecular basis of cancer, although the strategies for its definitive resolution are still not well established. The complexity of cancer biology, given by the high heterogeneity of cancer cells, leads to the development of pharmacoresistance for many patients, hampering the efficacy of therapeutic approaches. Machine learning techniques have been implemented to extract knowledge from cancer omics data in order to address fundamental issues in cancer research, as well as the classification of clinically relevant sub-groups of patients and for the identification of biomarkers for disease risk and prognosis. Rule induction algorithms are a group of pattern discovery approaches that represents discovered relationships in the form of human readable associative rules. The application of such techniques to the modern plethora of collected cancer omics data can effectively boost our understanding of cancer-related mechanisms. In fact, the capability of these methods to extract a huge amount of human readable knowledge will eventually help to uncover unknown relationships between molecular attributes and the malignant phenotype. In this review, we describe applications and strategies for the usage of rule induction approaches in cancer omics data analysis. In particular, we explore the canonical applications and the future challenges and opportunities posed by multi-omics integration problems.",31861438,PMC6981587,10.3390/ijms21010018,3,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,6.208,0.4618054926395416,0.431438127090301,0.5351170568561873,0.47039433237302264
Multi-omics integration in biomedical research - A metabolomics-centric review,"Recent advances in high-throughput technologies have enabled the profiling of multiple layers of a biological system, including DNA sequence data (genomics), RNA expression levels (transcriptomics), and metabolite levels (metabolomics). This has led to the generation of vast amounts of biological data that can be integrated in so-called multi-omics studies to examine the complex molecular underpinnings of health and disease. Integrative analysis of such datasets is not straightforward and is particularly complicated by the high dimensionality and heterogeneity of the data and by the lack of universal analysis protocols. Previous reviews have discussed various strategies to address the challenges of data integration, elaborating on specific aspects, such as network inference or feature selection techniques. Thereby, the main focus has been on the integration of two omics layers in their relation to a phenotype of interest. In this review we provide an overview over a typical multi-omics workflow, focusing on integration methods that have the potential to combine metabolomics data with two or more omics. We discuss multiple integration concepts including data-driven, knowledge-based, simultaneous and step-wise approaches. We highlight the application of these methods in recent multi-omics studies, including large-scale integration efforts aiming at a global depiction of the complex relationships within and between different biological layers without focusing on a particular phenotype.",33248648,PMC7701361,10.1016/j.aca.2020.10.038,68,Analytica chimica acta,370534,6.911,0.46089544892311096,0.9498327759197325,0.5886287625418061,0.5842295770461743
MCluster-VAEs: An end-to-end variational deep learning-based clustering method for subtype discovery using multi-omics data,"The discovery of cancer subtypes based on unsupervised clustering helps in providing a precise diagnosis, guide treatment, and improve patients' prognoses. Instead of single-omics data, multi-omics data can improve the clustering performance because it obtains a comprehensive landscape for understanding biological systems and mechanisms. However, heterogeneous data from multiple sources raises high complexity and different kinds of noise, which are detrimental to the extraction of clustering information. We propose an end-to-end deep learning based method, called Multi-omics Clustering Variational Autoencoders (MCluster-VAEs), that can extract cluster-friendly representations on multi-omics data. First, a unified network architecture with an attention mechanism was developed for accurately modeling multi-omics data. Then, using a novel objective function built from the Variational Bayes technique, the model was trained to effectively obtain the posterior estimation of the clustering assignments. Compared with 12 other state-of-the-art multi-omics clustering methods, MCluster-VAEs achieved an outstanding performance on benchmark datasets from the TCGA database. On the Pan Cancer dataset, MCluster-VAEs achieved an adjusted Rand index of approximately 0.78 for cancer category recognition, an increase of more than 18% compared with other methods. Furthermore, a survival analysis and clinical parameter enrichment tests conducted on 10 cancer datasets demonstrated that MCluster-VAEs provides comparable and even better results than many common integrative approaches. These results demonstrate that MCluster-VAEs are a powerful new tool for dissecting complex multi-omics relationships and providing new insights for cancer subtype discovery.",36162197,,10.1016/j.compbiomed.2022.106085,4,Computers in biology and medicine,1250250,6.698,0.4608651101589203,0.5050167224080268,0.5852842809364549,0.49457926676424846
"GSCA: an integrated platform for gene set cancer analysis at genomic, pharmacogenomic and immunogenomic levels","Cancer initiation and progression are likely caused by the dysregulation of biological pathways. Gene set analysis (GSA) could improve the signal-to-noise ratio and identify potential biological insights on the gene set level. However, platforms exploring cancer multi-omics data using GSA methods are lacking. In this study, we upgraded our GSCALite to GSCA (gene set cancer analysis, http://bioinfo.life.hust.edu.cn/GSCA) for cancer GSA at genomic, pharmacogenomic and immunogenomic levels. In this improved GSCA, we integrated expression, mutation, drug sensitivity and clinical data from four public data sources for 33 cancer types. We introduced useful features to GSCA, including associations between immune infiltration with gene expression and genomic variations, and associations between gene set expression/mutation and clinical outcomes. GSCA has four main functional modules for cancer GSA to explore, analyze and visualize expression, genomic variations, tumor immune infiltration, drug sensitivity and their associations with clinical outcomes. We used case studies of three gene sets: (i) seven cell cycle genes, (ii) tumor suppressor genes of PI3K pathway and (iii) oncogenes of PI3K pathway to prove the advantage of GSCA over single gene analysis. We found novel associations of gene set expression and mutation with clinical outcomes in different cancer types on gene set level, while on single gene analysis level, they are not significant associations.

Multi-omics data integration for the identification of biomarkers for bull fertility,"Bull fertility is an important economic trait, and the use of subfertile semen for artificial insemination decreases the global efficiency of the breeding sector. Although the analysis of semen functional parameters can help to identify infertile bulls, no tools are currently available to enable precise predictions and prevent the commercialization of subfertile semen. Because male fertility is a multifactorial phenotype that is dependent on genetic, epigenetic, physiological and environmental factors, we hypothesized that an integrative analysis might help to refine our knowledge and understanding of bull fertility. We combined -omics data (genotypes, sperm DNA methylation at CpGs and sperm small non-coding RNAs) and semen parameters measured on a large cohort of 98 MontbÃ©liarde bulls with contrasting fertility levels. Multiple Factor Analysis was conducted to study the links between the datasets and fertility. Four methodologies were then considered to identify the features linked to bull fertility variation: Logistic Lasso, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting and Neural Networks. Finally, the features selected by these methods were annotated in terms of genes, to conduct functional enrichment analyses. The less relevant features in -omics data were filtered out, and MFA was run on the remaining 12,006 features, including the 11 semen parameters and a balanced proportion of each type of-omics data. The results showed that unlike the semen parameters studied the-omics datasets were related to fertility. Biomarkers related to bull fertility were selected using the four methodologies mentioned above. The most contributory CpGs, SNPs and miRNAs targeted genes were all found to be involved in development. Interestingly, fragments derived from ribosomal RNAs were overrepresented among the selected features, suggesting roles in male fertility. These markers could be used in the future to identify subfertile bulls in order to increase the global efficiency of the breeding sector.",38394258,PMC10890740,10.1371/journal.pone.0298623,0,PloS one,101285081,3.752,0.45989468693733215,0.11371237458193979,0.21070234113712374,0.340819755306212
Improving existing analysis pipeline to identify and analyze cancer driver genes using multi-omics data,"The cumulative of genes carrying mutations is vital for the establishment and development of cancer. However, this driver gene exploring research line has selected and used types of tools and models of analysis unsystematically and discretely. Also, the previous studies may have neglected low-frequency drivers and seldom predicted subgroup specificities of identified driver genes. In this study, we presented an improved driver gene identification and analysis pipeline that comprises the four most widely focused analyses for driver genes: enrichment analysis, clinical feature association with expression profiles of identified driver genes as well as with their functional modules, and patient stratification by existing advanced computational tools integrating multi-omics data. The improved pipeline's general usability was demonstrated straightforwardly for breast cancer, validated by some independent databases. Accordingly, 31 validated driver genes, including four novel ones, were discovered. Subsequently, we detected cancer-related significantly enriched gene ontology terms and pathways, probable drug targets, two co-expressed modules associated significantly with several clinical features, such as number of positive lymph nodes, Nottingham prognostic index, and tumor stage, and two biologically distinct groups of BRCA patients.

Deep learning assisted multi-omics integration for survival and drug-response prediction in breast cancer,"Background:Survival and drug response are two highly emphasized clinical outcomes in cancer research that directs the prognosis of a cancer patient. Here, we have proposed a late multi omics integrative framework that robustly quantifies survival and drug response for breast cancer patients with a focus on the relative predictive ability of available omics datatypes. Neighborhood component analysis (NCA), a supervised feature selection algorithm selected relevant features from multi-omics datasets retrieved from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) databases. A Neural network framework, fed with NCA selected features, was used to develop survival and drug response prediction models for breast cancer patients. The drug response framework used regression and unsupervised clustering (K-means) to segregate samples into responders and non-responders based on their predicted IC50 values (Z-score).Results:The survival prediction framework was highly effective in categorizing patients into risk subtypes with an accuracy of 94%. Compared to single-omics and early integration approaches, our drug response prediction models performed significantly better and were able to predict IC50 values (Z-score) with a mean square error (MSE) of 1.154 and an overall regression value of 0.92, showing a linear relationship between predicted and actual IC50 values.Conclusion:The proposed omics integration strategy provides an effective way of extracting critical information from diverse omics data types enabling estimation of prognostic indicators. Such integrative models with high predictive power would have a significant impact and utility in precision oncology.",33761889,PMC7992339,10.1186/s12864-021-07524-2,30,BMC genomics,100965258,4.547,0.45592519640922546,0.8896321070234113,0.2976588628762542,0.5110133118254684
An integrative imputation method based on multi-omics datasets,"Background:Integrative analysis of multi-omics data is becoming increasingly important to unravel functional mechanisms of complex diseases. However, the currently available multi-omics datasets inevitably suffer from missing values due to technical limitations and various constrains in experiments. These missing values severely hinder integrative analysis of multi-omics data. Current imputation methods mainly focus on using single omics data while ignoring biological interconnections and information imbedded in multi-omics data sets.Results:In this study, a novel multi-omics imputation method was proposed to integrate multiple correlated omics datasets for improving the imputation accuracy. Our method was designed to: 1) combine the estimates of missing value from individual omics data itself as well as from other omics, and 2) simultaneously impute multiple missing omics datasets by an iterative algorithm. We compared our method with five imputation methods using single omics data at different noise levels, sample sizes and data missing rates. The results demonstrated the advantage and efficiency of our method, consistently in terms of the imputation error and the recovery of mRNA-miRNA network structure.Conclusions:We concluded that our proposed imputation method can utilize more biological information to minimize the imputation error and thus can improve the performance of downstream analysis such as genetic regulatory network construction.",27329642,PMC4915152,10.1186/s12859-016-1122-6,17,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,3.307,0.45534995198249817,0.8127090301003345,0.14715719063545152,0.4651832153366561
A supervised Bayesian factor model for the identification of multi-omics signatures,"Motivation:Predictive biological signatures provide utility as biomarkers for disease diagnosis and prognosis, as well as prediction of responses to vaccination or therapy. These signatures are identified from high-throughput profiling assays through a combination of dimensionality reduction and machine learning techniques. The genes, proteins, metabolites, and other biological analytes that compose signatures also generate hypotheses on the underlying mechanisms driving biological responses, thus improving biological understanding. Dimensionality reduction is a critical step in signature discovery to address the large number of analytes in omics datasets, especially for multi-omics profiling studies with tens of thousands of measurements. Latent factor models, which can account for the structural heterogeneity across diverse assays, effectively integrate multi-omics data and reduce dimensionality to a small number of factors that capture correlations and associations among measurements. These factors provide biologically interpretable features for predictive modeling. However, multi-omics integration and predictive modeling are generally performed independently in sequential steps, leading to suboptimal factor construction. Combining these steps can yield better multi-omics signatures that are more predictive while still being biologically meaningful.Results:We developed a supervised variational Bayesian factor model that extracts multi-omics signatures from high-throughput profiling datasets that can span multiple data types. Signature-based multiPle-omics intEgration via lAtent factoRs (SPEAR) adaptively determines factor rank, emphasis on factor structure, data relevance and feature sparsity. The method improves the reconstruction of underlying factors in synthetic examples and prediction accuracy of coronavirus disease 2019 severity and breast cancer tumor subtypes.Availability and implementation:SPEAR is a publicly available R-package hosted at https://bitbucket.org/kleinstein/SPEAR.",38603606,PMC11078774,10.1093/bioinformatics/btae202,0,"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",9808944,6.931,0.45380643010139465,0.11705685618729098,0.6287625418060201,0.42144773765949906
LinkedOmics: analyzing multi-omics data within and across 32 cancer types,"The LinkedOmics database contains multi-omics data and clinical data for 32 cancer types and a total of 11 158 patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project. It is also the first multi-omics database that integrates mass spectrometry (MS)-based global proteomics data generated by the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) on selected TCGA tumor samples. In total, LinkedOmics has more than a billion data points. To allow comprehensive analysis of these data, we developed three analysis modules in the LinkedOmics web application. The LinkFinder module allows flexible exploration of associations between a molecular or clinical attribute of interest and all other attributes, providing the opportunity to analyze and visualize associations between billions of attribute pairs for each cancer cohort. The LinkCompare module enables easy comparison of the associations identified by LinkFinder, which is particularly useful in multi-omics and pan-cancer analyses. The LinkInterpreter module transforms identified associations into biological understanding through pathway and network analysis. Using five case studies, we demonstrate that LinkedOmics provides a unique platform for biologists and clinicians to access, analyze and compare cancer multi-omics data within and across tumor types.

Multi-omics analysis identifies drivers of protein phosphorylation,"Background:Phosphorylation of proteins is a key step in the regulation of many cellular processes including activation of enzymes and signaling cascades. The abundance of a phosphorylated peptide (phosphopeptide) is determined by the abundance of its parent protein and the proportion of target sites that are phosphorylated.Results:We quantified phosphopeptides, proteins, and transcripts in heart, liver, and kidney tissue samples of mice from 58 strains of the Collaborative Cross strain panel. We mapped ~700 phosphorylation quantitative trait loci (phQTL) across the three tissues and applied genetic mediation analysis to identify causal drivers of phosphorylation. We identified kinases, phosphatases, cytokines, and other factors, including both known and potentially novel interactions between target proteins and genes that regulate site-specific phosphorylation. Our analysis highlights multiple targets of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1), a regulator of mitochondrial function that shows reduced activity in the NZO/HILtJ mouse, a polygenic model of obesity and type 2 diabetes.Conclusions:Together, this integrative multi-omics analysis in genetically diverse CC strains provides a powerful tool to identify regulators of protein phosphorylation.

Prioritization of risk genes in colorectal cancer by integrative analysis of multi-omics data and gene networks,"Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified over 140 colorectal cancer (CRC)-associated loci; however, target genes at the majority of loci and underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we utilized a Bayesian approach, integrative risk gene selector (iRIGS), to prioritize risk genes at CRC GWAS loci by integrating multi-omics data. As a result, a total of 105 high-confidence risk genes (HRGs) were identified, which exhibited strong gene dependencies for CRC and enrichment in the biological processes implicated in CRC. Among the 105 HRGs, CEBPB, located at the 20q13.13 locus, acted as a transcription factor playing critical roles in cancer. Our subsequent assays indicated the tumor promoter function of CEBPB that facilitated CRC cell proliferation by regulating multiple oncogenic pathways such as MAPK, PI3K-Akt, and Ras signaling. Next, by integrating a fine-mapping analysis and three independent case-control studies in Chinese populations consisting of 8,039 cases and 12,775 controls, we elucidated that rs1810503, a putative functional variant regulating CEBPB, was associated with CRC risk (OR=0.90, 95%CI=0.86-0.93, P=1.07Ã10-7). The association between rs1810503 and CRC risk was further validated in three additional multi-ancestry populations consisting of 24,254 cases and 58,741 controls. Mechanistically, the rs1810503 A to T allele change weakened the enhancer activity in an allele-specific manner to decrease CEBPB expression via long-range promoter-enhancer interactions, mediated by the transcription factor, REST, and thus decreased CRC risk. In summary, our study provides a genetic resource and a generalizable strategy for CRC etiology investigation, and highlights the biological implications of CEBPB in CRC tumorigenesis, shedding new light on the etiology of CRC.",37747674,,10.1007/s11427-023-2439-7,2,Science China.

Multi-omics data analysis reveals the biological implications of alternative splicing events in lung adenocarcinoma,"Cancer is characterized by the dysregulation of alternative splicing (AS). However, the comprehensive regulatory mechanisms of AS in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) are poorly understood. Here, we displayed the AS landscape in LUAD based on the integrated analyses of LUAD's multi-omics data. We identified 13,995 AS events in 6309 genes as differentially expressed alternative splicing events (DEASEs) mainly covering protein-coding genes. These DEASEs were strongly linked to ""cancer hallmarks"", such as apoptosis, DNA repair, cell cycle, cell proliferation, angiogenesis, immune response, generation of precursor metabolites and energy, p53 signaling pathway and PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. We further built a regulatory network connecting splicing factors (SFs) and DEASEs. In addition, RNA-binding protein (RBP) mutations that can affect DEASEs were investigated to find some potential cancer drivers. Further association analysis demonstrated that DNA methylation levels were highly correlated with DEASEs. In summary, our results can bring new insight into understanding the mechanism of AS and provide novel biomarkers for personalized medicine of LUAD.",37694487,,10.1142/S0219720023500208,0,Journal of bioinformatics and computational biology,101187344,1.204,0.45199161767959595,0.12040133779264214,0.07023411371237458,0.3093220609087609
Molecular classification reveals the diverse genetic and prognostic features of gastric cancer: A multi-omics consensus ensemble clustering,"Background:Globally, gastric cancer (GC) is the fifth most common tumor. It is necessary to identify novel molecular subtypes to guide patient selection for specific target therapeutic benefits.Methods:Multi-omics data, including transcriptomics RNA-sequencing (mRNA, LncRNA, miRNA), DNA methylation, and gene mutations in the TCGA-STAD cohort were used for the clustering. Ten classical clustering algorithms were executed to recognize patients with different molecular features using the ""MOVICS"" package in R. The activated signaling pathways were evaluated using the single-sample gene set enrichment analysis. The differential distribution of gene mutations, copy number alterations, and tumor mutation burden was compared, and potential responses to immunotherapy and chemotherapy were also assessed.Results:Two molecular subtypes (CS1 and CS2) were recognized by ten clustering algorithms with consensus ensembles. Patients in the CS1 group had a shorter average overall survival time (28.5 vs. 68.9 months, P = 0.016), and progression-free survival (19.0 vs. 63.9 months, P = 0.008) as compared to those in the CS2 group. Extracellular associated biological process activation was higher in the CS1 group, while the CS2 group displayed the enhanced activation of cell cycle-associated pathways. Significantly higher total mutation numbers and neoantigens were observed in the CS2 group, along with specific mutations in TTN, MUC16, and ARID1A. Higher infiltration of immunocytes was also observed in the CS2 group, reflective of the potential immunotherapeutic benefits. Moreover, the CS2 group could also respond to 5-fluorouracil, cisplatin, and paclitaxel. The similar diversity in clinical outcomes between CS1 and CS2 groups was successfully validated in the external cohorts, GSE62254, GSE26253, GSE15459, and GSE84437.Conclusion:The findings provided novel insights into the GC subtypes through integrative analysis of five -omics data by ten clustering algorithms.

Prospects and challenges of multi-omics data integration in toxicology,"Exposure of cells or organisms to chemicals can trigger a series of effects at the regulatory pathway level, which involve changes of levels, interactions, and feedback loops of biomolecules of different types. A single-omics technique, e.g., transcriptomics, will detect biomolecules of one type and thus can only capture changes in a small subset of the biological cascade. Therefore, although applying single-omics analyses can lead to the identification of biomarkers for certain exposures, they cannot provide a systemic understanding of toxicity pathways or adverse outcome pathways. Integration of multiple omics data sets promises a substantial improvement in detecting this pathway response to a toxicant, by an increase of information as such and especially by a systemic understanding. Here, we report the findings of a thorough evaluation of the prospects and challenges of multi-omics data integration in toxicological research. We review the availability of such data, discuss options for experimental design, evaluate methods for integration and analysis of multi-omics data, discuss best practices, and identify knowledge gaps. Re-analyzing published data, we demonstrate that multi-omics data integration can considerably improve the confidence in detecting a pathway response. Finally, we argue that more data need to be generated from studies with a multi-omics-focused design, to define which omics layers contribute most to the identification of a pathway response to a toxicant.",32034435,,10.1007/s00204-020-02656-y,61,Archives of toxicology,417615,6.168,0.4499363601207733,0.939799331103679,0.5150501672240803,0.5609317157380158
Integrative human and murine multi-omics: Highlighting shared biomarkers in the neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses,"Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL) is a group of neurodegenerative disorders whose molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. Omics approaches are among the methods that generate new information on modifying factors and molecular signatures. Moreover, omics data integration can address the need to progressively expand knowledge around the disease and pinpoint specific proteins to promote as candidate biomarkers. In this work, we integrated a total of 62 proteomic and transcriptomic datasets originating from humans and mice, employing a new approach able to define dysregulated processes across species, stages and NCL forms. Moreover, we selected a pool of differentially expressed proteins and genes as species- and form-related biomarkers of disease status/progression and evaluated local and spatial differences in most affected brain regions. Our results offer promising targets for potential new therapeutic strategies and reinforce the hypothesis of a connection between NCLs and other forms of dementia, particularly Alzheimer's disease.",37952681,,10.1016/j.nbd.2023.106349,0,Neurobiology of disease,9500169,7.046,0.4486979842185974,0.12374581939799331,0.68561872909699,0.4310917002301551
MCNF: A Novel Method for Cancer Subtyping by Integrating Multi-Omics and Clinical Data,"In the age of personalized medicine, there is a great need to classify cancer (from the same organ site) into homogeneous subtypes. Recent technology advancements in genome-wide molecular profiling have made it possible to profiling multiple molecular datasets to characterize the genomic changes in various cancer types. How to take full advantage of the availability of these omics data? And how to integrate these molecular data with patient clinical data to do a more systematic subtyping of cancer are the focuses of the paper. We proposed a new method called Molecular and Clinical Networks Fusion (MCNF) to classify cancer into homogeneous subtypes. Our method has two highlights: one is that it can integrate both numerical and non-numerical data into the fused network; the next highlight is that it is unsupervised, which means it can automatically determine the optimal number of clusters.",30990192,,10.1109/TCBB.2019.2910515,5,IEEE/ACM transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics,101196755,3.702,0.44854703545570374,0.5919732441471572,0.18394648829431437,0.42431216776171654
Integrated analysis of multimodal single-cell data with structural similarity,"Multimodal single-cell sequencing technologies provide unprecedented information on cellular heterogeneity from multiple layers of genomic readouts. However, joint analysis of two modalities without properly handling the noise often leads to overfitting of one modality by the other and worse clustering results than vanilla single-modality analysis. How to efficiently utilize the extra information from single cell multi-omics to delineate cell states and identify meaningful signal remains as a significant computational challenge. In this work, we propose a deep learning framework, named SAILERX, for efficient, robust, and flexible analysis of multi-modal single-cell data. SAILERX consists of a variational autoencoder with invariant representation learning to correct technical noises from sequencing process, and a multimodal data alignment mechanism to integrate information from different modalities. Instead of performing hard alignment by projecting both modalities to a shared latent space, SAILERX encourages the local structures of two modalities measured by pairwise similarities to be similar. This strategy is more robust against overfitting of noises, which facilitates various downstream analysis such as clustering, imputation, and marker gene detection. Furthermore, the invariant representation learning part enables SAILERX to perform integrative analysis on both multi- and single-modal datasets, making it an applicable and scalable tool for more general scenarios.",36130281,PMC9757079,10.1093/nar/gkac781,23,Nucleic acids research,411011,19.16,0.44848668575286865,0.8494983277591973,0.9665551839464883,0.6323027137928583
Deep Subspace Mutual Learning for cancer subtypes prediction,"Motivation:Precise prediction of cancer subtypes is of significant importance in cancer diagnosis and treatment. Disease etiology is complicated existing at different omics levels; hence integrative analysis provides a very effective way to improve our understanding of cancer.Results:We propose a novel computational framework, named Deep Subspace Mutual Learning (DSML). DSML has the capability to simultaneously learn the subspace structures in each available omics data and in overall multi-omics data by adopting deep neural networks, which thereby facilitates the subtype's prediction via clustering on multi-level, single-level and partial-level omics data. Extensive experiments are performed in five different cancers on three levels of omics data from The Cancer Genome Atlas.

However, the complete understanding of our genome and its association with cancer is a far way to go. Researchers are striving hard to detect new variants and find their association with diseases, which further gives rise to the need for aggregation of this Big Data into a common standard scalable platform. In this work, a database named Enlightenment has been implemented which makes the availability of genomic data integrated from eight public databases, and DNA sequencing profiles of H. sapiens in a single platform. Annotated results with respect to cancer specific biomarkers, pharmacogenetic biomarkers and its association with variability in drug response, and DNA profiles along with novel copy number variants are computed and stored, which are accessible through a web interface.

Network diffusion-based approach for survival prediction and identification of biomarkers using multi-omics data of papillary renal cell carcinoma,"Identification of cancer subtypes based on molecular knowledge is crucial for improving the patient diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. In this work, we integrated copy number variations (CNVs) and transcriptomic data of Kidney Papillary Renal Cell Carcinoma (KIRP) using a network diffusion strategy to stratify cancers into clinically and biologically relevant subtypes. We constructed GeneNet, a KIRP specific gene expression network from RNA-seq data. The copy number variation data was projected onto GeneNet and propagated on the network for clustering. We identified robust subtypes that are biologically informative and significantly associated with patient survival, tumor stage and clinical subtypes of KIRP. We performed a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) analysis of KIRP subtypes, which revealed the genes/silent players related to poor survival. A differential gene expression analysis between subtypes showed that genes related to immune, extracellular matrix organization, and genomic instability are upregulated in the poor survival group. Overall, the network-based approach revealed the molecular subtypes of KIRP and captured the relationship between gene expression and CNVs. This framework can be further expanded to integrate other omics data.",37093328,,10.1007/s00438-023-02022-4,0,Molecular genetics and genomics : MGG,101093320,2.98,0.44574064016342163,0.13043478260869565,0.10367892976588629,0.31426712657296935
Multi-omics network analysis reveals distinct stages in the human aging progression in epidermal tissue,"In recent years, reports of non-linear regulations in age- and longevity-associated biological processes have been accumulating. Inspired by methodological advances in precision medicine involving the integrative analysis of multi-omics data, we sought to investigate the potential of multi-omics integration to identify distinct stages in the aging progression fromex vivohuman skin tissue. For this we generated transcriptome and methylome profiling data from suction blister lesions of female subjects between 21 and 76 years, which were integrated using a network fusion approach. Unsupervised cluster analysis on the combined network identified four distinct subgroupings exhibiting a significant age-association. As indicated by DNAm age analysis and Hallmark of Aging enrichment signals, the stages captured the biological aging state more clearly than a mere grouping by chronological age and could further be recovered in a longitudinal validation cohort with high stability. Characterization of the biological processes driving the phases using machine learning enabled a data-driven reconstruction of the order of Hallmark of Aging manifestation.

Bioinformatics Prediction for Network-Based Integrative Multi-Omics Expression Data Analysis in Hirschsprung Disease,"Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR) is a rare developmental disorder in which enteric ganglia are missing along a portion of the intestine. HSCR has a complex inheritance, withRETas the major disease-causing gene. However, the pathogenesis of HSCR is still not completely understood.

"Status and perspectives of biomarker validation for diagnosis, stratification, and treatment","Objectives:The aim of this study was to discuss the status of and perspective for biomarker validation in view of the challenges imposed on national healthcare systems due to an increasing number of citizens with chronic diseases and new expensive drugs with effects that are sometimes poorly documented. The demand for a paradigm shift toward stratification of patients or even 'personalized medicine' (PM) is rising, and the implementation of such novel strategies has the potential to increase patient outcomes and cost efficiency of treatments. The implementation of PM depends on relevant and reliable biomarkers correlated to disease states, prognosis, or effect of treatment. Beyond biomarkers of disease, personalized prevention strategies (such as individualized nutrition guidance) are likely to depend on novel biomarkers.Study design:We discuss the current status of the use of biomarkers and the need for standardization and integration of biomarkers based on multi-omics approaches.Methods:We present representative cases from laboratory medicine, oncology, and nutrition, where present and emerging biomarkers have or may present opportunities for PM or prevention.Results:Biomarkers vary greatly in complexity, from single genomic mutations to metagenomic analyses of the composition of the gut microbiota and comprehensive analyses of metabolites, metabolomics. Using biomarkers for decision-making has previously often relied on measurements of single biomolecules. The current development now moves toward the use of multiple biomarkers requiring the use of machine learning or artificial intelligence. Still, the usefulness of biomarkers is often challenged by suboptimal validation, and the discovery of new biomarkers moves much faster than standardization efforts. To reap the potential benefits of personalization of treatment and prevention, healthcare systems and regulatory authorities need to focus on validation and standardization of biomarkers.Conclusion:There is a great public health need for better understanding of the usefulness, but also limitations, of biomarkers among policy makers, clinicians, and scientists, and efforts securing effective validation are key to the future use of novel sets of complex biomarkers.",33309006,,10.1016/j.puhe.2020.11.002,1,Public health,376507,4.984,0.4380638897418976,0.2809364548494983,0.38127090301003347,0.3952798054170449
Protocol for a scoping review of multi-omic analysis for rare diseases,"Introduction:The development of next generation sequencing technology has enabled cost-efficient, large scale, multiple 'omic' analysis, including epigenomic, genomic, metabolomic, phenomic, proteomic and transcriptomic research. These integrated approaches hold significant promise for rare disease research, with the potential to aid biomarker discovery, improve our understanding of disease pathogenesis and identify novel therapeutic targets. In this paper we outline a systematic approach for a scoping review designed to evaluate what primary research has been performed to date on multi-omics and rare disease.Methods and analysis:This protocol was designed using the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology for scoping reviews. Databases to be searched will include: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus and Google Scholar for primary studies relevant to the key terms 'multi-omics' and 'rare disease', published prior to 30thDecember 2018. Grey literature databases GreyLit and OpenGrey will also be searched, as well as reverse citation screening of relevant articles and forward citation searching using Web of Science Cited Reference Search Tool. Data extraction will be performed using customised forms and a narrative synthesis of the results will be presented.Ethics and dissemination:As a secondary analysis study with no primary data generated, this scoping review does not require ethical approval. We anticipate this review will highlight a gap in rare disease research and provide direction for novel research. The completed review will be submitted for publication in peer-reviewed journals and presented at relevant conferences discussing rare disease research and/or molecular strategies.",31061034,PMC6501961,10.1136/bmjopen-2018-026278,2,BMJ open,101552874,3.006,0.4368022084236145,0.35785953177257523,0.10702341137123746,0.3550579136829312
DELFOS-drug efficacy leveraging forked and specialized networks-benchmarking scRNA-seq data in multi-omics-based prediction of cancer sensitivity,"Motivation:Cancer is currently one of the most notorious diseases, with over 1 million deaths in the European Union alone in 2022. As each tumor can be composed of diverse cell types with distinct genotypes, cancer cells can acquire resistance to different compounds. Moreover, anticancer drugs can display severe side effects, compromising patient well-being. Therefore, novel strategies for identifying the optimal set of compounds to treat each tumor have become an important research topic in recent decades.Results:To address this challenge, we developed a novel drug response prediction algorithm called Drug Efficacy Leveraging Forked and Specialized networks (DELFOS). Our model learns from multi-omics data from over 65 cancer cell lines, as well as structural data from over 200 compounds, for the prediction of drug sensitivity. We also evaluated the benefits of incorporating single-cell expression data to predict drug response. DELFOS was validated using datasets with unseen cell lines or drugs and compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms, achieving a high prediction performance on several correlation and error metrics. Overall, DELFOS can effectively leverage multi-omics data for the prediction of drug responses in thousands of drug-cell line pairs.Availability and implementation:The DELFOS pipeline and associated data are available at github.com/MoreiraLAB/delfos.",37862234,PMC10627353,10.1093/bioinformatics/btad645,0,"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",9808944,6.931,0.4353613257408142,0.14046822742474915,0.6354515050167224,0.4164007419327828
A New Era of Integration between Multiomics and Spatio-Temporal Analysis for the Translation of EMT towards Clinical Applications in Cancer,"Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is crucial to metastasis by increasing cancer cell migration and invasion. At the cellular level, EMT-related morphological and functional changes are well established. At the molecular level, critical signaling pathways able to drive EMT have been described. Yet, the translation of EMT into efficient diagnostic methods and anti-metastatic therapies is still missing. This highlights a gap in our understanding of the precise mechanisms governing EMT. Here, we discuss evidence suggesting that overcoming this limitation requires the integration of multiple omics, a hitherto neglected strategy in the EMT field. More specifically, this work summarizes results that were independently obtained through epigenomics/transcriptomics while comprehensively reviewing the achievements of proteomics in cancer research. Additionally, we prospect gains to be obtained by applying spatio-temporal multiomics in the investigation of EMT-driven metastasis. Along with the development of more sensitive technologies, the integration of currently available omics, and a look at dynamic alterations that regulate EMT at the subcellular level will lead to a deeper understanding of this process. Further, considering the significance of EMT to cancer progression, this integrative strategy may enable the development of new and improved biomarkers and therapeutics capable of increasing the survival and quality of life of cancer patients.",38067168,PMC10706093,10.3390/cells12232740,0,Cells,101600052,7.666,0.4342813491821289,0.14381270903010032,0.7357859531772575,0.43648854195074893
"Multi-omics analysis reveals genomic, clinical and immunological features of SARS-CoV-2 virus target genes in pan-cancer","The SARS-CoV-2 virus, also known as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, has raised great threats to humans. The connection between the SARS-CoV-2 virus and cancer is currently unclear. In this study, we thus evaluated the multi-omics data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database utilizing genomic and transcriptomic techniques to fully identify the SARS-CoV-2 target genes (STGs) in tumor samples from 33 types of cancers. The expression of STGs was substantially linked with the immune infiltration and may be used to predict survival in cancer patients. STGs were also substantially associated with immunological infiltration, immune cells, and associated immune pathways. At the molecular level, the genomic changes of STGs were frequently related with carcinogenesis and patient survival. In addition, pathway analysis revealed that STGs were involved in the control of signaling pathways associated with cancer. The prognostic features and nomogram of clinical factors of STGs in cancers have been developed. Lastly, by mining the cancer drug sensitivity genomics database, a list of potential STG-targeting medicines was compiled. Collectively, this work demonstrated comprehensively the genomic alterations and clinical characteristics of STGs, which may offer new clues to explore the mechanisms on a molecular level between SARS-CoV-2 virus and cancers as well as provide new clinical guidance for cancer patients who are threatened by the COVID-19 epidemic.",36875081,PMC9982007,10.3389/fimmu.2023.1112704,2,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,8.786,0.4331420660018921,0.3612040133779264,0.7859531772575251,0.4893166777282255
MarsGT: Multi-omics analysis for rare population inference using single-cell graph transformer,"Rare cell populations are key in neoplastic progression and therapeutic response, offering potential intervention targets. However, their computational identification and analysis often lag behind major cell types. To fill this gap, we introduce MarsGT: Multi-omics Analysis for Rare population inference using a Single-cell Graph Transformer. It identifies rare cell populations using a probability-based heterogeneous graph transformer on single-cell multi-omics data. MarsGT outperforms existing tools in identifying rare cells across 550 simulated and four real human datasets. In mouse retina data, it reveals unique subpopulations of rare bipolar cells and a MÃ¼ller glia cell subpopulation. In human lymph node data, MarsGT detects an intermediate B cell population potentially acting as lymphoma precursors. In human melanoma data, it identifies a rare MAIT-like population impacted by a high IFN-I response and reveals the mechanism of immunotherapy. Hence, MarsGT offers biological insights and suggests potential strategies for early detection and therapeutic intervention of disease.",38184630,PMC10771517,10.1038/s41467-023-44570-8,0,Nature communications,101528555,17.694,0.4327225089073181,0.14715719063545152,0.9331103678929766,0.4756870170500765
A roadmap for multi-omics data integration using deep learning,"High-throughput next-generation sequencing now makes it possible to generate a vast amount of multi-omics data for various applications. These data have revolutionized biomedical research by providing a more comprehensive understanding of the biological systems and molecular mechanisms of disease development. Recently, deep learning (DL) algorithms have become one of the most promising methods in multi-omics data analysis, due to their predictive performance and capability of capturing nonlinear and hierarchical features. While integrating and translating multi-omics data into useful functional insights remain the biggest bottleneck, there is a clear trend towards incorporating multi-omics analysis in biomedical research to help explain the complex relationships between molecular layers. Multi-omics data have a role to improve prevention, early detection and prediction; monitor progression; interpret patterns and endotyping; and design personalized treatments. In this review, we outline a roadmap of multi-omics integration using DL and offer a practical perspective into the advantages, challenges and barriers to the implementation of DL in multi-omics data.",34791014,PMC8769688,10.1093/bib/bbab454,55,Briefings in bioinformatics,100912837,13.994,0.4321233332157135,0.9331103678929766,0.8896321070234113,0.6238224949127057
Improving prediction performance of colon cancer prognosis based on the integration of clinical and multi-omics data,"Background:Colon cancer is common worldwide and is the leading cause of cancer-related death. Multiple levels of omics data are available due to the development of sequencing technologies. In this study, we proposed an integrative prognostic model for colon cancer based on the integration of clinical and multi-omics data.Methods:In total, 344 patients were included in this study. Clinical, gene expression, DNA methylation and miRNA expression data were retrieved from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). To accommodate the high dimensionality of omics data, unsupervised clustering was used as dimension reduction method. The bias-corrected Harrell's concordance index was used to verify which clustering result provided the best prognostic performance. Finally, we proposed a prognostic prediction model based on the integration of clinical data and multi-omics data. Uno's concordance index with cross-validation was used to compare the discriminative performance of the prognostic model constructed with different covariates.Results:Combinations of clinical and multi-omics data can improve prognostic performance, as shown by the increase of the bias-corrected Harrell's concordance of the prognostic model from 0.7424 (clinical features only) to 0.7604 (clinical features and three types of omics features). Additionally, 2-year, 3-year and 5-year Uno's concordance statistics increased from 0.7329, 0.7043, and 0.7002 (clinical features only) to 0.7639, 0.7474 and 0.7597 (clinical features and three types of omics features), respectively.Conclusion:In conclusion, this study successfully combined clinical and multi-omics data for better prediction of colon cancer prognosis.",32033604,PMC7006213,10.1186/s12911-020-1043-1,11,BMC medical informatics and decision making,101088682,3.298,0.43206343054771423,0.7424749163879598,0.12040133779264214,0.4318133091647489
Integrated multi-omics analysis of brain aging in female nonhuman primates reveals altered signaling pathways relevant to age-related disorders,"The prefrontal cortex (PFC) has been implicated as a key brain region responsible for age-related cognitive decline. Little is known about aging-related molecular changes in PFC that may mediate these effects. To date, no studies have used untargeted discovery methods with integrated analyses to determine PFC molecular changes in healthy female primates. We quantified PFC changes associated with healthy aging in female baboons by integrating multiple omics data types (transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics) from samples across the adult age span. Our integrated omics approach using unbiased weighted gene co-expression network analysis to integrate data and treat age as a continuous variable, revealed highly interconnected known and novel pathways associated with PFC aging. We found Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) tissue content associated with these signaling pathways, providing 1 potential biomarker to assess PFC changes with age. These highly coordinated pathway changes during aging may represent early steps for aging-related decline in PFC functions, such as learning and memory, and provide potential biomarkers to assess cognitive status in humans.",37797463,,10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2023.08.009,2,Neurobiology of aging,8100437,5.133,0.4318237900733948,0.36454849498327757,0.431438127090301,0.4182915984587526
Multi-omics analysis of zebrafish response to tick saliva reveals biological processes associated with alpha-Gal syndrome,"The alpha-Gal syndrome (AGS) is a tick-borne allergy. A multi-omics approach was used to determine the effect of tick saliva and mammalian meat consumption on zebrafish gut transcriptome and proteome. Bioinformatics analysis using R software was focused on significant biological and metabolic pathway changes associated with AGS. Ortholog mapping identified highly concordant human ortholog genes for the detection of disease-enriched pathways. Tick saliva treatment increased zebrafish mortality, incidence of hemorrhagic type allergic reactions and changes in behavior and feeding patterns. Transcriptomics analysis showed downregulation of biological and metabolic pathways correlated with anti-alpha-Gal IgE and allergic reactions to tick saliva affecting blood circulation, cardiac and vascular smooth muscle contraction, behavior and sensory perception. Disease enrichment analysis revealed downregulated orthologous genes associated with human disorders affecting nervous, musculoskeletal, and cardiovascular systems. Proteomics analysis revealed suppression of pathways associated with immune system production of reactive oxygen species and cardiac muscle contraction. Underrepresented proteins were mainly linked to nervous and metabolic human disorders. Multi-omics data revealed inhibition of pathways associated with adrenergic signaling in cardiomyocytes, and heart and muscle contraction. Results identify tick saliva-related biological pathways supporting multisystemic organ involvement and linking Î±-Gal sensitization with other illnesses for the identification of potential disease biomarkers.",37922649,,10.1016/j.biopha.2023.115829,0,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,8213295,7.419,0.4318237900733948,0.1505016722408027,0.7157190635451505,0.4323384212012275
Multi-omics facilitated variable selection in Cox-regression model for cancer prognosis prediction,"Motivation:New developments in high-throughput genomic technologies have enabled the measurement of diverse types of omics biomarkers in a cost-efficient and clinically-feasible manner. Developing computational methods and tools for analysis and translation of such genomic data into clinically-relevant information is an ongoing and active area of investigation. For example, several studies have utilized an unsupervised learning framework to cluster patients by integrating omics data. Despite such recent advances, predicting cancer prognosis using integrated omics biomarkers remains a challenge. There is also a shortage of computational tools for predicting cancer prognosis by using supervised learning methods. The current standard approach is to fit a Cox regression model by concatenating the different types of omics data in a linear manner, while penalty could be added for feature selection. A more powerful approach, however, would be to incorporate data by considering relationships among omics datatypes.Methods:Here we developed two methods: a SKI-Cox method and a wLASSO-Cox method to incorporate the association among different types of omics data. Both methods fit the Cox proportional hazards model and predict a risk score based on mRNA expression profiles. SKI-Cox borrows the information generated by these additional types of omics data to guide variable selection, while wLASSO-Cox incorporates this information as a penalty factor during model fitting.Results:We show that SKI-Cox and wLASSO-Cox models select more true variables than a LASSO-Cox model in simulation studies. We assess the performance of SKI-Cox and wLASSO-Cox using TCGA glioblastoma multiforme and lung adenocarcinoma data. In each case, mRNA expression, methylation, and copy number variation data are integrated to predict the overall survival time of cancer patients. Our methods achieve better performance in predicting patients' survival in glioblastoma and lung adenocarcinoma.",28627406,,10.1016/j.ymeth.2017.06.010,20,"Methods (San Diego, Calif.)",9426302,4.647,0.4315841495990753,0.8361204013377926,0.32441471571906355,0.4910575131708164
Exploring Computational Data Amplification and Imputation for the Discovery of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) Biomarkers from Limited Human Datasets,"Background:Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a devastating disease with serious health complications. Early T1D biomarkers that could enable timely detection and prevention before the onset of clinical symptoms are paramount but currently unavailable. Despite their promise, omics approaches have so far failed to deliver such biomarkers, likely due to the fragmented nature of information obtained through the single omics approach. We recently demonstrated the utility of parallel multi-omics for the identification of T1D biomarker signatures. Our studies also identified challenges.Methods:Here, we evaluated a novel computational approach of data imputation and amplification as one way to overcome challenges associated with the relatively small number of subjects in these studies.Results:Using proprietary algorithms, we amplified our quadra-omics (proteomics, metabolomics, lipidomics, and transcriptomics) dataset from nine subjects a thousand-fold and analyzed the data usingIngenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA)software to assess the change in its analytical capabilities and biomarker prediction power in the amplified datasets compared to the original. These studies showed the ability to identify an increased number of T1D-relevant pathways and biomarkers in such computationally amplified datasets, especially, at imputation ratios close to the ""golden ratio"" of 38.2%:61.8%. Specifically, theCanonical PathwayandDiseases and Functionsmodules identified higher numbers of inflammatory pathways and functions relevant to autoimmune T1D, including novel ones not identified in the original data. TheBiomarker Predictionmodule also predicted in the amplified data several unique biomarker candidates with direct links to T1D pathogenesis.Conclusions:These preliminary findings indicate that such large-scale data imputation and amplification approaches are useful in facilitating the discovery of candidate integrated biomarker signatures of T1D or other diseases by increasing the predictive range of existing data mining tools, especially when the size of the input data is inherently limited.",36291653,PMC9599756,10.3390/biom12101444,2,Biomolecules,101596414,6.064,0.4313446581363678,0.36789297658862874,0.5050167224080268,0.4333887346811518
iSMOD: an integrative browser for image-based single-cell multi-omics data,"Genomic and transcriptomic image data, represented by DNA and RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), respectively, together with proteomic data, particularly that related to nuclear proteins, can help elucidate gene regulation in relation to the spatial positions of chromatins, messenger RNAs, and key proteins. However, methods for image-based multi-omics data collection and analysis are lacking. To this end, we aimed to develop the first integrative browser called iSMOD (image-based Single-cell Multi-omics Database) to collect and browse comprehensive FISH and nucleus proteomics data based on the title, abstract, and related experimental figures, which integrates multi-omics studies focusing on the key players in the cell nucleus from 20 000+ (still growing) published papers. We have also provided several exemplar demonstrations to show iSMOD's wide applications-profiling multi-omics research to reveal the molecular target for diseases; exploring the working mechanism behind biological phenomena using multi-omics interactions, and integrating the 3D multi-omics data in a virtual cell nucleus. iSMOD is a cornerstone for delineating a global view of relevant research to enable the integration of scattered data and thus provides new insights regarding the missing components of molecular pathway mechanisms and facilitates improved and efficient scientific research.",37439331,PMC10484677,10.1093/nar/gkad580,0,Nucleic acids research,411011,19.16,0.42895087599754333,0.15384615384615385,0.9698996655518395,0.48211968947812467
Molecular genomic landscapes of hepatobiliary cancer,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and biliary tract cancer are more frequent in East Asia including Japan than in Europe or North America. A compilation of 1340 multi-ethnic HCC genomes, the largest cohort ever reported, identified a comprehensive landscape of HCC driver genes, comprised of three core drivers (TP53, TERT, and WNT signaling) and combinations of infrequent alterations in various cancer pathways. In contrast, five core driver genes (TP53, ARID1A, KRAS, SMAD4, and BAP1) with characteristic molecular alterations including fusion transcripts involving fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 and the protein kinase A pathway, and IDH1/2 mutation constituted the biliary tract cancer genomes. Consistent with their heterogeneous epidemiological backgrounds, mutational signatures and combinations of non-core driver genes within these cancer genomes were found to be complex. Integrative analyses of multi-omics data identified molecular classifications of these tumors that are associated with clinical outcome and enrichments of potential therapeutic targets, including immune checkpoint molecules. Translating comprehensive molecular-genomic analysis together with further basic research and international collaborations are highly anticipated for developing precise and better treatments, diagnosis, and prevention of these tumor types.",29573058,PMC5980207,10.1111/cas.13582,19,Cancer science,101168776,6.518,0.42769548296928406,0.8260869565217391,0.5518394648829431,0.5322025740625069
"Synthetic lethality prediction in DNA damage repair, chromatin remodeling and the cell cycle using multi-omics data from cell lines and patients","Discovering synthetic lethal (SL) gene partners of cancer genes is an important step in developing cancer therapies. However, identification of SL interactions is challenging, due to a large number of possible gene pairs, inherent noise and confounding factors in the observed signal. To discover robust SL interactions, we devised SLIDE-VIP, a novel framework combining eight statistical tests, including a new patient data-based test iSurvLRT. SLIDE-VIP leverages multi-omics data from four different sources: gene inactivation cell line screens, cancer patient data, drug screens and gene pathways. We applied SLIDE-VIP to discover SL interactions between genes involved in DNA damage repair, chromatin remodeling and cell cycle, and their potentially druggable partners. The top 883 ranking SL candidates had strong evidence in cell line and patient data, 250-fold reducing the initial space of 200K pairs. Drug screen and pathway tests provided additional corroboration and insights into these interactions. We rediscovered well-known SL pairs such as RB1 and E2F3 or PRKDC and ATM, and in addition, proposed strong novel SL candidates such as PTEN and PIK3CB. In summary, SLIDE-VIP opens the door to the discovery of SL interactions with clinical potential.

Parallel Multi-Omics in High-Risk Subjects for the Identification of Integrated Biomarker Signatures of Type 1 Diabetes,"Background:Biomarkers are crucial for detecting early type-1 diabetes (T1D) and preventing significant Î²-cell loss before the onset of clinical symptoms. Here, we present proof-of-concept studies to demonstrate the potential for identifying integrated biomarker signature(s) of T1D using parallel multi-omics.Methods:Blood from human subjects at high risk for T1D (and healthy controls;n= 4 + 4) was subjected to parallel unlabeled proteomics, metabolomics, lipidomics, and transcriptomics. The integrated dataset was analyzed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software for disturbances in the at-risk subjects compared to controls.Results:The final quadra-omics dataset contained 2292 proteins, 328 miRNAs, 75 metabolites, and 41 lipids that were detected in all samples without exception. Disease/function enrichment analyses consistently indicated increased activation, proliferation, and migration of CD4 T-lymphocytes and macrophages. Integrated molecular network predictions highlighted central involvement and activation of NF-ÎºB, TGF-Î², VEGF, arachidonic acid, and arginase, and inhibition of miRNA Let-7a-5p. IPA-predicted candidate biomarkers were used to construct a putative integrated signature containing several miRNAs and metabolite/lipid features in the at-risk subjects.Conclusions:Preliminary parallel quadra-omics provided a comprehensive picture of disturbances in high-risk T1D subjects and highlighted the potential for identifying associated integrated biomarker signatures.

A multi-omics integrative analysis based on CRISPR screens re-defines the pluripotency regulatory network in ESCs,"A comprehensive and precise definition of the pluripotency gene regulatory network (PGRN) is crucial for clarifying the regulatory mechanisms in embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Here, after a CRISPR/Cas9-based functional genomics screen and integrative analysis with other functional genomes, transcriptomes, proteomes and epigenome data, an expanded pluripotency-associated gene set is obtained, and a new PGRN with nine sub-classes is constructed. By integrating the DNA binding, epigenetic modification, chromatin conformation, and RNA expression profiles, the PGRN is resolved to six functionally independent transcriptional modules (CORE, MYC, PAF, PRC, PCGF and TBX). Spatiotemporal transcriptomics reveal activated CORE/MYC/PAF module activity and repressed PRC/PCGF/TBX module activity in both mouse ESCs (mESCs) and pluripotent cells of early embryos. Moreover, this module activity pattern is found to be shared by human ESCs (hESCs) and cancers.

Lung cancer multi-omics digital human avatars for integrating precision medicine into clinical practice: the LANTERN study,"Background:The current management of lung cancer patients has reached a high level of complexity. Indeed, besides the traditional clinical variables (e.g., age, sex, TNM stage), new omics data have recently been introduced in clinical practice, thereby making more complex the decision-making process. With the advent of Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, various omics datasets may be used to create more accurate predictive models paving the way for a better care in lung cancer patients.Methods:The LANTERN study is a multi-center observational clinical trial involving a multidisciplinary consortium of five institutions from different European countries. The aim of this trial is to develop accurate several predictive models for lung cancer patients, through the creation of Digital Human Avatars (DHA), defined as digital representations of patients using various omics-based variables and integrating well-established clinical factors with genomic data, quantitative imaging data etc. A total of 600 lung cancer patients will be prospectively enrolled by the recruiting centers and multi-omics data will be collected. Data will then be modelled and parameterized in an experimental context of cutting-edge big data analysis. All data variables will be recorded according to a shared common ontology based on variable-specific domains in order to enhance their direct actionability. An exploratory analysis will then initiate the biomarker identification process. The second phase of the project will focus on creating multiple multivariate models trained though advanced machine learning (ML) and AI techniques for the specific areas of interest. Finally, the developed models will be validated in order to test their robustness, transferability and generalizability, leading to the development of the DHA. All the potential clinical and scientific stakeholders will be involved in the DHA development process.

[Research progress on pneumoconiosis markers based on multi-omics analysis],"The etiology of pneumoconiosis is relatively clear, but the pathogenic mechanism is not fully understood, and there is no effective cure for pneumoconiosis. Clarifying the pathogenesis of pneumoconiosis and exploring relevant markers can help screen high-risk groups of dust exposure, and relevant markers can also be used as targets to intervene in the process of pulmonary fibrosis. The in-depth development of genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics has provided a new way to discover more potential markers of pneumoconiosis. In the future, the combination of multi-omics and multi-stage interactive analysis can systematically and comprehensively identify key genes (proteins) , metabolites and metabolic pathways in the occurrence and development of pneumoconiosis, build a core regulatory network, and then screen out sensitive markers related to early diagnosis and treatment of pneumoconiosis. This article summarizes the research progress of pneumoconiosis markers from the perspective of multi-omics, hoping to provide more basic data for the early prevention and diagnosis of pneumoconiosis, pathogenesis research, and therapeutic intervention.",38802314,,10.3760/cma.j.cn121094-20230321-00089,0,Zhonghua lao dong wei sheng zhi ye bing za zhi = Zhonghua laodong weisheng,8410840,0.0,0.4223259389400482,0.16387959866220736,0.05351170568561873,0.29687382423359415
Identifying biomarkers for predicting successful embryo implantation: applying single to multi-OMICs to improve reproductive outcomes,"Background:Successful embryo implantation is a complex process that requires the coordination of a series of events, involving both the embryo and the maternal endometrium. Key to this process is the intricate cascade of molecular mechanisms regulated by endocrine, paracrine and autocrine modulators of embryonic and maternal origin. Despite significant progress in ART, implantation failure still affects numerous infertile couples worldwide and fewer than 10% of embryos successfully implant. Improved selection of both the viable embryos and the optimal endometrial phenotype for transfer remains crucial to enhancing implantation chances. However, both classical morphological embryo selection and new strategies incorporated into clinical practice, such as embryonic genetic analysis, morphokinetics or ultrasound endometrial dating, remain insufficient to predict successful implantation. Additionally, no techniques are widely applied to analyse molecular signals involved in the embryo-uterine interaction. More reliable biological markers to predict embryo and uterine reproductive competence are needed to improve pregnancy outcomes. Recent years have seen a trend towards 'omics' methods, which enable the assessment of complete endometrial and embryonic molecular profiles during implantation. Omics have advanced our knowledge of the implantation process, identifying potential but rarely implemented biomarkers of successful implantation.Objective and rationale:Differences between the findings of published omics studies, and perhaps because embryonic and endometrial molecular signatures were often not investigated jointly, have prevented firm conclusions being reached. A timely review summarizing omics studies on the molecular determinants of human implantation in both the embryo and the endometrium will help facilitate integrative and reliable omics approaches to enhance ART outcomes.Search methods:In order to provide a comprehensive review of the literature published up to September 2019, Medline databases were searched using keywords pertaining to omics, including 'transcriptome', 'proteome', 'secretome', 'metabolome' and 'expression profiles', combined with terms related to implantation, such as 'endometrial receptivity', 'embryo viability' and 'embryo implantation'. No language restrictions were imposed. References from articles were also used for additional literature.Outcomes:Here we provide a complete summary of the major achievements in human implantation research supplied by omics approaches, highlighting their potential to improve reproductive outcomes while fully elucidating the implantation mechanism. The review highlights the existence of discrepancies among the postulated biomarkers from studies on embryo viability or endometrial receptivity, even using the same omic analysis.Wider implications:Despite the huge amount of biomarker information provided by omics, we still do not have enough evidence to link data from all omics with an implantation outcome. However, in the foreseeable future, application of minimally or non-invasive omics tools, together with a more integrative interpretation of uniformly collected data, will help to overcome the difficulties for clinical implementation of omics tools. Omics assays of the embryo and endometrium are being proposed or already being used as diagnostic tools for personalised single-embryo transfer in the most favourable endometrial environment, avoiding the risk of multiple pregnancies and ensuring better pregnancy rates.",32096829,,10.1093/humupd/dmz042,35,Human reproduction update,9507614,17.179,0.4223259389400482,0.9063545150501672,0.9130434782608695,0.6172751620262363
optima: an open-source R package for the Tapestri platform for integrative single cell multiomics data analysis,"Summary:The Tapestri platform offers DNA and protein analysis at the single-cell level. Integrating both types of data is beneficial for studying multiple cell populations in heterogeneous microenvironments, such as tumor tissues. Here, we present optima, an R package for the processing and analysis of data generated from the Tapestri platform. This package provides streamlined functionality for raw data filtering, integration, normalization, transformation, and visualization. Insights gained from the optima package help users to identify unique cell populations and uncover surface protein expression patterns.

A framework for identifying dysregulated chromatin regulators as master regulators in human cancer,"Motivation:Chromatin regulators (CRs) are frequently dysregulated to reprogram the epigenetic landscape of the cancer genome. However, the underpinnings of the dysregulation of CRs and their downstream effectors remain to be elucidated.Results:Here, we designed an integrated framework based on multi-omics data to identify candidate master regulatory CRs affected by genomic alterations across eight cancer types in The Cancer Genome Atlas. Most of them showed consistent activated or repressed (i.e. oncogenic or tumor-suppressive) roles in cancer initiation and progression. In order to further explore the insight mechanism of the dysregulated CRs, we developed an R package ModReg based on differential connectivity to identify CRs as modulators of transcription factors (TFs) involved in tumorigenesis. Our analysis revealed that the connectivity between TFs and their target genes (TGs) tended to be disrupted in the patients who had a high expression of oncogenic CRs or low-expression of tumor-suppressive CRs. As a proof-of-principle study, 14 (82.4%) of the top-ranked 17 driver CRs in liver cancer were able to be validated by literature mining or experiments including shRNA knockdown and dCas9-based epigenetic editing. Moreover, we confirmed that CR SIRT7 physically interacted with TF NFE2L2, and positively modulated the transcriptional program of NFE2L2 by affecting â¼64% of its TGs.Availability and implementation:ModReg is freely accessible at http://cis.hku.hk/software/ModReg.tar.gz.Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",30358822,,10.1093/bioinformatics/bty836,2,"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",9808944,6.931,0.4217899739742279,0.3712374581939799,0.6421404682274248,0.4557495696688177
Pan-cancer onco-signatures reveal a novel mitochondrial subtype of luminal breast cancer with specific regulators,"Background:Somatic alterations in cancer cause dysregulation of signaling pathways that control cell-cycle progression, apoptosis, and cell growth. The effect of individual alterations in these pathways differs between individual tumors and tumor types. Recognizing driver events is a complex task requiring integrating multiple molecular data, including genomics, epigenomics, and functional genomics. A common hypothesis is that these driver events share similar effects on the hallmarks of cancer. The availability of large-scale multi-omics studies allows for inferring these common effects from data. Once these effects are known, one can then deconvolve in every individual patient whether a given genomics alteration is a driver event.Methods:Here, we develop a novel data-driven approach to identify shared oncogenic expression signatures among tumors. We aim to identify gene onco-signature for classifying tumor patients in homogeneous subclasses with distinct prognoses and specific genomic alterations. We derive expression pan-cancer onco-signatures from TCGA gene expression data using a discovery set of 9107 primary pan-tumor samples together with respective matched mutational data and a list of known cancer-related genes from COSMIC database.Results:We use the derived ono-signatures to state their prognostic significance and apply them to the TCGA breast cancer dataset as proof of principle of our approach. We uncover a ""mitochondrial"" sub-group of Luminal patients characterized by its biological features and regulated by specific genetic modulators. Collectively, our results demonstrate the effectiveness of onco-signatures-based methodologies, and they also contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the metabolic heterogeneity of Luminal tumors.Conclusions:These findings provide novel genomics evidence for developing personalized breast cancer patient treatments. The onco-signature approach, demonstrated here on breast cancer, is general and can be applied to other cancer types.",36717859,PMC9885701,10.1186/s12967-023-03907-z,0,Journal of translational medicine,101190741,8.44,0.42089709639549255,0.1705685618729097,0.7625418060200669,0.43916033141589084
Multi-omics analysis predicts fibronectin 1 as a prognostic biomarker in glioblastoma multiforme,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is one of the most malignant and intractable central nervous system tumors with high recurrence, low survival rate, and poor prognosis. Despite the advances of aggressive, multimodal treatment, a successful treatment strategy is still elusive, often leading to therapeutic resistance and fatality. Thus, it is imperative to search for and identify novel markers critically associated with GBM pathogenesis to improve the existing trend of diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. Seven publicly available GEO microarray datasets containing 409 GBM samples were integrated and further data mining was conducted using several bioinformatics tools. A total of 209 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in the GBM tissue samples compared to the normal brains. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of the DEGs revealed association of the upregulates genes with extracellular matrix (ECM), conceivably contributing to the invasive nature of GBM while downregulated DEGs were found to be predominantly related to neuronal processes and structures. Alongside, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Reactome pathway analyses described the involvement of the DEGs with various crucial contributing pathways (PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, p53 signaling pathway, insulin secretion, etc.) in GBM progression and pathogenesis. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network containing 879 nodes and 1237 edges revealed 3 significant modules and consecutive KEGG pathway analysis of these modules showed a significant connection to gliomagenesis. Later, 10 hub genes were screened out based on degree and their expressions were externally validated. Surprisingly, only fibronectin 1 (FN1) high expression appeared to be related to poor prognosis. Subsequently, 109 transcription factors and 211 miRNAs were detected to be involved with the hub genes where FN1 demonstrated the highest number of interactions. Considering its high connectivity and potential prognostic value FN1 could be a novel biomarker providing new insights into the prognosis and treatment for GBM, although experimental validation is required.",35513291,,10.1016/j.ygeno.2022.110378,5,Genomics,8800135,4.31,0.4185780882835388,0.5986622073578596,0.2608695652173913,0.4230532074851735
MSProGene: integrative proteogenomics beyond six-frames and single nucleotide polymorphisms,"Ongoing advances in high-throughput technologies have facilitated accurate proteomic measurements and provide a wealth of information on genomic and transcript level. In proteogenomics, this multi-omics data is combined to analyze unannotated organisms and to allow more accurate sample-specific predictions. Existing analysis methods still mainly depend on six-frame translations or reference protein databases that are extended by transcriptomic information or known single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). However, six-frames introduce an artificial sixfold increase of the target database and SNP integration requires a suitable database summarizing results from previous experiments. We overcome these limitations by introducing MSProGene, a new method for integrative proteogenomic analysis based on customized RNA-Seq driven transcript databases. MSProGene is independent from existing reference databases or annotated SNPs and avoids large six-frame translated databases by constructing sample-specific transcripts. In addition, it creates a network combining RNA-Seq and peptide information that is optimized by a maximum-flow algorithm. It thereby also allows resolving the ambiguity of shared peptides for protein inference. We applied MSProGene on three datasets and show that it facilitates a database-independent reliable yet accurate prediction on gene and protein level and additionally identifies novel genes.Availability and implementation:MSProGene is written in Java and Python. It is open source and available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/msprogene/.",26072472,PMC4765881,10.1093/bioinformatics/btv236,20,"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",9808944,6.931,0.4179840087890625,0.8394648829431438,0.6454849498327759,0.5477803718286214
A multi-modal data harmonisation approach for discovery of COVID-19 drug targets,"Despite the volume of experiments performed and data available, the complex biology of coronavirus SARS-COV-2 is not yet fully understood. Existing molecular profiling studies have focused on analysing functional omics data of a single type, which captures changes in a small subset of the molecular perturbations caused by the virus. As the logical next step, results from multiple such omics analysis may be aggregated to comprehensively interpret the molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2. An alternative approach is to integrate data simultaneously in a parallel fashion to highlight the inter-relationships of disease-driving biomolecules, in contrast to comparing processed information from each omics level separately. We demonstrate that valuable information may be masked by using the former fragmented views in analysis, and biomarkers resulting from such an approach cannot provide a systematic understanding of the disease aetiology. Hence, we present a generic, reproducible and flexible open-access data harmonisation framework that can be scaled out to future multi-omics analysis to study a phenotype in a holistic manner. The pipeline source code, detailed documentation and automated version as a R package are accessible. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our pipeline, we applied it to a drug screening task. We integrated multi-omics data to find the lowest level of statistical associations between data features in two case studies. Strongly correlated features within each of these two datasets were used for drug-target analysis, resulting in a list of 84 drug-target candidates. Further computational docking and toxicity analyses revealed seven high-confidence targets, amsacrine, bosutinib, ceritinib, crizotinib, nintedanib and sunitinib as potential starting points for drug therapy and development.",34036326,PMC8194516,10.1093/bib/bbab185,4,Briefings in bioinformatics,100912837,13.994,0.41685599088668823,0.5083612040133779,0.8929765886287625,0.5303811530604411
Multi-omics Visualization Platform: An extensible Galaxy plug-in for multi-omics data visualization and exploration,"Background:Proteogenomics integrates genomics, transcriptomics, and mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics data to identify novel protein sequences arising from gene and transcript sequence variants. Proteogenomic data analysis requires integration of disparate 'omic software tools, as well as customized tools to view and interpret results. The flexible Galaxy platform has proven valuable for proteogenomic data analysis. Here, we describe a novel Multi-omics Visualization Platform (MVP) for organizing, visualizing, and exploring proteogenomic results, adding a critically needed tool for data exploration and interpretation.Findings:MVP is built as an HTML Galaxy plug-in, primarily based on JavaScript. Via the Galaxy API, MVP uses SQLite databases as input-a custom data type (mzSQLite) containing MS-based peptide identification information, a variant annotation table, and a coding sequence table. Users can interactively filter identified peptides based on sequence and data quality metrics, view annotated peptide MS data, and visualize protein-level information, along with genomic coordinates. Peptides that pass the user-defined thresholds can be sent back to Galaxy via the API for further analysis; processed data and visualizations can also be saved and shared. MVP leverages the Integrated Genomics Viewer JavaScript framework, enabling interactive visualization of peptides and corresponding transcript and genomic coding information within the MVP interface.Conclusions:MVP provides a powerful, extensible platform for automated, interactive visualization of proteogenomic results within the Galaxy environment, adding a unique and critically needed tool for empowering exploration and interpretation of results.

Advances in applying of multi-omics approaches in the research of systemic lupus erythematosus,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), an autoimmune disease that causes multiorgan injury, has an unclear etiology and complex pathogenesis. Numerous studies have found abnormal alterations in mRNAs, proteins and/or metabolites in SLE patients. These findings have extended our understanding of the pathogenesis of SLE. Novel omics techniques, such as transcriptome, proteome and metabolome profiling, can identify and quantify large numbers of biomarkers of human diseases. However, in most cases, biological reactions are the consequences of interactions among genes, proteomes, and metabolites. Single biomolecules or signaling pathways cannot fully explain biological traits or functions. Therefore, integrative multi-omics analysis can help us systematically comprehend the intrinsic molecular mechanisms underlying biological function and pathogenesis. Integrating transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome KEGG enrichment analysis data will expand our knowledge of the pathogenesis of SLE.

Multiomix: a cloud-based platform to infer cancer genomic and epigenomic events associated with gene expression modulation,"Motivation:Large-scale cancer genome projects have generated genomic, transcriptomic, epigenomic and clinicopathological data from thousands of samples in almost every human tumor site. Although most omics data and their associated resources are publicly available, its full integration and interpretation to dissect the sources of gene expression modulation require specialized knowledge and software.Results:We present Multiomix, an interactive cloud-based platform that allows biologists to identify genetic and epigenetic events associated with the transcriptional modulation of cancer-related genes through the analysis of multi-omics data available on public functional genomic databases or user-uploaded datasets. Multiomix consists of an integrated set of functions, pipelines and a graphical user interface that allows retrieval, aggregation, analysis and visualization of different omics data sources. After the user provides the data to be analyzed, Multiomix identifies all significant correlations between mRNAs and non-mRNA genomics features (e.g. miRNA, DNA methylation and CNV) across the genome, the predicted sequence-based interactions (e.g. miRNA-mRNA) and their associated prognostic values.Availability and implementation:Multiomix is available at https://www.multiomix.org.

Multi-omics analysis identifies osteosarcoma subtypes with distinct prognosis indicating stratified treatment,"Osteosarcoma (OS) is a primary malignant bone tumor that most commonly affects children, adolescents, and young adults. Here, we comprehensively analyze genomic, epigenomic and transcriptomic data from 121 OS patients. Somatic mutations are diverse within the cohort, and only TP53 is significantly mutated. Through unsupervised integrative clustering of the multi-omics data, we classify OS into four subtypes with distinct molecular features and clinical prognosis: (1) Immune activated (S-IA), (2) Immune suppressed (S-IS), (3) Homologous recombination deficiency dominant (S-HRD), and (4) MYC driven (S-MD). MYC amplification with HR proficiency tumors is identified with a high oxidative phosphorylation signature resulting in resistance to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Potential therapeutic targets are identified for each subtype, including platinum-based chemotherapy, immune checkpoint inhibitors, anti-VEGFR, anti-MYC and PARPi-based synthetic lethal strategies. Our comprehensive integrated characterization provides a valuable resource that deepens our understanding of the disease, and may guide future clinical strategies for the precision treatment of OS.",36418292,PMC9684515,10.1038/s41467-022-34689-5,19,Nature communications,101528555,17.694,0.41466179490089417,0.8294314381270903,0.9364548494983278,0.6019743344656201
An integrated multiomics analysis of rectal cancer patients identified POU2F3 as a putative druggable target and entinostat as a cytotoxic enhancer of 5-fluorouracil,"Rectal cancer (RC) accounts for one-third of colorectal cancers (CRC), and 40% of these are locally advanced rectal cancers (LARC). The use of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) significantly reduces the rate of local recurrence compared to adjuvant therapy or surgery alone. However, after nCRT, up to 40%-60% of patients show a poor pathological response, while only about 20% achieve a pathological complete response. In this scenario, the identification of novel predictors of tumor response to nCRT is urgently needed to reduce LARC mortality and to spare poorly responding patients from unnecessary treatments. Therefore, by combining gene and microRNA expression datasets with proteomic data from LARC patients, we developed an integrated network centered on seven hub-genes putatively involved in the response to nCRT. In an independent validation cohort of LARC patients, we confirmed that differential expression of NFKB1, TRAF6 and STAT3 is correlated with the response to nCRT. In addition, the functional enrichment analysis also revealed that these genes are strongly related to hallmarks of cancer and inflammation, whose dysfunction may causatively affect LARC patient's response to nCRT. Furthermore, by constructing the transcription factor-module network, we hypothesized a protective role of POU2F3 gene, which could be used as a new drug target in LARC patients. Finally, we identified and tested in vitro entinostat, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, as a chemical compound that could be combined with a classical therapeutic regimen in order to design more efficient therapeutic strategies in LARC management.",36815540,,10.1002/ijc.34478,0,International journal of cancer,42124,7.316,0.41460251808166504,0.17725752508361203,0.6956521739130435,0.4233434506483301

Multi-omics reveals novel prognostic implication of SRC protein expression in bladder cancer and its correlation with immunotherapy response,"Purpose:This study aims to identify potential prognostic biomarkers of bladder cancer (BCa) based on large-scale multi-omics data and investigate the role of SRC in improving predictive outcomes for BCa patients and those receiving immune checkpoint therapies (ICTs).Methods:Large-scale multi-comic data were enrolled from the Cancer Proteome Atlas, the Cancer Genome Atlas and gene expression omnibus based on machining-learning methods. Immune infiltration, survival and other statistical analyses were implemented using R software in cancers (n= 12,452). The predictive value of SRC was performed in 81 BCa patients receiving ICT from aa validation cohort (n= 81).Results:Landscape of novel candidate prognostic protein signatures of BCa patients was identified. Differential BECLIN, EGFR, PKCALPHA, ANNEXIN1, AXL and SRC expression significantly correlated with the outcomes for BCa patients from multiply cohorts (n= 906). Notably, risk score of the integrated prognosis-related proteins (IPRPs) model exhibited high diagnostic accuracy and consistent predictive ability (AUC = 0.714). Besides, we tested the clinical relevance of baseline SRC protein and mRNA expression in two independent confirmatory cohorts (n= 566) and the prognostic value in pan-cancers. Then, we found that elevated SRC expression contributed to immunosuppressive microenvironment mediated by immune checkpoint molecules of BCa and other cancers. Next, we validated SRC expression as a potential biomarker in predicting response to ICT in 81 BCa patient from FUSCC cohort, and found that expression of SRC in the baseline tumour tissues correlated with improved survival benefits, but predicts worse ICT response.Conclusion:This study first performed the large-scale multi-omics analysis, distinguished the IPRPs (BECLIN, EGFR, PKCALPHA, SRC, ANNEXIN1andAXL) and revealed novel prediction model, outperforming the currently traditional prognostic indicators for anticipating BCa progression and better clinical strategies. Additionally, this study provided insight into the importance of biomarker SRC for better prognosis, which may inversely improve predictive outcomes for patients receiving ICT and enable patient selection for future clinical treatment.",33830879,PMC8043611,10.1080/07853890.2021.1908588,9,Annals of medicine,8906388,5.348,0.4130627512931824,0.7123745819397993,0.44481605351170567,0.47927577786621045
DROEG: a method for cancer drug response prediction based on omics and essential genes integration,"Predicting therapeutic responses in cancer patients is a major challenge in the field of precision medicine due to high inter- and intra-tumor heterogeneity. Most drug response models need to be improved in terms of accuracy, and there is limited research to assess therapeutic responses of particular tumor types. Here, we developed a novel method DROEG (Drug Response based on Omics and Essential Genes) for prediction of drug response in tumor cell lines by integrating genomic, transcriptomic and methylomic data along with CRISPR essential genes, and revealed that the incorporation of tumor proliferation essential genes can improve drug sensitivity prediction. Concisely, DROEG integrates literature-based and statistics-based methods to select features and uses Support Vector Regression for model construction. We demonstrate that DROEG outperforms most state-of-the-art algorithms by both qualitative (prediction accuracy for drug-sensitive/resistant) and quantitative (Pearson correlation coefficient between the predicted and actual IC50) evaluation in Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer and Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia datasets. In addition, DROEG is further applied to the pan-gastrointestinal tumor with high prevalence and mortality as a case study at both cell line and clinical levels to evaluate the model efficacy and discover potential prognostic biomarkers in Cisplatin and Epirubicin treatment. Interestingly, the CRISPR essential gene information is found to be the most important contributor to enhance the accuracy of the DROEG model. To our knowledge, this is the first study to integrate essential genes with multi-omics data to improve cancer drug response prediction and provide insights into personalized precision treatment.",36715269,,10.1093/bib/bbad003,0,Briefings in bioinformatics,100912837,13.994,0.4128851890563965,0.1806020066889632,0.8963210702341137,0.4631157288184532
Multi-Staged Data-Integrated Multi-Omics Analysis for Symptom Science Research,"The incorporation of omics approaches into symptom science research can provide researchers with information about the molecular mechanisms that underlie symptoms. Most of the omics analyses in symptom science have used a single omics approach. Therefore, these analyses are limited by the information contained within a specific omics domain (e.g., genomics and inherited variations, transcriptomics and gene function). A multi-staged data-integrated multi-omics (MS-DIMO) analysis integrates multiple types of omics data in a single study. With this integration, a MS-DIMO analysis can provide a more comprehensive picture of the complex biological mechanisms that underlie symptoms. The results of a MS-DIMO analysis can be used to refine mechanistic hypotheses and/or discover therapeutic targets for specific symptoms. The purposes of this paper are to: (1) describe a MS-DIMO analysis using ""Symptom X"" as an example; (2) discuss a number of challenges associated with specific omics analyses and how a MS-DIMO analysis can address them; (3) describe the various orders of omics data that can be used in a MS-DIMO analysis; (4) describe omics analysis tools; and (5) review case exemplars of MS-DIMO analyses in symptom science. This paper provides information on how a MS-DIMO analysis can strengthen symptom science research through the prioritization of functional genes and biological processes associated with a specific symptom.",33827270,PMC8726420,10.1177/10998004211003980,4,Biological research for nursing,9815758,2.318,0.412234365940094,0.5150501672240803,0.08361204013377926,0.3670730610356283
Group Lasso Regularized Deep Learning for Cancer Prognosis from Multi-Omics and Clinical Features,"Accurate prognosis of patients with cancer is important for the stratification of patients, the optimization of treatment strategies, and the design of clinical trials. Both clinical features and molecular data can be used for this purpose, for instance, to predict the survival of patients censored at specific time points. Multi-omics data, including genome-wide gene expression, methylation, protein expression, copy number alteration, and somatic mutation data, are becoming increasingly common in cancer studies. To harness the rich information in multi-omics data, we developed GDP (Group lass regularized Deep learning for cancer Prognosis), a computational tool for survival prediction using both clinical and multi-omics data. GDP integrated a deep learning framework and Cox proportional hazard model (CPH) together, and applied group lasso regularization to incorporate gene-level group prior knowledge into the model training process. We evaluated its performance in both simulated and real data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project. In simulated data, our results supported the importance of group prior information in the regularization of the model. Compared to the standard lasso regularization, we showed that group lasso achieved higher prediction accuracy when the group prior knowledge was provided. We also found that GDP performed better than CPH for complex survival data. Furthermore, analysis on real data demonstrated that GDP performed favorably against other methods in several cancers with large-scale omics data sets, such as glioblastoma multiforme, kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, and bladder urothelial carcinoma. In summary, we demonstrated that GDP is a powerful tool for prognosis of patients with cancer, especially when large-scale molecular features are available.",30901858,PMC6471789,10.3390/genes10030240,30,Genes,101551097,4.141,0.41046085953712463,0.8929765886287625,0.24749163879598662,0.4743701612072246
"Identification, semantic annotation and comparison of combinations of functional elements in multiple biological conditions","Motivation:Approaches such as chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) represent the standard for the identification of binding sites of DNA-associated proteins, including transcription factors and histone marks. Public repositories of omics data contain a huge number of experimental ChIP-seq data, but their reuse and integrative analysis across multiple conditions remain a daunting task.Results:We present the Combinatorial and Semantic Analysis of Functional Elements (CombSAFE), an efficient computational method able to integrate and take advantage of the valuable and numerous, but heterogeneous, ChIP-seq data publicly available in big data repositories. Leveraging natural language processing techniques, it integrates omics data samples with semantic annotations from selected biomedical ontologies; then, using hidden Markov models, it identifies combinations of static and dynamic functional elements throughout the genome for the corresponding samples. CombSAFE allows analyzing the whole genome, by clustering patterns of regions with similar functional elements and through enrichment analyses to discover ontological terms significantly associated with them. Moreover, it allows comparing functional states of a specific genomic region to analyze their different behavior throughout the various semantic annotations. Such findings can provide novel insights by identifying unexpected combinations of functional elements in different biological conditions.Availability and implementation:The Python implementation of the CombSAFE pipeline is freely available for non-commercial use at: https://github.com/DEIB-GECO/CombSAFE.Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",34864898,,10.1093/bioinformatics/btab815,1,"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",9808944,6.931,0.4102245569229126,0.2842809364548495,0.6521739130434783,0.4334257040534132
"Integration of transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics data to reveal HER2-associated metabolic heterogeneity in gastric cancer with response to immunotherapy and neoadjuvant chemotherapy","Background:Currently available prognostic tools and focused therapeutic methods result in unsatisfactory treatment of gastric cancer (GC). A deeper understanding of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-coexpressed metabolic pathways may offer novel insights into tumour-intrinsic precision medicine.Methods:The integrated multi-omics strategies (including transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics) were applied to develop a novel metabolic classifier for gastric cancer. We integrated TCGA-STAD cohort (375 GC samples and 56753 genes) and TCPA-STAD cohort (392 GC samples and 218 proteins), and rated them as transcriptomics and proteomics data, resepectively. 224 matched blood samples of GC patients and healthy individuals were collected to carry out untargeted metabolomics analysis.Results:In this study, pan-cancer analysis highlighted the crucial role of ERBB2 in the immune microenvironment and metabolic remodelling. In addition, the metabolic landscape of GC indicated that alanine, aspartate and glutamate (AAG) metabolism was significantly associated with the prevalence and progression of GC. Weighted metabolite correlation network analysis revealed that glycolysis/gluconeogenesis (GG) and AAG metabolism served as HER2-coexpressed metabolic pathways. Consensus clustering was used to stratify patients with GC into four subtypes with different metabolic characteristics (i.e. quiescent, GG, AAG and mixed subtypes). The GG subtype was characterised by a lower level of ERBB2 expression, a higher proportion of the inflammatory phenotype and the worst prognosis. However, contradictory features were found in the mixed subtype with the best prognosis. The GG and mixed subtypes were found to be highly sensitive to chemotherapy, whereas the quiescent and AAG subtypes were more likely to benefit from immunotherapy.Conclusions:Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses highlighted the close association of HER-2 level with the immune status and metabolic features of patients with GC. Metabolomics analysis highlighted the co-expressed relationship between alanine, aspartate and glutamate and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis metabolisms and HER2 level in GC. The novel integrated multi-omics strategy used in this study may facilitate the development of a more tailored approach to GC therapy.",35990657,PMC9389544,10.3389/fimmu.2022.951137,43,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,8.786,0.409633994102478,0.919732441471572,0.7892976588628763,0.5875864165283764
Applications of artificial intelligence multiomics in precision oncology,"Cancer is the second leading worldwide disease that depends on oncogenic mutations and non-mutated genes for survival. Recent advancements in next-generation sequencing (NGS) have transformed the health care sector with big data and machine learning (ML) approaches. NGS data are able to detect the abnormalities and mutations in the oncogenes. These multi-omics analyses are used for risk prediction, early diagnosis, accurate prognosis, and identification of biomarkers in cancer patients. The availability of these cancer data and their analysis may provide insights into the biology of the disease, which can be used for the personalized treatment of cancer patients. Bioinformatics tools are delivering this promise by managing, integrating, and analyzing these complex datasets. The clinical outcomes of cancer patients are improved by the use of various innovative methods implicated particularly for diagnosis and therapeutics. ML-based artificial intelligence (AI) applications are solving these issues to a great extent. AI techniques are used to update the patients on a personalized basis about their treatment procedures, progress, recovery, therapies used, dietary changes in lifestyles patterns along with the survival summary of previously recovered cancer patients. In this way, the patients are becoming more aware of their diseases and the entire clinical treatment procedures. Though the technology has its own advantages and disadvantages, we hope that the day is not so far when AI techniques will provide personalized treatment to cancer patients tailored to their needs in much quicker ways.",35796775,,10.1007/s00432-022-04161-4,4,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,4.322,0.40821778774261475,0.5183946488294314,0.26421404682274247,0.4014524117760036
Canonical correlation analysis for multi-omics: Application to cross-cohort analysis,"Integrative approaches that simultaneously model multi-omics data have gained increasing popularity because they provide holistic system biology views of multiple or all components in a biological system of interest. Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is a correlation-based integrative method designed to extract latent features shared between multiple assays by finding the linear combinations of features-referred to as canonical variables (CVs)-within each assay that achieve maximal across-assay correlation. Although widely acknowledged as a powerful approach for multi-omics data, CCA has not been systematically applied to multi-omics data in large cohort studies, which has only recently become available. Here, we adapted sparse multiple CCA (SMCCA), a widely-used derivative of CCA, to proteomics and methylomics data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) and Jackson Heart Study (JHS). To tackle challenges encountered when applying SMCCA to MESA and JHS, our adaptations include the incorporation of the Gram-Schmidt (GS) algorithm with SMCCA to improve orthogonality among CVs, and the development of Sparse Supervised Multiple CCA (SSMCCA) to allow supervised integration analysis for more than two assays. Effective application of SMCCA to the two real datasets reveals important findings. Applying our SMCCA-GS to MESA and JHS, we identified strong associations between blood cell counts and protein abundance, suggesting that adjustment of blood cell composition should be considered in protein-based association studies. Importantly, CVs obtained from two independent cohorts also demonstrate transferability across the cohorts. For example, proteomic CVs learned from JHS, when transferred to MESA, explain similar amounts of blood cell count phenotypic variance in MESA, explaining 39.0% ~ 50.0% variation in JHS and 38.9% ~ 49.1% in MESA. Similar transferability was observed for other omics-CV-trait pairs. This suggests that biologically meaningful and cohort-agnostic variation is captured by CVs. We anticipate that applying our SMCCA-GS and SSMCCA on various cohorts would help identify cohort-agnostic biologically meaningful relationships between multi-omics data and phenotypic traits.",37216410,PMC10237647,10.1371/journal.pgen.1010517,2,PLoS genetics,101239074,6.02,0.4078049957752228,0.3745819397993311,0.4816053511705686,0.41592045565911356
A Practical Guide to Inferring Multi-Omics Networks in Plant Systems,"The inference of gene regulatory networks can reveal molecular connections underlying biological processes and improve our understanding of complex biological phenomena in plants. Many previous network studies have inferred networks using only one type of omics data, such as transcriptomics. However, given more recent work applying multi-omics integration in plant biology, such as combining (phospho)proteomics with transcriptomics, it may be advantageous to integrate multiple omics data types into a comprehensive network prediction. Here, we describe a state-of-the-art approach for integrating multi-omics data with gene regulatory network inference to describe signaling pathways and uncover novel regulators. We detail how to download and process transcriptomics and (phospho)proteomics data for network inference, using an example dataset from the plant hormone signaling field. We provide a step-by-step protocol for inference, visualization, and analysis of an integrative multi-omics network using currently available methods.

Identifying BMI-associated genes via a genome-wide multi-omics integrative approach using summary data,"Objective:This study aims to identify BMI-associated genes by integrating aggregated summary information from different omics data.Methods:We conducted a meta-analysis to leverage information from a genome-wide association study (n = 339 224), a transcriptome-wide association study (n = 5619), and an epigenome-wide association study (n = 3743). We prioritized the significant genes with a machine learning-based method, netWAS, which borrows information from adipose tissue-specific interaction networks. We also used the brain-specific network in netWAS to investigate genes potentially involved in brain-adipose interaction.Results:We identified 195 genes that were significantly associated with BMI through meta-analysis. The netWAS analysis narrowed down the list to 21 genes in adipose tissue. Among these 21 genes, six genes, including FUS, STX4, CCNT2, FUBP1, NDUFS3, and RAPSN, were not reported to be BMI-associated in PubMed or GWAS Catalog. We also identified 11 genes that were significantly associated with BMI in both adipose and whole brain tissues.Conclusion:This study integrated three types of omics data and identified a group of genes that have not previously been reported to be associated with BMI. This strategy could provide new insights for future studies to identify molecular mechanisms contributing to BMI regulation.",38215789,,10.1093/hmg/ddad212,0,Human molecular genetics,9208958,5.121,0.40721553564071655,0.18394648829431437,0.4280936454849498,0.3667373481402828
HONMF: integration analysis of multi-omics microbiome data via matrix factorization and hypergraph,"Motivation:The accumulation of multi-omics microbiome data provides an unprecedented opportunity to understand the diversity of bacterial, fungal, and viral components from different conditions. The changes in the composition of viruses, bacteria, and fungi communities have been associated with environments and critical illness. However, identifying and dissecting the heterogeneity of microbial samples and cross-kingdom interactions remains challenging.Results:We propose HONMF for the integrative analysis of multi-modal microbiome data, including bacterial, fungal, and viral composition profiles. HONMF enables identification of microbial samples and data visualization, and also facilitates downstream analysis, including feature selection and cross-kingdom association analysis between species. HONMF is an unsupervised method based on hypergraph induced orthogonal non-negative matrix factorization, where it assumes that latent variables are specific for each composition profile and integrates the distinct sets of latent variables through graph fusion strategy, which better tackles the distinct characteristics in bacterial, fungal, and viral microbiome. We implemented HONMF on several multi-omics microbiome datasets from different environments and tissues. The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of HONMF in data visualization and clustering. HONMF also provides rich biological insights by implementing discriminative microbial feature selection and bacterium-fungus-virus association analysis, which improves our understanding of ecological interactions and microbial pathogenesis.Availability and implementation:The software and datasets are available at https://github.com/chonghua-1983/HONMF.",37216923,PMC10243929,10.1093/bioinformatics/btad335,0,"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",9808944,6.931,0.406744122505188,0.18729096989966554,0.6555183946488294,0.41260834641281174
Tightly integrated multiomics-based deep tensor survival model for time-to-event prediction,"Motivation:Multiomics cancer profiles provide essential signals for predicting cancer survival. It is challenging to reveal the complex patterns from multiple types of data and link them to survival outcomes. We aim to develop a new deep learning-based algorithm to integrate three types of high-dimensional omics data measured on the same individuals to improve cancer survival outcome prediction.Results:We built a three-dimension tensor to integrate multi-omics cancer data and factorized it into two-dimension matrices of latent factors, which were fed into neural networks-based survival networks. The new algorithm and other multi-omics-based algorithms, as well as individual genomic-based survival analysis algorithms, were applied to the breast cancer data colon and rectal cancer data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) program. We evaluated the goodness-of-fit using the concordance index (C-index) and Integrated Brier Score (IBS).

DrugTargetInspector: An assistance tool for patient treatment stratification,"Cancer is a large class of diseases that are characterized by a common set of features, known as the Hallmarks of cancer. One of these hallmarks is the acquisition of genome instability and mutations. This, combined with high proliferation rates and failure of repair mechanisms, leads to clonal evolution as well as a high genotypic and phenotypic diversity within the tumor. As a consequence, treatment and therapy of malignant tumors is still a grand challenge. Moreover, under selective pressure, e.g., caused by chemotherapy, resistant subpopulations can emerge that then may lead to relapse. In order to minimize the risk of developing multidrug-resistant tumor cell populations, optimal (combination) therapies have to be determined on the basis of an in-depth characterization of the tumor's genetic and phenotypic makeup, a process that is an important aspect of stratified medicine and precision medicine. We present DrugTargetInspector (DTI), an interactive assistance tool for treatment stratification. DTI analyzes genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic datasets and provides information on deregulated drug targets, enriched biological pathways, and deregulated subnetworks, as well as mutations and their potential effects on putative drug targets and genes of interest. To demonstrate DTI's broad scope of applicability, we present case studies on several cancer types and different types of input -omics data. DTI's integrative approach allows users to characterize the tumor under investigation based on various -omics datasets and to elucidate putative treatment options based on clinical decision guidelines, but also proposing additional points of intervention that might be neglected otherwise.

Using knowledge-driven genomic interactions for multi-omics data analysis: metadimensional models for predicting clinical outcomes in ovarian carcinoma,"It is common that cancer patients have different molecular signatures even though they have similar clinical features, such as histology, due to the heterogeneity of tumors. To overcome this variability, we previously developed a new approach incorporating prior biological knowledge that identifies knowledge-driven genomic interactions associated with outcomes of interest. However, no systematic approach has been proposed to identify interaction models between pathways based on multi-omics data. Here we have proposed such a novel methodological framework, called metadimensional knowledge-driven genomic interactions (MKGIs). To test the utility of the proposed framework, we applied it to an ovarian cancer dataset including multi-omics profiles from The Cancer Genome Atlas to predict grade, stage, and survival outcome. We found that each knowledge-driven genomic interaction model, based on different genomic datasets, contains different sets of pathway features, which suggests that each genomic data type may contribute to outcomes in ovarian cancer via a different pathway. In addition, MKGI models significantly outperformed the single knowledge-driven genomic interaction model. From the MKGI models, many interactions between pathways associated with outcomes were found, including the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway and the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) signaling pathway, which are known to play important roles in cancer pathogenesis. The beauty of incorporating biological knowledge into the model based on multi-omics data is the ability to improve diagnosis and prognosis and provide better interpretability. Thus, determining variability in molecular signatures based on these interactions between pathways may lead to better diagnostic/treatment strategies for better precision medicine.",28040685,PMC5391734,10.1093/jamia/ocw165,16,Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,9430800,7.942,0.40456622838974,0.8093645484949833,0.7424749163879598,0.5531076300104326
ReactomeGSA - Efficient Multi-Omics Comparative Pathway Analysis,"Pathway analyses are key methods to analyze 'omics experiments. Nevertheless, integrating data from different 'omics technologies and different species still requires considerable bioinformatics knowledge.Here we present the novel ReactomeGSA resource for comparative pathway analyses of multi-omics datasets. ReactomeGSA can be used through Reactome's existing web interface and the novel ReactomeGSA R Bioconductor package with explicit support for scRNA-seq data. Data from different species is automatically mapped to a common pathway space. Public data from ExpressionAtlas and Single Cell ExpressionAtlas can be directly integrated in the analysis. ReactomeGSA greatly reduces the technical barrier for multi-omics, cross-species, comparative pathway analyses.We used ReactomeGSA to characterize the role of B cells in anti-tumor immunity. We compared B cell rich and poor human cancer samples from five of the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) transcriptomics and two of the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) proteomics studies. B cell-rich lung adenocarcinoma samples lacked the otherwise present activation through NFkappaB. This may be linked to the presence of a specific subset of tumor associated IgG+ plasma cells that lack NFkappaB activation in scRNA-seq data from human melanoma.

"Multiomics, artificial intelligence, and precision medicine in perinatology","Technological advances in omics evaluation, bioinformatics, and artificial intelligence have made us rethink ways to improve patient outcomes. Collective quantification and characterization of biological data including genomics, epigenomics, metabolomics, and proteomics is now feasible at low cost with rapid turnover. Significant advances in the integration methods of these multiomics data sets by machine learning promise us a holistic view of disease pathogenesis and yield biomarkers for disease diagnosis and prognosis. Using machine learning tools and algorithms, it is possible to integrate multiomics data with clinical information to develop predictive models that identify risk before the condition is clinically apparent, thus facilitating early interventions to improve the health trajectories of the patients. In this review, we intend to update the readers on the recent developments related to the use of artificial intelligence in integrating multiomic and clinical data sets in the field of perinatology, focusing on neonatal intensive care and the opportunities for precision medicine. We intend to briefly discuss the potential negative societal and ethical consequences of using artificial intelligence in healthcare. We are poised for a new era in medicine where computational analysis of biological and clinical data sets will make precision medicine a reality. IMPACT: Biotechnological advances have made multiomic evaluations feasible and integration of multiomics data may provide a holistic view of disease pathophysiology.

Metabolome and microbiome multi-omics integration from a murine lung inflammation model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia,"Background:Respiratory tract microbial dysbiosis can exacerbate inflammation and conversely inflammation may cause dysbiosis. Dysbiotic microbiome metabolites may lead to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Hyperoxia and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) interaction alters lung microbiome and metabolome, mediating BPD lung injury sequence.Methods:C57BL6/J mice were exposed to 21% (normoxia) or 70% (hyperoxia) oxygen during postnatal days (PND) 1-14. Pups were injected with LPS (6 mg/kg) or equal PBS volume, intraperitoneally on PND 3, 5, and 7. At PND14, the lungs were collected for microbiome and metabolomic analyses (n = 5/group).Results:Microbiome alpha and beta diversity were similar between groups. Metabolic changes included hyperoxia 31 up/18 down, LPS 7 up/4 down, exposure interaction 8. Hyperoxia increased Intestinimonas abundance, whereas LPS decreased Clostridiales, Dorea, and Intestinimonas; exposure interaction affected Blautia. Differential co-expression analysis on multi-omics data identified exposure-altered modules. Hyperoxia metabolomics response was integrated with a published matching transcriptome, identifying four induced genes (ALDOA, GAA, NEU1, RENBP), which positively correlated with BPD severity in a published human newborn cohort.Conclusions:We report hyperoxia and LPS lung microbiome and metabolome signatures in a clinically relevant BPD model. We identified four genes correlating with BPD status in preterm infants that are promising targets for therapy and prevention.Impact:Using multi-omics, we identified and correlated key biomarkers of hyperoxia and LPS on murine lung micro-landscape and examined their potential clinical implication, which shows strong clinical relevance for future research.

Multi-omics annotation of human long non-coding RNAs,"LncRNAs (long non-coding RNAs) are pervasively transcribed in the human genome and also extensively involved in a variety of essential biological processes and human diseases. The comprehensive annotation of human lncRNAs is of great significance in navigating the functional landscape of the human genome and deepening the understanding of the multi-featured RNA world. However, the unique characteristics of lncRNAs as well as their enormous quantity have complicated and challenged the annotation of lncRNAs. Advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies give rise to a large volume of omics data that are generated at an unprecedented rate and scale, providing possibilities in the identification, characterization and functional annotation of lncRNAs. Here, we review the recent important discoveries of human lncRNAs through analysis of various omics data and summarize specialized lncRNA database resources. Moreover, we highlight the multi-omics integrative analysis as a powerful strategy to efficiently discover and characterize the functional lncRNAs and elucidate their potential molecular mechanisms.",32756901,,10.1042/BST20191063,4,Biochemical Society transactions,7506897,4.919,0.402450829744339,0.5250836120401338,0.36789297658862874,0.4200658155723559
Similarity Fusion via Exploiting High Order Proximity for Cancer Subtyping,"Identifying cancer subtypes holds essential promise for improving prognosis and personalized treatment. Cancer subtyping based on multi-omics data has become a hotspot in bioinformatics research. One of the critical approaches of handling data heterogeneity in multi-omics data is first modeling each omics data as a separate similarity graph. Then, the information of multiple graphs is integrated into a unified graph. However, a significant challenge is how to measure the similarity of nodes in each graph and preserve cluster information of each graph. To that end, we exploit a new high order proximity in each graph and propose a similarity fusion method to fuse the high order proximity of multiple graphs while preserving cluster information of multiple graphs. Compared with the current techniques employing the first order proximity, exploiting high order proximity contributes to attaining accurate similarity. The proposed similarity fusion method makes full use of the complementary information from multi-omics data. Experiments in six benchmark multi-omics datasets and two individual cancer case studies confirm that our proposed method achieves statistically significant and biologically meaningful cancer subtypes.",34971537,,10.1109/TCBB.2021.3139597,1,IEEE/ACM transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics,101196755,3.702,0.40133580565452576,0.29431438127090304,0.19063545150501673,0.33779144994789945
Predicting Deep Learning Based Multi-Omics Parallel Integration Survival Subtypes in Lung Cancer Using Reverse Phase Protein Array Data,"Mortality attributed to lung cancer accounts for a large fraction of cancer deaths worldwide. With increasing mortality figures, the accurate prediction of prognosis has become essential. In recent years, multi-omics analysis has emerged as a useful survival prediction tool. However, the methodology relevant to multi-omics analysis has not yet been fully established and further improvements are required for clinical applications. In this study, we developed a novel method to accurately predict the survival of patients with lung cancer using multi-omics data. With unsupervised learning techniques, survival-associated subtypes in non-small cell lung cancer were first detected using the multi-omics datasets from six categories in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The new subtypes, referred to as integration survival subtypes, clearly divided patients into longer and shorter-surviving groups (log-rank test:p= 0.003) and we confirmed that this is independent of histopathological classification (Chi-square test of independence:p= 0.94). Next, an attempt was made to detect the integration survival subtypes using only one categorical dataset. Our machine learning model that was only trained on the reverse phase protein array (RPPA) could accurately predict the integration survival subtypes (AUC = 0.99). The predicted subtypes could also distinguish between high and low risk patients (log-rank test:p= 0.012). Overall, this study explores novel potentials of multi-omics analysis to accurately predict the prognosis of patients with lung cancer.",33086649,PMC7603376,10.3390/biom10101460,28,Biomolecules,101596414,6.064,0.4012185335159302,0.882943143812709,0.5117056856187291,0.5196608859958457
BioVLAB-Cancer-Pharmacogenomics: tumor heterogeneity and pharmacogenomics analysis of multi-omics data from tumor on the cloud,"Motivation:Multi-omics data in molecular biology has accumulated rapidly over the years. Such data contains valuable information for research in medicine and drug discovery. Unfortunately, data-driven research in medicine and drug discovery is challenging for a majority of small research labs due to the large volume of data and the complexity of analysis pipeline.Results:We present BioVLAB-Cancer-Pharmacogenomics, a bioinformatics system that facilitates analysis of multi-omics data from breast cancer to analyze and investigate intratumor heterogeneity and pharmacogenomics on Amazon Web Services. Our system takes multi-omics data as input to perform tumor heterogeneity analysis in terms of TCGA data and deconvolve-and-match the tumor gene expression to cell line data in CCLE using DNA methylation profiles. We believe that our system can help small research labs perform analysis of tumor multi-omics without worrying about computational infrastructure and maintenance of databases and tools.Availability and implementation:http://biohealth.snu.ac.kr/software/biovlab_cancer_pharmacogenomics.Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",34185062,,10.1093/bioinformatics/btab478,1,"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",9808944,6.931,0.39975306391716003,0.2976588628762542,0.6622073578595318,0.4318250824974532
Multi-omics characterization of synthetic lethality-related molecular features: implications for SL-based therapeutic target screening,"Synthetic lethality (SL) represents the co-occurrence of two or more non-lethal disordered genes that could lead to cell death. SL-based anticancer therapeutics could specifically kill the cancer cells carrying the targeted mutated gene while leaving normal cells alive. Recent large-scale computational and experimental screenings provide rich resources of SL information while lacking systematic research on molecular features of SL genes. Combined with comprehensive multi-omics data analysis and experimental validation of one SL gene pair, Guo et al. portrayed a systematic layout of cancer-specific SL interactions that could improve understanding of carcinogenesis and potentially assist the subsequent screening of anticancer therapeutic targets.",36461713,,10.1111/febs.16692,1,The FEBS journal,101229646,5.622,0.3995773196220398,0.3010033444816054,0.46153846153846156,0.3922547529772372
Multi-Omics Analysis of Circulating Exosomes in Adherent Long-Term Treated OSA Patients,"Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a highly prevalent chronic disease affecting nearly a billion people globally and increasing the risk of multi-organ morbidity and overall mortality. However, the mechanisms underlying such adverse outcomes remain incompletely delineated. Extracellular vesicles (exosomes) are secreted by most cells, are involved in both proximal and long-distance intercellular communication, and contribute toward homeostasis under physiological conditions. A multi-omics integrative assessment of plasma-derived exosomes from adult OSA patients prior to and after 1-year adherent CPAP treatment is lacking. We conducted multi-omic integrative assessments of plasma-derived exosomes from adult OSA patients prior to and following 1-year adherent CPAP treatment to identify potential specific disease candidates. Fasting morning plasma exosomes isolated from 12 adult patients with polysomnographically-diagnosed OSA were analyzed before and after 12 months of adherent CPAP therapy (mean â¥ 6 h/night) (OSAT). Exosomes were characterized by flow cytometry, transmission electron microscopy, and nanoparticle tracking analysis. Endothelial cell barrier integrity, wound healing, and tube formation were also performed. Multi-omics analysis for exosome cargos was integrated. Exosomes derived from OSAT improved endothelial permeability and dysfunction as well as significant improvement in tube formation compared with OSA. Multi-omic approaches for OSA circulating exosomes included lipidomic, proteomic, and small RNA (miRNAs) assessments. We found 30 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs), 72 lipids (DELs), and 13 miRNAs (DEMs). We found that the cholesterol metabolism (has04979) pathway is associated with lipid classes in OSA patients. Among the 12 subjects of OSA and OSAT, seven subjects had complete comprehensive exosome cargo information including lipids, proteins, and miRNAs. Multi-omic approaches identify potential signature biomarkers in plasma exosomes that are responsive to adherent OSA treatment. These differentially expressed molecules may also play a mechanistic role in OSA-induced morbidities and their reversibility. Our data suggest that a multi-omic integrative approach might be useful in understanding how exosomes function, their origin, and their potential clinical relevance, all of which merit future exploration in the context of relevant phenotypic variance. Developing an integrated molecular classification should lead to improved diagnostic classification, risk stratification, and patient management of OSA by assigning molecular disease-specific therapies.",38003263,PMC10671639,10.3390/ijms242216074,0,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,6.208,0.3988746404647827,0.19063545150501673,0.5418060200668896,0.3858130785932509
Systems Biology Approaches to Understanding the Human Immune System,"Systems biology is an approach to interrogate complex biological systems through large-scale quantification of numerous biomolecules. The immune system involves >1,500 genes/proteins in many interconnected pathways and processes, and a systems-level approach is critical in broadening our understanding of the immune response to vaccination. Changes in molecular pathways can be detected using high-throughput omics datasets (e.g., transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics) by using methods such as pathway enrichment, network analysis, machine learning, etc. Importantly, integration of multipleomicdatasets is becoming key to revealing novel biological insights. In this perspective article, we highlight the use of protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks as a multi-omics integration approach to unravel information flow and mechanisms during complex biological events, with a focus on the immune system. This involves a combination of tools, including:InnateDB, a database of curated interactions between genes and protein products involved in the innate immunity;NetworkAnalyst, a visualization and analysis platform for InnateDB interactions; andMetaBridge, a tool to integrate metabolite data into PPI networks. The application of these systems techniques is demonstrated for a variety of biological questions, including: the developmental trajectory of neonates during the first week of life, mechanisms in host-pathogen interaction, disease prognosis, biomarker discovery, and drug discovery and repurposing. Overall, systems biology analyses of omics data have been applied to a variety of immunology-related questions, and here we demonstrate the numerous ways in which PPI network analysis can be a powerful tool in contributing to our understanding of the immune system and the study of vaccines.",32849587,PMC7406790,10.3389/fimmu.2020.01683,12,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,8.786,0.398640513420105,0.7625418060200669,0.7926421404682275,0.5502210973497219
"Targeted proteomic analysis of cognitive dysfunction in remitted major depressive disorder: Opportunities of multi-omics approaches towards predictive, preventive, and personalized psychiatry","In order to accelerate the understanding of pathophysiological mechanisms and clinical biomarker discovery and in psychiatry, approaches that integrate multiple -omics platforms are needed. We introduce a workflow that investigates a narrowly defined psychiatric phenotype, makes use of the potent and cost-effective discovery technology of gene expression microarrays, applies Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) to better capture complex and polygenic traits, and finally explores gene expression findings on the proteomic level using targeted mass-spectrometry (MS) technologies. To illustrate the effectiveness of the workflow, we present a proteomic analysis of peripheral blood plasma from patient's remitted major depressive disorder (MDD) who experience ongoing cognitive deficits. We show that co-expression patterns previous detected on the transcript level could be replicated for plasma proteins, as could the module eigengene correlation with cognitive performance. Further, we demonstrate that functional analysis of multi-omics data has the potential to point to cellular mechanisms and candidate biomarkers for cognitive dysfunction in MDD, implicating cell cycle regulation by cyclin D3 (CCND3), regulation of protein processing in the endoplasmatic reticulum by Thioredoxin domain-containing protein 5 (TXND5), and modulation of inflammatory cytokines by Tripartite Motif Containing 26 (TRI26).Significance:This paper discusses how data from multiple -omics platforms can be integrated to accelerate biomarker discovery in psychiatry. Using the phenotype of cognitive impairment in remitted major depressive disorder (MDD) as an example, we show that the application of a systems biology approach - weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) - in the discovery phase, and targeted proteomic follow-up of results, provides a structured avenue towards uncovering novel candidate markers and pathways for personalized clinical psychiatry.",29474866,,10.1016/j.jprot.2018.02.023,9,Journal of proteomics,101475056,3.855,0.39501747488975525,0.7157190635451505,0.21739130434782608,0.42363255851244846
Multi-OMICS: a critical technical perspective on integrative lipidomics approaches,"During the past decades, high-throughput approaches for analyzing different molecular classes such as nucleic acids, proteins, metabolites, and lipids have grown rapidly. These approaches became powerful tools for getting a fundamental understanding of biological systems. Considering each approach and its results separately, relations and causal connections between these classes have no chance to be revealed, since only separate molecular snapshots are provided. Only a combined approach, not fully established yet, with the integration of the corresponding data, might yield a comprehensive and complete understanding of biological processes, such as crosstalk and interactions in signaling pathways. Taking two or more omics-methods into consideration for analysis is referred to as a multi-omics approach, which is gradually evolving. In this critical note, we briefly discuss the relevance, challenges, current state, and potential of data integration from multi-omics approaches, with a special focus on lipidomics analysis, listing the advantages and gaps in this field.

eQTLs are key players in the integration of genomic and transcriptomic data for phenotype prediction,"Background:Multi-omics represent a promising link between phenotypes and genome variation. Few studies yet address their integration to understand genetic architecture and improve predictability.Results:Our study used 241 poplar genotypes, phenotyped in two common gardens, with xylem and cambium RNA sequenced at one site, yielding large phenotypic, genomic (SNP), and transcriptomic datasets. Prediction models for each trait were built separately for SNPs and transcripts, and compared to a third model integrated by concatenation of both omics. The advantage of integration varied across traits and, to understand such differences, an eQTL analysis was performed to characterize the interplay between the genome and transcriptome and classify the predicting features into cis or trans relationships. A strong, significant negative correlation was found between the change in predictability and the change in predictor ranking for trans eQTLs for traits evaluated in the site of transcriptomic sampling.Conclusions:Consequently, beneficial integration happens when the redundancy of predictors is decreased, likely leaving the stage to other less prominent but complementary predictors. An additional gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis appeared to corroborate such statistical output. To our knowledge, this is a novel finding delineating a promising method to explore data integration.",35764918,PMC9238188,10.1186/s12864-022-08690-7,2,BMC genomics,100965258,4.547,0.39338502287864685,0.3779264214046823,0.3010033444816054,0.37181696690444566
"The Personal Genome Project-UK, an open access resource of human multi-omics data","Integrative analysis of multi-omics data is a powerful approach for gaining functional insights into biological and medical processes. Conducting these multifaceted analyses on human samples is often complicated by the fact that the raw sequencing output is rarely available under open access. The Personal Genome Project UK (PGP-UK) is one of few resources that recruits its participants under open consent and makes the resulting multi-omics data freely and openly available. As part of this resource, we describe the PGP-UK multi-omics reference panel consisting of ten genomic, methylomic and transcriptomic data. Specifically, we outline the data processing, quality control and validation procedures which were implemented to ensure data integrity and exclude sample mix-ups. In addition, we provide a REST API to facilitate the download of the entire PGP-UK dataset. The data are also available from two cloud-based environments, providing platforms for free integrated analysis. In conclusion, the genotype-validated PGP-UK multi-omics human reference panel described here provides a valuable new open access resource for integrated analyses in support of personal and medical genomics.",31672996,PMC6823446,10.1038/s41597-019-0205-4,12,Scientific data,101640192,8.501,0.3916967511177063,0.7692307692307693,0.7658862876254181,0.5420414620418612
"BioVLAB-mCpG-SNP-EXPRESS: A system for multi-level and multi-perspective analysis and exploration of DNA methylation, sequence variation (SNPs), and gene expression from multi-omics data","Measuring gene expression, DNA sequence variation, and DNA methylation status is routinely done using high throughput sequencing technologies. To analyze such multi-omics data and explore relationships, reliable bioinformatics systems are much needed. Existing systems are either for exploring curated data or for processing omics data in the form of a library such as R. Thus scientists have much difficulty in investigating relationships among gene expression, DNA sequence variation, and DNA methylation using multi-omics data. In this study, we report a system called BioVLAB-mCpG-SNP-EXPRESS for the integrated analysis of DNA methylation, sequence variation (SNPs), and gene expression for distinguishing cellular phenotypes at the pairwise and multiple phenotype levels. The system can be deployed on either the Amazon cloud or a publicly available high-performance computing node, and the data analysis and exploration of the analysis result can be conveniently done using a web-based interface. In order to alleviate analysis complexity, all the process are fully automated, and graphical workflow system is integrated to represent real-time analysis progression. The BioVLAB-mCpG-SNP-EXPRESS system works in three stages. First, it processes and analyzes multi-omics data as input in the form of the raw data, i.e., FastQ files. Second, various integrated analyses such as methylation vs. gene expression and mutation vs. methylation are performed. Finally, the analysis result can be explored in a number of ways through a web interface for the multi-level, multi-perspective exploration. Multi-level interpretation can be done by either gene, gene set, pathway or network level and multi-perspective exploration can be explored from either gene expression, DNA methylation, sequence variation, or their relationship perspective. The utility of the system is demonstrated by performing analysis of phenotypically distinct 30breast cancer cell line data set.

DeepProg: an ensemble of deep-learning and machine-learning models for prognosis prediction using multi-omics data,"Multi-omics data are good resources for prognosis and survival prediction; however, these are difficult to integrate computationally. We introduce DeepProg, a novel ensemble framework of deep-learning and machine-learning approaches that robustly predicts patient survival subtypes using multi-omics data. It identifies two optimal survival subtypes in most cancers and yields significantly better risk-stratification than other multi-omics integration methods. DeepProg is highly predictive, exemplified by two liver cancer (C-index 0.73-0.80) and five breast cancer datasets (C-index 0.68-0.73). Pan-cancer analysis associates common genomic signatures in poor survival subtypes with extracellular matrix modeling, immune deregulation, and mitosis processes.

Mergeomics 2.0: a web server for multi-omics data integration to elucidate disease networks and predict therapeutics,"The Mergeomics web server is a flexible online tool for multi-omics data integration to derive biological pathways, networks, and key drivers important to disease pathogenesis and is based on the open source Mergeomics R package. The web server takes summary statistics of multi-omics disease association studies (GWAS, EWAS, TWAS, PWAS, etc.) as input and features four functions: Marker Dependency Filtering (MDF) to correct for known dependency between omics markers, Marker Set Enrichment Analysis (MSEA) to detect disease relevant biological processes, Meta-MSEA to examine the consistency of biological processes informed by various omics datasets, and Key Driver Analysis (KDA) to identify essential regulators of disease-associated pathways and networks. The web server has been extensively updated and streamlined in version 2.0 including an overhauled user interface, improved tutorials and results interpretation for each analytical step, inclusion of numerous disease GWAS, functional genomics datasets, and molecular networks to allow for comprehensive omics integrations, increased functionality to decrease user workload, and increased flexibility to cater to user-specific needs.

Clustering analysis revealed the autophagy classification and potential autophagy regulators' sensitivity of pancreatic cancer based on multi-omics data,"Background:Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a lethal malignancy and is unresponsive to conventional therapeutic modalities due to its high heterogeneity, expounding the necessity, and priority of searching for effective biomarkers and drugs. Autophagy, as an evolutionarily conserved biological process, is upregulated in PDAC and its regulation is linked to a poor prognosis. Increased autophagy sequestered MHC-I on PDAC cells and weaken the antigen presentation and antitumor immune response, indicating the potential therapeutic strategies of autophagy inhibitors.Methods:By performing 10 state-of-the-art multi-omics clustering algorithms, we constructed a robust PDAC classification model to reveal the autophagy-related genes among different subgroups.Outcomes:After building a more comprehensive regulating network for potential autophagy regulators exploration, we concluded the top 20 autophagy-related hub genes (GAPDH, MAPK3, RHEB, SQSTM1, EIF2S1, RAB5A, CTSD, MAP1LC3B, RAB7A, RAB11A, FADD, CFKN2A, HSP90AB1, VEGFA, RELA, DDIT3, HSPA5, BCL2L1, BAG3, and ERBB2), six miRNAs, five transcription factors, and five immune infiltrated cells as biomarkers. The drug sensitivity database was screened based on the biomarkers to predict possible drug-targeting signal pathways, hoping to yield novel insights, and promote the progress of the anticancer therapeutic strategy.Conclusion:We succefully constructed an autophagy-related mRNA/miRNA/TF/Immune cells network based on a 10 state-of art algorithm multi-omics analysis, and screened the drug sensitivity dataset for detecting potential signal pathway which might be possible autophagy modulators' targets.",35684936,PMC9844610,10.1002/cam4.4932,3,Cancer medicine,101595310,4.711,0.3900691866874695,0.43812709030100333,0.3377926421404682,0.389225458500776
Bayesian structural equation modeling in multiple omics data with application to circadian genes,"Motivation:It is well known that the integration among different data-sources is reliable because of its potential of unveiling new functionalities of the genomic expressions, which might be dormant in a single-source analysis. Moreover, different studies have justified the more powerful analyses of multi-platform data. Toward this, in this study, we consider the circadian genes' omics profile, such as copy number changes and RNA-sequence data along with their survival response. We develop a Bayesian structural equation modeling coupled with linear regressions and log normal accelerated failure-time regression to integrate the information between these two platforms to predict the survival of the subjects. We place conjugate priors on the regression parameters and derive the Gibbs sampler using the conditional distributions of them.Results:Our extensive simulation study shows that the integrative model provides a better fit to the data than its closest competitor. The analyses of glioblastoma cancer data and the breast cancer data from TCGA, the largest genomics and transcriptomics database, support our findings.Availability and implementation:The developed method is wrapped in R package available at https://github.com/MAITYA02/semmcmc.Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",32369552,PMC7332567,10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa286,4,"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",9808944,6.931,0.3898368775844574,0.5284280936454849,0.6655518394648829,0.47269811317274807
ORIO (Online Resource for Integrative Omics): a web-based platform for rapid integration of next generation sequencing data,"Established and emerging next generation sequencing (NGS)-based technologies allow for genome-wide interrogation of diverse biological processes. However, accessibility of NGS data remains a problem, and few user-friendly resources exist for integrative analysis of NGS data from different sources and experimental techniques. Here, we present Online Resource for Integrative Omics (ORIO; https://orio.niehs.nih.gov/), a web-based resource with an intuitive user interface for rapid analysis and integration of NGS data. To use ORIO, the user specifies NGS data of interest along with a list of genomic coordinates. Genomic coordinates may be biologically relevant features from a variety of sources, such as ChIP-seq peaks for a given protein or transcription start sites from known gene models. ORIO first iteratively finds read coverage values at each genomic feature for each NGS dataset. Data are then integrated using clustering-based approaches, giving hierarchical relationships across NGS datasets and separating individual genomic features into groups. In focusing its analysis on read coverage, ORIO makes limited assumptions about the analyzed data; this allows the tool to be applied across data from a variety of experiments and techniques. Results from analysis are presented in dynamic displays alongside user-controlled statistical tests, supporting rapid statistical validation of observed results. We emphasize the versatility of ORIO through diverse examples, ranging from NGS data quality control to characterization of enhancer regions and integration of gene expression information.

Single-cell multi-omics topic embedding reveals cell-type-specific and COVID-19 severity-related immune signatures,"The advent of single-cell multi-omics sequencing technology makes it possible for researchers to leverage multiple modalities for individual cells and explore cell heterogeneity. However, the high-dimensional, discrete, and sparse nature of the data make the downstream analysis particularly challenging. Here, we propose an interpretable deep learning method called moETM to perform integrative analysis of high-dimensional single-cell multimodal data. moETM integrates multiple omics data via a product-of-experts in the encoder and employs multiple linear decoders to learn the multi-omics signatures. moETM demonstrates superior performance compared with six state-of-the-art methods on seven publicly available datasets. By applying moETM to the scRNA + scATAC data, we identified sequence motifs corresponding to the transcription factors regulating immune gene signatures.
