Stress relief: emerging methods to mitigate dissociation-induced artefacts,"The rapid progress of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) at large scales has led to what seemed impossible until recently: the generation of comprehensive transcriptional maps of nearly all cells in multicellular tissues. We pinpoint three key elements as being critical to the production of these maps: scalability, spatial information, and accuracy of the transcriptome of the individual cells. Here, we discuss the ramifications of traditional cell-isolation protocols when capturing the transcriptional signature of cells as they exist in their native tissue context, the methods that have been developed to avoid these distortions, and the biological processes that have unraveled on account of these upgraded methodological approaches.",34074577,,10.1016/j.tcb.2021.05.004,14
Transcriptional profiling of microglia; current state of the art and future perspectives,"Microglia are the tissue macrophages of the central nervous system (CNS) and the first to respond to CNS dysfunction and disease. Gene expression profiling of microglia during development, under homeostatic conditions, and in the diseased CNS provided insight in microglia functions and changes thereof. Single-cell sequencing studies further contributed to our understanding of microglia heterogeneity in relation to age, sex, and CNS disease. Recently, single nucleus gene expression profiling was performed on (frozen) CNS tissue. Transcriptomic profiling of CNS tissues by (single) nucleus RNA-sequencing has the advantage that it can be applied to archived and well-stratified frozen specimens. Here, we give an overview of the significant advances recently made in microglia transcriptional profiling. In addition, we present matched cellular and nuclear microglia RNA-seq datasets we generated from mouse and human CNS tissue to compare cellular versus nuclear transcriptomes from fresh and frozen samples. We demonstrate that microglia can be similarly profiled with cell and nucleus profiling, and importantly also with nuclei isolated from frozen tissue. Nuclear microglia transcriptomes are a reliable proxy for cellular transcriptomes. Importantly, lipopolysaccharide-induced changes in gene expression were conserved in the nuclear transcriptome. In addition, heterogeneity in microglia observed in fresh samples was similarly detected in frozen nuclei of the same donor. Together, these results show that microglia nuclear RNAs obtained from frozen CNS tissue are a reliable proxy for microglia gene expression and cellular heterogeneity and may prove an effective strategy to study of the role of microglia in neuropathology.",31846124,PMC7064956,10.1002/glia.23767,55
Advances in spatial transcriptomics and related data analysis strategies,"Spatial transcriptomics technologies developed in recent years can provide various information including tissue heterogeneity, which is fundamental in biological and medical research, and have been making significant breakthroughs. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) cannot provide spatial information, while spatial transcriptomics technologies allow gene expression information to be obtained from intact tissue sections in the original physiological context at a spatial resolution. Various biological insights can be generated into tissue architecture and further the elucidation of the interaction between cells and the microenvironment. Thus, we can gain a general understanding of histogenesis processes and disease pathogenesis, etc. Furthermore, in silico methods involving the widely distributed R and Python packages for data analysis play essential roles in deriving indispensable bioinformation and eliminating technological limitations. In this review, we summarize available technologies of spatial transcriptomics, probe into several applications, discuss the computational strategies and raise future perspectives, highlighting the developmental potential.",37202762,PMC10193345,10.1186/s12967-023-04150-2,9
CLEAR: coverage-based limiting-cell experiment analysis for RNA-seq,"Background:Direct cDNA preamplification protocols developed for single-cell RNA-seq have enabled transcriptome profiling of precious clinical samples and rare cell populations without the need for sample pooling or RNA extraction. We term the use of single-cell chemistries for sequencing low numbers of cells limiting-cell RNA-seq (lcRNA-seq). Currently, there is no customized algorithm to select robust/low-noise transcripts from lcRNA-seq data for between-group comparisons.Methods:Herein, we present CLEAR, a workflow that identifies reliably quantifiable transcripts in lcRNA-seq data for differentially expressed genes (DEG) analysis. Total RNA obtained from primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) CD5+ and CD5- cells were used to develop the CLEAR algorithm. Once established, the performance of CLEAR was evaluated with FACS-sorted cells enriched from mouse Dentate Gyrus (DG).Results:When using CLEAR transcripts vs. using all transcripts in CLL samples, downstream analyses revealed a higher proportion of shared transcripts across three input amounts and improved principal component analysis (PCA) separation of the two cell types. In mouse DG samples, CLEAR identifies noisy transcripts and their removal improves PCA separation of the anticipated cell populations. In addition, CLEAR was applied to two publicly-available datasets to demonstrate its utility in lcRNA-seq data from other institutions. If imputation is applied to limit the effect of missing data points, CLEAR can also be used in large clinical trials and in single cell studies.Conclusions:lcRNA-seq coupled with CLEAR is widely used in our institution for profiling immune cells (circulating or tissue-infiltrating) for its transcript preservation characteristics. CLEAR fills an important niche in pre-processing lcRNA-seq data to facilitate transcriptome profiling and DEG analysis. We demonstrate the utility of CLEAR in analyzing rare cell populations in clinical samples and in murine neural DG region without sample pooling.",32039730,PMC7008572,10.1186/s12967-020-02247-6,8
Challenges and considerations for single-cell and spatially resolved transcriptomics sample collection during spaceflight,"Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) have experienced rapid development in recent years. The findings of spaceflight-based scRNA-seq and SRT investigations are likely to improve our understanding of life in space and our comprehension of gene expression in various cell systems and tissue dynamics. However, compared to their Earth-based counterparts, gene expression experiments conducted in spaceflight have not experienced the same pace of development. Out of the hundreds of spaceflight gene expression datasets available, only a few used scRNA-seq and SRT. In this perspective piece, we explore the growing importance of scRNA-seq and SRT in space biology and discuss the challenges and considerations relevant to robust experimental design to enable growth of these methods in the field.",36452864,PMC9701605,10.1016/j.crmeth.2022.100325,2
Single-cell and spatial transcriptomics: Bridging current technologies with long-read sequencing,"Single-cell technologies have transformed biomedical research over the last decade, opening up new possibilities for understanding cellular heterogeneity, both at the genomic and transcriptomic level. In addition, more recent developments of spatial transcriptomics technologies have made it possible to profile cells in their tissue context. In parallel, there have been substantial advances in sequencing technologies, and the third generation of methods are able to produce reads that are tens of kilobases long, with error rates matching the second generation short reads. Long reads technologies make it possible to better map large genome rearrangements and quantify isoform specific abundances. This further improves our ability to characterize functionally relevant heterogeneity. Here, we show how researchers have begun to combine single-cell, spatial transcriptomics, and long-read technologies, and how this is resulting in powerful new approaches to profiling both the genome and the transcriptome. We discuss the achievements so far, and we highlight remaining challenges and opportunities.",38368637,,10.1016/j.mam.2024.101255,1
Single cell analysis of the developing mouse kidney provides deeper insight into marker gene expression and ligand-receptor crosstalk,"Recent advances in the generation of kidney organoids and the culture of primary nephron progenitors from mouse and human have been based on knowledge of the molecular basis of kidney development in mice. Although gene expression during kidney development has been intensely investigated, single cell profiling provides new opportunities to further subsect component cell types and the signalling networks at play. Here, we describe the generation and analysis of 6732 single cell transcriptomes from the fetal mouse kidney [embryonic day (E)18.5] and 7853 sorted nephron progenitor cells (E14.5). These datasets provide improved resolution of cell types and specific markers, including subdivision of the renal stroma and heterogeneity within the nephron progenitor population. Ligand-receptor interaction and pathway analysis reveals novel crosstalk between cellular compartments and associates new pathways with differentiation of nephron and ureteric epithelium cell types. We identify transcriptional congruence between the distal nephron and ureteric epithelium, showing that most markers previously used to identify ureteric epithelium are not specific. Together, this work improves our understanding of metanephric kidney development and provides a template to guide the regeneration of renal tissue.",31118232,,10.1242/dev.178673,75
psupertime: supervised pseudotime analysis for time-series single-cell RNA-seq data,"Motivation:Improvements in single-cell RNA-seq technologies mean that studies measuring multiple experimental conditions, such as time series, have become more common. At present, few computational methods exist to infer time series-specific transcriptome changes, and such studies have therefore typically used unsupervised pseudotime methods. While these methods identify cell subpopulations and the transitions between them, they are not appropriate for identifying the genes that vary coherently along the time series. In addition, the orderings they estimate are based only on the major sources of variation in the data, which may not correspond to the processes related to the time labels.Results:We introduce psupertime, a supervised pseudotime approach based on a regression model, which explicitly uses time-series labels as input. It identifies genes that vary coherently along a time series, in addition to pseudotime values for individual cells, and a classifier that can be used to estimate labels for new data with unknown or differing labels. We show that psupertime outperforms benchmark classifiers in terms of identifying time-varying genes and provides better individual cell orderings than popular unsupervised pseudotime techniques. psupertime is applicable to any single-cell RNA-seq dataset with sequential labels (e.g. principally time series but also drug dosage and disease progression), derived from either experimental design and provides a fast, interpretable tool for targeted identification of genes varying along with specific biological processes.Availability and implementation:R package available at github.com/wmacnair/psupertime and code for results reproduction at github.com/wmacnair/psupplementary.Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",35758781,PMC9235474,10.1093/bioinformatics/btac227,10
Phylogenetic Comparative Analysis of Single-Cell Transcriptomes Reveals Constrained Accumulation of Gene Expression Heterogeneity during Clonal Expansion,"In the same way that a phylogeny summarizes the evolutionary history of species, a cell lineage tree describes the process of clonal expansion, in which gene expression differences between cells naturally accrue as a result of stochastic partitioning and imperfect expression control. How is functional homeostasis, a key factor in the biological function of any population of cells, maintained in the face of such continuous accumulation of transcriptomic heterogeneity remains largely unresolved. To answer this question, we experimentally determined the single-cell transcriptomes and lineage relationships of up to 50% cells in single-HEK293-seeded colonies. Phylogenetic comparative analyses of the single-cell transcriptomes on the cell lineage tree revealed three lines of evidence for the constrained accumulation of transcriptome heterogeneity among cells, including rapid saturation of transcriptomic heterogeneity upon four cell divisions, reduced expression differences within subtrees closer to expression boundaries, and cofluctuations among genes. Our analyses showcased the applicability of phylogenetic comparative methods in cell lineage trees, demonstrated the constrained accumulation of transcriptomic heterogeneity, and provided novel insight into the functional homeostasis of cell populations.",37183780,PMC10210624,10.1093/molbev/msad113,1
Analysis and Visualization of Single-Cell Sequencing Data with Scanpy and MetaCell: A Tutorial,"The emergence and development of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) techniques enable researchers to perform large-scale analysis of the transcriptomic profiling at cell-specific resolution. Unsupervised clustering of scRNA-seq data is central for most studies, which is essential to identify novel cell types and their gene expression logics. Although an increasing number of algorithms and tools are available for scRNA-seq analysis, a practical guide for users to navigate the landscape remains underrepresented. This chapter presents an overview of the scRNA-seq data analysis pipeline, quality control, batch effect correction, data standardization, cell clustering and visualization, cluster correlation analysis, and marker gene identification. Taking the two broadly used analysis packages, i.e., Scanpy and MetaCell, as examples, we provide a hands-on guideline and comparison regarding the best practices for the above essential analysis steps and data visualization. Additionally, we compare both packages and algorithms using a scRNA-seq dataset of the ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi, which is representative of one of the earliest animal lineages, critical to understanding the origin and evolution of animal novelties. This pipeline can also be helpful for analyses of other taxa, especially prebilaterian animals, where these tools are under development (e.g., placozoan and Porifera).",38668977,,10.1007/978-1-0716-3642-8_17,0
scPower accelerates and optimizes the design of multi-sample single cell transcriptomic studies,"Single cell RNA-seq has revolutionized transcriptomics by providing cell type resolution for differential gene expression and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analyses. However, efficient power analysis methods for single cell data and inter-individual comparisons are lacking. Here, we present scPower; a statistical framework for the design and power analysis of multi-sample single cell transcriptomic experiments. We modelled the relationship between sample size, the number of cells per individual, sequencing depth, and the power of detecting differentially expressed genes within cell types. We systematically evaluated these optimal parameter combinations for several single cell profiling platforms, and generated broad recommendations. In general, shallow sequencing of high numbers of cells leads to higher overall power than deep sequencing of fewer cells. The model, including priors, is implemented as an R package and is accessible as a web tool. scPower is a highly customizable tool that experimentalists can use to quickly compare a multitude of experimental designs and optimize for a limited budget.",34785648,PMC8595682,10.1038/s41467-021-26779-7,27
Subtyping of COVID-19 samples based on cell-cell interaction in single cell transcriptomes,"In single-cell transcriptome analysis, numerous biomarkers related to COVID-19 severity, including cell subtypes, genes, and pathways, have been identified. Nevertheless, most studies have focused on severity groups based on clinical features, neglecting immunological heterogeneity within the same severity level. In this study, we employed sample-level clustering using cell-cell interaction scores to investigate patient heterogeneity and uncover novel subtypes. The clustering results were validated using external datasets, demonstrating superior reproducibility and purity compared to gene expression- or gene set enrichment-based clustering. Furthermore, the cell-cell interaction score-based clusters exhibited a strong correlation with the WHO ordinal severity score based on clinical characteristics. By characterizing the identified subtypes through known COVID-19 severity-associated biomarkers, we discovered a ""Severe-like moderate"" subtype. This subtype displayed clinical features akin to moderate cases; however, molecular features, such as gene expression and cell-cell interactions, resembled those of severe cases. Notably, all patients who progressed from moderate to severe belonged to this subtype, underscoring the significance of cell-cell interactions in COVID-19 patient heterogeneity and severity.",37949890,PMC10638268,10.1038/s41598-023-46350-2,0
From Bite to Byte: Dental Structures Resolved at a Single-Cell Resolution,"The systematic classification of the cells that compose a tissue or an organ is key to understanding how these cells cooperate and interact as a functional unit. Our capacity to detect features that define cell identity has evolved from morphological and chemical analyses, through the use of predefined genetic markers, to unbiased transcriptomic and epigenetic profiling. The innovative technology of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables transcriptional profiling of thousands of individual cells. Since its development, scRNA-seq has been extensively applied to numerous organs and tissues in a wide range of animal models and human samples, thereby providing a plethora of fundamental biological insights into their development, homeostasis, and pathology. In this review, we present the findings of 3 recent studies that employed scRNA-seq to unravel the complexity of cellular composition in mammalian teeth. These findings offer an unprecedented catalogue of cell types in the mouse incisor, which is a convenient model system for studying continuous tooth growth. These studies identified novel cell types in the tooth epithelium and mesenchyme, as well as new markers for known cell types. Computational analyses of the data also uncovered the lineage and dynamics of cell states during ameloblast and odontoblast differentiation during both normal homeostasis and injury repair. The transcriptional differences between the mouse incisor and mouse and human molars uncover species-specific as well as shared features in tooth cell composition. Here, we highlight these findings and discuss important similarities and differences between these studies. We also discuss potential future applications of scRNA-seq in dental research and dentistry. Together, these studies demonstrate how the rapidly evolving technology of scRNA-seq can advance the study of tooth development and function and provide putative targets for regenerative approaches.",33764175,PMC8293759,10.1177/00220345211001848,9
Single-cell transcriptome analysis of Physcomitrella leaf cells during reprogramming using microcapillary manipulation,"Next-generation sequencing technologies have made it possible to carry out transcriptome analysis at the single-cell level. Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data provide insights into cellular dynamics, including intercellular heterogeneity as well as inter- and intra-cellular fluctuations in gene expression that cannot be studied using populations of cells. The utilization of scRNA-seq is, however, restricted to cell types that can be isolated from their original tissues, and it can be difficult to obtain precise positional information for these cells in situ. Here, we established single cell-digital gene expression (1cell-DGE), a method of scRNA-seq that uses micromanipulation to extract the contents of individual living cells in intact tissue while recording their positional information. With 1cell-DGE, we could detect differentially expressed genes (DEGs) during the reprogramming of leaf cells of the moss Physcomitrella patens, identifying 6382 DEGs between cells at 0 and 24 h after excision. Furthermore, we identified a subpopulation of reprogramming cells based on their pseudotimes, which were calculated using transcriptome profiles at 24 h. 1cell-DGE with microcapillary manipulation can be used to analyze the gene expression of individual cells without detaching them from their tightly associated tissues, enabling us to retain positional information and investigate cell-cell interactions.",30873540,PMC6511839,10.1093/nar/gkz181,17
A Two-Part Mixed Model for Differential Expression Analysis in Single-Cell High-Throughput Gene Expression Data,"The high-throughput gene expression data generated from recent single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and parallel single-cell reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR (scRT-qPCR) technologies enable biologists to study the function of transcriptome at the level of individual cells. Compared with bulk RNA-seq and RT-qPCR gene expression data, single-cell data show notable distinct features, including excessive zero expression values, high variability, and clustered design. We propose to model single-cell high-throughput gene expression data using a two-part mixed model, which not only adequately accounts for the aforementioned features of single-cell expression data but also provides the flexibility of adjusting for covariates. An efficient computational algorithm, automatic differentiation, is used for estimating the model parameters. Compared with existing methods, our approach shows improved power for detecting differential expressed genes in single-cell high-throughput gene expression data.",35205420,PMC8872627,10.3390/genes13020377,2
Network-Based Single-Cell RNA-Seq Data Imputation Enhances Cell Type Identification,"Single-cell RNA sequencing is a powerful technology for obtaining transcriptomes at single-cell resolutions. However, it suffers from dropout events (i.e., excess zero counts) since only a small fraction of transcripts get sequenced in each cell during the sequencing process. This inherent sparsity of expression profiles hinders further characterizations at cell/gene-level such as cell type identification and downstream analysis. To alleviate this dropout issue we introduce a network-based method, netImpute, by leveraging the hidden information in gene co-expression networks to recover real signals. netImpute employs Random Walk with Restart (RWR) to adjust the gene expression level in a given cell by borrowing information from its neighbors in a gene co-expression network. Performance evaluation and comparison with existing tools on simulated data and seven real datasets show that netImpute substantially enhances clustering accuracy and data visualization clarity, thanks to its effective treatment of dropouts. While the idea of netImpute is general and can be applied with other types of networks such as cell co-expression network or protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, evaluation results show that gene co-expression network is consistently more beneficial, presumably because PPI network usually lacks cell type context, while cell co-expression network can cause information loss for rare cell types. Evaluation results on several biological datasets show that netImpute can more effectively recover missing transcripts in scRNA-seq data and enhance the identification and visualization of heterogeneous cell types than existing methods.",32244427,PMC7230610,10.3390/genes11040377,6
Cell-Cell Communication at the Embryo Implantation Site of Mouse Uterus Revealed by Single-Cell Analysis,"As a crucial step for human reproduction, embryo implantation is a low-efficiency process. Despite rapid advances in recent years, the molecular mechanism underlying embryo implantation remains poorly understood. Here, we used the mouse as an animal model and generated a single-cell transcriptomic atlas of embryo implantation sites. By analyzing inter-implantation sites of the uterus as control, we were able to identify global gene expression changes associated with embryo implantation in each cell type. Additionally, we predicted signaling interactions between uterine luminal epithelial cells and mural trophectoderm of blastocysts, which represent the key mechanism of embryo implantation. We also predicted signaling interactions between uterine epithelial-stromal crosstalk at implantation sites, which are crucial for post-implantation development. Our data provide a valuable resource for deciphering the molecular mechanism underlying embryo implantation.",34068395,PMC8153605,10.3390/ijms22105177,9
Isolation and profiling of viable tumor cells from human ex vivo glioblastoma cultures through single-cell transcriptomics,"Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) is becoming a ubiquitous method in profiling the cellular transcriptomes of both malignant and non-malignant cells from the human brain. Here, we present a protocol to isolate viable tumor cells from human ex vivo glioblastoma cultures for single-cell transcriptomic analysis. We describe steps including surgical tissue collection, sectioning, culturing, primary tumor cells inoculation, growth tracking, fluorescence-based cell sorting, and population-enriched scRNA-seq. This comprehensive methodology empowers in-depth understanding of brain tumor biology at the single-cell level. For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to Ravi et al.1.",37393609,PMC10328984,10.1016/j.xpro.2023.102383,2
Characterizing spatial gene expression heterogeneity in spatially resolved single-cell transcriptomic data with nonuniform cellular densities,"Recent technological advances have enabled spatially resolved measurements of expression profiles for hundreds to thousands of genes in fixed tissues at single-cell resolution. However, scalable computational analysis methods able to take into consideration the inherent 3D spatial organization of cell types and nonuniform cellular densities within tissues are still lacking. To address this, we developed MERINGUE, a computational framework based on spatial autocorrelation and cross-correlation analysis to identify genes with spatially heterogeneous expression patterns, infer putative cell-cell communication, and perform spatially informed cell clustering in 2D and 3D in a density-agnostic manner using spatially resolved transcriptomic data. We applied MERINGUE to a variety of spatially resolved transcriptomic data sets including multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH), spatial transcriptomics, Slide-seq, and aligned in situ hybridization (ISH) data. We anticipate that such statistical analysis of spatially resolved transcriptomic data will facilitate our understanding of the interplay between cell state and spatial organization in tissue development and disease.",34035045,PMC8494224,10.1101/gr.271288.120,50
Single-Cell Transcriptomic Profiling of Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived SCGB3A2+ Airway Epithelium,"Lung epithelial lineages have been difficult to maintain in pure form in vitro, and lineage-specific reporters have proven invaluable for monitoring their emergence from cultured pluripotent stem cells (PSCs). However, reporter constructs for tracking proximal airway lineages generated from PSCs have not been previously available, limiting the characterization of these cells. Here, we engineer mouse and human PSC lines carrying airway secretory lineage reporters that facilitate the tracking, purification, and profiling of this lung subtype. Through bulk and single-cell-based global transcriptomic profiling, we find PSC-derived airway secretory cells are susceptible to phenotypic plasticity exemplified by the tendency to co-express both a proximal airway secretory program as well as an alveolar type 2 cell program, which can be minimized by inhibiting endogenous Wnt signaling. Our results provide global profiles of engineered lung cell fates, a guide for improving their directed differentiation, and a human model of the developing airway.",29657097,PMC5995784,10.1016/j.stemcr.2018.03.013,47
Visualizing Cluster-specific Genes from Single-cell Transcriptomics Data Using Association Plots,"Visualizing single-cell transcriptomics data in an informative way is a major challenge in biological data analysis. Clustering of cells is a prominent analysis step and the results are usually visualized in a planar embedding of the cells using methods like PCA, t-SNE, or UMAP. Given a cluster of cells, one frequently searches for the genes highly expressed specifically in that cluster. At this point, visualization is usually replaced by studying a list of differentially expressed genes. Association Plots are derived from correspondence analysis and constitute a planar visualization of the features which characterize a given cluster of observations. We have adapted Association Plots to address the challenge of visualizing cluster-specific genes in large single-cell data sets. Our method is made available as a free R package called APL. We demonstrate the application of APL and Association Plots to single-cell RNA-seq data on two example data sets. First, we present how to delineate novel marker genes using Association Plots with the example of Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell data. Second, we show how to apply Association Plots for annotating cell clusters to known cell types using Association Plots and a predefined list of marker genes. To do this we will use data from the human cell atlas of fetal gene expression. Results from Association Plots will also be compared to methods for deriving differentially expressed genes, and we will show the integration of APL with Gene Ontology Enrichment.",35271868,,10.1016/j.jmb.2022.167525,1
Challenges and opportunities to computationally deconvolve heterogeneous tissue with varying cell sizes using single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets,"Deconvolution of cell mixtures in ""bulk"" transcriptomic samples from homogenate human tissue is important for understanding disease pathologies. However, several experimental and computational challenges impede transcriptomics-based deconvolution approaches using single-cell/nucleus RNA-seq reference atlases. Cells from the brain and blood have substantially different sizes, total mRNA, and transcriptional activities, and existing approaches may quantify total mRNA instead of cell type proportions. Further, standards are lacking for the use of cell reference atlases and integrative analyses of single-cell and spatial transcriptomics data. We discuss how to approach these key challenges with orthogonal ""gold standard"" datasets for evaluating deconvolution methods.",38098055,PMC10722720,10.1186/s13059-023-03123-4,5
ASURAT: functional annotation-driven unsupervised clustering of single-cell transcriptomes,"Motivation:Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis reveals heterogeneity and dynamic cell transitions. However, conventional gene-based analyses require intensive manual curation to interpret biological implications of computational results. Hence, a theory for efficiently annotating individual cells remains warranted.Results:We present ASURAT, a computational tool for simultaneously performing unsupervised clustering and functional annotation of disease, cell type, biological process and signaling pathway activity for single-cell transcriptomic data, using a correlation graph decomposition for genes in database-derived functional terms. We validated the usability and clustering performance of ASURAT using scRNA-seq datasets for human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, which required fewer manual curations than existing methods. Moreover, we applied ASURAT to scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptome datasets for human small cell lung cancer and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, respectively, identifying previously overlooked subpopulations and differentially expressed genes. ASURAT is a powerful tool for dissecting cell subpopulations and improving biological interpretability of complex and noisy transcriptomic data.Availability and implementation:ASURAT is published on Bioconductor (https://doi.org/10.18129/B9.bioc.ASURAT). The codes for analyzing data in this article are available at Github (https://github.com/keita-iida/ASURATBI) and figshare (https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.19200254.v4).Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",35924984,PMC9477531,10.1093/bioinformatics/btac541,2
Neighbor-specific gene expression revealed from physically interacting cells during mouse embryonic development,"Development of multicellular organisms is orchestrated by persistent cell-cell communication between neighboring partners. Direct interaction between different cell types can induce molecular signals that dictate lineage specification and cell fate decisions. Current single-cell RNA-seq technology cannot adequately analyze cell-cell contact-dependent gene expression, mainly due to the loss of spatial information. To overcome this obstacle and resolve cell-cell contact-specific gene expression during embryogenesis, we performed RNA sequencing of physically interacting cells (PIC-seq) and assessed them alongside similar single-cell transcriptomes derived from developing mouse embryos between embryonic day (E) 7.5 and E9.5. Analysis of the PIC-seq data identified gene expression signatures that were dependent on the presence of specific neighboring cell types. Our computational predictions, validated experimentally, demonstrated that neural progenitor (NP) cells upregulateLhx5andNkx2-1genes, when exclusively interacting with definitive endoderm (DE) cells. Moreover, there was a reciprocal impact on the transcriptome of DE cells, as they tend to upregulateRaxandGscwhen in contact with NP cells. Using individual cell transcriptome data, we formulated a means of computationally predicting the impact of one cell type on the transcriptome of its neighboring cell types. We have further developed a distinctive spatial-t-distributed stochastic neighboring embedding to display the pseudospatial distribution of cells in a 2-dimensional space. In summary, we describe an innovative approach to study contact-specific gene regulation during embryogenesis.",36595695,PMC9926237,10.1073/pnas.2205371120,6
Multiplexing Methods for Simultaneous Large-Scale Transcriptomic Profiling of Samples at Single-Cell Resolution,"Barcoding technology has greatly improved the throughput of cells and genes detected in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) studies. Recently, increasing studies have paid more attention to the use of this technology to increase the throughput of samples, as it has greatly reduced the processing time, technical batch effects, and library preparation costs, and lowered the per-sample cost. In this review, the various DNA-based barcoding methods for sample multiplexing are focused on, specifically, on the four major barcoding strategies. A detailed comparison of the barcoding methods is also presented, focusing on aspects such as sample/cell throughput and gene detection, and guidelines for choosing the most appropriate barcoding technique according to the personalized requirements are developed. Finally, the critical applications of sample multiplexing and technical challenges in combinatorial labeling, barcoding in vivo, and multimodal tagging at the spatially resolved resolution, as well as, the future prospects of multiplexed scRNA-seq, for example, prioritizing and predicting the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in patients of different gender and age are highlighted.",34240574,PMC8425911,10.1002/advs.202101229,20
Gene expression pattern of trophoblast-specific transcription factors in trophectoderm by analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data of human blastocyst,"The dysfunction of placenta development is correlated to the defects of pregnancy and fetal growth. The detailed molecular mechanism of placenta development is not identified in humans due to the lack of material in vivo. Trophoblast (TB) lineage derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) induced by bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) has been applied as a model for studying TB lineage specification in vitro. With the development of single-cell sequencing technology, it became possible to detect the transcriptome of the post-implantation embryo at unprecedented precision. In this study, we reanalyzed single-cell RNA-seq of post-implantation embryos derived from two separate groups and identified different subtypes of trophoblast cells and their marker, respectively. At the same time, we focused on the gene expression patterns of trophoblast-specific transcription factors in different models. Our analysis sheds new light on the transcription regulation mechanism of trophoblast differentiation at the early stage of pregnancy establishment in human.",33543402,,10.1007/s10142-021-00770-3,2
Single-Cell RNA-Seq by Multiple Annealing and Tailing-Based Quantitative Single-Cell RNA-Seq (MATQ-Seq),"Single-cell technologies have emerged as advanced tools to study various biological processes that demand the single cell resolution. To detect subtle heterogeneity in the transcriptome, high accuracy and sensitivity are still desired for single-cell RNA-seq.

In addition, MATQ-seq is a total RNA assay allowing for detection of nonpolyadenylated transcripts.",31028632,,10.1007/978-1-4939-9240-9_5,7
Recent advances in differential expression analysis for single-cell RNA-seq and spatially resolved transcriptomic studies,"Differential expression (DE) analysis is a necessary step in the analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) data. Unlike traditional bulk RNA-seq, DE analysis for scRNA-seq or SRT data has unique characteristics that may contribute to the difficulty of detecting DE genes. However, the plethora of DE tools that work with various assumptions makes it difficult to choose an appropriate one. Furthermore, a comprehensive review on detecting DE genes for scRNA-seq data or SRT data from multi-condition, multi-sample experimental designs is lacking. To bridge such a gap, here, we first focus on the challenges of DE detection, then highlight potential opportunities that facilitate further progress in scRNA-seq or SRT analysis, and finally provide insights and guidance in selecting appropriate DE tools or developing new computational DE methods.",37022699,,10.1093/bfgp/elad011,1
Combined Measurement of RNA and Protein Expression on a Single-Cell Level,"Single-cell RNA sequencing (sc-RNAseq) has become a critical approach for the analysis of immune cell function and heterogeneity. So far, the immune cell isolation, based on surface marker expression predicted by the RNA expression profiles, is often limited by the poor correlation between transcript and protein expression patterns. To overcome these difficulties, novel single-cell multi-omic approaches based on the combined analysis of transcript and surface protein expression have been developed. One of the major benefits of these technologies is the possibility to use a high number of antibodies conjugated with oligonucleotide (AbOs) for the surface marker detection, thus overcoming the limit of using few surface markers as occurs in flow cytometry. Here we describe the BD Rhapsody single-cell analysis system protocol for 3' mRNA whole transcriptome analysis (WTA), combined with AbO- and Sample Tag library preparation.",34766276,,10.1007/978-1-0716-1771-7_16,0
DURIAN: an integrative deconvolution and imputation method for robust signaling analysis of single-cell transcriptomics data,"Single-cell RNA sequencing trades read-depth for dimensionality, often leading to loss of critical signaling gene information that is typically present in bulk data sets. We introduce DURIAN (Deconvolution and mUltitask-Regression-based ImputAtioN), an integrative method for recovery of gene expression in single-cell data. Through systematic benchmarking, we demonstrate the accuracy, robustness and empirical convergence of DURIAN using both synthetic and published data sets. We show that use of DURIAN improves single-cell clustering, low-dimensional embedding, and recovery of intercellular signaling networks. Our study resolves several inconsistent results of cell-cell communication analysis using single-cell or bulk data independently. The method has broad application in biomarker discovery and cell signaling analysis using single-cell transcriptomics data sets.",35709795,PMC9294432,10.1093/bib/bbac223,2
[Application of single-cell transcriptome sequencing in mechanistic toxicology],"Traditional bulk RNA sequencing assesses the average expression level of genes in tissues rather than the differences in cellular responses. Accordingly, it is hard to differentiate sensitive responding cells, leading to inaccurate identification of toxicity pathways. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) isolated single cells from tissue and subjected them to cell subtypes-specific transcriptome analysis. This technique in toxicological studies realizes the heterogeneous cellular responses in the tissue microenvironment upon chemical exposure. Thus it helps to identify sensitive responding cells and key molecular events, providing a powerful tool and a new perspective for exploring the mechanisms of toxicity and the modes of action. This review summarizes the development, principle, method, application and limitations of scRNA-seq in mechanistic toxicological researches, and discusses the prospect of multi-directional applications.",35092987,,10.3760/cma.j.cn112150-20210513-00469,0
Inferring transcriptomic cell states and transitions only from time series transcriptome data,"Cellular stages of biological processes have been characterized using fluorescence-activated cell sorting and genetic perturbations, charting a limited landscape of cellular states. Time series transcriptome data can help define new cellular states at the molecular level since the analysis of transcriptional changes can provide information on cell states and transitions. However, existing methods for inferring cell states from transcriptome data use additional information such as prior knowledge on cell types or cell-type-specific markers to reduce the complexity of data. In this study, we present a novel time series clustering framework to infer TRAnscriptomic Cellular States (TRACS) only from time series transcriptome data by integrating Gaussian process regression, shape-based distance, and ranked pairs algorithm in a single computational framework. TRACS determines patterns that correspond to hidden cellular states by clustering gene expression data. TRACS was used to analyse single-cell and bulk RNA sequencing data and successfully generated cluster networks that reflected the characteristics of key stages of biological processes. Thus, TRACS has a potential to help reveal unknown cellular states and transitions at the molecular level using only time series transcriptome data. TRACS is implemented in Python and available at http://github.com/BML-cbnu/TRACS/ .",34131182,PMC8206345,10.1038/s41598-021-91752-9,2
Integrating Single-Cell and Spatial Transcriptomics Reveals Heterogeneity of Early Pig Skin Development and a Subpopulation with Hair Placode Formation,"The dermis and epidermis, crucial structural layers of the skin, encompass appendages, hair follicles (HFs), and intricate cellular heterogeneity. However, an integrated spatiotemporal transcriptomic atlas of embryonic skin has not yet been described and would be invaluable for studying skin-related diseases in humans. Here, single-cell and spatial transcriptomic analyses are performed on skin samples of normal and hairless fetal pigs across four developmental periods. The cross-species comparison of skin cells illustrated that the pig epidermis is more representative of the human epidermis than mice epidermis. Moreover, Phenome-wide association study analysis revealed that the conserved genes between pigs and humans are strongly associated with human skin-related diseases. In the epidermis, two lineage differentiation trajectories describe hair follicle (HF) morphogenesis and epidermal development. By comparing normal and hairless fetal pigs, it is found that the hair placode (Pc), the most characteristic initial structure in HFs, arises from progenitor-like OGN+/UCHL1+cells. These progenitors appear earlier in development than the previously described early Pc cells and exhibit abnormal proliferation and migration during differentiation in hairless pigs. The study provides a valuable resource for in-depth insights into HF development, which may serve as a key reference atlas for studying human skin disease etiology using porcine models.",38561967,PMC11132071,10.1002/advs.202306703,0
A MATQ-seq-Based Protocol for Single-Cell RNA-seq in Bacteria,"Microbes exhibit an extraordinary capacity to adapt their physiology to different environments using phenotypic heterogeneity. However, the majority of gene regulation studies are conducted in bulk reflecting only averaged gene expression levels across millions of cells. Bacterial single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) can overcome this by enabling whole transcriptome and unbiased analysis of microbes at the single-cell level. Here, we describe a detailed workflow of single-cell RNA-seq based on the multiple annealing and dC-tailing-based quantitative single-cell RNA-seq (MATQ-seq) protocol. Following adjustments to the original eukaryotic protocol, the workflow was applied to two major human pathogens Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (henceforth Salmonella) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (henceforth Pseudomonas). The development of bacterial scRNA-seq protocols offers promising avenues to explore the molecular programs underlying phenotypic heterogeneity on the transcriptome level in different settings such as infection, persistence, ecology, and biofilms.",36495446,,10.1007/978-1-0716-2756-3_4,1

Sincast: a computational framework to predict cell identities in single-cell transcriptomes using bulk atlases as references,"Characterizing the molecular identity of a cell is an essential step in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data analysis. Numerous tools exist for predicting cell identity using single-cell reference atlases. However, many challenges remain, including correcting for inherent batch effects between reference and query data andinsufficient phenotype data from the reference. One solution is to project single-cell data onto established bulk reference atlases to leverage their rich phenotype information. Sincast is a computational framework to query scRNA-seq data by projection onto bulk reference atlases. Prior to projection, single-cell data are transformed to be directly comparable to bulk data, either with pseudo-bulk aggregation or graph-based imputation to address sparse single-cell expression profiles. Sincast avoids batch effect correction, and cell identity is predicted along a continuum to highlight new cell states not found in the reference atlas. In several case study scenarios, we show that Sincast projects single cells into the correct biological niches in the expression space of the bulk reference atlas. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our imputation approach that was specifically developed for querying scRNA-seq data based on bulk reference atlases. We show that Sincast is an efficient and powerful tool for single-cell profiling that will facilitate downstream analysis of scRNA-seq data.",35362513,PMC9155616,10.1093/bib/bbac088,2
The promise of spatial transcriptomics for neuroscience in the era of molecular cell typing,"The stereotyped spatial architecture of the brain is both beautiful and fundamentally related to its function, extending from gross morphology to individual neuron types, where soma position, dendritic architecture, and axonal projections determine their roles in functional circuitry. Our understanding of the cell types that make up the brain is rapidly accelerating, driven in particular by recent advances in single-cell transcriptomics. However, understanding brain function, development, and disease will require linking molecular cell types to morphological, physiological, and behavioral correlates. Emerging spatially resolved transcriptomic methods promise to fill this gap by localizing molecularly defined cell types in tissues, with simultaneous detection of morphology, activity, or connectivity. Here, we review the requirements for spatial transcriptomic methods toward these goals, consider the challenges ahead, and describe promising applications.",28983044,,10.1126/science.aan6827,169
"Single-cell transcriptomics in the Drosophila visual system: Advances and perspectives on cell identity regulation, connectivity, and neuronal diversity evolution","The Drosophila visual system supports complex behaviors and shares many of its anatomical and molecular features with the vertebrate brain. Yet, it contains a much more manageable number of neurons and neuronal types. In addition to the extensive Drosophila genetic toolbox, this relative simplicity has allowed decades of work to yield a detailed account of its neuronal type diversity, morphology, connectivity and specification mechanisms. In the past three years, numerous studies have applied large scale single-cell transcriptomic approaches to the Drosophila visual system and have provided access to the complete gene expression profile of most neuronal types throughout development. This makes the fly visual system particularly well suited to perform detailed studies of the genetic mechanisms underlying the evolution and development of neuronal systems. Here, we highlight how these transcriptomic resources allow exploring long-standing biological questions under a new light. We first present the efforts made to characterize neuronal diversity in the Drosophila visual system and suggest ways to further improve this description. We then discuss current advances allowed by the single-cell datasets, and envisage how these datasets can be further leveraged to address fundamental questions regarding the regulation of neuronal identity, neuronal circuit development and the evolution of neuronal diversity.",34375653,,10.1016/j.ydbio.2021.08.001,8
Integrating Multiple Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Datasets Using Adversarial Autoencoders,"Single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has been demonstrated to be a proven method for quantifying gene-expression heterogeneity and providing insight into the transcriptome at the single-cell level. When combining multiple single-cell transcriptome datasets for analysis, it is common to first correct the batch effect. Most of the state-of-the-art processing methods are unsupervised, i.e., they do not utilize single-cell cluster labeling information, which could improve the performance of batch correction methods, especially in the case of multiple cell types. To better utilize known labels for complex dataset scenarios, we propose a novel deep learning model named IMAAE (i.e., integrating multiple single-cell datasets via an adversarial autoencoder) to correct the batch effects. After conducting experiments with various dataset scenarios, the results show that IMAAE outperforms existing methods for both qualitative measures and quantitative evaluation. In addition, IMAAE is able to retain both corrected dimension reduction data and corrected gene expression data. These features make it a potential new option for large-scale single-cell gene expression data analysis.",36982574,PMC10056671,10.3390/ijms24065502,0
Onepot-Seq: capturing single-cell transcriptomes simultaneously in a continuous medium via transient localization of mRNA,"The development of single-cell RNA-seq has broadened the spectrum for biological research by providing a high-resolution analysis of cellular heterogeneity. However, the requirement for sophisticated devices for the compartmentalization of cells has limited its widespread applicability. Here, we develop Onepot-Seq, a device-free method, that harnesses the transient localization of mRNA after lysis to capture single-cell transcriptomes simultaneously in a continuous fluid medium. In mixed-species experiments, we obtained high-quality single-cell profiles. Further, cell type-specific poly(A)-conjugated antibodies allow Onepot-Seq to effectively capture target cells in complex populations. Chemical perturbations to cells can be profiled by Onepot-Seq at single-cell resolution. Onepot-Seq should allow routine transcriptional profiling at single-cell resolution, accelerating clinical and scientific discoveries in many fields of science.",35953080,PMC9825186,10.1093/nar/gkac665,1
scAI: an unsupervised approach for the integrative analysis of parallel single-cell transcriptomic and epigenomic profiles,"Simultaneous measurements of transcriptomic and epigenomic profiles in the same individual cells provide an unprecedented opportunity to understand cell fates. However, effective approaches for the integrative analysis of such data are lacking. Here, we present a single-cell aggregation and integration (scAI) method to deconvolute cellular heterogeneity from parallel transcriptomic and epigenomic profiles. Through iterative learning, scAI aggregates sparse epigenomic signals in similar cells learned in an unsupervised manner, allowing coherent fusion with transcriptomic measurements. Simulation studies and applications to three real datasets demonstrate its capability of dissecting cellular heterogeneity within both transcriptomic and epigenomic layers and understanding transcriptional regulatory mechanisms.",32014031,PMC6996200,10.1186/s13059-020-1932-8,69

MAPS-seq: magnetic bead-assisted parallel single-cell gene expression profiling,"Recently developed single-cell RNA sequencing methods allow the simultaneous profiling of the transcriptomes of thousands of individual cells. However, current methods still require advanced equipment or entail substantial waste of reagents. Here, we introduce magnetic bead-assisted parallel single-cell gene expression sequencing (MAPS-seq), a microwell-based method that pools samples before the reverse transcription step, increasing the ease of sample preparation and reducing reagent waste. Moreover, because this method uses universal reagents and standard molecular biology lab instruments, it is easy to implement, even in labs that have not previously conducted single-cell RNA sequencing. We validated our method by demonstrating that it can generate gene expression data at the single-cell level. We then applied the MAPS-seq method to analyze 237 human myelogenous leukemia cells treated with one of three different drugs or dimethyl sulfoxide. We observed transcriptional changes and identified marker genes that indicate a drug response. Furthermore, the MAPS-seq method produced data of comparable quality to those of existing single-cell RNA sequencing methods. Consequently, we expect that our method will provide researchers with a more accessible, less wasteful, and less burdensome method for investigating the transcriptomes of individual cells.",32404928,PMC7272464,10.1038/s12276-020-0433-x,4

Accurate interpretation of cardiac transcriptional data comes with the unique challenges of heart biology including cardiomyocyte morphology, cryopreservation of limited samples and adequate selection of transcriptional platform at a single-cell resolution. Consequently, development and implementation of novel transcriptional platforms and creative bioinformatic analysis are essential to resolve standing questions in the field of cardiac regenerative medicine. Targeted bioinformatic approaches, advancing technological access, increase technical availability and fostering communication between interdisciplinary groups is critical to improve therapeutic approaches and to overcome challenges inherent to transcriptomic cardiac research.",31464566,PMC6770408,10.2217/rme-2019-0063,0
scDSSC: Deep Sparse Subspace Clustering for scRNA-seq Data,"Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables researchers to characterize transcriptomic profiles at the single-cell resolution with increasingly high throughput. Clustering is a crucial step in single cell analysis. Clustering analysis of transcriptome profiled by scRNA-seq can reveal the heterogeneity and diversity of cells. However, single cell study still remains great challenges due to its high noise and dimension. Subspace clustering aims at discovering the intrinsic structure of data in unsupervised fashion. In this paper, we propose a deep sparse subspace clustering method scDSSC combining noise reduction and dimensionality reduction for scRNA-seq data, which simultaneously learns feature representation and clustering via explicit modelling of scRNA-seq data generation. Experiments on a variety of scRNA-seq datasets from thousands to tens of thousands of cells have shown that scDSSC can significantly improve clustering performance and facilitate the interpretability of clustering and downstream analysis. Compared to some popular scRNA-deq analysis methods, scDSSC outperformed state-of-the-art methods under various clustering performance metrics.",36534702,PMC9810169,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010772,3
Manifold learning analysis suggests strategies to align single-cell multimodal data of neuronal electrophysiology and transcriptomics,"Recent single-cell multimodal data reveal multi-scale characteristics of single cells, such as transcriptomics, morphology, and electrophysiology. However, integrating and analyzing such multimodal data to deeper understand functional genomics and gene regulation in various cellular characteristics remains elusive. To address this, we applied and benchmarked multiple machine learning methods to align gene expression and electrophysiological data of single neuronal cells in the mouse brain from the Brain Initiative. We found that nonlinear manifold learning outperforms other methods. After manifold alignment, the cells form clusters highly corresponding to transcriptomic and morphological cell types, suggesting a strong nonlinear relationship between gene expression and electrophysiology at the cell-type level. Also, the electrophysiological features are highly predictable by gene expression on the latent space from manifold alignment. The aligned cells further show continuous changes of electrophysiological features, implying cross-cluster gene expression transitions. Functional enrichment and gene regulatory network analyses for those cell clusters revealed potential genome functions and molecular mechanisms from gene expression to neuronal electrophysiology.",34799674,PMC8604989,10.1038/s42003-021-02807-6,4
Single-cell and spatial transcriptomics enables probabilistic inference of cell type topography,"The field of spatial transcriptomics is rapidly expanding, and with it the repertoire of available technologies. However, several of the transcriptome-wide spatial assays do not operate on a single cell level, but rather produce data comprised of contributions from a - potentially heterogeneous - mixture of cells. Still, these techniques are attractive to use when examining complex tissue specimens with diverse cell populations, where complete expression profiles are required to properly capture their richness. Motivated by an interest to put gene expression into context and delineate the spatial arrangement of cell types within a tissue, we here present a model-based probabilistic method that uses single cell data to deconvolve the cell mixtures in spatial data. To illustrate the capacity of our method, we use data from different experimental platforms and spatially map cell types from the mouse brain and developmental heart, which arrange as expected.",33037292,PMC7547664,10.1038/s42003-020-01247-y,150
Spatiotemporally resolved transcriptomics reveals the subcellular RNA kinetic landscape,"Spatiotemporal regulation of the cellular transcriptome is crucial for proper protein expression and cellular function. However, the intricate subcellular dynamics of RNA remain obscured due to the limitations of existing transcriptomics methods. Here, we report TEMPOmap-a method that uncovers subcellular RNA profiles across time and space at the single-cell level. TEMPOmap integrates pulse-chase metabolic labeling with highly multiplexed three-dimensional in situ sequencing to simultaneously profile the age and location of individual RNA molecules. Using TEMPOmap, we constructed the subcellular RNA kinetic landscape in various human cells from transcription and translocation to degradation. Clustering analysis of RNA kinetic parameters across single cells revealed 'kinetic gene clusters' whose expression patterns were shaped by multistep kinetic sculpting. Importantly, these kinetic gene clusters are functionally segregated, suggesting that subcellular RNA kinetics are differentially regulated in a cell-state- and cell-type-dependent manner. Spatiotemporally resolved transcriptomics provides a gateway to uncovering new spatiotemporal gene regulation principles.",37038000,PMC10172111,10.1038/s41592-023-01829-8,6
Joint cell segmentation and cell type annotation for spatial transcriptomics,"RNA hybridization-based spatial transcriptomics provides unparalleled detection sensitivity. However, inaccuracies in segmentation of image volumes into cells cause misassignment of mRNAs which is a major source of errors. Here, we develop JSTA, a computational framework for joint cell segmentation and cell type annotation that utilizes prior knowledge of cell type-specific gene expression. Simulation results show that leveraging existing cell type taxonomy increases RNA assignment accuracy by more than 45%. Using JSTA, we were able to classify cells in the mouse hippocampus into 133 (sub)types revealing the spatial organization of CA1, CA3, and Sst neuron subtypes. Analysis of within cell subtype spatial differential gene expression of 80 candidate genes identified 63 with statistically significant spatial differential gene expression across 61 (sub)types. Overall, our work demonstrates that known cell type expression patterns can be leveraged to improve the accuracy of RNA hybridization-based spatial transcriptomics while providing highly granular cell (sub)type information. The large number of newly discovered spatial gene expression patterns substantiates the need for accurate spatial transcriptomic measurements that can provide information beyond cell (sub)type labels.",34057817,PMC8166214,10.15252/msb.202010108,31
Topological and geometric analysis of cell states in single-cell transcriptomic data,"Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables dissecting cellular heterogeneity in tissues, resulting in numerous biological discoveries. Various computational methods have been devised to delineate cell types by clustering scRNA-seq data, where clusters are often annotated using prior knowledge of marker genes. In addition to identifying pure cell types, several methods have been developed to identify cells undergoing state transitions, which often rely on prior clustering results. The present computational approaches predominantly investigate the local and first-order structures of scRNA-seq data using graph representations, while scRNA-seq data frequently display complex high-dimensional structures. Here, we introduce scGeom, a tool that exploits the multiscale and multidimensional structures in scRNA-seq data by analyzing the geometry and topology through curvature and persistent homology of both cell and gene networks. We demonstrate the utility of these structural features to reflect biological properties and functions in several applications, where we show that curvatures and topological signatures of cell and gene networks can help indicate transition cells and the differentiation potential of cells. We also illustrate that structural characteristics can improve the classification of cell types.",38632952,PMC11024518,10.1093/bib/bbae176,1

"The double-edged sword of the mammalian oocyte--advantages, drawbacks and approaches for basic and clinical analysis at the single cell level","Oocytes are usually the largest cells in the body and as such offer unique opportunities for single-cell analysis. Unfortunately, these cells are also some of the rarest in the mammalian female, usually necessitating single-cell analysis. In cases of infertility in humans, determining the quality of the oocyte is often restricted to a morphological analysis or to the study of cellular behaviors in the developing embryo. Minimally invasive approaches could greatly assist the clinician to prioritize oocytes for fertilization or following fertilization, which embryo to transfer back into the woman. Transcriptomics of human and mouse oocytes may have great utility, and recently it was learned that the polar body faithfully reflects the transcript prevalence in the oocyte. The polar body may thus serve as a minimally invasive proxy for an oocyte in the clinic. In the mouse, the transcriptomes of oocytes from mice of the same strain are markedly similar; no significant differences are apparent in transcript prevalence or identity. In human oocytes however, the transcript pool is highly variable. This is likely the result of different histories of each oocyte, in the age of the donor woman, the different hormonal exposures and the prolonged time from specification of the primary oocyte to the fully grown and ovulated egg. This variability in human oocytes also emphasizes the need for cell-by-cell analysis of the oocytes in vitro; which oocytes have a better potential for fertilization and development? To this end, new imaging capabilities are being employed. For example, a single-cell analytical device for oocytes (the simple perfusion apparatus, or SPA) enables investigators to load multiple oocytes in individual wells, to visualize them on the microscope and to use controlled temperature and media flow by perfusion for optimal clinical applications. Recently, developed Raman microspectroscopy approaches suggest that this imaging modality may enable more in-depth analysis of the molecular characteristics of an oocyte that, in combination with the SPA and transcriptomic approaches, might assist the clinician to prioritize more effectively human oocytes and embryos for transfer into women. This review is intended to update the reader on the status of the examination of single oocytes from a variety of approaches and to emphasize areas that may be primed for advancement in the near future.",26590170,PMC4767051,10.1093/molehr/gav064,0

Recent advances in single cell transcriptomics enable to conduct cell taxonomy identifying new cell types and to re-arrange cells in order of pseudo-time course describing differentiation status of each cell. Even though the cost is still high, the single cell transcriptomics now becomes one of the conventional assays. We have applied the single cell gene expression analysis to dissect human development.

Entropy sorting of single-cell RNA sequencing data reveals the inner cell mass in the human pre-implantation embryo,"A major challenge in single-cell gene expression analysis is to discern meaningful cellular heterogeneity from technical or biological noise. To address this challenge, we present entropy sorting (ES), a mathematical framework that distinguishes genes indicative of cell identity. ES achieves this in an unsupervised manner by quantifying if observed correlations between features are more likely to have occurred due to random chance versus a dependent relationship, without the need for any user-defined significance threshold. On synthetic data, we demonstrate the removal of noisy signals to reveal a higher resolution of gene expression patterns than commonly used feature selection methods. We then apply ES to human pre-implantation embryo single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. Previous studies failed to unambiguously identify early inner cell mass (ICM), suggesting that the human embryo may diverge from the mouse paradigm. In contrast, ES resolves the ICM and reveals sequential lineage bifurcations as in the classical model. ES thus provides a powerful approach for maximizing information extraction from high-dimensional datasets such as scRNA-seq data.",36240776,PMC9859930,10.1016/j.stemcr.2022.09.007,5
PhyloVelo enhances transcriptomic velocity field mapping using monotonically expressed genes,"Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a powerful approach for studying cellular differentiation, but accurately tracking cell fate transitions can be challenging, especially in disease conditions. Here we introduce PhyloVelo, a computational framework that estimates the velocity of transcriptomic dynamics by using monotonically expressed genes (MEGs) or genes with expression patterns that either increase or decrease, but do not cycle, through phylogenetic time. Through integration of scRNA-seq data with lineage information, PhyloVelo identifies MEGs and reconstructs a transcriptomic velocity field. We validate PhyloVelo using simulated data and Caenorhabditis elegans ground truth data, successfully recovering linear, bifurcated and convergent differentiations. Applying PhyloVelo to seven lineage-traced scRNA-seq datasets, generated using CRISPR-Cas9 editing, lentiviral barcoding or immune repertoire profiling, demonstrates its high accuracy and robustness in inferring complex lineage trajectories while outperforming RNA velocity. Additionally, we discovered that MEGs across tissues and organisms share similar functions in translation and ribosome biogenesis.",37524958,,10.1038/s41587-023-01887-5,3
Molecular cytometry for comprehensive immune profiling,"Molecular cytometry refers to a group of high-parameter technologies for single-cell analysis that share the following traits: (1) combined (multimodal) measurement of protein and transcripts, (2) medium throughput (10-100K cells), and (3) the use of oligonucleotide-tagged antibodies to detect protein expression. The platform can measure over 100 proteins and either hundreds of targeted genes or the whole transcriptome, on a cell-by-cell basis. It is currently one of the most powerful technologies available for immune monitoring. Here, we describe the technology platform (which includes CITE-Seq, REAP-Seq, and AbSeq), provide guidance for its optimization, and discuss advantages and limitations. Finally, we provide some vignettes from studies that demonstrate the application and potential insight that can be gained from molecular cytometry studies.",38705602,,10.1016/bs.mcb.2024.02.020,0
Integration of single-cell proteomic datasets through distinctive proteins in cell clusters,"The use of mass spectrometry and antibody-based sequencing technologies at the single-cell level has led to an increase in single-cell proteomic datasets. Integrating these datasets is crucial to eliminate the batch effect that often arises due to their limited sequencing molecules. Although methods for horizontally integrating high-dimensional single-cell transcriptomic datasets can also be applied to single-cell proteomic datasets, a specialized approach explicitly tailored for low-dimensional proteomic datasets may enhance the integration process. Here, we introduce SCPRO-HI, an algorithm for the horizontal integration of antibody-based single-cell proteomic datasets. It utilizes a hierarchical cell anchoring technique to match cells based on the similarity of distinctive proteins for constituting cell clusters. A novel variational auto-encoder model is employed for correcting batch effects on the protein abundances, eliminating the need for mapping them into a new domain. Moreover, we propose a technique for extending the algorithm to high-dimensional datasets. The performance of the SCPRO-HI algorithm is evaluated using simulated and real-world single-cell proteomic datasets. The findings demonstrate our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 75% higher silhouette score while preserving HVPs 13% better. Furthermore, the algorithm shows competitive performance in transcriptomic datasets, suggesting potential for integrating high-dimensional mass-spectrometry-based proteomic datasets.",38135888,,10.1002/pmic.202300282,0
Highly Regional Genes: graph-based gene selection for single-cell RNA-seq data,"Gene selection is an indispensable step for analyzing noisy and high-dimensional single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data. Compared with the commonly used variance-based methods, by mimicking the human maker selection in the 2D visualization of cells, a new feature selection method called HRG (Highly Regional Genes) is proposed to find the informative genes, which show regional expression patterns in the cell-cell similarity network. We mathematically find the optimal expression patterns that can maximize the proposed scoring function. In comparison with several unsupervised methods, HRG shows high accuracy and robustness, and can increase the performance of downstream cell clustering and gene correlation analysis. Also, it is applicable for selecting informative genes of sequencing-based spatial transcriptomic data.",35144027,,10.1016/j.jgg.2022.01.004,4
Challenges in unsupervised clustering of single-cell RNA-seq data,"Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) allows researchers to collect large catalogues detailing the transcriptomes of individual cells. Unsupervised clustering is of central importance for the analysis of these data, as it is used to identify putative cell types. However, there are many challenges involved. We discuss why clustering is a challenging problem from a computational point of view and what aspects of the data make it challenging. We also consider the difficulties related to the biological interpretation and annotation of the identified clusters.",30617341,,10.1038/s41576-018-0088-9,386
An integrated single-cell RNA-seq atlas of the mouse hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus links transcriptomic and functional types,"The hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) is a highly complex brain region that is crucial for homeostatic regulation through neuroendocrine signaling, outflow of the autonomic nervous system, and projections to other brain areas. In the past years, single-cell datasets of the hypothalamus have contributed immensely to the current understanding of the diverse hypothalamic cellular composition. While the PVN has been adequately classified functionally, its molecular classification is currently still insufficient. To address this, we created a detailed atlas of PVN transcriptomic cell types by integrating various PVN single-cell datasets into a recently published hypothalamus single-cell transcriptome atlas. Furthermore, we functionally profiled transcriptomic cell types, based on relevant literature, existing retrograde tracing data, and existing single-cell data of a PVN-projection target region. Finally, we validated our findings with immunofluorescent stainings. In our PVN atlas dataset, we identify the well-known different neuropeptide types, each composed of multiple novel subtypes. We identify Avp-Tac1, Avp-Th, Oxt-Foxp1, Crh-Nr3c1, and Trh-Nfib as the most important neuroendocrine subtypes based on markers described in literature. To characterize the preautonomic functional population, we integrated a single-cell retrograde tracing study of spinally projecting preautonomic neurons into our PVN atlas. We identify these (presympathetic) neurons to cocluster with the Adarb2+clusters in our dataset. Further, we identify the expression of receptors for Crh, Oxt, Penk, Sst, and Trh in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, a key region that the pre-parasympathetic PVN neurons project to. Finally, we identify Trh-Ucn3 and Brs3-Adarb2 as some centrally projecting populations. In conclusion, our study presents a detailed overview of the transcriptomic cell types of the murine PVN and provides a first attempt to resolve functionality for the identified populations.",38281730,,10.1111/jne.13367,1
Entropy-based inference of transition states and cellular trajectory for single-cell transcriptomics,"The development of single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) technology allows researchers to characterize the cell types, states and transitions during dynamic biological processes at single-cell resolution. One of the critical tasks is to infer pseudo-time trajectory. However, the existence of transition cells in the intermediate state of complex biological processes poses a challenge for the trajectory inference. Here, we propose a new single-cell trajectory inference method based on transition entropy, named scTite, to identify transitional states and reconstruct cell trajectory from scRNA-seq data. Taking into account the continuity of cellular processes, we introduce a new metric called transition entropy to measure the uncertainty of a cell belonging to different cell clusters, and then identify cell states and transition cells. Specifically, we adopt different strategies to infer the trajectory for the identified cell states and transition cells, and combine them to obtain a detailed cell trajectory. For the identified cell clusters, we utilize the Wasserstein distance based on the probability distribution to calculate distance between clusters, and construct the minimum spanning tree. Meanwhile, we adopt the signaling entropy and partial correlation coefficient to determine transition paths, which contain a group of transition cells with the largest similarity. Then the transitional paths and the MST are combined to infer a refined cell trajectory. We apply scTite to four real scRNA-seq datasets and an integrated dataset, and conduct extensive performance comparison with nine existing trajectory inference methods. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can reconstruct the cell trajectory more accurately than the compared algorithms. The scTite software package is available at https://github.com/dblab2022/scTite.",35696651,,10.1093/bib/bbac225,4
Single-Cell Transcriptome Profiling of Mouse and hESC-Derived Pancreatic Progenitors,"Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are a potential unlimited source of insulin-producing β cells for diabetes treatment. A greater understanding of how β cells form during embryonic development will improve current hESC differentiation protocols. All pancreatic endocrine cells, including β cells, are derived from Neurog3-expressing endocrine progenitors. This study characterizes the single-cell transcriptomes of 6,905 mouse embryonic day (E) 15.5 and 6,626 E18.5 pancreatic cells isolated from Neurog3-Cre; Rosa26mT/mGembryos, allowing for enrichment of endocrine progenitors (yellow; tdTomato + EGFP) and endocrine cells (green; EGFP). Using a NEUROG3-2A-eGFP CyT49 hESC reporter line (N5-5), 4,462 hESC-derived GFP+ cells were sequenced. Differential expression analysis revealed enrichment of markers that are consistent with progenitor, endocrine, or previously undescribed cell-state populations. This study characterizes the single-cell transcriptomes of mouse and hESC-derived endocrine progenitors and serves as a resource (https://lynnlab.shinyapps.io/embryonic_pancreas) for improving the formation of functional β-like cells from hESCs.",30540962,PMC6294286,10.1016/j.stemcr.2018.11.008,49
CellSTAR: a comprehensive resource for single-cell transcriptomic annotation,"Large-scale studies of single-cell sequencing and biological experiments have successfully revealed expression patterns that distinguish different cell types in tissues, emphasizing the importance of studying cellular heterogeneity and accurately annotating cell types. Analysis of gene expression profiles in these experiments provides two essential types of data for cell type annotation: annotated references and canonical markers. In this study, the first comprehensive database of single-cell transcriptomic annotation resource (CellSTAR) was thus developed. It is unique in (a) offering the comprehensive expertly annotated reference data for annotating hundreds of cell types for the first time and (b) enabling the collective consideration of reference data and marker genes by incorporating tens of thousands of markers. Given its unique features, CellSTAR is expected to attract broad research interests from the technological innovations in single-cell transcriptomics, the studies of cellular heterogeneity & dynamics, and so on. It is now publicly accessible without any login requirement at: https://idrblab.org/cellstar.",37855686,PMC10767908,10.1093/nar/gkad874,1
ILoReg: a tool for high-resolution cell population identification from single-cell RNA-seq data,"Motivation:Single-cell RNA-seq allows researchers to identify cell populations based on unsupervised clustering of the transcriptome. However, subpopulations can have only subtle transcriptomic differences and the high dimensionality of the data makes their identification challenging.Results:We introduce ILoReg, an R package implementing a new cell population identification method that improves identification of cell populations with subtle differences through a probabilistic feature extraction step that is applied before clustering and visualization. The feature extraction is performed using a novel machine learning algorithm, called iterative clustering projection (ICP), that uses logistic regression and clustering similarity comparison to iteratively cluster data. Remarkably, ICP also manages to integrate feature selection with the clustering through L1-regularization, enabling the identification of genes that are differentially expressed between cell populations. By combining solutions of multiple ICP runs into a single consensus solution, ILoReg creates a representation that enables investigating cell populations with a high resolution. In particular, we show that the visualization of ILoReg allows segregation of immune and pancreatic cell populations in a more pronounced manner compared with current state-of-the-art methods.Availability and implementation:ILoReg is available as an R package at https://bioconductor.org/packages/ILoReg.Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",33151294,PMC8150131,10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa919,3
JOINTLY: interpretable joint clustering of single-cell transcriptomes,"Single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (sxRNA-seq) is increasingly being used to characterise the transcriptomic state of cell types at homeostasis, during development and in disease. However, this is a challenging task, as biological effects can be masked by technical variation. Here, we present JOINTLY, an algorithm enabling joint clustering of sxRNA-seq datasets across batches. JOINTLY performs on par or better than state-of-the-art batch integration methods in clustering tasks and outperforms other intrinsically interpretable methods. We demonstrate that JOINTLY is robust against over-correction while retaining subtle cell state differences between biological conditions and highlight how the interpretation of JOINTLY can be used to annotate cell types and identify active signalling programs across cell types and pseudo-time. Finally, we use JOINTLY to construct a reference atlas of white adipose tissue (WATLAS), an expandable and comprehensive community resource, in which we describe four adipocyte subpopulations and map compositional changes in obesity and between depots.",38123569,PMC10733431,10.1038/s41467-023-44279-8,0
Glyoxal as an alternative fixative for single-cell RNA sequencing,"Single-cell RNA sequencing has become an important method to identify cell types, delineate the trajectories of cell differentiation in whole organisms, and understand the heterogeneity in cellular responses. Nevertheless, sample collection and processing remain a severe bottleneck for single-cell RNA sequencing experiments. Cell isolation protocols often lead to significant changes in the transcriptomes of cells, requiring novel methods to preserve cell states. Here, we developed and benchmarked protocols using glyoxal as a fixative for single-cell RNA sequencing applications. Using Drop-seq methodology, we detected a large number of transcripts and genes from glyoxal-fixed Drosophila cells after single-cell RNA sequencing. The effective glyoxal fixation of transcriptomes in Drosophila and human cells was further supported by a high correlation of gene expression data between glyoxal-fixed and unfixed samples. Accordingly, we also found highly expressed genes overlapping to a large extent between experimental conditions. These results indicated that our fixation protocol did not induce considerable changes in gene expression and conserved the transcriptome for subsequent single-cell isolation procedures. In conclusion, we present glyoxal as a suitable fixative for Drosophila cells and potentially cells of other species that allow high-quality single-cell RNA sequencing applications.",37494060,PMC10542564,10.1093/g3journal/jkad160,1
Elucidating transcriptomic profiles from single-cell RNA sequencing data using nature-inspired compressed sensing,"Gene-expression profiling can define the cell state and gene-expression pattern of cells at the genetic level in a high-throughput manner. With the development of transcriptome techniques, processing high-dimensional genetic data has become a major challenge in expression profiling. Thanks to the recent widespread use of matrix decomposition methods in bioinformatics, a computational framework based on compressed sensing was adopted to reduce dimensionality. However, compressed sensing requires an optimization strategy to learn the modular dictionaries and activity levels from the low-dimensional random composite measurements to reconstruct the high-dimensional gene-expression data. Considering this, here we introduce and compare four compressed sensing frameworks coming from nature-inspired optimization algorithms (CSCS, ABCCS, BACS and FACS) to improve the quality of the decompression process. Several experiments establish that the three proposed methods outperform benchmark methods on nine different datasets, especially the FACS method. We illustrate therefore, the robustness and convergence of FACS in various aspects; notably, time complexity and parameter analyses highlight properties of our proposed FACS. Furthermore, differential gene-expression analysis, cell-type clustering, gene ontology enrichment and pathology analysis are conducted, which bring novel insights into cell-type identification and characterization mechanisms from different perspectives. All algorithms are written in Python and available at https://github.com/Philyzh8/Nature-inspired-CS.",33855366,PMC8579163,10.1093/bib/bbab125,2
RNA-Bloom enables reference-free and reference-guided sequence assembly for single-cell transcriptomes,"Despite the rapid advance in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies within the last decade, single-cell transcriptome analysis workflows have primarily used gene expression data while isoform sequence analysis at the single-cell level still remains fairly limited. Detection and discovery of isoforms in single cells is difficult because of the inherent technical shortcomings of scRNA-seq data, and existing transcriptome assembly methods are mainly designed for bulk RNA samples. To address this challenge, we developed RNA-Bloom, an assembly algorithm that leverages the rich information content aggregated from multiple single-cell transcriptomes to reconstruct cell-specific isoforms. Assembly with RNA-Bloom can be either reference-guided or reference-free, thus enabling unbiased discovery of novel isoforms or foreign transcripts. We compared both assembly strategies of RNA-Bloom against five state-of-the-art reference-free and reference-based transcriptome assembly methods. In our benchmarks on a simulated 384-cell data set, reference-free RNA-Bloom reconstructed 37.9%-38.3% more isoforms than the best reference-free assembler, whereas reference-guided RNA-Bloom reconstructed 4.1%-11.6% more isoforms than reference-based assemblers. When applied to a real 3840-cell data set consisting of more than 4 billion reads, RNA-Bloom reconstructed 9.7%-25.0% more isoforms than the best competing reference-based and reference-free approaches evaluated. We expect RNA-Bloom to boost the utility of scRNA-seq data beyond gene expression analysis, expanding what is informatically accessible now.",32817073,PMC7462077,10.1101/gr.260174.119,26
Combining denoising of RNA-seq data and flux balance analysis for cluster analysis of single cells,"Background:Sophisticated methods to properly pre-process and analyze the increasing collection of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data are increasingly being developed. On the contrary, the best practices to integrate these data into metabolic networks, aiming at describing metabolic phenotypes within a heterogeneous cell population, have been poorly investigated. In this regard, a critical factor is the presence of false zero values in reactions essential for a fundamental metabolic function, such as biomass or energy production. Here, we investigate the role of denoising strategies in mitigating this problem.Methods:We applied state-of-the-art denoising strategies - namely MAGIC, ENHANCE, and SAVER - on three public scRNA-seq datasets. We then associated a metabolic flux distribution with every single cell by embedding its noise-free transcriptomics profile in the constraints of the optimization of a core metabolic model. Finally, we used the obtained single-cell optimal metabolic fluxes as features for cluster analysis. We compared the results obtained with different techniques, and with or without the use of denoising. We also investigated the possibility of applying denoising directly on the Reaction Activity Scores, which are metabolic features extracted from the read counts, rather than on the read counts.Results:We show that denoising of transcriptomics data improves the clustering of single cells. We also illustrate that denoising restores important metabolic properties, such as the correlation between cell cycle phase and biomass accumulation, and between the RAS scores of reactions belonging to the same metabolic pathway. We show that MAGIC performs better than ENHANCE and SAVER, and that, denoising applied directly on the RAS matrix could be an effective alternative in removing false zero values from essential metabolic reactions.Conclusions:Our results indicate that including denoising as a pre-processing operation represents a milestone to integrate scRNA-seq data into Flux Balance Analysis simulations and to perform single-cell cluster analysis with a focus on metabolic phenotypes.",36284276,PMC9597960,10.1186/s12859-022-04967-6,2
Practical Considerations for Complex Tissue Dissociation for Single-Cell Transcriptomics,"Single-cell and single-nucleus RNA sequencing have revolutionized biomedical research, allowing analysis of complex tissues, identification of novel cell types, and mapping of development as well as disease states. Successful application of this technology critically relies on the dissociation of solid organs and tissues into high-quality single-cell (or nuclei) suspensions.In this chapter, we examine several key aspects of the tissue handling workflow that need to be considered when establishing an efficient tissue processing protocol for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). These include tissue collection, transport, and storage, as well as the choice of the dissociation conditions. We emphasize the importance of the tissue quality check and discuss the advantages (and potential limitations) of tissue cryopreservation. We provide practical tips and considerations on each of the steps of the processing workflow, and comment on how to maximize cell viability and integrity, which are critical for obtaining high-quality single-cell transcriptomic data.",36495461,,10.1007/978-1-0716-2756-3_19,2
Myeloid Heterogeneity in Kidney Disease as Revealed through Single-Cell RNA Sequencing,"Kidney disease represents a global health burden of increasing prevalence and is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Myeloid cells are a major cellular compartment of the immune system; they are found in the healthy kidney and in increased numbers in the damaged and/or diseased kidney, where they act as key players in the progression of injury, inflammation, and fibrosis. They possess enormous plasticity and heterogeneity, adopting different phenotypic and functional characteristics in response to stimuli in the local milieu. Although this inherent complexity remains to be fully understood in the kidney, advances in single-cell genomics promise to change this. Specifically, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has had a transformative effect on kidney research, enabling the profiling and analysis of the transcriptomes of single cells at unprecedented resolution and throughput, and subsequent generation of cell atlases. Moving forward, combining scRNA- and single-nuclear RNA-seq with greater-resolution spatial transcriptomics will allow spatial mapping of kidney disease of varying etiology to further reveal the patterning of immune cells and nonimmune renal cells. This review summarizes the roles of myeloid cells in kidney health and disease, the experimental workflow in currently available scRNA-seq technologies, and published findings using scRNA-seq in the context of myeloid cells and the kidney.",35372996,PMC8785845,10.34067/KID.0003682021,4
Preparing Highly Viable Single-Cell Suspensions from Mouse Pancreatic Islets for Single-Cell RNA Sequencing,"Pancreatic islets consist of several cell types, including alpha, beta, delta, epsilon, and PP cells. Due to cellular heterogeneity, it is challenging to interpret whole-islet transcriptome data. Single-cell transcriptomics offers a powerful method for investigating gene expression at the single-cell level and identifying cellular heterogeneity and subpopulations. Here, we describe a protocol for mouse pancreatic islet isolation, culturing, and dissociation into a single-cell suspension. This protocol yields highly viable cells for successful library preparation and single-cell RNA sequencing. For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to Lee et al.

Transcriptome Encyclopedia of Early Human Development,"Our understanding of human pre-implantation development is limited by the availability of human embryos and cannot completely rely on mouse studies. Petropoulos et al. now provide an extensive transcriptome analysis of a large number of human pre-implantation embryos at single-cell resolution, revealing previously unrecognized features unique to early human development.",27153491,PMC4859939,10.1016/j.cell.2016.04.042,8
A hybrid deep clustering approach for robust cell type profiling using single-cell RNA-seq data,"Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a recent technology that enables fine-grained discovery of cellular subtypes and specific cell states. Analysis of scRNA-seq data routinely involves machine learning methods, such as feature learning, clustering, and classification, to assist in uncovering novel information from scRNA-seq data. However, current methods are not well suited to deal with the substantial amount of noise that is created by the experiments or the variation that occurs due to differences in the cells of the same type. To address this, we developed a new hybrid approach, deep unsupervised single-cell clustering (DUSC), which integrates feature generation based on a deep learning architecture by using a new technique to estimate the number of latent features, with a model-based clustering algorithm, to find a compact and informative representation of the single-cell transcriptomic data generating robust clusters. We also include a technique to estimate an efficient number of latent features in the deep learning model. Our method outperforms both classical and state-of-the-art feature learning and clustering methods, approaching the accuracy of supervised learning. We applied DUSC to a single-cell transcriptomics data set obtained from a triple-negative breast cancer tumor to identify potential cancer subclones accentuated by copy-number variation and investigate the role of clonal heterogeneity. Our method is freely available to the community and will hopefully facilitate our understanding of the cellular atlas of living organisms as well as provide the means to improve patient diagnostics and treatment.",32532794,PMC7491323,10.1261/rna.074427.119,8
Dissecting the transcriptome landscape of the human fetal neural retina and retinal pigment epithelium by single-cell RNA-seq analysis,"The developmental pathway of the neural retina (NR) and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) has been revealed by extensive research in mice. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of the human NR and RPE, as well as the interactions between these two tissues, have not been well defined. Here, we analyzed 2,421 individual cells from human fetal NR and RPE using single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) technique and revealed the tightly regulated spatiotemporal gene expression network of human retinal cells. We identified major cell classes of human fetal retina and potential crucial transcription factors for each cell class. We dissected the dynamic expression patterns of visual cycle- and ligand-receptor interaction-related genes in the RPE and NR. Moreover, we provided a map of disease-related genes for human fetal retinal cells and highlighted the importance of retinal progenitor cells as potential targets of inherited retinal diseases. Our findings captured the key in vivo features of the development of the human NR and RPE and offered insightful clues for further functional studies.",31269016,PMC6634428,10.1371/journal.pbio.3000365,77
Technical optimization of spatially resolved single-cell transcriptomic datasets to study clinical liver disease,"Single cell and spatially resolved 'omic' techniques have enabled deep characterization of clinical pathologies that remain poorly understood, providing unprecedented insights into molecular mechanisms of disease. However, transcriptomic platforms are costly, limiting sample size, which increases the possibility of pre-analytical variables such as tissue processing and storage procedures impacting RNA quality and downstream analyses. Furthermore, spatial transcriptomics have not yet reached single cell resolution, leading to the development of multiple deconvolution methods to predict individual cell types within each transcriptome 'spot' on tissue sections. In this study, we performed spatial transcriptomics and single nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNAseq) on matched specimens from patients with either histologically normal or advanced fibrosis to establish important aspects of tissue handling, data processing, and downstream analyses of biobanked liver samples. We observed that tissue preservation technique impacts transcriptomic data, especially in fibrotic liver. Single cell mapping of the spatial transcriptome using paired snRNAseq data generated a spatially resolved, single cell dataset with 24 unique liver cell phenotypes. We determined that cell-cell interactions predicted using ligand-receptor analysis of snRNAseq data poorly correlated with cellular relationships identified using spatial transcriptomics. Our study provides a framework for generating spatially resolved, single cell datasets to study gene expression and cell-cell interactions in biobanked clinical samples with advanced liver disease.",38351241,PMC10864257,10.1038/s41598-024-53993-2,0
Spatially aware dimension reduction for spatial transcriptomics,"Spatial transcriptomics are a collection of genomic technologies that have enabled transcriptomic profiling on tissues with spatial localization information. Analyzing spatial transcriptomic data is computationally challenging, as the data collected from various spatial transcriptomic technologies are often noisy and display substantial spatial correlation across tissue locations. Here, we develop a spatially-aware dimension reduction method, SpatialPCA, that can extract a low dimensional representation of the spatial transcriptomics data with biological signal and preserved spatial correlation structure, thus unlocking many existing computational tools previously developed in single-cell RNAseq studies for tailored analysis of spatial transcriptomics. We illustrate the benefits of SpatialPCA for spatial domain detection and explores its utility for trajectory inference on the tissue and for high-resolution spatial map construction. In the real data applications, SpatialPCA identifies key molecular and immunological signatures in a detected tumor surrounding microenvironment, including a tertiary lymphoid structure that shapes the gradual transcriptomic transition during tumorigenesis and metastasis. In addition, SpatialPCA detects the past neuronal developmental history that underlies the current transcriptomic landscape across tissue locations in the cortex.",36418351,PMC9684472,10.1038/s41467-022-34879-1,31
FitDevo: accurate inference of single-cell developmental potential using sample-specific gene weight,"The quantification of developmental potential is critical for determining developmental stages and identifying essential molecular signatures in single-cell studies. Here, we present FitDevo, a novel method for inferring developmental potential using scRNA-seq data. The main idea of FitDevo is first to generate sample-specific gene weight (SSGW) and then infer developmental potential by calculating the correlation between SSGW and gene expression. SSGW is generated using a generalized linear model that combines sample-specific information and gene weight learned from a training dataset covering scRNA-seq data of 17 previously published datasets. We have rigorously validated FitDevo's effectiveness using a testing dataset with scRNA-seq data from 28 existing datasets and have also demonstrated its superiority over current methods. Furthermore, FitDevo's broad application scope has been illustrated using three practical scenarios: deconvolution analysis of epidermis, spatial transcriptomic data analysis of hearts and intestines, and developmental potential analysis of breast cancer.

TooManyCells identifies and visualizes relationships of single-cell clades,"Identifying and visualizing transcriptionally similar cells is instrumental for accurate exploration of the cellular diversity revealed by single-cell transcriptomics. However, widely used clustering and visualization algorithms produce a fixed number of cell clusters. A fixed clustering 'resolution' hampers our ability to identify and visualize echelons of cell states. We developed TooManyCells, a suite of graph-based algorithms for efficient and unbiased identification and visualization of cell clades. TooManyCells introduces a visualization model built on a concept intentionally orthogonal to dimensionality-reduction methods. TooManyCells is also equipped with an efficient matrix-free divisive hierarchical spectral clustering different from prevalent single-resolution clustering methods. TooManyCells enables multiresolution and multifaceted exploration of single-cell clades. An advantage of this paradigm is the immediate detection of rare and common populations that outperforms popular clustering and visualization algorithms, as demonstrated using existing single-cell transcriptomic data sets and new data modeling drug-resistance acquisition in leukemic T cells.",32123397,PMC7439807,10.1038/s41592-020-0748-5,33
Comprehensive evaluation of deconvolution methods for human brain gene expression,"Transcriptome deconvolution aims to estimate the cellular composition of an RNA sample from its gene expression data, which in turn can be used to correct for composition differences across samples. The human brain is unique in its transcriptomic diversity, and comprises a complex mixture of cell-types, including transcriptionally similar subtypes of neurons. Here, we carry out a comprehensive evaluation of deconvolution methods for human brain transcriptome data, and assess the tissue-specificity of our key observations by comparison with human pancreas and heart. We evaluate eight transcriptome deconvolution approaches and nine cell-type signatures, testing the accuracy of deconvolution using in silico mixtures of single-cell RNA-seq data, RNA mixtures, as well as nearly 2000 human brain samples. Our results identify the main factors that drive deconvolution accuracy for brain data, and highlight the importance of biological factors influencing cell-type signatures, such as brain region and in vitro cell culturing.",35292647,PMC8924248,10.1038/s41467-022-28655-4,37
DestVI identifies continuums of cell types in spatial transcriptomics data,"Most spatial transcriptomics technologies are limited by their resolution, with spot sizes larger than that of a single cell. Although joint analysis with single-cell RNA sequencing can alleviate this problem, current methods are limited to assessing discrete cell types, revealing the proportion of cell types inside each spot. To identify continuous variation of the transcriptome within cells of the same type, we developed Deconvolution of Spatial Transcriptomics profiles using Variational Inference (DestVI). Using simulations, we demonstrate that DestVI outperforms existing methods for estimating gene expression for every cell type inside every spot. Applied to a study of infected lymph nodes and of a mouse tumor model, DestVI provides high-resolution, accurate spatial characterization of the cellular organization of these tissues and identifies cell-type-specific changes in gene expression between different tissue regions or between conditions. DestVI is available as part of the open-source software package scvi-tools ( https://scvi-tools.org ).",35449415,PMC9756396,10.1038/s41587-022-01272-8,51
Tracing production instability in a clonally derived CHO cell line using single-cell transcriptomics,"A variety of mechanisms including transcriptional silencing, gene copy loss, and increased susceptibility to cellular stress have been associated with a sudden or gradual loss of monoclonal antibody (mAb) production in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines. In this study, we utilized single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) to study a clonally derived CHO cell line that underwent production instability leading to a dramatic reduction of the levels of mAb produced. From the scRNA-seq data, we identified subclusters associated with variations in the mAb transgenes and observed that heavy chain gene expression was significantly lower than that of the light chain across the population. Using trajectory inference, the evolution of the cell line was reconstructed and was found to correlate with a reduction in heavy and light chain gene expression. Genes encoding for proteins involved in the response to oxidative stress and apoptosis were found to increase in expression as cells progressed along the trajectory. Future studies of CHO cell lines using this technology have the potential to dramatically enhance our understanding of the characteristics underpinning efficient manufacturing performance as well as product quality.",33586781,,10.1002/bit.27715,3
"SMaSH: a scalable, general marker gene identification framework for single-cell RNA-sequencing","Background:Single-cell RNA-sequencing is revolutionising the study of cellular and tissue-wide heterogeneity in a large number of biological scenarios, from highly tissue-specific studies of disease to human-wide cell atlases. A central task in single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis design is the calculation of cell type-specific genes in order to study the differential impact of different replicates (e.g. tumour vs. non-tumour environment) on the regulation of those genes and their associated networks. The crucial task is the efficient and reliable calculation of such cell type-specific 'marker' genes. These optimise the ability of the experiment to isolate highly-specific cell phenotypes of interest to the analyser. However, while methods exist that can calculate marker genes from single-cell RNA-sequencing, no such method places emphasise on specific cell phenotypes for downstream study in e.g. differential gene expression or other experimental protocols (spatial transcriptomics protocols for example). Here we present SMaSH, a general computational framework for extracting key marker genes from single-cell RNA-sequencing data which reliably characterise highly-specific and niche populations of cells in numerous different biological data-sets.Results:SMaSH extracts robust and biologically well-motivated marker genes, which characterise a given single-cell RNA-sequencing data-set better than existing computational approaches for general marker gene calculation. We demonstrate the utility of SMaSH through its substantial performance improvement over several existing methods in the field. Furthermore, we evaluate the SMaSH markers on spatial transcriptomics data, demonstrating they identify highly localised compartments of the mouse cortex.Conclusion:SMaSH is a new methodology for calculating robust markers genes from large single-cell RNA-sequencing data-sets, and has implications for e.g. effective gene identification for probe design in downstream analyses spatial transcriptomics experiments. SMaSH has been fully-integrated with the ScanPy framework and provides a valuable bioinformatics tool for cell type characterisation and validation in every-growing data-sets spanning over 50 different cell types across hundreds of thousands of cells.",35941549,PMC9361618,10.1186/s12859-022-04860-2,11
Quantifying Landscape-Flux via Single-Cell Transcriptomics Uncovers the Underlying Mechanism of Cell Cycle,"Recent developments in single-cell sequencing technology enable the acquisition of entire transcriptome data. Understanding the underlying mechanism and identifying the driving force of transcriptional regulation governing cell function directly from these data remains challenging. This study reconstructs a continuous vector field of the cell cycle based on discrete single-cell RNA velocity to quantify the single-cell global nonequilibrium dynamic landscape-flux. It reveals that large fluctuations disrupt the global landscape and genetic perturbations alter landscape-flux, thus identifying key genes in maintaining cell cycle dynamics and predicting associated functional effects. Additionally, it quantifies the fundamental energy cost of the cell cycle initiation and unveils that sustaining the cell cycle requires curl flux and dissipation to maintain the oscillatory phase coherence. This study enables the inference of the cell cycle gene regulatory networks directly from the single-cell transcriptomic data, including the feedback mechanisms and interaction intensity. This provides a golden opportunity to experimentally verify the landscape-flux theory and also obtain its associated quantifications. It also offers a unique framework for combining the landscape-flux theory and single-cell high-through sequencing experiments for understanding the underlying mechanisms of the cell cycle and can be extended to other nonequilibrium biological processes, such as differentiation development and disease pathogenesis.",38353329,PMC11040366,10.1002/advs.202308879,0
Computational assignment of cell-cycle stage from single-cell transcriptome data,"The transcriptome of single cells can reveal important information about cellular states and heterogeneity within populations of cells. Recently, single-cell RNA-sequencing has facilitated expression profiling of large numbers of single cells in parallel. To fully exploit these data, it is critical that suitable computational approaches are developed. One key challenge, especially pertinent when considering dividing populations of cells, is to understand the cell-cycle stage of each captured cell. Here we describe and compare five established supervised machine learning methods and a custom-built predictor for allocating cells to their cell-cycle stage on the basis of their transcriptome. In particular, we assess the impact of different normalisation strategies and the usage of prior knowledge on the predictive power of the classifiers. We tested the methods on previously published datasets and found that a PCA-based approach and the custom predictor performed best. Moreover, our analysis shows that the performance depends strongly on normalisation and the usage of prior knowledge. Only by leveraging prior knowledge in form of cell-cycle annotated genes and by preprocessing the data using a rank-based normalisation, is it possible to robustly capture the transcriptional cell-cycle signature across different cell types, organisms and experimental protocols.",26142758,,10.1016/j.ymeth.2015.06.021,207
Identification of cell-type-specific genes in multimodal single-cell data using deep neural network algorithm,"The emergence of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology makes it possible to measure DNA, RNA, and protein in a single cell. Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by sequencing (CITE-seq) is a powerful multimodal single-cell research innovation, allowing researchers to capture RNA and surface protein expression on the same cells. Currently, identification of cell-type-specific genes in CITE-seq data is still challenging. In this study, we obtained a set of CITE-seq datasets from Kaggle database, which included the sequencing dataset of seven cell types during bone marrow stem cell differentiation. We used Student's t-test to analyze these transcription RNAs and pick out 133 significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs) among all cell types. Functional enrichment revealed that these DEGs were strongly associated with blood-related diseases, providing important insights into the cellular heterogeneity within bone marrow stem cells. The relation between RNA and protein levels was performed by deep neural network (DNN) model and achieved a high prediction score of 0.867. Based on their coefficients in the DNN model, three genes (LGALS1, CENPV, TRIM24) were identified as cell-type-specific genes in erythrocyte progenitor. Our works provide a novel perspective regarding the differentiation of stem cells in the bone marrow and provide valuable insights for further research in this field.",37738895,,10.1016/j.compbiomed.2023.107498,0
Biological and Medical Importance of Cellular Heterogeneity Deciphered by Single-Cell RNA Sequencing,"The present review discusses recent progress in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), which can describe cellular heterogeneity in various organs, bodily fluids, and pathologies (e.g., cancer and Alzheimer's disease). We outline scRNA-seq techniques that are suitable for investigating cellular heterogeneity that is present in cell populations with very high resolution of the transcriptomic landscape. We summarize scRNA-seq findings and applications of this technology to identify cell types, activity, and other features that are important for the function of different bodily organs. We discuss future directions for scRNA-seq techniques that can link gene expression, protein expression, cellular function, and their roles in pathology. We speculate on how the field could develop beyond its present limitations (e.g., performing scRNA-seq in situ and in vivo). Finally, we discuss the integration of machine learning and artificial intelligence with cutting-edge scRNA-seq technology, which could provide a strong basis for designing precision medicine and targeted therapy in the future.",32707839,PMC7463515,10.3390/cells9081751,24
Interpretable and context-free deconvolution of multi-scale whole transcriptomic data with UniCell deconvolve,"We introduce UniCell: Deconvolve Base (UCDBase), a pre-trained, interpretable, deep learning model to deconvolve cell type fractions and predict cell identity across Spatial, bulk-RNA-Seq, and scRNA-Seq datasets without contextualized reference data. UCD is trained on 10 million pseudo-mixtures from a fully-integrated scRNA-Seq training database comprising over 28 million annotated single cells spanning 840 unique cell types from 898 studies. We show that our UCDBase and transfer-learning models achieve comparable or superior performance on in-silico mixture deconvolution to existing, reference-based, state-of-the-art methods. Feature attribute analysis uncovers gene signatures associated with cell-type specific inflammatory-fibrotic responses in ischemic kidney injury, discerns cancer subtypes, and accurately deconvolves tumor microenvironments. UCD identifies pathologic changes in cell fractions among bulk-RNA-Seq data for several disease states. Applied to lung cancer scRNA-Seq data, UCD annotates and distinguishes normal from cancerous cells. Overall, UCD enhances transcriptomic data analysis, aiding in assessment of cellular and spatial context.",36906603,PMC10008582,10.1038/s41467-023-36961-8,6
Prioritizing prognostic-associated subpopulations and individualized recurrence risk signatures from single-cell transcriptomes of colorectal cancer,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common gastrointestinal malignancies. There are few recurrence risk signatures for CRC patients. Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides a high-resolution platform for prognostic signature detection. However, scRNA-seq is not practical in large cohorts due to its high cost and most single-cell experiments lack clinical phenotype information. Few studies have been reported to use external bulk transcriptome with survival time to guide the detection of key cell subtypes in scRNA-seq data. We proposed scRankXMBD, a computational framework to prioritize prognostic-associated cell subpopulations based on within-cell relative expression orderings of gene pairs from single-cell transcriptomes. scRankXMBD achieves higher precision and concordance compared with five existing methods. Moreover, we developed single-cell gene pair signatures to predict recurrence risk for patients individually. Our work facilitates the application of the rank-based method in scRNA-seq data for prognostic biomarker discovery and precision oncology. scRankXMBD is available at https://github.com/xmuyulab/scRank-XMBD.

Improving replicability in single-cell RNA-Seq cell type discovery with Dune,"Background:Single-cell transcriptome sequencing (scRNA-Seq) has allowed new types of investigations at unprecedented levels of resolution. Among the primary goals of scRNA-Seq is the classification of cells into distinct types. Many approaches build on existing clustering literature to develop tools specific to single-cell. However, almost all of these methods rely on heuristics or user-supplied parameters to control the number of clusters. This affects both the resolution of the clusters within the original dataset as well as their replicability across datasets. While many recommendations exist, in general, there is little assurance that any given set of parameters will represent an optimal choice in the trade-off between cluster resolution and replicability. For instance, another set of parameters may result in more clusters that are also more replicable.Results:Here, we propose Dune, a new method for optimizing the trade-off between the resolution of the clusters and their replicability. Our method takes as input a set of clustering results-or partitions-on a single dataset and iteratively merges clusters within each partitions in order to maximize their concordance between partitions. As demonstrated on multiple datasets from different platforms, Dune outperforms existing techniques, that rely on hierarchical merging for reducing the number of clusters, in terms of replicability of the resultant merged clusters as well as concordance with ground truth. Dune is available as an R package on Bioconductor: https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/Dune.html .Conclusions:Cluster refinement by Dune helps improve the robustness of any clustering analysis and reduces the reliance on tuning parameters. This method provides an objective approach for borrowing information across multiple clusterings to generate replicable clusters most likely to represent common biological features across multiple datasets.",38789920,PMC11127396,10.1186/s12859-024-05814-6,0
webSCST: an interactive web application for single-cell RNA-sequencing data and spatial transcriptomic data integration,"Summary:Integrative analysis of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data with spatial data for the same species and organ would provide each cell sample with a predictive spatial location, which would facilitate biological study. However, publicly available spatial sequencing datasets for specific species and organs are rare and are often displayed in different formats. In this study, we introduce a new web-based scRNA-seq analysis tool, webSCST, that integrates well-organized spatial transcriptome sequencing datasets categorized by species and organs, provides a user-friendly interface for raw single-cell processing with popular integration methods and allows users to submit their raw scRNA-seq data once to obtain predicted spatial locations for each cell type.Availability and implementation:webSCST implemented in shiny with all major browsers supported is available at http://www.webscst.com. webSCST is also freely available as an R package at https://github.com/swsoyee/webSCST.",35604082,,10.1093/bioinformatics/btac350,6

In order to understand cardiac development, heart tissue homeostasis, and the effects of stress and injury on the cardiovascular system, it is essential to characterize the heart at high cellular resolution. Single-cell profiling provides a more precise definition of tissue composition, cell differentiation trajectories, and intercellular communication, compared to classical bulk approaches. Here, we aim to review how recent single-cell multi-omic studies have changed our understanding of cell dynamics during cardiac development, and in the healthy and diseased adult myocardium.",33669808,PMC7922347,10.3390/ijms22042071,1
Transcriptomic analysis of mid-secretory endometrium reveals essential immune factors associated with pregnancy after single euploid blastocyst transfer,"Purpose:Implantation is a limiting factor for treatment success in assisted reproduction. Both embryonic and endometrial factors contribute to implantation. Embryonic factors have often been ignored in previous studies about the role of endometrium in implantation. In this study, we sought to identify the endometrial genes associated with negative pregnancy outcomes following the transfer of a single euploid blastocyst.Methods:Computational analyses of the transcriptomes of mid-secretory endometria from nine pregnant and seven non-pregnant patients in a cycle preceding the transfer of a single euploid blastocyst in a vitrified-warmed cycle were performed.Results:Principal component analysis of two reported endometrial receptivity gene sets showed close clustering of the pregnant and non-pregnant samples. Differential gene expression analysis and co-expression module analysis identified 131 genes associated with the pregnancy status. The endometrial signatures identified highlight the importance of immune and metabolic regulation in pregnancy outcome. Network analysis identified 20 hub genes that could predict pregnancy outcomes with 88.9% sensitivity and 85.7% specificity. Single-cell gene expression analysis highlighted the regulation of endometrial natural killer (NK) cells, T cells, and macrophages during embryo implantation. Immune cell abundance analysis supported the dysregulation of cytotoxic immune cells in the endometria of non-pregnant women.Conclusions:We reported the first endometrial gene signature associated with pregnancy after elimination of embryo aneuploidy and highlighted the importance of the endometrial immune microenvironment and metabolic status in pregnancy outcomes.",36542433,,10.1111/aji.13672,0
Vision-Dependent and -Independent Molecular Maturation of Mouse Retinal Ganglion Cells,"The development and connectivity of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), the retina's sole output neurons, are patterned by activity-independent transcriptional programs and activity-dependent remodeling. To inventory the molecular correlates of these influences, we applied high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to mouse RGCs at six embryonic and postnatal ages. We identified temporally regulated modules of genes that correlate with, and likely regulate, multiple phases of RGC development, ranging from differentiation and axon guidance to synaptic recognition and refinement. Some of these genes are expressed broadly while others, including key transcription factors and recognition molecules, are selectively expressed by one or a few of the 45 transcriptomically distinct types defined previously in adult mice. Next, we used these results as a foundation to analyze the transcriptomes of RGCs in mice lacking visual experience due to dark rearing from birth or to mutations that ablate either bipolar or photoreceptor cells. 98.5% of visually deprived (VD) RGCs could be unequivocally assigned to a single RGC type based on their transcriptional profiles, demonstrating that visual activity is dispensable for acquisition and maintenance of RGC type identity. However, visual deprivation significantly reduced the transcriptomic distinctions among RGC types, implying that activity is required for complete RGC maturation or maintenance. Consistent with this notion, transcriptomic alternations in VD RGCs significantly overlapped with gene modules found in developing RGCs. Our results provide a resource for mechanistic analyses of RGC differentiation and maturation, and for investigating the role of activity in these processes.",35870562,PMC10809145,10.1016/j.neuroscience.2022.07.013,7
Likelihood-based deconvolution of bulk gene expression data using single-cell references,"Direct comparison of bulk gene expression profiles is complicated by distinct cell type mixtures in each sample that obscure whether observed differences are actually caused by changes in the expression levels themselves or are simply a result of differing cell type compositions. Single-cell technology has made it possible to measure gene expression in individual cells, achieving higher resolution at the expense of increased noise. If carefully incorporated, such single-cell data can be used to deconvolve bulk samples to yield accurate estimates of the true cell type proportions, thus enabling one to disentangle the effects of differential expression and cell type mixtures. Here, we propose a generative model and a likelihood-based inference method that uses asymptotic statistical theory and a novel optimization procedure to perform deconvolution of bulk RNA-seq data to produce accurate cell type proportion estimates. We show the effectiveness of our method, called RNA-Sieve, across a diverse array of scenarios involving real data and discuss extensions made uniquely possible by our probabilistic framework, including a demonstration of well-calibrated confidence intervals.",34301624,PMC8494215,10.1101/gr.272344.120,13

Novel techniques expand on current benchmark protocols, expediting their incorporation into ongoing research. These approaches digitally reconstruct patterns of embryonic expression in three dimensions, and have successfully identified novel domains of expression, cell types, and tissue features. Such technologies pave the way for unbiased and exhaustive recapitulation of gene expression levels in spatial and quantitative terms, promoting understanding of the molecular origin of developmental defects, and improving medical diagnostics.",33097816,PMC7584572,10.1038/s42003-020-01341-1,55
Gene expression profiles of brain endothelial cells during embryonic development at bulk and single-cell levels,"The blood-brain barrier is a dynamic interface that separates the brain from the circulatory system, and it is formed by highly specialized endothelial cells. To explore the molecular mechanisms defining the unique nature of vascular development and differentiation in the brain, we generated high-resolution gene expression profiles of mouse embryonic brain endothelial cells using translating ribosome affinity purification and single-cell RNA sequencing. We compared the brain vascular translatome with the vascular translatomes of other organs and analyzed the vascular translatomes of the brain at different time points during embryonic development. Because canonical Wnt signaling is implicated in the formation of the blood-brain barrier, we also compared the brain endothelial translatome of wild-type mice with that of mice lacking the transcriptional cofactor β-catenin (Ctnnb1). Our analysis revealed extensive molecular changes during the embryonic development of the brain endothelium. We identified genes encoding brain endothelium-specific transcription factors (Foxf2,Foxl2,Foxq1,Lef1,Ppard,Zfp551, andZic3) that are associated with maturation of the blood-brain barrier and act downstream of the Wnt-β-catenin signaling pathway. Profiling of individual brain endothelial cells revealed substantial heterogeneity in the population. Nevertheless, the high abundance ofFoxf2,Foxq1,Ppard, orZic3transcripts correlated with the increased expression of genes encoding markers of brain endothelial cell differentiation. Expression ofFoxf2andZic3in human umbilical vein endothelial cells induced the production of blood-brain barrier differentiation markers. This comprehensive data set may help to improve the engineering of in vitro blood-brain barrier models.",28698213,,10.1126/scisignal.aag2476,55
scShapes: a statistical framework for identifying distribution shapes in single-cell RNA-sequencing data,"Background:Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) methods have been advantageous for quantifying cell-to-cell variation by profiling the transcriptomes of individual cells. For scRNA-seq data, variability in gene expression reflects the degree of variation in gene expression from one cell to another. Analyses that focus on cell-cell variability therefore are useful for going beyond changes based on average expression and, instead, identifying genes with homogeneous expression versus those that vary widely from cell to cell.Results:We present a novel statistical framework, scShapes, for identifying differential distributions in single-cell RNA-sequencing data using generalized linear models. Most approaches for differential gene expression detect shifts in the mean value. However, as single-cell data are driven by overdispersion and dropouts, moving beyond means and using distributions that can handle excess zeros is critical. scShapes quantifies gene-specific cell-to-cell variability by testing for differences in the expression distribution while flexibly adjusting for covariates if required. We demonstrate that scShapes identifies subtle variations that are independent of altered mean expression and detects biologically relevant genes that were not discovered through standard approaches.Conclusions:This analysis also draws attention to genes that switch distribution shapes from a unimodal distribution to a zero-inflated distribution and raises open questions about the plausible biological mechanisms that may give rise to this, such as transcriptional bursting. Overall, the results from scShapes help to expand our understanding of the role that gene expression plays in the transcriptional regulation of a specific perturbation or cellular phenotype. Our framework scShapes is incorporated into a Bioconductor R package (https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/scShapes.html).",36691728,PMC9871437,10.1093/gigascience/giac126,1

Gene Regulatory Network Inference from Single-Cell Data Using Multivariate Information Measures,"While single-cell gene expression experiments present new challenges for data processing, the cell-to-cell variability observed also reveals statistical relationships that can be used by information theory. Here, we use multivariate information theory to explore the statistical dependencies between triplets of genes in single-cell gene expression datasets. We develop PIDC, a fast, efficient algorithm that uses partial information decomposition (PID) to identify regulatory relationships between genes. We thoroughly evaluate the performance of our algorithm and demonstrate that the higher-order information captured by PIDC allows it to outperform pairwise mutual information-based algorithms when recovering true relationships present in simulated data. We also infer gene regulatory networks from three experimental single-cell datasets and illustrate how network context, choices made during analysis, and sources of variability affect network inference. PIDC tutorials and open-source software for estimating PID are available. PIDC should facilitate the identification of putative functional relationships and mechanistic hypotheses from single-cell transcriptomic data.",28957658,PMC5624513,10.1016/j.cels.2017.08.014,209
Transcriptome analysis method based on differential distribution evaluation,"Identifying differential genes over conditions provides insights into the mechanisms of biological processes and disease progression. Here we present an approach, the Kullback-Leibler divergence-based differential distribution (klDD), which provides a flexible framework for quantifying changes in higher-order statistical information of genes including mean and variance/covariation. The method can well detect subtle differences in gene expression distributions in contrast to mean or variance shifts of the existing methods. In addition to effectively identifying informational genes in terms of differential distribution, klDD can be directly applied to cancer subtyping, single-cell clustering and disease early-warning detection, which were all validated by various benchmark datasets.",35151228,,10.1093/bib/bbab608,1
Single-cell RNA-sequencing reports growth-condition-specific global transcriptomes of individual bacteria,"Bacteria respond to changes in their environment with specific transcriptional programmes, but even within genetically identical populations these programmes are not homogenously expressed1. Such transcriptional heterogeneity between individual bacteria allows genetically clonal communities to develop a complex array of phenotypes1, examples of which include persisters that resist antibiotic treatment and metabolically specialized cells that emerge under nutrient-limiting conditions2. Fluorescent reporter constructs have played a pivotal role in deciphering heterogeneous gene expression within bacterial populations3but have been limited to recording the activity of single genes in a few genetically tractable model species, whereas the vast majority of bacteria remain difficult to engineer and/or even to cultivate. Single-cell transcriptomics is revolutionizing the analysis of phenotypic cell-to-cell variation in eukaryotes, but technical hurdles have prevented its robust application to prokaryotes. Here, using an improved poly(A)-independent single-cell RNA-sequencing protocol, we report the faithful capture of growth-dependent gene expression patterns in individual Salmonella and Pseudomonas bacteria across all RNA classes and genomic regions. These transcriptomes provide important reference points for single-cell RNA-sequencing of other bacterial species, mixed microbial communities and host-pathogen interactions.",32807892,,10.1038/s41564-020-0774-1,69
PancrESS - a meta-analysis resource for understanding cell-type specific expression in the human pancreas,"Background:The human pancreas is composed of specialized cell types producing hormones and enzymes critical to human health. These specialized functions are the result of cell type-specific transcriptional programs which manifest in cell-specific gene expression. Understanding these programs is essential to developing therapies for pancreatic disorders. Transcription in the human pancreas has been widely studied by single-cell RNA technologies, however the diversity of protocols and analysis methods hinders their interpretability in the aggregate.Results:In this work, we perform a meta-analysis of pancreatic single-cell RNA sequencing data. We present a database for reference transcriptome abundances and cell-type specificity metrics. This database facilitates the identification and definition of marker genes within the pancreas. Additionally, we introduce a versatile tool which is freely available as an R package, and should permit integration into existing workflows. Our tool accepts count data files generated by widely-used single-cell gene expression platforms in their original format, eliminating an additional pre-formatting step. Although we designed it to calculate expression specificity of pancreas cell types, our tool is agnostic to the biological source of count data, extending its applicability to other biological systems.Conclusions:Our findings enhance the current understanding of expression specificity within the pancreas, surpassing previous work in terms of scope and detail. Furthermore, our database and tool enable researchers to perform similar calculations in diverse biological systems, expanding the applicability of marker gene identification and facilitating comparative analyses.",38238687,PMC10797729,10.1186/s12864-024-09964-y,0
Differential Network Analysis Reveals Regulatory Patterns in Neural Stem Cell Fate Decision,"Deciphering regulatory patterns of neural stem cell (NSC) differentiation with multiple stages is essential to understand NSC differentiation mechanisms. Recent single-cell transcriptome datasets became available at individual differentiation. However, a systematic and integrative analysis of multiple datasets at multiple temporal stages of NSC differentiation is lacking. In this study, we propose a new method integrating prior information to construct three gene regulatory networks at pair-wise stages of transcriptome and apply this method to investigate five NSC differentiation paths on four different single-cell transcriptome datasets. By constructing gene regulatory networks for each path, we delineate their regulatory patterns via differential topology and network diffusion analyses. We find 12 common differentially expressed genes among the five NSC differentiation paths, with one common regulatory pattern (Gsk3b_App_Cdk5) shared by all paths. The identified regulatory pattern, partly supported by previous experimental evidence, is essential to all differentiation paths, but it plays a different role in each path when regulating other genes. Together, our integrative analysis provides both common and specific regulatory mechanisms for each of the five NSC differentiation paths.",33439459,,10.1007/s12539-020-00415-2,1
A Targeted Multi-omic Analysis Approach Measures Protein Expression and Low-Abundance Transcripts on the Single-Cell Level,"High-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has become a frequently used tool to assess immune cell heterogeneity. Recently, the combined measurement of RNA and protein expression was developed, commonly known as cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing (CITE-seq). Acquisition of protein expression data along with transcriptome data resolves some of the limitations inherent to only assessing transcripts but also nearly doubles the sequencing read depth required per single cell. Furthermore, there is still a paucity of analysis tools to visualize combined transcript-protein datasets. Here, we describe a targeted transcriptomics approach that combines an analysis of over 400 genes with simultaneous measurement of over 40 proteins on 2 × 104cells in a single experiment. This targeted approach requires only about one-tenth of the read depth compared to a whole-transcriptome approach while retaining high sensitivity for low abundance transcripts. To analyze these multi-omic datasets, we adapted one-dimensional soli expression by nonlinear stochastic embedding (One-SENSE) for intuitive visualization of protein-transcript relationships on a single-cell level.",32268080,PMC7224638,10.1016/j.celrep.2020.03.063,48

Maximizing the Utility of Transcriptomics Data in Inflammatory Skin Diseases,"Inflammatory skin diseases are induced by disorders of the host defense system of the skin, which is composed of a barrier, innate and acquired immunity, as well as the cutaneous microbiome. These disorders are characterized by recurrent cutaneous lesions and intense itch, which seriously affecting life quality of people across all ages and ethnicities. To elucidate molecular factors for typical inflammatory skin diseases (such as psoriasis and atopic dermatitis), transcriptomic profiling assays have been largely performed. Additionally, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) as well as spatial transcriptomic profiling have revealed multiple potential translational targets and offered guides to improve diagnosis and treatment strategies for inflammatory skin diseases. High-throughput transcriptomics data has shown unprecedented power to disclose the complex pathophysiology of inflammatory skin diseases.

scESI: evolutionary sparse imputation for single-cell transcriptomes from nearest neighbor cells,"The ubiquitous dropout problem in single-cell RNA sequencing technology causes a large amount of data noise in the gene expression profile. For this reason, we propose an evolutionary sparse imputation (ESI) algorithm for single-cell transcriptomes, which constructs a sparse representation model based on gene regulation relationships between cells. To solve this model, we design an optimization framework based on nondominated sorting genetics. This framework takes into account the topological relationship between cells and the variety of gene expression to iteratively search the global optimal solution, thereby learning the Pareto optimal cell-cell affinity matrix. Finally, we use the learned sparse relationship model between cells to improve data quality and reduce data noise. In simulated datasets, scESI performed significantly better than benchmark methods with various metrics. By applying scESI to real scRNA-seq datasets, we discovered scESI can not only further classify the cell types and separate cells in visualization successfully but also improve the performance in reconstructing trajectories differentiation and identifying differentially expressed genes. In addition, scESI successfully recovered the expression trends of marker genes in stem cell differentiation and can discover new cell types and putative pathways regulating biological processes.",35512331,,10.1093/bib/bbac144,3
CIRI-Deep Enables Single-Cell and Spatial Transcriptomic Analysis of Circular RNAs with Deep Learning,"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a crucial yet relatively unexplored class of transcripts known for their tissue- and cell-type-specific expression patterns. Despite the advances in single-cell and spatial transcriptomics, these technologies face difficulties in effectively profiling circRNAs due to inherent limitations in circRNA sequencing efficiency. To address this gap, a deep learning model, CIRI-deep, is presented for comprehensive prediction of circRNA regulation on diverse types of RNA-seq data. CIRI-deep is trained on an extensive dataset of 25 million high-confidence circRNA regulation events and achieved high performances on both test and leave-out data, ensuring its accuracy in inferring differential events from RNA-seq data. It is demonstrated that CIRI-deep and its adapted version enable various circRNA analyses, including cluster- or region-specific circRNA detection, BSJ ratio map visualization, and trans and cis feature importance evaluation. Collectively, CIRI-deep's adaptability extends to all major types of RNA-seq datasets including single-cell and spatial transcriptomic data, which will undoubtedly broaden the horizons of circRNA research.",38308181,PMC11005702,10.1002/advs.202308115,1
Concordance of MERFISH spatial transcriptomics with bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing,"Spatial transcriptomics extends single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) by providing spatial context for cell type identification and analysis. Imaging-based spatial technologies such as multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH) can achieve single-cell resolution, directly mapping single-cell identities to spatial positions. MERFISH produces a different data type than scRNA-seq, and a technical comparison between the two modalities is necessary to ascertain how to best integrate them. We performed MERFISH on the mouse liver and kidney and compared the resulting bulk and single-cell RNA statistics with those from the Tabula Muris Senis cell atlas and from two Visium datasets. MERFISH quantitatively reproduced the bulk RNA-seq and scRNA-seq results with improvements in overall dropout rates and sensitivity. Finally, we found that MERFISH independently resolved distinct cell types and spatial structure in both the liver and kidney. Computational integration with the Tabula Muris Senis atlas did not enhance these results. We conclude that MERFISH provides a quantitatively comparable method for single-cell gene expression and can identify cell types without the need for computational integration with scRNA-seq atlases.",36526371,PMC9760489,10.26508/lsa.202201701,20
Temporal transcriptomic analysis using TrendCatcher identifies early and persistent neutrophil activation in severe COVID-19,"Studying temporal gene expression shifts during disease progression provides important insights into the biological mechanisms that distinguish adaptive and maladaptive responses. Existing tools for the analysis of time course transcriptomic data are not designed to optimally identify distinct temporal patterns when analyzing dynamic differentially expressed genes (DDEGs). Moreover, there are not enough methods to assess and visualize the temporal progression of biological pathways mapped from time course transcriptomic data sets. In this study, we developed an open-source R package TrendCatcher (https://github.com/jaleesr/TrendCatcher), which applies the smoothing spline ANOVA model and break point searching strategy, to identify and visualize distinct dynamic transcriptional gene signatures and biological processes from longitudinal data sets. We used TrendCatcher to perform a systematic temporal analysis of COVID-19 peripheral blood transcriptomes, including bulk and single-cell RNA-Seq time course data. TrendCatcher uncovered the early and persistent activation of neutrophils and coagulation pathways, as well as impaired type I IFN (IFN-I) signaling in circulating cells as a hallmark of patients who progressed to severe COVID-19, whereas no such patterns were identified in individuals receiving SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations or patients with mild COVID-19. These results underscore the importance of systematic temporal analysis to identify early biomarkers and possible pathogenic therapeutic targets.",35175937,PMC9057597,10.1172/jci.insight.157255,5
DevOmics: an integrated multi-omics database of human and mouse early embryo,"Transcriptomic and epigenetic alterations during early embryo development have been proven to play essential roles in regulating the cell fate. Nowadays, advances in single-cell transcriptomics and epigenomics profiling techniques provide large volumes of data for understanding the molecular regulatory mechanisms in early embryos and facilitate the investigation of assisted reproductive technology as well as preimplantation genetic testing. However, the lack of integrated data collection and unified analytic procedures greatly limits their usage in scientific research and clinical application. Hence, it is necessary to establish a database integrating the regulatory information of human and mouse early embryos with unified analytic procedures. Here, we introduce DevOmics (http://devomics.cn/), which contains normalized gene expression, DNA methylation, histone modifications (H3K4me3, H3K9me3, H3K27me3, H3K27ac), chromatin accessibility and 3D chromatin architecture profiles of human and mouse early embryos spanning six developmental stages (zygote, 2cell, 4cell, 8cell, morula and blastocyst (ICM, TE)). The current version of DevOmics provides Search and Advanced Search for retrieving genes a researcher is interested in, Analysis Tools including the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) analysis for acquiring DEGs between different types of samples, allelic explorer for displaying allele-specific gene expression as well as epigenetic modifications and correlation analysis for showing the dynamic changes in different layers of data across developmental stages, as well as Genome Browser and Ortholog for visualization.

ICELLNET v2: a versatile method for cell-cell communication analysis from human transcriptomic data,"Summary:Several methods have been developed in the past years to infer cell-cell communication networks from transcriptomic data based on ligand and receptor expression. Among them, ICELLNET is one of the few approaches to consider the multiple subunits of ligands and receptors complexes to infer and quantify cell communication. In here, we present a major update of ICELLNET. As compared to its original implementation, we (i) drastically expanded the ICELLNET ligand-receptor database from 380 to 1669 biologically curated interactions, (ii) integrated important families of communication molecules involved in immune crosstalk, cell adhesion, and Wnt pathway, (iii) optimized ICELLNET framework for single-cell RNA sequencing data analyses, (iv) provided new visualizations of cell-cell communication results to facilitate prioritization and biological interpretation. This update will broaden the use of ICELLNET by the scientific community in different biological fields.Availability and implementation:ICELLNET package is implemented in R.

Comparison of Single Cell Transcriptome Sequencing Methods: Of Mice and Men,"Single cell RNAseq has been a big leap in many areas of biology. Rather than investigating gene expression on a whole organism level, this technology enables scientists to get a detailed look at rare single cells or within their cell population of interest. The field is growing, and many new methods appear each year. We compared methods utilized in our core facility: Smart-seq3, PlexWell, FLASH-seq, VASA-seq, SORT-seq, 10X, Evercode, and HIVE. We characterized the equipment requirements for each method. We evaluated the performances of these methods based on detected features, transcriptome diversity, mitochondrial RNA abundance and multiplets, among others and benchmarked them against bulk RNA sequencing. Here, we show that bulk transcriptome detects more unique transcripts than any single cell method. While most methods are comparable in many regards, FLASH-seq and VASA-seq yielded the best metrics, e.g., in number of features. If no equipment for automation is available or many cells are desired, then HIVE or 10X yield good results. In general, more recently developed methods perform better. This also leads to the conclusion that older methods should be phased out, and that the development of single cell RNAseq methods is still progressing considerably.",38137048,PMC10743076,10.3390/genes14122226,0
Biology-inspired data-driven quality control for scientific discovery in single-cell transcriptomics,"Background:Quality control (QC) of cells, a critical first step in single-cell RNA sequencing data analysis, has largely relied on arbitrarily fixed data-agnostic thresholds applied to QC metrics such as gene complexity and fraction of reads mapping to mitochondrial genes. The few existing data-driven approaches perform QC at the level of samples or studies without accounting for biological variation.Results:We first demonstrate that QC metrics vary with both tissue and cell types across technologies, study conditions, and species. We then propose data-driven QC (ddqc), an unsupervised adaptive QC framework to perform flexible and data-driven QC at the level of cell types while retaining critical biological insights and improved power for downstream analysis. ddqc applies an adaptive threshold based on the median absolute deviation on four QC metrics (gene and UMI complexity, fraction of reads mapping to mitochondrial and ribosomal genes). ddqc retains over a third more cells when compared to conventional data-agnostic QC filters. Finally, we show that ddqc recovers biologically meaningful trends in gradation of gene complexity among cell types that can help answer questions of biological interest such as which cell types express the least and most number of transcripts overall, and ribosomal transcripts specifically.Conclusions:ddqc retains cell types such as metabolically active parenchymal cells and specialized cells such as neutrophils which are often lost by conventional QC. Taken together, our work proposes a revised paradigm to quality filtering best practices-iterative QC, providing a data-driven QC framework compatible with observed biological diversity.",36575523,PMC9793662,10.1186/s13059-022-02820-w,5
Single-cell transcriptome analysis reveals the effectiveness of cytokine priming irrespective of heterogeneity in mesenchymal stromal cells,"Background aims:Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are recognized as a potential cell-based therapy for regenerative medicine. Short-term inflammatory cytokine pre-stimulation (cytokine priming) is a promising approach to enhance regenerative efficacy of MSCs. However, it is unclear whether their intrinsic heterogenic nature causes an unequal response to cytokine priming, which might blunt the accessibility of clinical applications.Methods:In this study, by analyzing the single-cell transcriptomic landscape of human bone marrow MSCs from a naïve to cytokine-primed state, we elucidated the potential mechanism of superior therapeutic potential in cytokine-primed MSCs.Results:We found that cytokine-primed MSCs had a distinct transcriptome landscape. Although substantial heterogeneity was identified within the population in both naïve and primed states, cytokine priming enhanced the several characteristics of MSCs associated with therapeutic efficacy irrespective of heterogeneity. After cytokine-priming, all sub-clusters of MSCs possessed high levels of immunoregulatory molecules, trophic factors, stemness-related genes, anti-apoptosis markers and low levels of multi-lineage and senescence signatures, which are critical for their therapeutic potency.Conclusions:In conclusion, our results provide new insights into MSC heterogeneity under cytokine stimulation and suggest that cytokine priming reprogrammed MSCs independent of heterogeneity.",37715776,,10.1016/j.jcyt.2023.08.006,0
OralExplorer: a web server for exploring the mechanisms of oral inflammatory diseases,"Background:Oral inflammatory diseases are localized infectious diseases primarily caused by oral pathogens with the potential for serious systemic complications. However, publicly available datasets for these diseases are underutilized. To address this issue, a web tool called OralExplorer was developed. This tool integrates the available data and provides comprehensive online bioinformatic analysis.Methods:Human oral inflammatory disease-related datasets were obtained from the GEO database and normalized using a standardized process. Transcriptome data were then subjected to differential gene expression analysis, immune infiltration analysis, correlation analysis, pathway enrichment analysis, and visualization. The single-cell sequencing data was visualized as cluster plot, feature plot, and heatmaps. The web platform was primarily built using Shiny. The biomarkers identified in OralExplorer were validated using local clinical samples through qPCR and IHC.Results:A total of 35 human oral inflammatory disease-related datasets, covering 6 main disease types and 901 samples, were included in the study to identify potential molecular signatures of the mechanisms of oral diseases. OralExplorer consists of 5 main analysis modules (differential gene expression analysis, immune infiltration analysis, correlation analysis, pathway enrichment analysis and single-cell analysis), with multiple visualization options. The platform offers a simple and intuitive interface, high-quality images for visualization, and detailed analysis results tables for easy access by users. Six markers (IL1β, SRGN, CXCR1, FGR, ARHGEF2, and PTAFR) were identified by OralExplorer. qPCR- and IHC-based experimental validation showed significantly higher levels of these genes in the periodontitis group.Conclusions:OralExplorer is a comprehensive analytical platform for oral inflammatory diseases. It allows users to interactively explore the molecular mechanisms underlying the action and regression of these diseases. It also aids dental researchers in unlocking the potential value of transcriptomics data related to oral diseases.

CiteFuse enables multi-modal analysis of CITE-seq data,"Motivation:Multi-modal profiling of single cells represents one of the latest technological advancements in molecular biology. Among various single-cell multi-modal strategies, cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing (CITE-seq) allows simultaneous quantification of two distinct species: RNA and cell-surface proteins. Here, we introduce CiteFuse, a streamlined package consisting of a suite of tools for doublet detection, modality integration, clustering, differential RNA and protein expression analysis, antibody-derived tag evaluation, ligand-receptor interaction analysis and interactive web-based visualization of CITE-seq data.Results:We demonstrate the capacity of CiteFuse to integrate the two data modalities and its relative advantage against data generated from single-modality profiling using both simulations and real-world CITE-seq data. Furthermore, we illustrate a novel doublet detection method based on a combined index of cell hashing and transcriptome data. Finally, we demonstrate CiteFuse for predicting ligand-receptor interactions by using multi-modal CITE-seq data. Collectively, we demonstrate the utility and effectiveness of CiteFuse for the integrative analysis of transcriptome and epitope profiles from CITE-seq data.Availability and implementation:CiteFuse is freely available at http://shiny.maths.usyd.edu.au/CiteFuse/ as an online web service and at https://github.com/SydneyBioX/CiteFuse/ as an R package.Contact:pengyi.yang@sydney.edu.au.Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",32353146,,10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa282,42
Multi-View Clustering With Graph Learning for scRNA-Seq Data,"Advances in single-cell biotechnologies have generated the single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of gene expression profiles at cell levels, providing an opportunity to study cellular distribution. Although significant efforts developed in their analysis, many problems remain in studying cell types distribution because of the heterogeneity, high dimensionality, and noise of scRNA-seq. In this study, a multi-view clustering with graph learning algorithm (MCGL) for scRNA-seq data is proposed, which consists of multi-view learning, graph learning, and cell type clustering. In order to avoid a single feature space of scRNA-seq being inadequate to comprehensively characterize the functions of cells, MCGL constructs the multiple feature spaces and utilizes multi-view learning to comprehensively characterize scRNA-seq data from different perspectives. MCGL adaptively learns the similarity graphs of cells that overcome the dependence on fixed similarity, transforming scRNA-seq analysis into the analysis of multi-view clustering. MCGL decomposes the networks of cells into view-specific and common networks in multi-view learning, which better characterizes the topological relationship of cells. MCGL simultaneously utilizes multiple types of cell-cell networks and fully exploits the connection relationship between cells through the complementarity between networks to improve clustering performance. The graph learning, graph factorization, and cell-type clustering processes are accomplished simultaneously under one optimization framework. The performance of the MCGL algorithm is validated with ten scRNA-seq datasets from different scales, and experimental results imply that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms fourteen state-of-the-art scRNA-seq algorithms.",37486829,,10.1109/TCBB.2023.3298334,0
scWECTA: A weighted ensemble classification framework for cell type assignment based on single cell transcriptome,"Rapid advances in single-cell transcriptome analysis provide deeper insights into the study of tissue heterogeneity at the cellular level. Unsupervised clustering can identify potential cell populations in single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, but fail to further determine the identity of each cell. Existing automatic annotation methods using scRNA-seq data based on machine learning mainly use single feature set and single classifier. In view of this, we propose a Weighted Ensemble classification framework for Cell Type Annotation, named scWECTA, which improves the accuracy of cell type identification. scWECTA uses five informative gene sets and integrates five classifiers based on soft weighted ensemble framework. And the ensemble weights are inferred through the constrained non-negative least squares. Validated on multiple pairs of scRNA-seq datasets, scWECTA is able to accurately annotate scRNA-seq data across platforms and across tissues, especially for imbalanced data containing rare cell types. Moreover, scWECTA outperforms other comparable methods in balancing the prediction accuracy of common cell types and the unassigned rate of non-common cell types at the same time.

SCA: recovering single-cell heterogeneity through information-based dimensionality reduction,"Dimensionality reduction summarizes the complex transcriptomic landscape of single-cell datasets for downstream analyses. Current approaches favor large cellular populations defined by many genes, at the expense of smaller and more subtly defined populations. Here, we present surprisal component analysis (SCA), a technique that newly leverages the information-theoretic notion of surprisal for dimensionality reduction to promote more meaningful signal extraction. For example, SCA uncovers clinically important cytotoxic T-cell subpopulations that are indistinguishable using existing pipelines. We also demonstrate that SCA substantially improves downstream imputation. SCA's efficient information-theoretic paradigm has broad applications to the study of complex biological tissues in health and disease.",37626411,PMC10464206,10.1186/s13059-023-02998-7,1
PseudoGA: cell pseudotime reconstruction based on genetic algorithm,"Dynamic regulation of gene expression is often governed by progression through transient cell states. Bulk RNA-seq analysis can only detect average change in expression levels and is unable to identify this dynamics. Single cell RNA-seq presents an unprecedented opportunity that helps in placing the cells on a hypothetical time trajectory that reflects gradual transition of their transcriptomes. This continuum trajectory or 'pseudotime', may reveal the developmental pathway and provide us with information on dynamic transcriptomic changes and other biological processes. Existing approaches to build pseudotime heavily depend on reducing huge dimension to extremely low dimensional subspaces and may lead to loss of information. We propose PseudoGA, a genetic algorithm based approach to order cells assuming that gene expressions vary according to a smooth curve along the pseudotime trajectory. We observe superior accuracy of our method in simulated as well as benchmarking real datasets. Generality of the assumption behind PseudoGA and no dependence on dimensionality reduction technique make it a robust choice for pseudotime estimation from single cell transcriptome data. PseudoGA is also time efficient when applied to a large single cell RNA-seq data and adaptable to parallel computing. R code for PseudoGA is freely available at https://github.com/indranillab/pseudoga.",34244782,PMC8661435,10.1093/nar/gkab457,3
Computer vision for image-based transcriptomics,"Single-cell transcriptomics has recently emerged as one of the most promising tools for understanding the diversity of the transcriptome among single cells. Image-based transcriptomics is unique compared to other methods as it does not require conversion of RNA to cDNA prior to signal amplification and transcript quantification. Thus, its efficiency in transcript detection is unmatched by other methods. In addition, image-based transcriptomics allows the study of the spatial organization of the transcriptome in single cells at single-molecule, and, when combined with superresolution microscopy, nanometer resolution. However, in order to unlock the full power of image-based transcriptomics, robust computer vision of single molecules and cells is required. Here, we shortly discuss the setup of the experimental pipeline for image-based transcriptomics, and then describe in detail the algorithms that we developed to extract, at high-throughput, robust multivariate feature sets of transcript molecule abundance, localization and patterning in tens of thousands of single cells across the transcriptome. These computer vision algorithms and pipelines can be downloaded from: https://github.com/pelkmanslab/ImageBasedTranscriptomics.",26014038,,10.1016/j.ymeth.2015.05.016,16
OrganoidDB: a comprehensive organoid database for the multi-perspective exploration of bulk and single-cell transcriptomic profiles of organoids,"Organoids, three-dimensional in vitro tissue cultures derived from pluripotent (embryonic or induced) or adult stem cells, are promising models for the study of human processes and structures, disease onset and preclinical drug development. An increasing amount of omics data has been generated for organoid studies. Here, we introduce OrganoidDB (http://www.inbirg.com/organoid_db/), a comprehensive resource for the multi-perspective exploration of the transcriptomes of organoids. The current release of OrganoidDB includes curated bulk and single-cell transcriptome profiles of 16 218 organoid samples from both human and mouse. Other types of samples, such as primary tissue and cell line samples, are also integrated to enable comparisons with organoids. OrganoidDB enables queries of gene expression under different modes, e.g. across different organoid types, between different organoids from different sources or protocols, between organoids and other sample types, across different development stages, and via correlation analysis. Datasets and organoid samples can also be browsed for detailed information, including organoid information, differentially expressed genes, enriched pathways and single-cell clustering. OrganoidDB will facilitate a better understanding of organoids and help improve organoid culture protocols to yield organoids that are highly similar to living organs in terms of composition, architecture and function.",36271792,PMC9825539,10.1093/nar/gkac942,3
Very Low Abundance Single-Cell Transcript Quantification with 5-Plex ddPCRTMAssays,"Gene expression studies have provided one of the most accessible windows for understanding the molecular basis of cell and tissue phenotypes and how these change in response to stimuli. Current PCR-based and next generation sequencing methods offer great versatility in allowing the focused study of the roles of small numbers of genes or comprehensive profiling of the entire transcriptome of a sample at one time. Marrying of these approaches to various cell sorting technologies has recently enabled the profiling of expression in single cells, thereby increasing the resolution and sensitivity and strengthening the inferences from observed expression levels and changes. This chapter presents a quick and efficient 1-day workflow for sorting single cells with a small laboratory cell-sorter followed by an ultrahigh sensitivity, multiplexed digital PCR method for quantitative tracking of changes in 5-10 genes per single cell.",29717457,,10.1007/978-1-4939-7778-9_24,0
scEpath: energy landscape-based inference of transition probabilities and cellular trajectories from single-cell transcriptomic data,"Motivation:Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) offers unprecedented resolution for studying cellular decision-making processes. Robust inference of cell state transition paths and probabilities is an important yet challenging step in the analysis of these data.Results:Here we present scEpath, an algorithm that calculates energy landscapes and probabilistic directed graphs in order to reconstruct developmental trajectories. We quantify the energy landscape using 'single-cell energy' and distance-based measures, and find that the combination of these enables robust inference of the transition probabilities and lineage relationships between cell states. We also identify marker genes and gene expression patterns associated with cell state transitions. Our approach produces pseudotemporal orderings that are-in combination-more robust and accurate than current methods, and offers higher resolution dynamics of the cell state transitions, leading to new insight into key transition events during differentiation and development. Moreover, scEpath is robust to variation in the size of the input gene set, and is broadly unsupervised, requiring few parameters to be set by the user. Applications of scEpath led to the identification of a cell-cell communication network implicated in early human embryo development, and novel transcription factors important for myoblast differentiation. scEpath allows us to identify common and specific temporal dynamics and transcriptional factor programs along branched lineages, as well as the transition probabilities that control cell fates.Availability and implementation:A MATLAB package of scEpath is available at https://github.com/sqjin/scEpath.Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",29415263,PMC6658715,10.1093/bioinformatics/bty058,48
scBOL: a universal cell type identification framework for single-cell and spatial transcriptomics data,"Motivation:Over the past decade, single-cell transcriptomic technologies have experienced remarkable advancements, enabling the simultaneous profiling of gene expressions across thousands of individual cells. Cell type identification plays an essential role in exploring tissue heterogeneity and characterizing cell state differences. With more and more well-annotated reference data becoming available, massive automatic identification methods have sprung up to simplify the annotation process on unlabeled target data by transferring the cell type knowledge. However, in practice, the target data often include some novel cell types that are not in the reference data. Most existing works usually classify these private cells as one generic 'unassigned' group and learn the features of known and novel cell types in a coupled way. They are susceptible to the potential batch effects and fail to explore the fine-grained semantic knowledge of novel cell types, thus hurting the model's discrimination ability. Additionally, emerging spatial transcriptomic technologies, such as in situ hybridization, sequencing and multiplexed imaging, present a novel challenge to current cell type identification strategies that predominantly neglect spatial organization. Consequently, it is imperative to develop a versatile method that can proficiently annotate single-cell transcriptomics data, encompassing both spatial and non-spatial dimensions.Results:To address these issues, we propose a new, challenging yet realistic task called universal cell type identification for single-cell and spatial transcriptomics data. In this task, we aim to give semantic labels to target cells from known cell types and cluster labels to those from novel ones. To tackle this problem, instead of designing a suboptimal two-stage approach, we propose an end-to-end algorithm called scBOL from the perspective of Bipartite prototype alignment. Firstly, we identify the mutual nearest clusters in reference and target data as their potential common cell types. On this basis, we mine the cycle-consistent semantic anchor cells to build the intrinsic structure association between two data. Secondly, we design a neighbor-aware prototypical learning paradigm to strengthen the inter-cluster separability and intra-cluster compactness within each data, thereby inspiring the discriminative feature representations. Thirdly, driven by the semantic-aware prototypical learning framework, we can align the known cell types and separate the private cell types from them among reference and target data. Such an algorithm can be seamlessly applied to various data types modeled by different foundation models that can generate the embedding features for cells. Specifically, for non-spatial single-cell transcriptomics data, we use the autoencoder neural network to learn latent low-dimensional cell representations, and for spatial single-cell transcriptomics data, we apply the graph convolution network to capture molecular and spatial similarities of cells jointly. Extensive results on our carefully designed evaluation benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of scBOL over various state-of-the-art cell type identification methods. To our knowledge, we are the pioneers in presenting this pragmatic annotation task, as well as in devising a comprehensive algorithmic framework aimed at resolving this challenge across varied types of single-cell data. Finally, scBOL is implemented in Python using the Pytorch machine-learning library, and it is freely available at https://github.com/aimeeyaoyao/scBOL.",38678389,PMC11056022,10.1093/bib/bbae188,0
scMatch: a single-cell gene expression profile annotation tool using reference datasets,"Motivation:Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) measures gene expression at the resolution of individual cells. Massively multiplexed single-cell profiling has enabled large-scale transcriptional analyses of thousands of cells in complex tissues. In most cases, the true identity of individual cells is unknown and needs to be inferred from the transcriptomic data. Existing methods typically cluster (group) cells based on similarities of their gene expression profiles and assign the same identity to all cells within each cluster using the averaged expression levels. However, scRNA-seq experiments typically produce low-coverage sequencing data for each cell, which hinders the clustering process.Results:We introduce scMatch, which directly annotates single cells by identifying their closest match in large reference datasets. We used this strategy to annotate various single-cell datasets and evaluated the impacts of sequencing depth, similarity metric and reference datasets. We found that scMatch can rapidly and robustly annotate single cells with comparable accuracy to another recent cell annotation tool (SingleR), but that it is quicker and can handle larger reference datasets. We demonstrate how scMatch can handle large customized reference gene expression profiles that combine data from multiple sources, thus empowering researchers to identify cell populations in any complex tissue with the desired precision.Availability and implementation:scMatch (Python code) and the FANTOM5 reference dataset are freely available to the research community here https://github.com/forrest-lab/scMatch.Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",31028376,PMC6853649,10.1093/bioinformatics/btz292,47
Simultaneous Quantification of Single-Cell Proteomes and Transcriptomes in Integrated Fluidic Circuits,"Understanding the principles of gene regulation at single-cell resolution would require measurement and integration of multiple methods such as DNA mutation profiling, open chromatin profiling, RNA expression, protein quantification, and DNA methylation. Recent developments in single-cell multi-omic technologies have enabled integration of these modes in various combinations.With the advent of RNA expression and protein sequencing assay (REAP-seq), researchers can simultaneously analyze protein and gene expression within the same cell. In REAP-seq , cells are labeled with antibodies conjugated to unique DNA sequences. A barcode of 8 nucleotides can allow up to 65,536 unique barcodes for multiplex analysis of proteins, circumventing the limitations of fluorescence (~17 targets). Here, we describe the implementation of REAP-seq assay in the Fluidigm®C1™ mRNA Seq HT (high-throughput) v2 system.",34766275,,10.1007/978-1-0716-1771-7_15,1
Improving the performance of single-cell RNA-seq data mining based on relative expression orderings,"The advent of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides an unprecedented opportunity to explore gene expression profiles at the single-cell level. However, gene expression values vary over time and under different conditions even within the same cell. There is an urgent need for more stable and reliable feature variables at the single-cell level to depict cell heterogeneity. Thus, we construct a new feature matrix called the delta rank matrix (DRM) from scRNA-seq data by integrating an a priori gene interaction network, which transforms the unreliable gene expression value into a stable gene interaction/edge value on a single-cell basis. This is the first time that a gene-level feature has been transformed into an interaction/edge-level for scRNA-seq data analysis based on relative expression orderings. Experiments on various scRNA-seq datasets have demonstrated that DRM performs better than the original gene expression matrix in cell clustering, cell identification and pseudo-trajectory reconstruction. More importantly, the DRM really achieves the fusion of gene expressions and gene interactions and provides a method of measuring gene interactions at the single-cell level. Thus, the DRM can be used to find changes in gene interactions among different cell types, which may open up a new way to analyze scRNA-seq data from an interaction perspective. In addition, DRM provides a new method to construct a cell-specific network for each single cell instead of a group of cells as in traditional network construction methods. DRM's exceptional performance is due to its extraction of rich gene-association information on biological systems and stable characterization of cells.",36528803,PMC9851298,10.1093/bib/bbac556,0
The Conjugation of Antibodies for the Simultaneous Detection of Surface Proteins and Transcriptome Analysis at a Single-Cell Level,"Transcriptome analysis at a single-cell level with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a powerful method for detailed characterization of heterogeneous cell populations.

The need to reassess single-cell RNA sequencing datasets: the importance of biological sample processing,"Background:The advent of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) and additional single-cell omics technologies have provided scientists with unprecedented tools to explore biology at cellular resolution. However, reaching an appropriate number of good quality reads per cell and reasonable numbers of cells within each of the populations of interest are key to infer relevant conclusions about the underlying biology of the dataset. For these reasons, scRNAseq studies are constantly increasing the number of cells analysed and the granularity of the resultant transcriptomics analyses.Methods:We aimed to identify previously described fibroblast subpopulations in healthy adult human skin by using the largest dataset published to date (528,253 sequenced cells) and an unsupervised population-matching algorithm.Results:Our reanalysis of this landmark resource demonstrates that a substantial proportion of cell transcriptomic signatures may be biased by cellular stress and response to hypoxic conditions.Conclusions:We postulate that careful design of experimental conditions is needed to avoid long processing times of biological samples. Additionally, computation of large datasets might undermine the extent of the analysis, possibly due to long processing times.",35399227,PMC8984215,10.12688/f1000research.54864.2,6
ICAT: a novel algorithm to robustly identify cell states following perturbations in single-cell transcriptomes,"Motivation:The detection of distinct cellular identities is central to the analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) experiments. However, in perturbation experiments, current methods typically fail to correctly match cell states between conditions or erroneously remove population substructure. Here, we present the novel, unsupervised algorithm Identify Cell states Across Treatments (ICAT) that employs self-supervised feature weighting and control-guided clustering to accurately resolve cell states across heterogeneous conditions.Results:Using simulated and real datasets, we show ICAT is superior in identifying and resolving cell states compared with current integration workflows. While requiring no a priori knowledge of extant cell states or discriminatory marker genes, ICAT is robust to low signal strength, high perturbation severity, and disparate cell type proportions. We empirically validate ICAT in a developmental model and find that only ICAT identifies a perturbation-unique cellular response. Taken together, our results demonstrate that ICAT offers a significant improvement in defining cellular responses to perturbation in scRNA-seq data.Availability and implementation:https://github.com/BradhamLab/icat.",37086439,PMC10172037,10.1093/bioinformatics/btad278,1
Network inference with Granger causality ensembles on single-cell transcriptomics,"Cellular gene expression changes throughout a dynamic biological process, such as differentiation. Pseudotimes estimate cells' progress along a dynamic process based on their individual gene expression states. Ordering the expression data by pseudotime provides information about the underlying regulator-gene interactions. Because the pseudotime distribution is not uniform, many standard mathematical methods are inapplicable for analyzing the ordered gene expression states. Here we present single-cell inference of networks using Granger ensembles (SINGE), an algorithm for gene regulatory network inference from ordered single-cell gene expression data. SINGE uses kernel-based Granger causality regression to smooth irregular pseudotimes and missing expression values. It aggregates predictions from an ensemble of regression analyses to compile a ranked list of candidate interactions between transcriptional regulators and target genes. In two mouse embryonic stem cell differentiation datasets, SINGE outperforms other contemporary algorithms. However, a more detailed examination reveals caveats about poor performance for individual regulators and uninformative pseudotimes.",35139376,PMC9093087,10.1016/j.celrep.2022.110333,43
Effective detection of variation in single-cell transcriptomes using MATQ-seq,"The quantification of transcriptional variation in single cells, particularly within the same cell population, is currently limited by the low sensitivity and high technical noise of single-cell RNA-seq assays. We report multiple annealing and dC-tailing-based quantitative single-cell RNA-seq (MATQ-seq), a highly sensitive and quantitative method for single-cell sequencing of total RNA. By systematically determining technical noise, we show that MATQ-seq captures genuine biological variation between whole transcriptomes of single cells.",28092691,,10.1038/nmeth.4145,104
SPANN: annotating single-cell resolution spatial transcriptome data with scRNA-seq data,"Motivation:The rapid development of spatial transcriptome technologies has enabled researchers to acquire single-cell-level spatial data at an affordable price. However, computational analysis tools, such as annotation tools, tailored for these data are still lacking. Recently, many computational frameworks have emerged to integrate single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics datasets. While some frameworks can utilize well-annotated scRNA-seq data to annotate spatial expression patterns, they overlook critical aspects. First, existing tools do not explicitly consider cell type mapping when aligning the two modalities. Second, current frameworks lack the capability to detect novel cells, which remains a key interest for biologists.Results:To address these problems, we propose an annotation method for spatial transcriptome data called SPANN. The main tasks of SPANN are to transfer cell-type labels from well-annotated scRNA-seq data to newly generated single-cell resolution spatial transcriptome data and discover novel cells from spatial data. The major innovations of SPANN come from two aspects: SPANN automatically detects novel cells from unseen cell types while maintaining high annotation accuracy over known cell types. SPANN finds a mapping between spatial transcriptome samples and RNA data prototypes and thus conducts cell-type-level alignment. Comprehensive experiments using datasets from various spatial platforms demonstrate SPANN's capabilities in annotating known cell types and discovering novel cell states within complex tissue contexts.Availability:The source code of SPANN can be accessed at https://github.com/ddb-qiwang/SPANN-torch.Contact:dengmh@math.pku.edu.cn.",38279647,,10.1093/bib/bbad533,1
Variability of Gene Expression Identifies Transcriptional Regulators of Early Human Embryonic Development,"An analysis of gene expression variability can provide an insightful window into how regulatory control is distributed across the transcriptome. In a single cell analysis, the inter-cellular variability of gene expression measures the consistency of transcript copy numbers observed between cells in the same population. Application of these ideas to the study of early human embryonic development may reveal important insights into the transcriptional programs controlling this process, based on which components are most tightly regulated. Using a published single cell RNA-seq data set of human embryos collected at four-cell, eight-cell, morula and blastocyst stages, we identified genes with the most stable, invariant expression across all four developmental stages. Stably-expressed genes were found to be enriched for those sharing indispensable features, including essentiality, haploinsufficiency, and ubiquitous expression. The stable genes were less likely to be associated with loss-of-function variant genes or human recessive disease genes affected by a DNA copy number variant deletion, suggesting that stable genes have a functional impact on the regulation of some of the basic cellular processes. Genes with low expression variability at early stages of development are involved in regulation of DNA methylation, responses to hypoxia and telomerase activity, whereas by the blastocyst stage, low-variability genes are enriched for metabolic processes as well as telomerase signaling. Based on changes in expression variability, we identified a putative set of gene expression markers of morulae and blastocyst stages. Experimental validation of a blastocyst-expressed variability marker demonstrated that HDDC2 plays a role in the maintenance of pluripotency in human ES and iPS cells. Collectively our analyses identified new regulators involved in human embryonic development that would have otherwise been missed using methods that focus on assessment of the average expression levels; in doing so, we highlight the value of studying expression variability for single cell RNA-seq data.",26288249,PMC4546122,10.1371/journal.pgen.1005428,24
Single-cell RNA-seq transcriptome analysis of linear and circular RNAs in mouse preimplantation embryos,"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a new class of non-polyadenylated non-coding RNAs that may play important roles in many biological processes. Here we develop a single-cell universal poly(A)-independent RNA sequencing (SUPeR-seq) method to sequence both polyadenylated and non-polyadenylated RNAs from individual cells. This method exhibits robust sensitivity, precision and accuracy. We discover 2891 circRNAs and 913 novel linear transcripts in mouse preimplantation embryos and further analyze the abundance of circRNAs along development, the function of enriched genes, and sequence features of circRNAs. Our work is key to deciphering regulation mechanisms of circRNAs during mammalian early embryonic development.",26201400,PMC4511241,10.1186/s13059-015-0706-1,198
Single-cell transcriptome conservation in cryopreserved cells and tissues,"A variety of single-cell RNA preparation procedures have been described. So far, protocols require fresh material, which hinders complex study designs. We describe a sample preservation method that maintains transcripts in viable single cells, allowing one to disconnect time and place of sampling from subsequent processing steps. We sequence single-cell transcriptomes from >1000 fresh and cryopreserved cells using 3'-end and full-length RNA preparation methods. Our results confirm that the conservation process did not alter transcriptional profiles. This substantially broadens the scope of applications in single-cell transcriptomics and could lead to a paradigm shift in future study designs.",28249587,PMC5333448,10.1186/s13059-017-1171-9,87
Unveiling Hypothalamic Molecular Signatures via Retrograde Viral Tracing and Single-Cell Transcriptomics,"Despite the importance of hypothalamic neurocircuits in regulating homeostatic and survival-related behaviors, our understanding of the intrinsic molecular identities of neural components involved in these complex multi-synaptic interactions remains limited. In this study, we constructed a Cre recombinase-dependent pseudorabies virus (PRVs) capable of crossing synapses, coupled with transcriptome analysis of single upstream neurons post-infection. By utilizing this retrograde nuclear Connect-seq (nuConnect-seq) approach, we generated a single nuclei RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) dataset of 1,533 cells derived from the hypothalamus of CRH-IRES-Cre (CRH-Cre) mice. To ensure the technical validity of our nuConnect-seq dataset, we employed a label transfer technique against an integrated reference dataset of postnatal mouse hypothalamus comprising 152,524 QC-passed cells. The uniqueness of our approach lies in the integration of diverse datasets for validation, providing a more nuanced diversity of hypothalamic cell types. The presented validated dataset may deepen our understanding of hypothalamic neurocircuits and underscore the essential role of comprehensive integrated transcriptomic data for technical validity.",38049462,PMC10696032,10.1038/s41597-023-02789-6,0
Live Cell Genomics: Cell-Specific Transcriptome Capture in Live Tissues and Cells,"The sensitivity of new transcriptomic techniques is rapidly improving to the point that single-cell molecular analysis is now becoming commonplace. However to obtain accurate transcriptome data, the initial experimental steps must strive to maintain the natural environment of cell and always get set in motion under in vivo conditions. Achieving these critical experimental parameters is technically challenging for investigators and currently the most frequently used molecular techniques experimentally commence with tissues or cells in artificial environments or under in vitro conditions. Here we review an innovative experimental approach that is called transcriptome in vivo analysis (TIVA) that was designed to overcome theses well-known limitations. The TIVA methods permit cell-specific transcriptome capture from viable intact heterogeneous tissues. Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) are used to deliver multifunctional transcriptome-capture tags (TIVA tags) to the cytoplasm of the cell under in vivo conditions. The TIVA capture tag enables investigators to target and isolate cell-specific transcriptomes in their natural microenvironments. The combination of maintaining in vivo conditions and selective cell-specific transcriptome capture provides investigators with the opportunity to yield the most biologically accurate and informative transcriptome data hitherto.",26202288,,10.1007/978-1-4939-2806-4_30,3
Learning Consistency and Specificity of Cells From Single-Cell Multi-Omic Data,"Advancements in single-cell technologies concomitantly develop the epigenomic and transcriptomic profiles at the cell levels, providing opportunities to explore the potential biological mechanisms. Even though significant efforts have been dedicated to them, it remains challenging for the integration analysis of multi-omic data of single-cell because of the heterogeneity, complicated coupling and interpretability of data. To handle these issues, we propose a novel self-representation Learning-based Multi-omics data Integrative Clustering algorithm (sLMIC) for the integration of single-cell epigenomic profiles (DNA methylation or scATAC-seq) and transcriptomic (scRNA-seq), which the consistent and specific features of cells are explicitly extracted facilitating the cell clustering. Specifically, sLMIC constructs a graph for each type of single-cell data, thereby transforming omics data into multi-layer networks, which effectively removes heterogeneity of omic data. Then, sLMIC employs the low-rank and exclusivity constraints to separate the self-representation of cells into two parts, i.e., the shared and specific features, which explicitly characterize the consistency and diversity of omic data, providing an effective strategy to model the structure of cell types. Feature extraction and cell clustering are jointly formulated as an overall objective function, where latent features of data are obtained under the guidance of cell clustering. The extensive experimental results on 13 multi-omics datasets of single-cell from diverse organisms and tissues indicate that sLMIC observably exceeds the advanced algorithms regarding various measurements.",38709615,,10.1109/JBHI.2024.3370868,0
Characterization of transcript enrichment and detection bias in single-nucleus RNA-seq for mapping of distinct human adipocyte lineages,"Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables molecular characterization of complex biological tissues at high resolution. The requirement of single-cell extraction, however, makes it challenging for profiling tissues such as adipose tissue, for which collection of intact single adipocytes is complicated by their fragile nature. For such tissues, single-nucleus extraction is often much more efficient and therefore single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) presents an alternative to scRNA-seq. However, nuclear transcripts represent only a fraction of the transcriptome in a single cell, with snRNA-seq marked with inherent transcript enrichment and detection biases. Therefore, snRNA-seq may be inadequate for mapping important transcriptional signatures in adipose tissue. In this study, we compare the transcriptomic landscape of single nuclei isolated from preadipocytes and mature adipocytes across human white and brown adipocyte lineages, with whole-cell transcriptome. We show that snRNA-seq is capable of identifying the broad cell types present in scRNA-seq at all states of adipogenesis. However, we also explore how and why the nuclear transcriptome is biased and limited, as well as how it can be advantageous. We robustly characterize the enrichment of nuclear-localized transcripts and adipogenic regulatory lncRNAs in snRNA-seq, while also providing a detailed understanding for the preferential detection of long genes upon using this technique. To remove such technical detection biases, we propose a normalization strategy for a more accurate comparison of nuclear and cellular data. Finally, we show successful integration of scRNA-seq and snRNA-seq data sets with existing bioinformatic tools. Overall, our results illustrate the applicability of snRNA-seq for the characterization of cellular diversity in the adipose tissue.",35042723,PMC8805720,10.1101/gr.275509.121,27
STellaris: a web server for accurate spatial mapping of single cells based on spatial transcriptomics data,"Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides insights into gene expression heterogeneities in diverse cell types underlying homeostasis, development and pathological states. However, the loss of spatial information hinders its applications in deciphering spatially related features, such as cell-cell interactions in a spatial context. Here, we present STellaris (https://spatial.rhesusbase.com), a web server aimed to rapidly assign spatial information to scRNA-seq data based on their transcriptomic similarity with public spatial transcriptomics (ST) data. STellaris is founded on 101 manually curated ST datasets comprising 823 sections across different organs, developmental stages and pathological states from humans and mice. STellaris accepts raw count matrix and cell type annotation of scRNA-seq data as the input, and maps single cells to spatial locations in the tissue architecture of properly matched ST section. Spatially resolved information for intercellular communications, such as spatial distance and ligand-receptor interactions (LRIs), are further characterized between annotated cell types. Moreover, we also expanded the application of STellaris in spatial annotation of multiple regulatory levels with single-cell multiomics data, using the transcriptome as a bridge. STellaris was applied to several case studies to showcase its utility of adding value to the ever-growing scRNA-seq data from a spatial perspective.",37224539,PMC10320151,10.1093/nar/gkad419,3
Protocols for single-cell RNA-seq and spatial gene expression integration and interactive visualization,"There is a wealth of software that utilizes single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data to deconvolve spatial transcriptomic spots, which currently are not yet at single-cell resolution. Here we provide protocols for implementing Seurat and Giotto packages to elucidate cell-type distribution in our example human ureter scRNA-seq dataset. We also describe how to create a stand-alone interactive web application using Seurat libraries to visualize and share our results. For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to Fink et al. (2022).1.",36853708,PMC9871342,10.1016/j.xpro.2023.102047,0
ZINBMM: a general mixture model for simultaneous clustering and gene selection using single-cell transcriptomic data,"Clustering is a critical component of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data analysis and can help reveal cell types and infer cell lineages. Despite considerable successes, there are few methods tailored to investigating cluster-specific genes contributing to cell heterogeneity, which can promote biological understanding of cell heterogeneity. In this study, we propose a zero-inflated negative binomial mixture model (ZINBMM) that simultaneously achieves effective scRNA-seq data clustering and gene selection. ZINBMM conducts a systemic analysis on raw counts, accommodating both batch effects and dropout events. Simulations and the analysis of five scRNA-seq datasets demonstrate the practical applicability of ZINBMM.",37697330,PMC10496184,10.1186/s13059-023-03046-0,0
Batch alignment of single-cell transcriptomics data using deep metric learning,"scRNA-seq has uncovered previously unappreciated levels of heterogeneity. With the increasing scale of scRNA-seq studies, the major challenge is correcting batch effect and accurately detecting the number of cell types, which is inevitable in human studies. The majority of scRNA-seq algorithms have been specifically designed to remove batch effect firstly and then conduct clustering, which may miss some rare cell types. Here we develop scDML, a deep metric learning model to remove batch effect in scRNA-seq data, guided by the initial clusters and the nearest neighbor information intra and inter batches. Comprehensive evaluations spanning different species and tissues demonstrated that scDML can remove batch effect, improve clustering performance, accurately recover true cell types and consistently outperform popular methods such as Seurat 3, scVI, Scanorama, BBKNN, Harmony et al. Most importantly, scDML preserves subtle cell types in raw data and enables discovery of new cell subtypes that are hard to extract by analyzing each batch individually. We also show that scDML is scalable to large datasets with lower peak memory usage, and we believe that scDML offers a valuable tool to study complex cellular heterogeneity.",36810607,PMC9944958,10.1038/s41467-023-36635-5,4
Deep learning exploration of single-cell and spatially resolved cancer transcriptomics to unravel tumour heterogeneity,"Tumour heterogeneity is one of the critical confounding aspects in decoding tumour growth. Malignant cells display variations in their gene transcription profiles and mutation spectra even when originating from a single progenitor cell. Single-cell and spatial transcriptomics sequencing have recently emerged as key technologies for unravelling tumour heterogeneity. Single-cell sequencing promotes individual cell-type identification through transcriptome-wide gene expression measurements of each cell. Spatial transcriptomics facilitates identification of cell-cell interactions and the structural organization of heterogeneous cells within a tumour tissue through associating spatial RNA abundance of cells at distinct spots in the tissue section. However, extracting features and analyzing single-cell and spatial transcriptomics data poses challenges. Single-cell transcriptome data is extremely noisy and its sparse nature and dropouts can lead to misinterpretation of gene expression and the misclassification of cell types. Deep learning predictive power can overcome data challenges, provide high-resolution analysis and enhance precision oncology applications that involve early cancer prognosis, diagnosis, patient survival estimation and anti-cancer therapy planning. In this paper, we provide a background to and review of the recent progress of deep learning frameworks to investigate tumour heterogeneity using both single-cell and spatial transcriptomics data types.",37506451,,10.1016/j.compbiomed.2023.107274,2
Bulk and Single-Cell RNA-Seq Analyses for Studies of Spermatogonia,"Robust methods have been developed that leverage next-generation sequencing (NGS) to measure abundance of all mRNAs (RNA-seq) in samples as small as individual cells in order to study the testicular transcriptome in mammals. In this chapter, we present robust options for implementing bioinformatics workflows for the analysis of bulk RNA-seq from aggregate samples of hundreds to millions of cells and single-cell RNA-seq from individual cells. We also provide detailed protocols for using the R packages DESeq2 and Seurat, important parameters for successful implementation, and considerations for drawing conclusions from the results.",37249866,PMC10353477,10.1007/978-1-0716-3139-3_4,0
Phiclust: a clusterability measure for single-cell transcriptomics reveals phenotypic subpopulations,"The ability to discover new cell phenotypes by unsupervised clustering of single-cell transcriptomes has revolutionized biology. Currently, there is no principled way to decide whether a cluster of cells contains meaningful subpopulations that should be further resolved. Here, we present phiclust (ϕclust), a clusterability measure derived from random matrix theory that can be used to identify cell clusters with non-random substructure, testably leading to the discovery of previously overlooked phenotypes.",35012604,PMC8751334,10.1186/s13059-021-02590-x,4
Improving bulk RNA-seq classification by transferring gene signature from single cells in acute myeloid leukemia,"The advances in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies enable the characterization of transcriptomic profiles at the cellular level and demonstrate great promise in bulk sample analysis thereby offering opportunities to transfer gene signature from scRNA-seq to bulk data. However, the gene expression signatures identified from single cells are typically inapplicable to bulk RNA-seq data due to the profiling differences of distinct sequencing technologies. Here, we propose single-cell pair-wise gene expression (scPAGE), a novel method to develop single-cell gene pair signatures (scGPSs) that were beneficial to bulk RNA-seq classification to transfer knowledge across platforms. PAGE was adopted to tackle the challenge of profiling differences. We applied the method to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and identified the scGPS from mouse scRNA-seq that allowed discriminating between AML and control cells. The scGPS was validated in bulk RNA-seq datasets and demonstrated better performance (average area under the curve [AUC] = 0.96) than the conventional gene expression strategies (average AUC$\le$ 0.88) suggesting its potential in disclosing the molecular mechanism of AML. The scGPS also outperformed its bulk counterpart, which highlighted the benefit of gene signature transfer. Furthermore, we confirmed the utility of scPAGE in sepsis as an example of other disease scenarios. scPAGE leveraged the advantages of single-cell profiles to enhance the analysis of bulk samples revealing great potential of transferring knowledge from single-cell to bulk transcriptome studies.",35136933,,10.1093/bib/bbac002,13
Gene Expression Nebulas (GEN): a comprehensive data portal integrating transcriptomic profiles across multiple species at both bulk and single-cell levels,"Transcriptomic profiling is critical to uncovering functional elements from transcriptional and post-transcriptional aspects. Here, we present Gene Expression Nebulas (GEN, https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/gen/), an open-access data portal integrating transcriptomic profiles under various biological contexts. GEN features a curated collection of high-quality bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing datasets by using standardized data processing pipelines and a structured curation model. Currently, GEN houses a large number of gene expression profiles from 323 datasets (157 bulk and 166 single-cell), covering 50 500 samples and 15 540 169 cells across 30 species, which are further categorized into six biological contexts. Moreover, GEN integrates a full range of transcriptomic profiles on expression, RNA editing and alternative splicing for 10 bulk datasets, providing opportunities for users to conduct integrative analysis at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. In addition, GEN provides abundant gene annotations based on value-added curation of transcriptomic profiles and delivers online services for data analysis and visualization. Collectively, GEN presents a comprehensive collection of transcriptomic profiles across multiple species, thus serving as a fundamental resource for better understanding genetic regulatory architecture and functional mechanisms from tissues to cells.",34591957,PMC8728231,10.1093/nar/gkab878,16
scTransSort: Transformers for Intelligent Annotation of Cell Types by Gene Embeddings,"Single-cell transcriptomics is rapidly advancing our understanding of the composition of complex tissues and biological cells, and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) holds great potential for identifying and characterizing the cell composition of complex tissues. Cell type identification by analyzing scRNA-seq data is mostly limited by time-consuming and irreproducible manual annotation. As scRNA-seq technology scales to thousands of cells per experiment, the exponential increase in the number of cell samples makes manual annotation more difficult. On the other hand, the sparsity of gene transcriptome data remains a major challenge. This paper applied the idea of the transformer to single-cell classification tasks based on scRNA-seq data. We propose scTransSort, a cell-type annotation method pretrained with single-cell transcriptomics data. The scTransSort incorporates a method of representing genes as gene expression embedding blocks to reduce the sparsity of data used for cell type identification and reduce the computational complexity. The feature of scTransSort is that its implementation of intelligent information extraction for unordered data, automatically extracting valid features of cell types without the need for manually labeled features and additional references. In experiments on cells from 35 human and 26 mouse tissues, scTransSort successfully elucidated its high accuracy and high performance for cell type identification, and demonstrated its own high robustness and generalization ability.",37189359,PMC10136153,10.3390/biom13040611,2
Benchmarking cell-type clustering methods for spatially resolved transcriptomics data,"Spatially resolved transcriptomics technologies enable the measurement of transcriptome information while retaining the spatial context at the regional, cellular or sub-cellular level. While previous computational methods have relied on gene expression information alone for clustering single-cell populations, more recent methods have begun to leverage spatial location and histology information to improve cell clustering and cell-type identification. In this study, using seven semi-synthetic datasets with real spatial locations, simulated gene expression and histology images as well as ground truth cell-type labels, we evaluate 15 clustering methods based on clustering accuracy, robustness to data variation and input parameters, computational efficiency, and software usability. Our analysis demonstrates that even though incorporating the additional spatial and histology information leads to increased accuracy in some datasets, it does not consistently improve clustering compared with using only gene expression data. Our results indicate that for the clustering of spatial transcriptomics data, there are still opportunities to enhance the overall accuracy and robustness by improving information extraction and feature selection from spatial and histology data.",36410733,PMC9851325,10.1093/bib/bbac475,8
Real age prediction from the transcriptome with RAPToR,"Transcriptomic data is often affected by uncontrolled variation among samples that can obscure and confound the effects of interest. This variation is frequently due to unintended differences in developmental stages between samples. The transcriptome itself can be used to estimate developmental progression, but existing methods require many samples and do not estimate a specimen's real age. Here we present real-age prediction from transcriptome staging on reference (RAPToR), a computational method that precisely estimates the real age of a sample from its transcriptome, exploiting existing time-series data as reference. RAPToR works with whole animal, dissected tissue and single-cell data for the most common animal models, humans and even for non-model organisms lacking reference data. We show that RAPToR can be used to remove age as a confounding factor and allow recovery of a signal of interest in differential expression analysis. RAPToR will be especially useful in large-scale single-organism profiling because it eliminates the need for accurate staging or synchronisation before profiling.",35817937,,10.1038/s41592-022-01540-0,9
Navigating the landscapes of spatial transcriptomics: How computational methods guide the way,"Spatially resolved transcriptomics has been dramatically transforming biological and medical research in various fields. It enables transcriptome profiling at single-cell, multi-cellular, or sub-cellular resolution, while retaining the information of geometric localizations of cells in complex tissues. The coupling of cell spatial information and its molecular characteristics generates a novel multi-modal high-throughput data source, which poses new challenges for the development of analytical methods for data-mining. Spatial transcriptomic data are often highly complex, noisy, and biased, presenting a series of difficulties, many unresolved, for data analysis and generation of biological insights. In addition, to keep pace with the ever-evolving spatial transcriptomic experimental technologies, the existing analytical theories and tools need to be updated and reformed accordingly. In this review, we provide an overview and discussion of the current computational approaches for mining of spatial transcriptomics data.

Identification and functional analysis of long non-coding RNAs in human and mouse early embryos based on single-cell transcriptome data,"Epigenetics regulations have an important role in fertilization and proper embryonic development, and several human diseases are associated with epigenetic modification disorders, such as Rett syndrome, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and Angelman syndrome. However, the dynamics and functions of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), one type of epigenetic regulators, in human pre-implantation development have not yet been demonstrated. In this study, a comprehensive analysis of human and mouse early-stage embryonic lncRNAs was performed based on public single-cell RNA sequencing data. Expression profile analysis revealed that lncRNAs are expressed in a developmental stage-specific manner during human early-stage embryonic development, whereas a more temporal-specific expression pattern was identified in mouse embryos. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis suggested that lncRNAs involved in human early-stage embryonic development are associated with several important functions and processes, such as oocyte maturation, zygotic genome activation and mitochondrial functions. We also found that the network of lncRNAs involved in zygotic genome activation was highly preservative between human and mouse embryos, whereas in other stages no strong correlation between human and mouse embryo was observed. This study provides insight into the molecular mechanism underlying lncRNA involvement in human pre-implantation embryonic development.",27542205,PMC5308646,10.18632/oncotarget.11304,15
Linear Regression Links Transcriptomic Data and Cellular Raman Spectra,"Raman microscopy is an imaging technique that has been applied to assess molecular compositions of living cells to characterize cell types and states. However, owing to the diverse molecular species in cells and challenges of assigning peaks to specific molecules, it has not been clear how to interpret cellular Raman spectra. Here, we provide firm evidence that cellular Raman spectra and transcriptomic profiles of Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Escherichia coli can be computationally connected and thus interpreted. We find that the dimensions of high-dimensional Raman spectra and transcriptomes measured by RNA sequencing can be reduced and connected linearly through a shared low-dimensional subspace. Accordingly, we were able to predict global gene expression profiles by applying the calculated transformation matrix to Raman spectra, and vice versa. Highly expressed non-coding RNAs contributed to the Raman-transcriptome linear correspondence more significantly than mRNAs in S. pombe. This demonstration of correspondence between cellular Raman spectra and transcriptomes is a promising step toward establishing spectroscopic live-cell omics studies.",29936183,,10.1016/j.cels.2018.05.015,17
Robust joint clustering of multi-omics single-cell data via multi-modal high-order neighborhood Laplacian matrix optimization,"Motivation:Simultaneous profiling of multi-omics single-cell data represents exciting technological advancements for understanding cellular states and heterogeneity. Cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing allowed for parallel quantification of cell-surface protein expression and transcriptome profiling in the same cells; methylome and transcriptome sequencing from single cells allows for analysis of transcriptomic and epigenomic profiling in the same individual cells. However, effective integration method for mining the heterogeneity of cells over the noisy, sparse, and complex multi-modal data is in growing need.Results:In this article, we propose a multi-modal high-order neighborhood Laplacian matrix optimization framework for integrating the multi-omics single-cell data: scHoML. Hierarchical clustering method was presented for analyzing the optimal embedding representation and identifying cell clusters in a robust manner. This novel method by integrating high-order and multi-modal Laplacian matrices would robustly represent the complex data structures and allow for systematic analysis at the multi-omics single-cell level, thus promoting further biological discoveries.Availability and implementation:Matlab code is available at https://github.com/jianghruc/scHoML.",37382572,PMC10329495,10.1093/bioinformatics/btad414,0
Elucidating immune cell dynamics in chronic lung allograft dysfunction: A comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic study,"Chronic Lung Allograft Dysfunction (CLAD) is a critical post-transplant complication that predominantly determines the long-term survival rates and quality of life of patients undergoing lung transplantation. The limited efficacy of current immunosuppressive strategies underscores our incomplete understanding of the immunological aspects of CLAD. Hence, there is an urgent need for more comprehensive and targeted research to unravel the complex interplay of immune cells in the development and progression of CLAD. This study conducts an in-depth analysis of the immune environment in CLAD. By examining the gene expression profiles of T cells, natural killer cells, B cells, macrophages, and monocytes, we have elucidated a unique immunological landscape in CLAD compared to healthy controls. We highlight the heterogeneity within the immune populations and provide a comprehensive understanding of the immune mechanisms driving CLAD. Enrichment analysis identified specific pathways that are either overactive or suppressed in CLAD, revealing potential molecular targets for therapeutic intervention. Our findings emphasize the crucial role of T cells in the pathophysiology of CLAD, coordinating the immune response and revealing an amplified immune cell network, potentially leading to maladaptive tissue responses. By integrating a comprehensive cellular and molecular portrait of the immune environment, our research not only deepens our understanding of the pathogenesis of CLAD but also lays a foundational approach for the development of targeted therapies.",38520924,,10.1016/j.compbiomed.2024.108254,0
Single cell transcriptome profiling of developing chick retinal cells,"The vertebrate retina is a specialized photosensitive tissue comprised of six neuronal and one glial cell types, each of which develops in prescribed proportions at overlapping timepoints from a common progenitor pool. While each of these cells has a specific function contributing to proper vision in the mature animal, their differential representation in the retina as well as the presence of distinctive cellular subtypes makes identifying the transcriptomic signatures that lead to each retinal cell's fate determination and development challenging. We have analyzed transcriptomes from individual cells isolated from the chick retina throughout retinogenesis. While we focused our efforts on the retinal ganglion cells, our transcriptomes of developing chick cells also contained representation from multiple retinal cell types, including photoreceptors and interneurons at different stages of development. Most interesting was the identification of transcriptomes from individual mixed lineage progenitor cells in the chick as these cells offer a window into the cell fate decision-making process. Taken together, these data sets will enable us to uncover the most critical genes acting in the steps of cell fate determination and early differentiation of various retinal cell types.",28510275,,10.1002/cne.24241,8
Semibulk RNA-seq analysis as a convenient method for measuring gene expression statuses in a local cellular environment,"When biologically interpretation of the data obtained from the single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis is attempted, additional information on the location of the single cells, behavior of the surrounding cells, and the microenvironment they generate, would be very important. We developed an inexpensive, high throughput application while preserving spatial organization, named ""semibulk RNA-seq"" (sbRNA-seq). We utilized a microfluidic device specifically designed for the experiments to encapsulate both a barcoded bead and a cell aggregate (a semibulk) into a single droplet. Using sbRNA-seq, we firstly analyzed mouse kidney specimens. In the mouse model, we could associate the pathological information with the gene expression information. We validated the results using spatial transcriptome analysis and found them highly consistent. When we applied the sbRNA-seq analysis to the human breast cancer specimens, we identified spatial interactions between a particular population of immune cells and that of cancer-associated fibroblast cells, which were not precisely represented solely by the single-cell analysis. Semibulk analysis may provide a convenient and versatile method, compared to a standard spatial transcriptome sequencing platform, to associate spatial information with transcriptome information.",36097044,PMC9468030,10.1038/s41598-022-19391-2,1
Detection of correlated hidden factors from single cell transcriptomes using Iteratively Adjusted-SVA (IA-SVA),"Single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) precisely characterizes gene expression levels and dissects variation in expression associated with the state (technical or biological) and the type of the cell, which is averaged out in bulk measurements. Multiple and correlated sources contribute to gene expression variation in single cells, which makes their estimation difficult with the existing methods developed for batch correction (e.g., surrogate variable analysis (SVA)) that estimate orthogonal transformations of these sources. We developed iteratively adjusted surrogate variable analysis (IA-SVA) that can estimate hidden factors even when they are correlated with other sources of variation by identifying a set of genes associated with each hidden factor in an iterative manner. Analysis of scRNA-seq data from human cells showed that IA-SVA could accurately capture hidden variation arising from technical (e.g., stacked doublet cells) or biological sources (e.g., cell type or cell-cycle stage). Furthermore, IA-SVA delivers a set of genes associated with the detected hidden source to be used in downstream data analyses. As a proof of concept, IA-SVA recapitulated known marker genes for islet cell subsets (e.g., alpha, beta), which improved the grouping of subsets into distinct clusters. Taken together, IA-SVA is an effective and novel method to dissect multiple and correlated sources of variation in scRNA-seq data.",30451954,PMC6242813,10.1038/s41598-018-35365-9,6
An optimized workflow for single-cell transcriptomics and repertoire profiling of purified lymphocytes from clinical samples,"Establishing clinically relevant single-cell (SC) transcriptomic workflows from cryopreserved tissue is essential to move this emerging immune monitoring technology from the bench to the bedside. Improper sample preparation leads to detrimental cascades, resulting in loss of precious time, money and finally compromised data. There is an urgent need to establish protocols specifically designed to overcome the inevitable variations in sample quality resulting from uncontrollable factors in a clinical setting. Here, we explore sample preparation techniques relevant to a range of clinically relevant scenarios, where SC gene expression and repertoire analysis are applied to a cryopreserved sample derived from a small amount of blood, with unknown or partially known preservation history. We compare a total of ten cell-counting, viability-improvement, and lymphocyte-enrichment methods to highlight a number of unexpected findings. Trypan blue-based automated counters, typically recommended for single-cell sample quantitation, consistently overestimate viability. Advanced sample clean-up procedures significantly impact total cell yield, while only modestly increasing viability. Finally, while pre-enrichment of B cells from whole peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) results in the most reliable BCR repertoire data, comparable T-cell enrichment strategies distort the ratio of CD4+ and CD8+ cells. Furthermore, we provide high-resolution analysis of gene expression and clonotype repertoire of different B cell subtypes. Together these observations provide both qualitative and quantitative sample preparation guidelines that increase the chances of obtaining high-quality single-cell transcriptomic and repertoire data from human PBMCs in a variety of clinical settings.",32042039,PMC7010687,10.1038/s41598-020-58939-y,14
Activated autophagy of innate immune cells during the early stages of major trauma,"Background:Trauma-induced immune dysfunction has been a major barrier to achieving reduced mortality, which is poorly understood. Autophagy is a crucial catabolic mechanism of immune cells during times of stress. Few studies have investigated the immune regulatory effects induced by autophagy after trauma. Here, we use single-cell transcriptomics analysis in a major trauma cohort to demonstrate the dominant role of autophagy in innate immune cells during the early stages of major trauma.Method:Single-cell transcriptional profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was performed, which were sampled from three control participants and five major trauma patients within 6 hours of injury. In detail, after single-cell RNA-sequence data processing, cell type annotation and cluster marker identification were performed. A genetic toolbox with 604 autophagy-related genes was used to monitor the autophagy levels in immune cells. In addition, all transcriptome RNA sequencing data obtained from PBMCs in a cohort of 167 major trauma patients were downloaded from gene expression omnibus (GEO) datasets (GSE36809). Key deregulated biological processes and important autophagic hub genes involved in immune cells were identified by weighted gene co-expression network analysis and gene ontology enrichment analysis.Results:A total of 20,445 differentially expressed genes were identified and five co-expression modules were constructed. Enrichment analysis indicated that activated autophagy is the most important biological process during the early stages of major trauma, and JMY (autophagy-related genes) were identified as hub genes. The single-cell transcriptional profiling of PBMCs demonstrated that all components of adaptive immune cells were significantly decreased, whereas components of innate immune cells (monocytes and neutrophils) were significantly increased in major trauma patients compared with control participants. Activated autophagy was detected in monocytes and neutrophils by monitoring the dynamic transcriptional signature of the autophagy-related genetic toolbox. Biological process analysis shows that antigen uptake, processing presentation, and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II protein complex assembly pathways were up-regulated in autophagy-positive monocytes, whereas antigen processing and presentation of endogenous antigen and type I interferon signaling pathways were up-regulated in autophagy-positive neutrophils during the early stages of major trauma.Conclusion:Our study demonstrated that autophagy is a biological process crucial to the development of immune disorders in the early stages of major trauma. Furthermore, the results of our study generated a comprehensive single-cell immune landscape for major trauma patients, in which we determined that autophagy profoundly affects the main functions of innate immune cells and provides insight into the cellular basis of immune dysregulation after major trauma.",36713435,PMC9879135,10.3389/fimmu.2022.1090358,0
A yeast-optimized single-cell transcriptomics platform elucidates how mycophenolic acid and guanine alter global mRNA levels,"Stochastic gene expression leads to inherent variability in expression outcomes even in isogenic single-celled organisms grown in the same environment. The Drop-Seq technology facilitates transcriptomic studies of individual mammalian cells, and it has had transformative effects on the characterization of cell identity and function based on single-cell transcript counts. However, application of this technology to organisms with different cell size and morphology characteristics has been challenging. Here we present yeastDrop-Seq, a yeast-optimized platform for quantifying the number of distinct mRNA molecules in a cell-specific manner in individual yeast cells. Using yeastDrop-Seq, we measured the transcriptomic impact of the lifespan-extending compound mycophenolic acid and its epistatic agent guanine. Each treatment condition had a distinct transcriptomic footprint on isogenic yeast cells as indicated by distinct clustering with clear separations among the different groups. The yeastDrop-Seq platform facilitates transcriptomic profiling of yeast cells for basic science and biotechnology applications.",34193958,PMC8245502,10.1038/s42003-021-02320-w,8
Spatial Reconstruction of Oligo and Single Cells by De Novo Coalescent Embedding of Transcriptomic Networks,"Single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) profiles conceal temporal and spatial tissue developmental information. De novo reconstruction of single cell temporal trajectory has been fairly addressed, but reverse engineering single cell 3D spatial tissue organization is hitherto landmark based, and de novo spatial reconstruction is a compelling computational open problem. Here it is shown that a proposed algorithm for de novo coalescent embedding (D-CE) of oligo/single cell transcriptomic networks can help to address this problem. Relying on the spatial information encoded in the expression patterns of genes, it is found that D-CE of cell-cell association transcriptomic networks, by preserving mesoscale network organization, captures spatial domains, identifies spatially expressed genes, reconstructs cell samples' 3D spatial distribution, and uncovers spatial domains and markers necessary for understanding the design principles on spatial organization and pattern formation. Comparison to the novoSpaRC and CSOmap (the only available de novo 3D spatial reconstruction methods) on 14 datasets and 497 reconstructions, reveals a significantly superior performance of D-CE.",37323105,PMC10369275,10.1002/advs.202206307,1
scMAGS: Marker gene selection from scRNA-seq data for spatial transcriptomics studies,"Single-Cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has provided unprecedented opportunities for exploring gene expression and thus uncovering regulatory relationships between genes at the single-cell level. However, scRNA-seq relies on isolating cells from tissues. Therefore, the spatial context of the regulatory processes is lost. A recent technological innovation, spatial transcriptomics, allows for the measurement of gene expression while preserving spatial information. An initial step in the spatial transcriptomic analysis is to identify the cell type, which requires a careful selection of cell-specific marker genes. For this purpose, currently, scRNA-seq data is used to select a limited number of marker genes from among all genes that distinguish cell types from each other. This study proposes scMAGS (single-cell MArker Gene Selection), a novel method for marker gene selection from scRNA-seq data for spatial transcriptomics studies. scMAGS uses a filtering step in which the candidate genes are identified before the marker gene selection step. For the selection of marker genes, cluster validity indices, the Silhouette index, or the Calinski-Harabasz index (for large datasets) are utilized. Experimental results showed that, in comparison to the existing methods, scMAGS is scalable, fast, and accurate. Even for large datasets with millions of cells, scMAGS could find the required number of marker genes in a reasonable amount of time with fewer memory requirements. scMAGS is made freely available at https://github.com/doganlab/scmags and can be downloaded from the Python Package Directory (PyPI) software repository with the command pip install scmags.",36774895,,10.1016/j.compbiomed.2023.106634,1
exFINDER: identify external communication signals using single-cell transcriptomics data,"Cells make decisions through their communication with other cells and receiving signals from their environment. Using single-cell transcriptomics, computational tools have been developed to infer cell-cell communication through ligands and receptors. However, the existing methods only deal with signals sent by the measured cells in the data, the received signals from the external system are missing in the inference. Here, we present exFINDER, a method that identifies such external signals received by the cells in the single-cell transcriptomics datasets by utilizing the prior knowledge of signaling pathways. In particular, exFINDER can uncover external signals that activate the given target genes, infer the external signal-target signaling network (exSigNet), and perform quantitative analysis on exSigNets. The applications of exFINDER to scRNA-seq datasets from different species demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of identifying external signals, revealing critical transition-related signaling activities, inferring critical external signals and targets, clustering signal-target paths, and evaluating relevant biological events. Overall, exFINDER can be applied to scRNA-seq data to reveal the external signal-associated activities and maybe novel cells that send such signals.",37026478,PMC10250247,10.1093/nar/gkad262,3
Spage2vec: Unsupervised representation of localized spatial gene expression signatures,"Investigations of spatial cellular composition of tissue architectures revealed by multiplexed in situ RNA detection often rely on inaccurate cell segmentation or prior biological knowledge from complementary single-cell sequencing experiments. Here, we present spage2vec, an unsupervised segmentation-free approach for decrypting the spatial transcriptomic heterogeneity of complex tissues at subcellular resolution. Spage2vec represents the spatial transcriptomic landscape of tissue samples as a graph and leverages a powerful machine learning graph representation technique to create a lower dimensional representation of local spatial gene expression. We apply spage2vec to mouse brain data from three different in situ transcriptomic assays and to a spatial gene expression dataset consisting of hundreds of individual cells. We show that learned representations encode meaningful biological spatial information of re-occurring localized gene expression signatures involved in cellular and subcellular processes. DATABASE: Spatial gene expression data are available in Zenodo database at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3897401.

Data Analysis Pipeline for scRNA-seq Experiments to Study Early Oogenesis,"Germ cells as the means for the transmission of genetic information between generations have been a hot topic of research for decades. The analysis of the transcriptomes, that is of the RNA transcripts produced by the genotype at a given time, of germ cells and the surrounding somatic cells, is essential to unravel the cellular and molecular processes regulating gametogenesis. However, the asynchronized differentiation of germ cells and high cellular heterogeneity in the developing ovary or testis represent two unsurmountable challenges for delineating the transcription regulation mechanism of germ cells using traditional bulk RNA sequencing. By performing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), it is now possible to dissect the transcriptome of germ cell development at single-cell resolution, and apply powerful bioinformatics methods to translate raw sequencing data into meaningful information. Here, using the 10× Genomic platform and the most widely cited bioinformatics tools, we describe how to analyze early female germ cell development using scRNA-seq data generated from mouse E11.5 to E14.5 ovaries. This pipeline will provide a guide for exploring the processes of early germ cell development at single-cell resolution.",38351456,,10.1007/978-1-0716-3698-5_15,0
Fragment-sequencing unveils local tissue microenvironments at single-cell resolution,"Cells collectively determine biological functions by communicating with each other-both through direct physical contact and secreted factors. Consequently, the local microenvironment of a cell influences its behavior, gene expression, and cellular crosstalk. Disruption of this microenvironment causes reciprocal changes in those features, which can lead to the development and progression of diseases. Hence, assessing the cellular transcriptome while simultaneously capturing the spatial relationships of cells within a tissue provides highly valuable insights into how cells communicate in health and disease. Yet, methods to probe the transcriptome often fail to preserve native spatial relationships, lack single-cell resolution, or are highly limited in throughput, i.e. lack the capacity to assess multiple environments simultaneously. Here, we introduce fragment-sequencing (fragment-seq), a method that enables the characterization of single-cell transcriptomes within multiple spatially distinct tissue microenvironments. We apply fragment-seq to a murine model of the metastatic liver to study liver zonation and the metastatic niche. This analysis reveals zonated genes and ligand-receptor interactions enriched in specific hepatic microenvironments. Finally, we apply fragment-seq to other tissues and species, demonstrating the adaptability of our method.",38012149,PMC10681997,10.1038/s41467-023-43005-8,2
PseudotimeDE: inference of differential gene expression along cell pseudotime with well-calibrated p-values from single-cell RNA sequencing data,"To investigate molecular mechanisms underlying cell state changes, a crucial analysis is to identify differentially expressed (DE) genes along the pseudotime inferred from single-cell RNA-sequencing data. However, existing methods do not account for pseudotime inference uncertainty, and they have either ill-posed p-values or restrictive models. Here we propose PseudotimeDE, a DE gene identification method that adapts to various pseudotime inference methods, accounts for pseudotime inference uncertainty, and outputs well-calibrated p-values. Comprehensive simulations and real-data applications verify that PseudotimeDE outperforms existing methods in false discovery rate control and power.",33926517,PMC8082818,10.1186/s13059-021-02341-y,20
scmap: projection of single-cell RNA-seq data across data sets,"Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) allows researchers to define cell types on the basis of unsupervised clustering of the transcriptome. However, differences in experimental methods and computational analyses make it challenging to compare data across experiments. Here we present scmap (http://bioconductor.org/packages/scmap; web version at http://www.sanger.ac.uk/science/tools/scmap), a method for projecting cells from an scRNA-seq data set onto cell types or individual cells from other experiments.",29608555,,10.1038/nmeth.4644,285
Using RNentropy to Detect Significant Variation in Gene Expression Across Multiple RNA-Seq or Single-Cell RNA-Seq Samples,"RNA-Seq has become the de facto standard technique for characterization and quantification of transcriptomes, and a large number of methods and tools have been proposed to model and detect differential gene expression based on the comparison of transcript abundances across different samples. However, state-of-the-art methods for this task are usually designed for pairwise comparisons, that is, can identify significant variation of expression only between two conditions or samples. We describe the use of RNentropy, a methodology based on information theory, devised to overcome this limitation. RNentropy can thus detect significant variations of gene expression in RNA-Seq data across any number of samples and conditions, and can be applied downstream of any analysis pipeline for the quantification of gene expression from raw sequencing data. RNentropy takes as input gene (or transcript) expression values, defined with any measure suitable for the comparison of transcript levels across samples and conditions. The output consists of genes (or transcripts) exhibiting significant variation of expression across the conditions studied, together with the samples in which they result to be over- or underexpressed. RNentropy is implemented as an R package and freely available from the CRAN repository. We provide a detailed guide to the functions and parameters of the package and usage examples to demonstrate the software capabilities, also showing how it can be applied to the analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data.",33835439,,10.1007/978-1-0716-1307-8_6,0
"An ultra high-throughput, massively multiplexable, single-cell RNA-seq platform in yeasts","Yeasts are naturally diverse, genetically tractable, and easy to grow such that researchers can investigate any number of genotypes, environments, or interactions thereof. However, studies of yeast transcriptomes have been limited by the processing capabilities of traditional RNA sequencing techniques. Here we optimize a powerful, high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) platform, SPLiT-seq (Split Pool Ligation-based Transcriptome sequencing), for yeasts and apply it to 43,388 cells of multiple species and ploidies. This platform utilizes a combinatorial barcoding strategy to enable massively parallel RNA sequencing of hundreds of yeast genotypes or growth conditions at once. This method can be applied to most species or strains of yeast for a fraction of the cost of traditional scRNAseq approaches. Thus, our technology permits researchers to leverage ""the awesome power of yeast"" by allowing us to survey the transcriptome of hundreds of strains and environments in a short period of time and with no specialized equipment. The key to this method is that sequential barcodes are probabilistically appended to cDNA copies of RNA while the molecules remain trapped inside of each cell. Thus, the transcriptome of each cell is labeled with a unique combination of barcodes. Since SPLiT-seq uses the cell membrane as a container for this reaction, many cells can be processed together without the need to physically isolate them from one another in separate wells or droplets. Further, the first barcode in the sequence can be chosen intentionally to identify samples from different environments or genetic backgrounds, enabling multiplexing of hundreds of unique perturbations in a single experiment. In addition to greater multiplexing capabilities, our method also facilitates a deeper investigation of biological heterogeneity, given its single-cell nature. For example, in the data presented here, we detect transcriptionally distinct cell states related to cell cycle, ploidy, metabolic strategies, and so forth, all within clonal yeast populations grown in the same environment. Hence, our technology has two obvious and impactful applications for yeast research: the first is the general study of transcriptional phenotypes across many strains and environments, and the second is investigating cell-to-cell heterogeneity across the entire transcriptome.",38282330,,10.1002/yea.3927,0
SpaDecon: cell-type deconvolution in spatial transcriptomics with semi-supervised learning,"Spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) has advanced our understanding of the spatial patterns of gene expression, but the lack of single-cell resolution in spatial barcoding-based SRT hinders the inference of specific locations of individual cells. To determine the spatial distribution of cell types in SRT, we present SpaDecon, a semi-supervised learning approach that incorporates gene expression, spatial location, and histology information for cell-type deconvolution. SpaDecon was evaluated through analyses of four real SRT datasets using knowledge of the expected distributions of cell types. Quantitative evaluations were performed for four pseudo-SRT datasets constructed according to benchmark proportions. Using mean squared error and Jensen-Shannon divergence with the benchmark proportions as evaluation criteria, we show that SpaDecon performance surpasses that of published cell-type deconvolution methods. Given the accuracy and computational speed of SpaDecon, we anticipate it will be valuable for SRT data analysis and will facilitate the integration of genomics and digital pathology.",37029267,PMC10082183,10.1038/s42003-023-04761-x,3
Decoding the universal human chromatin landscape through teratoma-based profiling,"Teratoma formation is key for evaluating differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells into embryonic germ layers and serves as a model for understanding stem cell differentiation and developmental processes. Its potential for insights into epigenome and transcriptome profiling is significant. This study integrates the analysis of the epigenome and transcriptome of hESC-generated teratomas, comparing transcriptomes between hESCs and teratomas. It employs cell type-specific expression patterns from single-cell data to deconvolve RNA-Seq data and identify cell types within teratomas. Our results provide a catalog of activating and repressive histone modifications, while also elucidating distinctive features of chromatin states. Construction of an epigenetic signature matrix enabled the quantification of diverse cell populations in teratomas and enhanced the ability to unravel the epigenetic landscape in heterogeneous tissue contexts. This study also includes a single cell multiome atlas of expression (scRNA-Seq) and chromatin accessibility (scATAC-Seq) of human teratomas, further revealing the complexity of these tissues. A histology-based digital staining tool further complemented the annotation of cell types in teratomas, enhancing our understanding of their cellular composition. This research is a valuable resource for examining teratoma epigenomic and transcriptomic landscapes and serves as a model for epigenetic data comparison.",38281248,PMC11039989,10.1093/nar/gkae021,0
Dynamics changes in the transcription factors during early human embryonic development,"Development of an embryo from a single cell, zygote, to multicellular morulae requires activation of hundreds of genes that were mostly inactivated before fertilization. Inevitably, transcription factors (TFs) would be involved in modulating the drastic changes in gene expression pattern observed at all preimplantation stages. Despite many ongoing efforts to uncover the role of TFs at the early stages of embryogenesis, still many unanswered questions remained that need to be explored. This could be done by studying the expression pattern of multiple genes obtained by high-throughput techniques. In the current study, we have identified a set of TFs that are involved in the progression of the zygote to blastocyst. Global gene expression patterns of consecutive stages were compared and differences documented. Expectedly, at the early stages of development, only a few sets of TFs differentially expressed while at the later stages hundreds of TFs appear to be upregulated. Interestingly, the expression levels of many TFs show an oscillation pattern during development indicating a need for their precise expression. A significant shift in gene expression was observed during the transition from four- to eight-cell stages, an indication of zygote genome activation. Additionally, we have found 11 TFs that were common in all stages including ATF3, EN1, IFI16, IKZF3, KLF3, NPAS3, NR2F2, RUNX1, SOX2, ZBTB20, and ZSCAN4. However, their expression patterns did not follow similar trends in the steps studied. Besides, our findings showed that both upregulation and active downregulation of the TFs expression is required for successful embryogenesis. Furthermore, our detailed network analysis identified the hub TFs for each transition. We found that HNF4A, FOXA2, and EP300 are the three most important elements for the first division of zygote.",30246428,,10.1002/jcp.27386,8
Profiling Cellular Ecosystems at Single-Cell Resolution and at Scale with EcoTyper,"Tissues are composed of diverse cell types and cellular states that organize into distinct ecosystems with specialized functions. EcoTyper is a collection of machine learning tools for the large-scale delineation of cellular ecosystems and their constituent cell states from bulk, single-cell, and spatially resolved gene expression data.

Characterization of Gene Expression Signatures for the Identification of Cellular Heterogeneity in the Developing Mammary Gland,"The developing mammary gland depends on several transcription-dependent networks to define cellular identities and differentiation trajectories. Recent technological advancements that allow for single-cell profiling of gene expression have provided an initial picture into the epithelial cellular heterogeneity across the diverse stages of gland maturation. Still, a deeper dive into expanded molecular signatures would improve our understanding of the diversity of mammary epithelial and non-epithelial cellular populations across different tissue developmental stages, mouse strains and mammalian species. Here, we combined differential mammary gland fractionation approaches and transcriptional profiles obtained from FACS-isolated mammary cells to improve our definitions of mammary-resident, cellular identities at the single-cell level. Our approach yielded a series of expression signatures that illustrate the heterogeneity of mammary epithelial cells, specifically those of the luminal fate, and uncovered transcriptional changes to their lineage-defined, cellular states that are induced during gland development. Our analysis also provided molecular signatures that identified non-epithelial mammary cells, including adipocytes, fibroblasts and rare immune cells. Lastly, we extended our study to elucidate expression signatures of human, breast-resident cells, a strategy that allowed for the cross-species comparison of mammary epithelial identities. Collectively, our approach improved the existing signatures of normal mammary epithelial cells, as well as elucidated the diversity of non-epithelial cells in murine and human breast tissue. Our study provides a useful resource for future studies that use single-cell molecular profiling strategies to understand normal and malignant breast development.",33988830,PMC8217035,10.1007/s10911-021-09486-3,11
DrivAER: Identification of driving transcriptional programs in single-cell RNA sequencing data,"Background:Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) unfolds complex transcriptomic datasets into detailed cellular maps. Despite recent success, there is a pressing need for specialized methods tailored towards the functional interpretation of these cellular maps.Findings:Here, we present DrivAER, a machine learning approach for the identification of driving transcriptional programs using autoencoder-based relevance scores. DrivAER scores annotated gene sets on the basis of their relevance to user-specified outcomes such as pseudotemporal ordering or disease status. DrivAER iteratively evaluates the information content of each gene set with respect to the outcome variable using autoencoders. We benchmark our method using extensive simulation analysis as well as comparison to existing methods for functional interpretation of scRNA-seq data. Furthermore, we demonstrate that DrivAER extracts key pathways and transcription factors that regulate complex biological processes from scRNA-seq data.Conclusions:By quantifying the relevance of annotated gene sets with respect to specified outcome variables, DrivAER greatly enhances our ability to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms.",33301553,PMC7727875,10.1093/gigascience/giaa122,5
Simulating multiple faceted variability in single cell RNA sequencing,"The abundance of new computational methods for processing and interpreting transcriptomes at a single cell level raises the need for in silico platforms for evaluation and validation. Here, we present SymSim, a simulator that explicitly models the processes that give rise to data observed in single cell RNA-Seq experiments. The components of the SymSim pipeline pertain to the three primary sources of variation in single cell RNA-Seq data: noise intrinsic to the process of transcription, extrinsic variation indicative of different cell states (both discrete and continuous), and technical variation due to low sensitivity and measurement noise and bias. We demonstrate how SymSim can be used for benchmarking methods for clustering, differential expression and trajectory inference, and for examining the effects of various parameters on their performance. We also show how SymSim can be used to evaluate the number of cells required to detect a rare population under various scenarios.",31197158,PMC6565723,10.1038/s41467-019-10500-w,50
Cost-Efficient Transcriptomic-Based Drug Screening,"Transcriptomics allows to obtain comprehensive insights into cellular programs and their responses to perturbations. Despite a significant decrease in the costs of library production and sequencing in the last decade, applying these technologies at the scale necessary for drug screening remains prohibitively expensive, obstructing the immense potential of these methods. Our study presents a cost-effective system for transcriptome-based drug screening, combining miniaturized perturbation cultures with mini-bulk transcriptomics. The optimized mini-bulk protocol provides informative biological signals at cost-effective sequencing depth, enabling extensive screening of known drugs and new molecules. Depending on the chosen treatment and incubation time, this protocol will result in sequencing libraries within approximately 2 days. Due to several stopping points within this protocol, the library preparation, as well as the sequencing, can be performed time-independently. Processing simultaneously a high number of samples is possible; measurement of up to 384 samples was tested without loss of data quality. There are also no known limitations to the number of conditions and/or drugs, despite considering variability in optimal drug incubation times.",38465925,,10.3791/65930,0
A downsampling method enables robust clustering and integration of single-cell transcriptome data,"The random noises, sampling biases, and batch effects often confound true biological variations in single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. Adjusting such biases is key to the robust discoveries in downstream analyses, such as cell clustering, gene selection and data integration. Here we propose a model-based downsampling algorithm based on minimal unbiased representative points (MURPXMBD). MURPXMBDis designed to retrieve a set of representative points by reducing gene-wise random independent errors, while retaining the covariance structure of biological origin hence provide an unbiased representation of the cell population. Subsequent validation using benchmark datasets shows that MURPXMBDcan improve the quality and accuracy of clustering algorithms, and thus facilitate the discovery of new cell types. Besides, MURPXMBDalso improves the performance of dataset integration algorithms. In summary, MURPXMBDserves as a useful noise-reduction method for single-cell sequencing analysis in biomedical studies.",35537690,,10.1016/j.jbi.2022.104093,1
Gene panel selection for targeted spatial transcriptomics,"Targeted spatial transcriptomics hold particular promise in analyzing complex tissues. Most such methods, however, measure only a limited panel of transcripts, which need to be selected in advance to inform on the cell types or processes being studied. A limitation of existing gene selection methods is their reliance on scRNA-seq data, ignoring platform effects between technologies. Here we describe gpsFISH, a computational method performing gene selection through optimizing detection of known cell types. By modeling and adjusting for platform effects, gpsFISH outperforms other methods. Furthermore, gpsFISH can incorporate cell type hierarchies and custom gene preferences to accommodate diverse design requirements.",38273415,PMC10811939,10.1186/s13059-024-03174-1,1
Early lineage segregation of multipotent embryonic mammary gland progenitors,"The mammary gland is composed of basal cells and luminal cells. It is generally believed that the mammary gland arises from embryonic multipotent progenitors, but it remains unclear when lineage restriction occurs and what mechanisms are responsible for the switch from multipotency to unipotency during its morphogenesis. Here, we perform multicolour lineage tracing and assess the fate of single progenitors, and demonstrate the existence of a developmental switch from multipotency to unipotency during embryonic mammary gland development. Molecular profiling and single cell RNA-seq revealed that embryonic multipotent progenitors express a unique hybrid basal and luminal signature and the factors associated with the different lineages. Sustained p63 expression in embryonic multipotent progenitors promotes unipotent basal cell fate and was sufficient to reprogram adult luminal cells into basal cells by promoting an intermediate hybrid multipotent-like state. Altogether, this study identifies the timing and the mechanisms mediating early lineage segregation of multipotent progenitors during mammary gland development.",29784918,PMC5985933,10.1038/s41556-018-0095-2,76
Mapping the cellular landscape of Atlantic salmon head kidney by single cell and single nucleus transcriptomics,"Single-cell transcriptomics is the current gold standard for global gene expression profiling, not only in mammals and model species, but also in non-model fish species. This is a rapidly expanding field, creating a deeper understanding of tissue heterogeneity and the distinct functions of individual cells, making it possible to explore the complexities of immunology and gene expression on a highly resolved level. In this study, we compared two single cell transcriptomic approaches to investigate cellular heterogeneity within the head kidney of healthy farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). We compared 14,149 cell transcriptomes assayed by single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) with 18,067 nuclei transcriptomes captured by single nucleus RNA-Seq (snRNA-seq). Both approaches detected eight major cell populations in common: granulocytes, heamatopoietic stem cells, erythrocytes, mononuclear phagocytes, thrombocytes, B cells, NK-like cells, and T cells. Four additional cell types, endothelial, epithelial, interrenal, and mesenchymal cells, were detected in the snRNA-seq dataset, but appeared to be lost during preparation of the single cell suspension submitted for scRNA-seq library generation. We identified additional heterogeneity and subpopulations within the B cells, T cells, and endothelial cells, and revealed developmental trajectories of heamatopoietic stem cells into differentiated granulocyte and mononuclear phagocyte populations. Gene expression profiles of B cell subtypes revealed distinct IgM and IgT-skewed resting B cell lineages and provided insights into the regulation of B cell lymphopoiesis. The analysis revealed eleven T cell sub-populations, displaying a level of T cell heterogeneity in salmon head kidney comparable to that observed in mammals, including distinct subsets of cd4/cd8-negative T cells, such as tcrγ positive, progenitor-like, and cytotoxic cells. Although snRNA-seq and scRNA-seq were both useful to resolve cell type-specific expression in the Atlantic salmon head kidney, the snRNA-seq pipeline was overall more robust in identifying several cell types and subpopulations. While scRNA-seq displayed higher levels of ribosomal and mitochondrial genes, snRNA-seq captured more transcription factor genes. However, only scRNA-seq-generated data was useful for cell trajectory inference within the myeloid lineage. In conclusion, this study systematically outlines the relative merits of scRNA-seq and snRNA-seq in Atlantic salmon, enhances understanding of teleost immune cell lineages, and provides a comprehensive list of markers for identifying major cell populations in the head kidney with significant immune relevance.",38181891,,10.1016/j.fsi.2024.109357,0
Surface protein imputation from single cell transcriptomes by deep neural networks,"While single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is invaluable for studying cell populations, cell-surface proteins are often integral markers of cellular function and serve as primary targets for therapeutic intervention. Here we propose a transfer learning framework, single cell Transcriptome to Protein prediction with deep neural network (cTP-net), to impute surface protein abundances from scRNA-seq data by learning from existing single-cell multi-omic resources.",32005835,PMC6994606,10.1038/s41467-020-14391-0,23
"Decomposing Cell Identity for Transfer Learning across Cellular Measurements, Platforms, Tissues, and Species","Analysis of gene expression in single cells allows for decomposition of cellular states as low-dimensional latent spaces. However, the interpretation and validation of these spaces remains a challenge. Here, we present scCoGAPS, which defines latent spaces from a source single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) dataset, and projectR, which evaluates these latent spaces in independent target datasets via transfer learning. Application of developing mouse retina to scRNA-Seq reveals intrinsic relationships across biological contexts and assays while avoiding batch effects and other technical features. We compare the dimensions learned in this source dataset to adult mouse retina, a time-course of human retinal development, select scRNA-seq datasets from developing brain, chromatin accessibility data, and a murine-cell type atlas to identify shared biological features. These tools lay the groundwork for exploratory analysis of scRNA-seq data via latent space representations, enabling a shift in how we compare and identify cells beyond reliance on marker genes or ensemble molecular identity.",31121116,PMC6588402,10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.004,68
Hidden Markov random field models for cell-type assignment of spatially resolved transcriptomics,"Motivation:The recent development of spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) technologies has facilitated research on gene expression in the spatial context. Annotating cell types is one crucial step for downstream analysis. However, many existing algorithms use an unsupervised strategy to assign cell types for SRT data. They first conduct clustering analysis and then aggregate cluster-level expression based on the clustering results. This workflow fails to leverage the marker gene information efficiently. On the other hand, other cell annotation methods designed for single-cell RNA-seq data utilize the cell-type marker genes information but fail to use spatial information in SRT data.Results:We introduce a statistical spatial transcriptomics cell assignment model, SPAN, to annotate clusters of cells or spots into known types in SRT data with prior knowledge of predefined marker genes and spatial information. The SPAN model annotates cells or spots from SRT data using predefined overexpressed marker genes and combines a mixture model with a hidden Markov random field to model the spatial dependency between neighboring spots. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SPAN against spatial and nonspatial clustering algorithms through extensive simulation and real data experiments.Availability and implementation:https://github.com/ChengZ352/SPAN.",37944045,PMC10640398,10.1093/bioinformatics/btad641,0
Niche-DE: niche-differential gene expression analysis in spatial transcriptomics data identifies context-dependent cell-cell interactions,"Existing methods for analysis of spatial transcriptomic data focus on delineating the global gene expression variations of cell types across the tissue, rather than local gene expression changes driven by cell-cell interactions. We propose a new statistical procedure called niche-differential expression (niche-DE) analysis that identifies cell-type-specific niche-associated genes, which are differentially expressed within a specific cell type in the context of specific spatial niches. We further develop niche-LR, a method to reveal ligand-receptor signaling mechanisms that underlie niche-differential gene expression patterns. Niche-DE and niche-LR are applicable to low-resolution spot-based spatial transcriptomics data and data that is single-cell or subcellular in resolution.",38217002,PMC10785550,10.1186/s13059-023-03159-6,0
A dynamical systems treatment of transcriptomic trajectories in hematopoiesis,"Inspired by Waddington's illustration of an epigenetic landscape, cell-fate transitions have been envisioned as bifurcating dynamical systems, wherein exogenous signaling dynamics couple to the enormously complex signaling and transcriptional machinery of a cell to elicit qualitative transitions in its collective state. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), which measures the distributions of possible transcriptional states in large populations of differentiating cells, provides an alternate view, in which development is marked by the variations of a myriad of genes. Here, we present a mathematical formalism for rigorously evaluating, from a dynamical systems perspective, whether scRNA-seq trajectories display statistical signatures consistent with bifurcations and, as a case study, pinpoint regions of multistability along the neutrophil branch of hematopoeitic differentiation. Additionally, we leverage the geometric features of linear instability to identify the low-dimensional phase plane in gene expression space within which the multistability unfolds, highlighting novel genetic players that are crucial for neutrophil differentiation. Broadly, we show that a dynamical systems treatment of scRNA-seq data provides mechanistic insights into the high-dimensional processes of cellular differentiation, taking a step toward systematic construction of mathematical models for transcriptomic dynamics.",37260149,PMC10281553,10.1242/dev.201280,2
Computational challenges and opportunities in spatially resolved transcriptomic data analysis,"Spatially resolved transcriptomic data demand new computational analysis methods to derive biological insights. Here, we comment on these associated computational challenges as well as highlight the opportunities for standardized benchmarking metrics and data-sharing infrastructure in spurring innovation moving forward.",34489425,PMC8421472,10.1038/s41467-021-25557-9,23
A top-down measure of gene-to-gene coordination for analyzing cell-to-cell variability,"Recent technological advances, such as single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), allow the measurement of gene expression profiles of individual cells. These expression profiles typically exhibit substantial variations even across seemingly homogeneous populations of cells. Two main different sources contribute to this measured variability: actual differences between the biological activity of the cells and technical measurement errors. Analysis of the biological variability may provide information about the underlying gene regulation of the cells, yet distinguishing it from the technical variability is a challenge. Here, we apply a recently developed computational method for measuring the global gene coordination level (GCL) to systematically study the cell-to-cell variability in numerical models of gene regulation. We simulate 'biological variability' by introducing heterogeneity in the underlying regulatory dynamic of different cells, while 'technical variability' is represented by stochastic measurement noise. We show that the GCL decreases for cohorts of cells with increased 'biological variability' only when it is originated from the interactions between the genes. Moreover, we find that the GCL can evaluate and compare-for cohorts with the same cell-to-cell variability-the ratio between the introduced biological and technical variability. Finally, we show that the GCL is robust against spurious correlations that originate from a small sample size or from the compositionality of the data. The presented methodology can be useful for future analysis of high-dimensional ecological and biochemical dynamics.",34040065,PMC8155031,10.1038/s41598-021-90353-w,2
A machine learning one-class logistic regression model to predict stemness for single cell transcriptomics and spatial omics,"Cell annotation is a crucial methodological component to interpreting single cell and spatial omics data. These approaches were developed for single cell analysis but are often biased, manually curated and yet unproven in spatial omics. Here we apply a stemness model for assessing oncogenic states to single cell and spatial omic cancer datasets. This one-class logistic regression machine learning algorithm is used to extract transcriptomic features from non-transformed stem cells to identify dedifferentiated cell states in tumors. We found this method identifies single cell states in metastatic tumor cell populations without the requirement of cell annotation. This machine learning model identified stem-like cell populations not identified in single cell or spatial transcriptomic analysis using existing methods. For the first time, we demonstrate the application of a ML tool across five emerging spatial transcriptomic and proteomic technologies to identify oncogenic stem-like cell types in the tumor microenvironment.",38017371,PMC10683105,10.1186/s12864-023-09722-6,0
Current and Future Methods for mRNA Analysis: A Drive Toward Single Molecule Sequencing,"The transcriptome encompasses a range of species including messenger RNA, and other noncoding RNA such as rRNA, tRNA, and short and long noncoding RNAs. Due to the huge role played by mRNA in development and disease, several methods have been developed to sequence and characterize mRNA, with RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) emerging as the current method of choice particularly for large high-throughput studies. Short-read RNA-Seq which involves sequencing of short cDNA fragments and computationally assembling them to reconstruct the transcriptome, or aligning them to a reference is the most widely used approach. However, due to inherent limitations of this approach in de novo transcriptome assembly and isoform quantification, long-read RNA-Seq approaches, which also happen to be single molecule sequencing approaches, are increasingly becoming the standard for de novo transcriptome assembly and isoform quantification. In this chapter, we review the technical aspects of the current methods of RNA-Seq, both short and long-read approaches, and data analysis methods available. We discuss recent advances in single-cell RNA-Seq and direct RNA-Seq approaches, which perhaps will dominate the future of RNA-Seq.",29767365,,10.1007/978-1-4939-7834-2_11,24
EDomics: a comprehensive and comparative multi-omics database for animal evo-devo,"Evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo) has been among the most fascinating interdisciplinary fields for decades, which aims to elucidate the origin and evolution of diverse developmental processes. The rapid accumulation of omics data provides unprecedented opportunities to answer many interesting but unresolved evo-devo questions. However, the access and utilization of these resources are hindered by challenges particularly in non-model animals. Here, we establish a comparative multi-omics database for animal evo-devo (EDomics, http://edomics.qnlm.ac) containing comprehensive genomes, bulk transcriptomes, and single-cell data across 40 representative species, many of which are generally used as model organisms for animal evo-devo study. EDomics provides a systematic view of genomic/transcriptomic information from various aspects, including genome assembly statistics, gene features and families, transcription factors, transposable elements, and gene expressional profiles/networks. It also exhibits spatiotemporal gene expression profiles at a single-cell level, such as cell atlas, cell markers, and spatial-map information. Moreover, EDomics provides highly valuable, customized datasets/resources for evo-devo research, including gene family expansion/contraction, inferred core gene repertoires, macrosynteny analysis for karyotype evolution, and cell type evolution analysis. EDomics presents a comprehensive and comparative multi-omics platform for animal evo-devo community to decipher the whole history of developmental evolution across the tree of life.",36318263,PMC9825439,10.1093/nar/gkac944,4
An unsupervised method for physical cell interaction profiling of complex tissues,"Cellular identity in complex multicellular organisms is determined in part by the physical organization of cells. However, large-scale investigation of the cellular interactome remains technically challenging. Here we develop cell interaction by multiplet sequencing (CIM-seq), an unsupervised and high-throughput method to analyze direct physical cell-cell interactions between cell types present in a tissue. CIM-seq is based on RNA sequencing of incompletely dissociated cells, followed by computational deconvolution into constituent cell types. CIM-seq estimates parameters such as number of cells and cell types in each multiplet directly from sequencing data, making it compatible with high-throughput droplet-based methods. When applied to gut epithelium or whole dissociated lung and spleen, CIM-seq correctly identifies known interactions, including those between different cell lineages and immune cells. In the colon, CIM-seq identifies a previously unrecognized goblet cell subtype expressing the wound-healing marker Plet1, which is directly adjacent to colonic stem cells. Our results demonstrate that CIM-seq is broadly applicable to unsupervised profiling of cell-type interactions in different tissue types.",34253926,,10.1038/s41592-021-01196-2,13
CAJAL enables analysis and integration of single-cell morphological data using metric geometry,"High-resolution imaging has revolutionized the study of single cells in their spatial context. However, summarizing the great diversity of complex cell shapes found in tissues and inferring associations with other single-cell data remains a challenge. Here, we present CAJAL, a general computational framework for the analysis and integration of single-cell morphological data. By building upon metric geometry, CAJAL infers cell morphology latent spaces where distances between points indicate the amount of physical deformation required to change the morphology of one cell into that of another. We show that cell morphology spaces facilitate the integration of single-cell morphological data across technologies and the inference of relations with other data, such as single-cell transcriptomic data. We demonstrate the utility of CAJAL with several morphological datasets of neurons and glia and identify genes associated with neuronal plasticity in C. elegans. Our approach provides an effective strategy for integrating cell morphology data into single-cell omics analyses.",37339989,PMC10282047,10.1038/s41467-023-39424-2,2
Cell-type-specific mRNA transcription and degradation kinetics in zebrafish embryogenesis from metabolically labeled single-cell RNA-seq,"During embryonic development, pluripotent cells assume specialized identities by adopting particular gene expression profiles. However, systematically dissecting the relative contributions of mRNA transcription and degradation to shaping those profiles remains challenging, especially within embryos with diverse cellular identities. Here, we combine single-cell RNA-Seq and metabolic labeling to capture temporal cellular transcriptomes of zebrafish embryos where newly-transcribed (zygotic) and pre-existing (maternal) mRNA can be distinguished. We introduce kinetic models to quantify mRNA transcription and degradation rates within individual cell types during their specification. These models reveal highly varied regulatory rates across thousands of genes, coordinated transcription and destruction rates for many transcripts, and link differences in degradation to specific sequence elements. They also identify cell-type-specific differences in degradation, namely selective retention of maternal transcripts within primordial germ cells and enveloping layer cells, two of the earliest specified cell types. Our study provides a quantitative approach to study mRNA regulation during a dynamic spatio-temporal response.",38600066,PMC11006943,10.1038/s41467-024-47290-9,0
Automation enables high-throughput and reproducible single-cell transcriptomics library preparation,"Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has revolutionized genomics, decreasing sequencing costs and allowing researchers to draw correlations between diseases and DNA or RNA changes. Technical advances have enabled the analysis of RNA expression changes between single cells within a heterogeneous population, known as single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq). Despite resolving transcriptomes of cellular subpopulations, scRNA-seq has not replaced RNA-seq, due to higher costs and longer hands-on time. Here, we developed an automated workflow to increase throughput (up to 48 reactions) and to reduce by 75% the hands-on time of scRNA-seq library preparation, using the 10X Genomics Single Cell 3' kit. After gel bead-in-emulsion (GEM) generation on the 10X Genomics Chromium Controller, cDNA amplification was performed, and the product was normalized and subjected to either the manual, standard library preparation method or a fully automated, walk-away method using a Biomek i7 Hybrid liquid handler. Control metrics showed that both quantity and quality of the single-cell gene expression libraries generated were equivalent in size and yield. Key scRNA-seq downstream quality metrics, such as unique molecular identifiers count, mitochondrial RNA content, and cell and gene counts, further showed high correlations between automated and manual workflows. Using the UMAP dimensionality reduction technique to visualize all cells, we were able to further correlate the results observed between the manual and automated methods (R=0.971). The method developed here allows for the fast, error-free, and reproducible multiplex generation of high-quality single-cell gene expression libraries.",35058211,,10.1016/j.slast.2021.10.018,1
An integrated single-cell transcriptomic dataset for non-small cell lung cancer,"As single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has emerged as a great tool for studying cellular heterogeneity within the past decade, the number of available scRNA-seq datasets also rapidly increased. However, reuse of such data is often problematic due to a small cohort size, limited cell types, and insufficient information on cell type classification. Here, we present a large integrated scRNA-seq dataset containing 224,611 cells from human primary non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumors. Using publicly available resources, we pre-processed and integrated seven independent scRNA-seq datasets using an anchor-based approach, with five datasets utilized as reference and the remaining two, as validation. We created two levels of annotation based on cell type-specific markers conserved across the datasets. To demonstrate usability of the integrated dataset, we created annotation predictions for the two validation datasets using our integrated reference. Additionally, we conducted a trajectory analysis on subsets of T cells and lung cancer cells. This integrated data may serve as a resource for studying NSCLC transcriptome at the single cell level.",36973297,PMC10042991,10.1038/s41597-023-02074-6,10
Single-Cell mRNA Sequencing of the Mouse Brain Vasculature,"In this chapter, we describe a method for analyzing the vasculature of the mouse brain using single-cell transcriptomics. More specifically, we focus on the use of fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) for selection of the cells of interest and sorting of these cells in a 384-well format, allowing for enrichment for the cells being studied. Furthermore, we outline the Smart-Seq2 single-cell library construction method for transforming single-cell mRNA into Illumina sequencing compatible libraries. As single-cell sequencing is still a costly technology, we take special care to describe strategies to include many quality control steps. Finally, we touch upon techniques to convert the sequencing data into a meaningful biological readout. The methods reported in this chapter can be expanded toward other tissues and will prove useful also for the study of different cell types beyond adult brain vasculature.",30242769,,10.1007/978-1-4939-8712-2_21,10
Transcriptomic Characterization of the Human Cell Cycle in Individual Unsynchronized Cells,"The highly fine-tuned dynamics of cell cycle gene expression have been intensely studied for several decades. However, some previous observations may be difficult to fully decouple from artifacts induced by traditional cell synchronization procedures. In addition, bulk cell measurements may have disguised intricate details. Here, we address this by sorting and transcriptomic sequencing of single cells progressing through the cell cycle without prior synchronization. Genes and pathways with known cell cycle roles are confirmed, associated regulatory sequence motifs are determined, and we also establish ties between other biological processes and the unsynchronized cell cycle. Importantly, we find the G1 phase to be surprisingly heterogeneous, with transcriptionally distinct early and late time points. We additionally note that mRNAs accumulate to reach maximum total levels at mitosis and find that stable transcripts show reduced cell-to-cell variability, consistent with the transcriptional burst model of gene expression. Our study provides the first detailed transcriptional profiling of an unsynchronized human cell cycle.",29045817,,10.1016/j.jmb.2017.10.011,8
Decoding meningioma heterogeneity and neoplastic cell-macrophage interaction through single-cell transcriptome profiling across pathological grades,"Background:Analyzing meningioma of distinct pathological types at the single-cell level can provide new and valuable insights into the specific biological mechanisms of each cellular subpopulation, as well as their vital interplay within the tumor microenvironment.Methods:We recruited patients diagnosed with four distinct types of meningioma and performed single-cell RNA sequencing on their tumor samples, concurrently analyzing a publicly available dataset for comparison. Next, we separated the cells into discrete clusters and identified their unique identities. Using pseudotime analysis, we demonstrated cellular differentiation and dynamics. To investigate biological function, we employed weighted gene co-expression network analysis, gene regulatory network, and gene set enrichment analysis. Additionally, we conducted cell-cell communication analyses to characterize interactions among different clusters and validated a crucial interaction using multiple immunofluorescence staining.Results:The single-cell transcriptomic profiles for five meningioma of different pathological types demonstrated that neoplastic cells exhibited high inter-sample heterogeneity and diverse biological functions featured by metabolic regulation. A small cluster of neoplastic cells (N5 cluster, < 3%) was most proliferative, indicated by high expression of MKI67 and TOP2A. They were primarily observed in our atypical and transitional meningioma samples and located at the beginning of the pseudotime differentiation branch for neoplastic cells. Macrophages, the most abundant immune cells present, showed two distinct developmental trajectories, one promoting and the other suppressing meningioma growth, with the MIF-CD74 interaction serving as the primary signaling pathway for MIF signals in the tumor environment. Unexpectedly, despite its small cluster size, the N5 cluster demonstrated a significant contribution in this interaction. By staining pathological sections of more samples, we found that this interaction was widely present in different types of meningiomas.Conclusions:Meningioma neoplastic cells' diverse types cause inter-sample heterogeneity and a wide range of functions. Some proliferative neoplastic cell may educate macrophages, which promotes tumorigenesis possibly through the MIF-CD74 interaction. It provides novel clues for future potential therapeutic avenues.",37880655,PMC10599053,10.1186/s12967-023-04445-4,1
muscat detects subpopulation-specific state transitions from multi-sample multi-condition single-cell transcriptomics data,"Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has become an empowering technology to profile the transcriptomes of individual cells on a large scale. Early analyses of differential expression have aimed at identifying differences between subpopulations to identify subpopulation markers. More generally, such methods compare expression levels across sets of cells, thus leading to cross-condition analyses. Given the emergence of replicated multi-condition scRNA-seq datasets, an area of increasing focus is making sample-level inferences, termed here as differential state analysis; however, it is not clear which statistical framework best handles this situation. Here, we surveyed methods to perform cross-condition differential state analyses, including cell-level mixed models and methods based on aggregated pseudobulk data. To evaluate method performance, we developed a flexible simulation that mimics multi-sample scRNA-seq data. We analyzed scRNA-seq data from mouse cortex cells to uncover subpopulation-specific responses to lipopolysaccharide treatment, and provide robust tools for multi-condition analysis within the muscat R package.",33257685,PMC7705760,10.1038/s41467-020-19894-4,131
Transcriptome age of individual cell types inCaenorhabditis elegans,"The phylotranscriptomic analysis of development in several species revealed the expression of older and more conserved genes in midembryonic stages and younger and more divergent genes in early and late embryonic stages, which supported the hourglass mode of development. However, previous work only studied the transcriptome age of whole embryos or embryonic sublineages, leaving the cellular basis of the hourglass pattern and the variation of transcriptome ages among cell types unexplored. By analyzing both bulk and single-cell transcriptomic data, we studied the transcriptome age of the nematodeCaenorhabditis elegansthroughout development. Using the bulk RNA-seq data, we identified the morphogenesis phase in midembryonic development as the phylotypic stage with the oldest transcriptome and confirmed the results using whole-embryo transcriptome assembled from single-cell RNA-seq data. The variation in transcriptome ages among individual cell types remained small in early and midembryonic development and grew bigger in late embryonic and larval stages as cells and tissues differentiate. Lineages that give rise to certain tissues (e.g., hypodermis and some neurons) but not all recapitulated the hourglass pattern across development at the single-cell transcriptome level. Further analysis of the variation in transcriptome ages among the 128 neuron types inC. elegansnervous system found that a group of chemosensory neurons and their downstream interneurons expressed very young transcriptomes and may contribute to adaptation in recent evolution. Finally, the variation in transcriptome age among the neuron types, as well as the age of their cell fate regulators, led us to hypothesize the evolutionary history of some neuron types.",36812209,PMC9992843,10.1073/pnas.2216351120,1
Single-Cell Analysis of Hematopoietic Stem Cells,"The study of hematopoiesis has been revolutionized in recent years by the application of single-cell RNA sequencing technologies. The technique coupled with rapidly developing bioinformatic analysis has provided great insight into the cell type compositions of many populations previously defined by their cell surface phenotype. Moreover, transcriptomic information enables the identification of individual molecules and pathways which define novel cell populations and their transitions including cell lineage decisions. Combining single-cell transcriptional profiling with molecular perturbations allows functional analysis of individual factors in gene regulatory networks and better understanding of the earliest stages of malignant transformation. In this chapter we describe a comprehensive protocol for scRNA-Seq analysis of the mouse bone marrow, using both plate-based (low throughput) and droplet-based (high throughput) methods. The protocol includes instructions for sample preparation, an antibody panel for flow cytometric purification of hematopoietic progenitors with index sorting for plate-based analysis or in bulk for droplet-based methods. The plate-based protocol described in this chapter is a combination of the Smart-Seq2 and mcSCRB-Seq protocols, optimized in our laboratory. It utilizes off-the-shelf reagents for cDNA preparation, is amenable to automation using a liquid handler, and takes 4 days from preparation of the cells for sorting to producing a sequencing-ready library. The droplet-based method (using for instance the 10× Genomics platform) relies on the manufacturer's user guide and commercial reagents, and takes 3 days from isolation of the cells to the production of a library ready for sequencing.",34057731,,10.1007/978-1-0716-1425-9_22,1
In vivo transcriptional analysis of mice infected with Leishmania major unveils cellular heterogeneity and altered transcriptomic profiling at single-cell resolution,"Leishmania parasites cause cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL), a disease characterized by disfiguring, ulcerative skin lesions. Both parasite and host gene expression following infection with various Leishmania species has been investigated in vitro, but global transcriptional analysis following L. major infection in vivo is lacking. Thus, we conducted a comprehensive transcriptomic profiling study combining bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) to identify global changes in gene expression in vivo following L. major infection. Bulk RNA-Seq analysis revealed that host immune response pathways like the antigen processing and presentation pathway were significantly enriched amongst differentially expressed genes (DEGs) upon infection, while ribosomal pathways were significantly downregulated in infected mice compared to naive controls. scRNA-Seq analyses revealed cellular heterogeneity including distinct resident and recruited cell types in the skin following murine L. major infection. Within the individual immune cell types, several DEGs indicative of many interferon induced GTPases and antigen presentation molecules were significantly enhanced in the infected ears including macrophages, resident macrophages, and inflammatory monocytes. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of scRNA-Seq data indicated the antigen presentation pathway was increased with infection, while EIF2 signaling is the top downregulated pathway followed by eIF4/p70S6k and mTOR signaling in multiple cell types including macrophages, blood and lymphatic endothelial cells. Altogether, this transcriptomic profile highlights known recruitment of myeloid cells to lesions and recognizes a potential role for EIF2 signaling in murine L. major infection in vivo.",35789215,PMC9286232,10.1371/journal.pntd.0010518,4
Single-cell RNA-seq analysis of mouse preimplantation embryos by third-generation sequencing,"The development of next generation sequencing (NGS) platform-based single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) techniques has tremendously changed biological researches, while there are still many questions that cannot be addressed by them due to their short read lengths. We developed a novel scRNA-seq technology based on third-generation sequencing (TGS) platform (single-cell amplification and sequencing of full-length RNAs by Nanopore platform, SCAN-seq). SCAN-seq exhibited high sensitivity and accuracy comparable to NGS platform-based scRNA-seq methods. Moreover, we captured thousands of unannotated transcripts of diverse types, with high verification rate by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR)-coupled Sanger sequencing in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). Then, we used SCAN-seq to analyze the mouse preimplantation embryos. We could clearly distinguish cells at different developmental stages, and a total of 27,250 unannotated transcripts from 9,338 genes were identified, with many of which showed developmental stage-specific expression patterns. Finally, we showed that SCAN-seq exhibited high accuracy on determining allele-specific gene expression patterns within an individual cell. SCAN-seq makes a major breakthrough for single-cell transcriptome analysis field.",33378329,PMC7773192,10.1371/journal.pbio.3001017,29
Cardelino: computational integration of somatic clonal substructure and single-cell transcriptomes,"Bulk and single-cell DNA sequencing has enabled reconstructing clonal substructures of somatic tissues from frequency and cooccurrence patterns of somatic variants. However, approaches to characterize phenotypic variations between clones are not established. Here we present cardelino (https://github.com/single-cell-genetics/cardelino), a computational method for inferring the clonal tree configuration and the clone of origin of individual cells assayed using single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq). Cardelino flexibly integrates information from imperfect clonal trees inferred based on bulk exome-seq data, and sparse variant alleles expressed in scRNA-seq data. We apply cardelino to a published cancer dataset and to newly generated matched scRNA-seq and exome-seq data from 32 human dermal fibroblast lines, identifying hundreds of differentially expressed genes between cells from different somatic clones. These genes are frequently enriched for cell cycle and proliferation pathways, indicating a role for cell division genes in somatic evolution in healthy skin.",32203388,,10.1038/s41592-020-0766-3,18
Integration of single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics to reveal the glioblastoma heterogeneity,"Glioblastoma (GBM), a deadly brain tumor, is still one of a few lasting challenges of contemporary oncology. Current therapies fail to significantly improve patient survival due to GBM tremendous genetic, transcriptomic, immunological, and sex-dependent heterogeneity. Over the years, clinical differences between males and females were characterized. For instance, higher incidence of GBM in males or distinct responses to cancer chemotherapy and immunotherapy between males and females have been noted. Despite the introduction of single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics, these differences were not further investigated as studies were focused only on revealing the general picture of GBM heterogeneity. Hence, in this mini-review, we summarized the current state of knowledge on GBM heterogeneity revealed by single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics with regard to genetics, immunology, and sex-dependent differences. Additionally, we highlighted future research directions which would fill the gap of knowledge on the impact of patient's sex on the disease outcome.",36875988,PMC9978243,10.12688/f1000research.126243.2,0
A human stomach cell type transcriptome atlas,"Background:The identification of cell type-specific genes and their modification under different conditions is central to our understanding of human health and disease. The stomach, a hollow organ in the upper gastrointestinal tract, provides an acidic environment that contributes to microbial defence and facilitates the activity of secreted digestive enzymes to process food and nutrients into chyme. In contrast to other sections of the gastrointestinal tract, detailed descriptions of cell type gene enrichment profiles in the stomach are absent from the major single-cell sequencing-based atlases.Results:Here, we use an integrative correlation analysis method to predict human stomach cell type transcriptome signatures using unfractionated stomach RNAseq data from 359 individuals. We profile parietal, chief, gastric mucous, gastric enteroendocrine, mitotic, endothelial, fibroblast, macrophage, neutrophil, T-cell, and plasma cells, identifying over 1600 cell type-enriched genes.Conclusions:We uncover the cell type expression profile of several non-coding genes strongly associated with the progression of gastric cancer and, using a sex-based subset analysis, uncover a panel of male-only chief cell-enriched genes. This study provides a roadmap to further understand human stomach biology.",38355543,PMC10865703,10.1186/s12915-024-01812-5,0
Deciphering transcriptional and functional heterogeneity in hematopoiesis with single-cell genomics,"Purpose of review:Single-cell genomic approaches have uncovered cell fate biases and heterogeneity within hematopoietic subpopulations. However, standard single-cell transcriptomics suffers from high sampling noise, which particularly skews the distribution of lowly expressed genes, such as transcription factors (TFs). This might preclude the identification of rare transcripts that define cell identity and demarcate cell fate biases. Moreover, these studies need to go hand in hand with relevant functional assays to ensure that observed gene expression changes represent biologically meaningful alterations.Recent findings:Single-cell lineage tracing and functional validation studies have uncovered cell fate bias within transcriptionally distinct hematopoietic stem and progenitor subpopulations. Novel markers identified using these strategies have been proposed to prospectively isolate functionally distinct subpopulations, including long-term hematopoietic stem cells for ex vivo applications. Furthermore, the continuous nature of hematopoiesis has prompted the study of the relationship between stochastic transcriptional noise in hematopoietic TFs and cell fate determination.Summary:An understanding of the limitations of single-cell genomic approaches and follow-up functional assays is critical to discern the technical and biological contribution of noise in hematopoietic heterogeneity, to identify rare gene expression states, and to uncover functionally distinct subpopulations within hematopoiesis.Supplementary video:http://links.lww.com/COH/A23.",33901135,PMC8169609,10.1097/MOH.0000000000000657,3
Analytical distributions for detailed models of stochastic gene expression in eukaryotic cells,"The stochasticity of gene expression presents significant challenges to the modeling of genetic networks. A two-state model describing promoter switching, transcription, and messenger RNA (mRNA) decay is the standard model of stochastic mRNA dynamics in eukaryotic cells. Here, we extend this model to include mRNA maturation, cell division, gene replication, dosage compensation, and growth-dependent transcription. We derive expressions for the time-dependent distributions of nascent mRNA and mature mRNA numbers, provided two assumptions hold: 1) nascent mRNA dynamics are much faster than those of mature mRNA; and 2) gene-inactivation events occur far more frequently than gene-activation events. We confirm that thousands of eukaryotic genes satisfy these assumptions by using data from yeast, mouse, and human cells. We use the expressions to perform a sensitivity analysis of the coefficient of variation of mRNA fluctuations averaged over the cell cycle, for a large number of genes in mouse embryonic stem cells, identifying degradation and gene-activation rates as the most sensitive parameters. Furthermore, it is shown that, despite the model's complexity, the time-dependent distributions predicted by our model are generally well approximated by the negative binomial distribution. Finally, we extend our model to include translation, protein decay, and auto-regulatory feedback, and derive expressions for the approximate time-dependent protein-number distributions, assuming slow protein decay. Our expressions enable us to study how complex biological processes contribute to the fluctuations of gene products in eukaryotic cells, as well as allowing a detailed quantitative comparison with experimental data via maximum-likelihood methods.",32071224,PMC7060679,10.1073/pnas.1910888117,52
Comparative transcriptome analysis of T lymphocyte subpopulations and identification of critical regulators defining porcine thymocyte identity,"Introduction:The development and migration of T cells in the thymus and peripheral tissues are crucial for maintaining adaptive immunity in mammals. However, the regulatory mechanisms underlying T cell development and thymocyte identity formation in pigs remain largely underexplored.Method:Here, by integrating bulk and single-cell RNA-sequencing data, we investigated regulatory signatures of porcine thymus and lymph node T cells.Results:The comparison of T cell subpopulations derived from porcine thymus and lymph nodes revealed that their transcriptomic differences were influenced more by tissue origin than by T cell phenotypes, and that lymph node cells exhibited greater transcriptional diversity than thymocytes. Through weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), we identified the key modules and candidate hub genes regulating the heterogeneity of T cell subpopulations. Further, we integrated the porcine thymocyte dataset with peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) dataset to systematically compare transcriptomic differences between T cell types from different tissues. Based on single-cell datasets, we further identified the key transcription factors (TFs) responsible for maintaining porcine thymocyte identity and unveiled that these TFs coordinately regulated the entire T cell development process. Finally, we performed GWAS of cell type-specific differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 30 complex traits, and found that the DEGs in thymus-related and peripheral blood-related cell types, especially CD4_SP cluster and CD8-related cluster, were significantly associated with pig productive and reproductive traits.Discussion:Our findings provide an insight into T cell development and lay a foundation for further exploring the porcine immune system and genetic mechanisms underlying complex traits in pigs.",38384475,PMC10879363,10.3389/fimmu.2024.1339787,0
The integrated transcriptome bioinformatics analysis identifies key genes and cellular components for proliferative diabetic retinopathy,"Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (PDR) is a chronic complication of Diabetes and the main cause of blindness among the world's working population at present. While there have been many studies on the pathogenesis of PDR, its intrinsic molecular mechanisms have not yet been fully elucidated. In recent years, several studies have employed bulk RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to profile differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and cellular components associated with PDR. This study adds to this expanding body of work by identifying PDR's target genes and cellular components by conducting an integrated transcriptome bioinformatics analysis. This study integrately examined two public bulk RNA-seq datasets(including 11 PDR patients and 7 controls) and one single-cell RNA-seq datasets(including 5 PDR patients) of Fibro (Vascular) Membranes (FVMs) from PDR patients and control. A total of 176 genes were identified as DEGs between PDR patients and control among both bulk RNA-seq datasets. Based on these DEGs, 14 proteins were identified in the protein overlap within the significant ligand-receptor interactions of retinal FVMs and Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) network, three of which were associated with PDR (CD44, ICAM1, POSTN), and POSTN might act as key ligand. This finding may provide novel gene signatures and therapeutic targets for PDR.",36409751,PMC9678275,10.1371/journal.pone.0277952,0
Defining the three cell lineages of the human blastocyst by single-cell RNA-seq,"Here, we provide fundamental insights into early human development by single-cell RNA-sequencing of human and mouse preimplantation embryos. We elucidate conserved transcriptional programs along with those that are human specific. Importantly, we validate our RNA-sequencing findings at the protein level, which further reveals differences in human and mouse embryo gene expression. For example, we identify several genes exclusively expressed in the human pluripotent epiblast, including the transcription factor KLF17. Key components of the TGF-β signalling pathway, including NODAL, GDF3, TGFBR1/ALK5, LEFTY1, SMAD2, SMAD4 and TDGF1, are also enriched in the human epiblast. Intriguingly, inhibition of TGF-β signalling abrogates NANOG expression in human epiblast cells, consistent with a requirement for this pathway in pluripotency. Although the key trophectoderm factors Id2, Elf5 and Eomes are exclusively localized to this lineage in the mouse, the human orthologues are either absent or expressed in alternative lineages. Importantly, we also identify genes with conserved expression dynamics, including Foxa2/FOXA2, which we show is restricted to the primitive endoderm in both human and mouse embryos. Comparison of the human epiblast to existing embryonic stem cells (hESCs) reveals conservation of pluripotency but also additional pathways more enriched in hESCs. Our analysis highlights significant differences in human preimplantation development compared with mouse and provides a molecular blueprint to understand human embryogenesis and its relationship to stem cells.",26293300,PMC4582176,10.1242/dev.123547,184
MorphoSeq: Full Single-Cell Transcriptome Dynamics Up to Gastrulation in a Chordate,"Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides a leap forward in resolving cellular diversity and developmental trajectories but fails to comprehensively delineate the spatial organization and precise cellular makeup of individual embryos. Here, we reconstruct from scRNA-seq and light sheet imaging data a canonical digital embryo that captures the genome-wide gene expression trajectory of every single cell at every cell division in the 18 lineages up to gastrulation in the ascidian Phallusia mammillata. By using high-coverage scRNA-seq, we devise a computational framework that stratifies single cells of individual embryos into cell types without prior knowledge. Unbiased transcriptome data analysis mapped each cell's physical position and lineage history, yielding the complete history of gene expression at the genome-wide level for every single cell in a developing embryo. A comparison of individual embryos reveals both extensive reproducibility between symmetric embryo sides and a large inter-embryonic variability due to small differences in embryogenesis timing.",32315617,PMC7237864,10.1016/j.cell.2020.03.055,18
Transcriptome Analysis at the Single-Cell Level Using SMART Technology,"RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is a powerful method for analyzing cell state, with minimal bias, and has broad applications within the biological sciences. However, transcriptome analysis of seemingly homogenous cell populations may in fact overlook significant heterogeneity that can be uncovered at the single-cell level. The ultra-low amount of RNA contained in a single cell requires extraordinarily sensitive and reproducible transcriptome analysis methods. As next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies mature, transcriptome profiling by RNA-seq is increasingly being used to decipher the molecular signature of individual cells. This unit describes an ultra-sensitive and reproducible protocol to generate cDNA and sequencing libraries directly from single cells or RNA inputs ranging from 10 pg to 10 ng. Important considerations for working with minute RNA inputs are given. © 2016 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",27723086,,10.1002/cpmb.23,3
Transcriptomic correlates of electrophysiological and morphological diversity within and across excitatory and inhibitory neuron classes,"In order to further our understanding of how gene expression contributes to key functional properties of neurons, we combined publicly accessible gene expression, electrophysiology, and morphology measurements to identify cross-cell type correlations between these data modalities. Building on our previous work using a similar approach, we distinguished between correlations which were ""class-driven,"" meaning those that could be explained by differences between excitatory and inhibitory cell classes, and those that reflected graded phenotypic differences within classes. Taking cell class identity into account increased the degree to which our results replicated in an independent dataset as well as their correspondence with known modes of ion channel function based on the literature. We also found a smaller set of genes whose relationships to electrophysiological or morphological properties appear to be specific to either excitatory or inhibitory cell types. Next, using data from PatchSeq experiments, allowing simultaneous single-cell characterization of gene expression and electrophysiology, we found that some of the gene-property correlations observed across cell types were further predictive of within-cell type heterogeneity. In summary, we have identified a number of relationships between gene expression, electrophysiology, and morphology that provide testable hypotheses for future studies.",31211786,PMC6599125,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007113,14
Combined Genome and Transcriptome (G&T) Sequencing of Single Cells,"The simultaneous examination of a single cell's genome and transcriptome presents scientists with a powerful tool to study genetic variability and its effect on gene expression. In this chapter, we describe the library generation method for combined genome and transcriptome sequencing (G&T-seq) originally described by Macaulay et al. (Nat Protoc 11(11):2081-2103, 2016; Nat Methods 12(6):519-522, 2015). This includes some alterations we made to improve robustness of this process for both the novice user and laboratories that want to deploy this method at scale. Using this method, genomic DNA and full-length mRNA from single cells are separated, amplified, and converted into Illumina sequencer-compatible sequencing libraries.",31028647,,10.1007/978-1-4939-9240-9_20,3
Classical Dichotomy of Macrophages and Alternative Activation Models Proposed with Technological Progress,"Macrophages are important immune cells that participate in the regulation of inflammation in implant dentistry, and their activation/polarization state is considered to be the basis for their functions. The classic dichotomy activation model is commonly accepted, however, due to the discovery of macrophage heterogeneity and more functional and iconic exploration at different technologies; some studies have discovered the shortcomings of the dichotomy model and have put forward the concept of alternative activation models through the application of advanced technologies such as cytometry by time-of-flight (CyTOF), single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq), and hyperspectral image (HSI). These alternative models have great potential to help macrophages divide phenotypes and functional genes.",34722776,PMC8553456,10.1155/2021/9910596,4
Single-Cell Transcriptome Analysis Profile of Meniscal Tissue Macrophages in Human Osteoarthritis,"Osteoarthritis (OA) has long been considered as a degenerative disease, but growing evidence suggests that inflammation plays a vital role in its pathogenesis. Unlike rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases, inflammation in OA is chronic and, in relatively low grade, mainly mediated by the innate immune system, especially macrophages. However, due to its low abundance, there is a lack of systematic studies on macrophages in the OA condition. Here, we have used single-cell RNA sequencing analysis to gain insight into the heterogeneity and functional specialization of human knee macrophages. We also compared the gene expression profiles of macrophages in healthy people and OA patients and found the characteristic changes of special macrophages in the OA knee. We believe that this in-depth understanding of the basis of OA inflammation will bring hope for the development of new therapies.",32775469,PMC7407017,10.1155/2020/8127281,7
Single-cell nanobiopsy enables multigenerational longitudinal transcriptomics of cancer cells,"Single-cell RNA sequencing has revolutionized our understanding of cellular heterogeneity, but routine methods require cell lysis and fail to probe the dynamic trajectories responsible for cellular state transitions, which can only be inferred. Here, we present a nanobiopsy platform that enables the injection of exogenous molecules and multigenerational longitudinal cytoplasmic sampling from a single cell and its progeny. The technique is based on scanning ion conductance microscopy (SICM) and, as a proof of concept, was applied to longitudinally profile the transcriptome of single glioblastoma (GBM) brain tumor cells in vitro over 72 hours. The GBM cells were biopsied before and after exposure to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and our results suggest that treatment either induces or selects for more transcriptionally stable cells. We envision the nanobiopsy will contribute to transforming standard single-cell transcriptomics from a static analysis into a dynamic assay.",38446884,PMC10917339,10.1126/sciadv.adl0515,2
Tutorial: guidelines for the experimental design of single-cell RNA sequencing studies,"Single-cell RNA sequencing is at the forefront of high-resolution phenotyping experiments for complex samples. Although this methodology requires specialized equipment and expertise, it is now widely applied in research. However, it is challenging to create broadly applicable experimental designs because each experiment requires the user to make informed decisions about sample preparation, RNA sequencing and data analysis. To facilitate this decision-making process, in this tutorial we summarize current methodological and analytical options, and discuss their suitability for a range of research scenarios. Specifically, we provide information about best practices for the separation of individual cells and provide an overview of current single-cell capture methods at different cellular resolutions and scales. Methods for the preparation of RNA sequencing libraries vary profoundly across applications, and we discuss features important for an informed selection process. An erroneous or biased analysis can lead to misinterpretations or obscure biologically important information. We provide a guide to the major data processing steps and options for meaningful data interpretation. These guidelines will serve as a reference to support users in building a single-cell experimental framework-from sample preparation to data interpretation-that is tailored to the underlying research context.",30446749,,10.1038/s41596-018-0073-y,84
Bayesian log-normal deconvolution for enhanced in silico microdissection of bulk gene expression data,"Deconvolution of bulk gene expression profiles into the cellular components is pivotal to portraying tissue's complex cellular make-up, such as the tumor microenvironment. However, the inherently variable nature of gene expression requires a comprehensive statistical model and reliable prior knowledge of individual cell types that can be obtained from single-cell RNA sequencing. We introduce BLADE (Bayesian Log-normAl Deconvolution), a unified Bayesian framework to estimate both cellular composition and gene expression profiles for each cell type. Unlike previous comprehensive statistical approaches, BLADE can handle > 20 types of cells due to the efficient variational inference. Throughout an intensive evaluation with > 700 simulated and real datasets, BLADE demonstrated enhanced robustness against gene expression variability and better completeness than conventional methods, in particular, to reconstruct gene expression profiles of each cell type. In summary, BLADE is a powerful tool to unravel heterogeneous cellular activity in complex biological systems from standard bulk gene expression data.",34671028,PMC8528834,10.1038/s41467-021-26328-2,5
Application of single-cell RNA sequencing in embryonic development,"Embryonic development is a complex process that is regulated by a series of precise cellular behaviours. The limited number of cells in the early stages of embryonic development represents a challenge for studying early gene regulation and maintaining cell sternness. Single-cell sequencing is a new technology for high-throughput sequencing analysis at the single-cell level that not only reflects the heterogeneity between cells but also reveals gene expression characteristics in different cells from limited samples. Currently, the widespread application of single-cell RNA sequencing technology is gradually changing our understanding of disease pathogenesis. This article reviews the application of single-cell RNA sequencing in embryonic development in recent years and provides innovative ideas for research on embryonic development and the treatment of diseases related to embryonic development.",32781204,,10.1016/j.ygeno.2020.08.007,4
Cell type-specific transcriptomics of esophageal adenocarcinoma as a scalable alternative for single cell transcriptomics,"Single-cell transcriptomics have revolutionized our understanding of the cell composition of tumors and allowed us to identify new subtypes of cells. Despite rapid technological advancements, single-cell analysis remains resource-intense hampering the scalability that is required to profile a sufficient number of samples for clinical associations. Therefore, more scalable approaches are needed to understand the contribution of individual cell types to the development and treatment response of solid tumors such as esophageal adenocarcinoma where comprehensive genomic studies have only led to a small number of targeted therapies. Due to the limited treatment options and late diagnosis, esophageal adenocarcinoma has a poor prognosis. Understanding the interaction between and dysfunction of individual cell populations provides an opportunity for the development of new interventions. In an attempt to address the technological and clinical needs, we developed a protocol for the separation of esophageal carcinoma tissue into leukocytes (CD45+), epithelial cells (EpCAM+), and fibroblasts (two out of PDGFRα, CD90, anti-fibroblast) by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and subsequent RNA sequencing. We confirm successful separation of the three cell populations by mapping their transcriptomic profiles to reference cell lineage expression data. Gene-level analysis further supports the isolation of individual cell populations with high expression of CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19, and CD20 for leukocytes, CDH1 and MUC1 for epithelial cells, and FAP, SMA, COL1A1, and COL3A1 for fibroblasts. As a proof of concept, we profiled tumor samples of nine patients and explored expression differences in the three cell populations between tumor and normal tissue. Interestingly, we found that angiogenesis-related genes were upregulated in fibroblasts isolated from tumors compared with normal tissue. Overall, we suggest our protocol as a complementary and more scalable approach compared with single-cell RNA sequencing to investigate associations between clinical parameters and transcriptomic alterations of specific cell populations in esophageal adenocarcinoma.",32255255,PMC7266280,10.1002/1878-0261.12680,7
Integrating single cell expression quantitative trait loci summary statistics to understand complex trait risk genes,"Transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) is a popular approach to dissect the functional consequence of disease associated non-coding variants. Most existing TWAS use bulk tissues and may not have the resolution to reveal cell-type specific target genes. Single-cell expression quantitative trait loci (sc-eQTL) datasets are emerging. The largest bulk- and sc-eQTL datasets are most conveniently available as summary statistics, but have not been broadly utilized in TWAS. Here, we present a new method EXPRESSO (EXpression PREdiction with Summary Statistics Only), to analyze sc-eQTL summary statistics, which also integrates 3D genomic data and epigenomic annotation to prioritize causal variants. EXPRESSO substantially improves existing methods. We apply EXPRESSO to analyze multi-ancestry GWAS datasets for 14 autoimmune diseases. EXPRESSO uniquely identifies 958 novel gene x trait associations, which is 26% more than the second-best method. Among them, 492 are unique to cell type level analysis and missed by TWAS using whole blood. We also develop a cell type aware drug repurposing pipeline, which leverages EXPRESSO results to identify drug compounds that can reverse disease gene expressions in relevant cell types. Our results point to multiple drugs with therapeutic potentials, including metformin for type 1 diabetes, and vitamin K for ulcerative colitis.",38769300,,10.1038/s41467-024-48143-1,0
An integrated single cell and spatial transcriptomic map of human white adipose tissue,"To date, single-cell studies of human white adipose tissue (WAT) have been based on small cohort sizes and no cellular consensus nomenclature exists. Herein, we performed a comprehensive meta-analysis of publicly available and newly generated single-cell, single-nucleus, and spatial transcriptomic results from human subcutaneous, omental, and perivascular WAT. Our high-resolution map is built on data from ten studies and allowed us to robustly identify >60 subpopulations of adipocytes, fibroblast and adipogenic progenitors, vascular, and immune cells. Using these results, we deconvolved spatial and bulk transcriptomic data from nine additional cohorts to provide spatial and clinical dimensions to the map. This identified cell-cell interactions as well as relationships between specific cell subtypes and insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, adipocyte volume, and lipolysis upon long-term weight changes. Altogether, our meta-map provides a rich resource defining the cellular and microarchitectural landscape of human WAT and describes the associations between specific cell types and metabolic states.",36922516,PMC10017705,10.1038/s41467-023-36983-2,24
Liver in infections: a single-cell and spatial transcriptomics perspective,"The liver is an immune organ that plays a vital role in the detection, capture, and clearance of pathogens and foreign antigens that invade the human body. During acute and chronic infections, the liver transforms from a tolerant to an active immune state. The defence mechanism of the liver mainly depends on a complicated network of intrahepatic and translocated immune cells and non-immune cells. Therefore, a comprehensive liver cell atlas in both healthy and diseased states is needed for new therapeutic target development and disease intervention improvement. With the development of high-throughput single-cell technology, we can now decipher heterogeneity, differentiation, and intercellular communication at the single-cell level in sophisticated organs and complicated diseases. In this concise review, we aimed to summarise the advancement of emerging high-throughput single-cell technologies and re-define our understanding of liver function towards infections, including hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, Plasmodium, schistosomiasis, endotoxemia, and corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We also unravel previously unknown pathogenic pathways and disease mechanisms for the development of new therapeutic targets. As high-throughput single-cell technologies mature, their integration into spatial transcriptomics, multiomics, and clinical data analysis will aid in patient stratification and in developing effective treatment plans for patients with or without liver injury due to infectious diseases.",37430371,PMC10332047,10.1186/s12929-023-00945-z,1
Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of the embryogenic callus clarifies the spatiotemporal developmental trajectories of the early somatic embryo in Dimocarpus longan,"Plant embryogenic calli (ECs) can undergo somatic embryogenesis to regenerate plants. This process is mediated by regulatory factors, such as transcription factors and specifically expressed genes, but the precise molecular mechanisms underlying somatic embryogenesis at the single-cell level remain unclear. In this study, we performed high-resolution single-cell RNA sequencing analysis to determine the cellular changes in the EC of the woody plant species Dimocarpus longan (longan) and clarify the continuous cell differentiation trajectories at the transcriptome level. The highly heterogeneous cells in the EC were divided into 12 putative clusters (e.g., proliferating, meristematic, vascular, and epidermal cell clusters). We determined cluster-enriched expression marker genes and found that overexpression of the epidermal cell marker gene GDSL ESTERASE/LIPASE-1 inhibited the hydrolysis of triacylglycerol. In addition, the stability of autophagy was critical for the somatic embryogenesis of longan. The pseudo-timeline analysis elucidated the continuous cell differentiation trajectories from early embryonic cell division to vascular and epidermal cell differentiation during the somatic embryogenesis of longan. Moreover, key transcriptional regulators associated with cell fates were revealed. We found that ETHYLENE RESPONSIVE FACTOR 6 was characterized as a heat-sensitive factor that negatively regulates longan somatic embryogenesis under high-temperature stress conditions. The results of this study provide new spatiotemporal insights into cell division and differentiation during longan somatic embryogenesis at single-cell resolution.",37235696,,10.1111/tpj.16319,2
Transcriptome Analysis Reveals a Two-Gene Signature Links to Motor Progression and Alterations of Immune Cells in Parkinson's Disease,"Background:The motor impairment in Parkinson's disease (PD) can be managed but effective treatments for stopping or slowing the disease process are lacking. The advent of transcriptomics studies in PD shed light on the development of promising measures to predict disease progression and discover novel therapeutic strategies.Objective:To reveal the potential role of transcripts in the motor impairment progression of patients with PD via transcriptome analysis.Methods:We separately analyzed the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between PD cases and healthy controls in two cohorts using whole blood bulk transcriptome data. Based on the intersection of DEGs, we established a prognostic signature by regularized regression and Cox proportional hazards analysis. We further performed immune cell analysis and single-cell RNA sequencing analysis to study the biological features of this signature.Results:We identified a two-gene-based prognostic signature that links to PD motor progression and the two-gene signature-derived risk score was associated with several types of immune cells in blood. Notably, the fraction of neutrophils increased 5% and CD4+ T cells decreased 7% in patients with high-risk scores compared to that in patients with low-risk scores, suggesting these two types of immune cells might play key roles in the prognosis of PD. We also observed the downregulated genes in PD patients with high-risk scores that enriched in PD-associated pathways from iPSC-derived dopaminergic neurons single-cell RNA sequencing analysis.Conclusion:We identified a two-gene signature linked to the motor progression in PD, which provides new insights into the motor prognosis of PD.",36591658,PMC9912738,10.3233/JPD-223454,0
Novel CAF-identifiers via transcriptomic and protein level analysis in HNSC patients,"Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), a prominent component of the tumor microenvironment, play an important role in tumor development, invasion, and drug resistance. The expression of distinct ""CAF-markers"" which separates CAFs from normal fibroblasts and epithelial cells, have traditionally been used to identify them. These commonly used CAF-markers have been reported to differ greatly across different CAF subpopulations, even within a cancer type. Using an unbiased -omic approach from public data and in-house RNAseq data from patient derived novel CAF cells, TIMP-1, SPARC, COL1A2, COL3A1 and COL1A1 were identified as potential CAF-markers by differential gene expression analysis using publicly available single cell sequencing data and in-house RNAseq data to distinguish CAF populations from tumor epithelia and normal oral fibroblasts. Experimental validation using qPCR and immunofluorescence revealed CAF-specific higher expression of TIMP-1 and COL1A2 as compared to other markers in 5 novel CAF cells, derived from patients of diverse gender, habits and different locations of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC). Upon immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of FFPE blocks however, COL1A2 showed better differential staining between tumor epithelia and tumor stroma. Similar data science driven approach utilizing single cell sequencing and RNAseq data from stabilized CAFs can be employed to identify CAF-markers in various cancers.",37626157,PMC10457345,10.1038/s41598-023-40908-w,1
Mapping Human Pluripotent Stem Cell-derived Erythroid Differentiation by Single-cell Transcriptome Analysis,"There is an imbalance between the supply and demand of functional red blood cells (RBCs) in clinical applications. This imbalance can be addressed by regenerating RBCs using several in vitro methods. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) can handle the low supply of cord blood and the ethical issues in embryonic stem cell research, and provide a promising strategy to eliminate immune rejection. However, no complete single-cell level differentiation pathway exists for the iPSC-derived erythroid differentiation system. In this study, we used iPSC line BC1 to establish a RBC regeneration system. The 10X Genomics single-cell transcriptome platform was used to map the cell lineage and differentiation trajectory on day 14 of the regeneration system. We observed that iPSC differentiation was not synchronized during embryoid body (EB) culture. The cells (on day 14) mainly consisted of mesodermal and various blood cells, similar to the yolk sac hematopoiesis. We identified six cell classifications and characterized the regulatory transcription factor (TF) networks and cell-cell contacts underlying the system. iPSCs undergo two transformations during the differentiation trajectory, accompanied by the dynamic expression of cell adhesion molecules and estrogen-responsive genes. We identified erythroid cells at different stages, such as burst-forming unit erythroid (BFU-E) and orthochromatic erythroblast (ortho-E) cells, and found that the regulation of TFs (e.g., TFDP1 and FOXO3) is erythroid-stage specific. Immune erythroid cells were identified in our system. This study provides systematic theoretical guidance for optimizing the iPSC-derived erythroid differentiation system, and this system is a useful model for simulating in vivo hematopoietic development and differentiation.",34284135,PMC8864192,10.1016/j.gpb.2021.03.009,5
Domain generalization enables general cancer cell annotation in single-cell and spatial transcriptomics,"Single-cell and spatial transcriptome sequencing, two recently optimized transcriptome sequencing methods, are increasingly used to study cancer and related diseases. Cell annotation, particularly for malignant cell annotation, is essential and crucial for in-depth analyses in these studies. However, current algorithms lack accuracy and generalization, making it difficult to consistently and rapidly infer malignant cells from pan-cancer data. To address this issue, we present Cancer-Finder, a domain generalization-based deep-learning algorithm that can rapidly identify malignant cells in single-cell data with an average accuracy of 95.16%. More importantly, by replacing the single-cell training data with spatial transcriptomic datasets, Cancer-Finder can accurately identify malignant spots on spatial slides. Applying Cancer-Finder to 5 clear cell renal cell carcinoma spatial transcriptomic samples, Cancer-Finder demonstrates a good ability to identify malignant spots and identifies a gene signature consisting of 10 genes that are significantly co-localized and enriched at the tumor-normal interface and have a strong correlation with the prognosis of clear cell renal cell carcinoma patients. In conclusion, Cancer-Finder is an efficient and extensible tool for malignant cell annotation.",38431724,PMC10908802,10.1038/s41467-024-46413-6,1
"A simple, scalable approach to building a cross-platform transcriptome atlas","Gene expression atlases have transformed our understanding of the development, composition and function of human tissues. New technologies promise improved cellular or molecular resolution, and have led to the identification of new cell types, or better defined cell states. But as new technologies emerge, information derived on old platforms becomes obsolete. We demonstrate that it is possible to combine a large number of different profiling experiments summarised from dozens of laboratories and representing hundreds of donors, to create an integrated molecular map of human tissue. As an example, we combine 850 samples from 38 platforms to build an integrated atlas of human blood cells. We achieve robust and unbiased cell type clustering using a variance partitioning method, selecting genes with low platform bias relative to biological variation. Other than an initial rescaling, no other transformation to the primary data is applied through batch correction or renormalisation. Additional data, including single-cell datasets, can be projected for comparison, classification and annotation. The resulting atlas provides a multi-scaled approach to visualise and analyse the relationships between sets of genes and blood cell lineages, including the maturation and activation of leukocytes in vivo and in vitro. In allowing for data integration across hundreds of studies, we address a key reproduciblity challenge which is faced by any new technology. This allows us to draw on the deep phenotypes and functional annotations that accompany traditional profiling methods, and provide important context to the high cellular resolution of single cell profiling. Here, we have implemented the blood atlas in the open access Stemformatics.org platform, drawing on its extensive collection of curated transcriptome data. The method is simple, scalable and amenable for rapid deployment in other biological systems or computational workflows.",32986694,PMC7544119,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008219,8
Deciphering the distinct transcriptomic and gene regulatory map in adult macaque basal ganglia cells,"Background:The basal ganglia are a complex of interconnected subcortical structures located beneath the mammalian cerebral cortex. The degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the basal ganglia is the primary pathological feature of Parkinson's disease. Due to a lack of integrated analysis of multiomics datasets across multiple basal ganglia brain regions, very little is known about the regulatory mechanisms of this area.Findings:We utilized high-throughput transcriptomic and epigenomic analysis to profile over 270,000 single-nucleus cells to create a cellular atlas of the basal ganglia, characterizing the cellular composition of 4 regions of basal ganglia in adult macaque brain, including the striatum, substantia nigra (SN), globus pallidum, and amygdala. We found a distinct epigenetic regulation on gene expression of neuronal and nonneuronal cells across regions in basal ganglia. We identified a cluster of SN-specific astrocytes associated with neurodegenerative diseases and further explored the conserved and primate-specific transcriptomics in SN cell types across human, macaque, and mouse. Finally, we integrated our epigenetic landscape of basal ganglia cells with human disease heritability and identified a regulatory module consisting of candidate cis-regulatory elements that are specific to medium spiny neurons and associated with schizophrenia.Conclusions:In general, our macaque basal ganglia atlas provides valuable insights into the comprehensive transcriptome and epigenome of the most important and populous cell populations in the macaque basal ganglia. We have identified 49 cell types based on transcriptomic profiles and 47 cell types based on epigenomic profiles, some of which exhibit region specificity, and characterized the molecular relationships underlying these brain regions.",38091510,PMC10716911,10.1093/gigascience/giad095,0
The Application of Single-Cell RNA Sequencing in Studies of Autoimmune Diseases: a Comprehensive Review,"Complex composition is one of the most important features of the immune system, involving many types of organs, tissues, cells, and molecules that perform immune functions. The normal function of each component of the immune system is the guarantee for maintaining the relatively stable immune function of the body. When the self-immune tolerance mechanism of the body is unregulated or destroyed, the immune system reacts to autoantigens, resulting in damage to self-tissues and organs or an immunopathological state with abnormal functions. Autoimmune diseases are diverse, and their pathogenesis is complicated. Various immune cells and their interactions play significant roles in the occurrence and development of diseases. The solution to heterogeneity of immune cells is the basic science and translational understanding of how genes and the environment interact to induce disease so that we can develop personalized medicine, a goal that has to this point eluded scientists. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) refers to a new technique allowing high-throughput sequencing analysis of the whole transcriptome to reveal the gene expression status of individual cells. It has emerged as an indispensable tool in the field of life science research, and can help identify the complex mechanism of cell heterogeneity, discover new cell subsets, and help uncover the molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis, the evolution of disorders, and drug resistance. This information can provide us with new strategies for diagnosis and prognostic evaluation, as well as monitoring treatment responses. In this review, we summarize the crucial experimental procedures used for single-cell RNA sequencing, and the current applications of this technique to study autoimmune diseases are described in detail. This technique will be widely used in more in-depth studies of autoimmune diseases and will contribute to the diagnosis and therapies of these disorders.",33236283,,10.1007/s12016-020-08813-6,15
TSEE: an elastic embedding method to visualize the dynamic gene expression patterns of time series single-cell RNA sequencing data,"Background:Time series single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data are emerging. However, the analysis of time series scRNA-seq data could be compromised by 1) distortion created by assorted sources of data collection and generation across time samples and 2) inheritance of cell-to-cell variations by stochastic dynamic patterns of gene expression. This calls for the development of an algorithm able to visualize time series scRNA-seq data in order to reveal latent structures and uncover dynamic transition processes.Results:In this study, we propose an algorithm, termed time series elastic embedding (TSEE), by incorporating experimental temporal information into the elastic embedding (EE) method, in order to visualize time series scRNA-seq data. TSEE extends the EE algorithm by penalizing the proximal placement of latent points that correspond to data points otherwise separated by experimental time intervals. TSEE is herein used to visualize time series scRNA-seq datasets of embryonic developmental processed in human and zebrafish. We demonstrate that TSEE outperforms existing methods (e.g. PCA, tSNE and EE) in preserving local and global structures as well as enhancing the temporal resolution of samples. Meanwhile, TSEE reveals the dynamic oscillation patterns of gene expression waves during zebrafish embryogenesis.Conclusions:TSEE can efficiently visualize time series scRNA-seq data by diluting the distortions of assorted sources of data variation across time stages and achieve the temporal resolution enhancement by preserving temporal order and structure. TSEE uncovers the subtle dynamic structures of gene expression patterns, facilitating further downstream dynamic modeling and analysis of gene expression processes. The computational framework of TSEE is generalizable by allowing the incorporation of other sources of information.",30967106,PMC6456934,10.1186/s12864-019-5477-8,7
"An in vitro model of tumor heterogeneity resolves genetic, epigenetic, and stochastic sources of cell state variability","Tumor heterogeneity is a primary cause of treatment failure and acquired resistance in cancer patients. Even in cancers driven by a single mutated oncogene, variability in response to targeted therapies is well known. The existence of additional genomic alterations among tumor cells can only partially explain this variability. As such, nongenetic factors are increasingly seen as critical contributors to tumor relapse and acquired resistance in cancer. Here, we show that both genetic and nongenetic factors contribute to targeted drug response variability in an experimental model of tumor heterogeneity. We observe significant variability to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibition among and within multiple versions and clonal sublines of PC9, a commonly used EGFR mutant nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell line. We resolve genetic, epigenetic, and stochastic components of this variability using a theoretical framework in which distinct genetic states give rise to multiple epigenetic ""basins of attraction,"" across which cells can transition driven by stochastic noise. Using mutational impact analysis, single-cell differential gene expression, and correlations among Gene Ontology (GO) terms to connect genomics to transcriptomics, we establish a baseline for genetic differences driving drug response variability among PC9 cell line versions. Applying the same approach to clonal sublines, we conclude that drug response variability in all but one of the sublines is due to epigenetic differences; in the other, it is due to genetic alterations. Finally, using a clonal drug response assay together with stochastic simulations, we attribute subclonal drug response variability within sublines to stochastic cell fate decisions and confirm that one subline likely contains genetic resistance mutations that emerged in the absence of drug treatment.",34061819,PMC8195356,10.1371/journal.pbio.3000797,14
Integration of single-cell RNA-seq data into population models to characterize cancer metabolism,"Metabolic reprogramming is a general feature of cancer cells. Regrettably, the comprehensive quantification of metabolites in biological specimens does not promptly translate into knowledge on the utilization of metabolic pathways. By estimating fluxes across metabolic pathways, computational models hold the promise to bridge this gap between data and biological functionality. These models currently portray the average behavior of cell populations however, masking the inherent heterogeneity that is part and parcel of tumorigenesis as much as drug resistance. To remove this limitation, we propose single-cell Flux Balance Analysis (scFBA) as a computational framework to translate single-cell transcriptomes into single-cell fluxomes. We show that the integration of single-cell RNA-seq profiles of cells derived from lung adenocarcinoma and breast cancer patients into a multi-scale stoichiometric model of a cancer cell population: significantly 1) reduces the space of feasible single-cell fluxomes; 2) allows to identify clusters of cells with different growth rates within the population; 3) points out the possible metabolic interactions among cells via exchange of metabolites. The scFBA suite of MATLAB functions is available at https://github.com/BIMIB-DISCo/scFBA, as well as the case study datasets.",30818329,PMC6413955,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006733,40
Transcriptomic diversity of cell types across the adult human brain,"The human brain directs complex behaviors, ranging from fine motor skills to abstract intelligence, but the diversity of cell types that support these skills has not been fully described. In this work, we used single-nucleus RNA sequencing to systematically survey cells across the entire adult human brain. We sampled more than three million nuclei from approximately 100 dissections across the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain in three postmortem donors. Our analysis identified 461 clusters and 3313 subclusters organized largely according to developmental origins and revealing high diversity in midbrain and hindbrain neurons. Astrocytes and oligodendrocyte-lineage cells also exhibited regional diversity at multiple scales. The transcriptomic census of the entire human brain presented in this work provides a resource for understanding the molecular diversity of the human brain in health and disease.",37824663,,10.1126/science.add7046,46
Single-cell profiling for advancing birth defects research and prevention,"Cellular analysis of developmental processes and toxicities has traditionally entailed bulk methods (e.g., transcriptomics) that lack single cell resolution or tissue localization methods (e.g., immunostaining) that allow only a few genes to be monitored in each experiment. Recent technological advances have enabled interrogation of genomic function at the single-cell level, providing new opportunities to unravel developmental pathways and processes with unprecedented resolution. Here, we review emerging technologies of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to globally characterize the gene expression sets of different cell types and how different cell types emerge from earlier cell states in development. Cell atlases of experimental embryology and human embryogenesis at single-cell resolution will provide an encyclopedia of genes that define key stages from gastrulation to organogenesis. This technology, combined with computational models to discover key organizational principles, was recognized by Science magazine as the ""Breakthrough of the year"" for 2018 due to transformative potential on the way we study how human cells mature over a lifetime, how tissues regenerate, and how cells change in diseases (e.g., patient-derived organoids to screen disease-specific targets and design precision therapy). Profiling transcriptomes at the single-cell level can fulfill the need for greater detail in the molecular progression of all cell lineages, from pluripotency to adulthood and how cell-cell signaling pathways control progression at every step. Translational opportunities emerge for elucidating pathogenesis of genetic birth defects with cellular precision and improvements for predictive toxicology of chemical teratogenesis.",33496083,PMC8562675,10.1002/bdr2.1870,2
Novel PRD-like homeodomain transcription factors and retrotransposon elements in early human development,"Transcriptional program that drives human preimplantation development is largely unknown. Here, by using single-cell RNA sequencing of 348 oocytes, zygotes and single blastomeres from 2- to 3-day-old embryos, we provide a detailed analysis of the human preimplantation transcriptome. By quantifying transcript far 5'-ends (TFEs), we include in our analysis transcripts that derive from alternative promoters. We show that 32 and 129 genes are transcribed during the transition from oocyte to four-cell stage and from four- to eight-cell stage, respectively. A number of identified transcripts originates from previously unannotated genes that include the PRD-like homeobox genes ARGFX, CPHX1, CPHX2, DPRX, DUXA, DUXB and LEUTX. Employing de novo promoter motif extraction on sequences surrounding TFEs, we identify significantly enriched gene regulatory motifs that often overlap with Alu elements. Our high-resolution analysis of the human transcriptome during preimplantation development may have important implications on future studies of human pluripotent stem cells and cell reprograming.",26360614,PMC4569847,10.1038/ncomms9207,54
Integrating single-cell RNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics reveals MDK-NCL dependent immunosuppressive environment in endometrial carcinoma,"Objectives:The tumor microenvironment (TME) play important roles in progression of endometrial carcinoma (EC). We aimed to assess the cell populations in TME of EC.Methods:We downloaded datasets of single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptome (ST) for EC from GEO, and downloaded RNA-Seq (FPKM) and clinical data of TCGA-UCEC project from TCGA. The datasets were analyzed using R software.Results:We obtained 5 datasets of scRNA-seq, 1 of ST and 569 samples of RNA-seq. Totally, 0.2 billion transcripts and 33,408 genes were detected in 33,162 cells from scRNA-seq. The cells were classified into 9 clusters, and EC cells were originated from epithelial cells and ciliated cells. Gene set variation analysis (GSVA) indicated that the pathways enriched in the subclusters of epithelial cells and endothelial cells were significantly different, indicating great heterogeneity in EC. Cell-cell communication analyses showed that EC cells emitted the strongest signals, and endothelial cells received more signals than other cells. Further analysis found that subclusters of 1 and 2 of epithelial cells were showed a more malignant phenotype, which may confer malignant phenotype to subcluster of 0 of endothelial cells through MK pathway by MDL-NCL signal. We also analyzed communications between spatial neighbors with ST data and confirmed the findings on MDL-NCL in cell-cell communication. TCGA and GEO analyses indicated that the expression levels of NCL was inversely correlated with ImmuneScore.Conclusion:Our study revealed EC cells can confer malignant phenotype to endothelial cells by MDK-NCL signal, and NCL is associated with suppressed immune activity. EC cells may shape TME by inhibiting immune cells and ""educating"" stromal cellsviaMDK-NCL signal.",37081869,PMC10110842,10.3389/fimmu.2023.1145300,8
Epigenetic control of microglial immune responses,"Microglia, the major population of brain-resident macrophages, are now recognized as a heterogeneous population comprising several cell subtypes with different (so far mostly supposed) functions in health and disease. A number of studies have performed molecular characterization of these different microglial activation states over the last years making use of ""omics"" technologies, that is transcriptomics, proteomics and, less frequently, epigenomics profiling. These approaches offer the possibility to identify disease mechanisms, discover novel diagnostic biomarkers, and develop new therapeutic strategies. Here, we focus on epigenetic profiling as a means to understand microglial immune responses beyond what other omics methods can offer, that is, revealing past and present molecular responses, gene regulatory networks and potential future response trajectories, and defining cell subtype-specific disease relevance through mapping non-coding genetic variants. We review the current knowledge in the field regarding epigenetic regulation of microglial identity and function, provide an exemplary analysis that demonstrates the advantages of performing joint transcriptomic and epigenomic profiling of single microglial cells and discuss how comprehensive epigenetic analyses may enhance our understanding of microglial pathophysiology.",38491845,,10.1111/imr.13317,0
Microdroplet-based one-step RT-PCR for ultrahigh throughput single-cell multiplex gene expression analysis and rare cell detection,"Gene expression analysis of individual cells enables characterization of heterogeneous and rare cell populations, yet widespread implementation of existing single-cell gene analysis techniques has been hindered due to limitations in scale, ease, and cost. Here, we present a novel microdroplet-based, one-step reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) platform and demonstrate the detection of three targets simultaneously in over 100,000 single cells in a single experiment with a rapid read-out. Our customized reagent cocktail incorporates the bacteriophage T7 gene 2.5 protein to overcome cell lysate-mediated inhibition and allows for one-step RT-PCR of single cells encapsulated in nanoliter droplets. Fluorescent signals indicative of gene expressions are analyzed using a probabilistic deconvolution method to account for ambient RNA and cell doublets and produce single-cell gene signature profiles, as well as predict cell frequencies within heterogeneous samples. We also developed a simulation model to guide experimental design and optimize the accuracy and precision of the assay. Using mixtures of in vitro transcripts and murine cell lines, we demonstrated the detection of single RNA molecules and rare cell populations at a frequency of 0.1%. This low cost, sensitive, and adaptable technique will provide an accessible platform for high throughput single-cell analysis and enable a wide range of research and clinical applications.",33762663,PMC7990930,10.1038/s41598-021-86087-4,2
Analysis of aggregated cell-cell statistical distances within pathways unveils therapeutic-resistance mechanisms in circulating tumor cells,"Motivation:As 'omics' biotechnologies accelerate the capability to contrast a myriad of molecular measurements from a single cell, they also exacerbate current analytical limitations for detecting meaningful single-cell dysregulations. Moreover, mRNA expression alone lacks functional interpretation, limiting opportunities for translation of single-cell transcriptomic insights to precision medicine. Lastly, most single-cell RNA-sequencing analytic approaches are not designed to investigate small populations of cells such as circulating tumor cells shed from solid tumors and isolated from patient blood samples.Results:In response to these characteristics and limitations in current single-cell RNA-sequencing methodology, we introduce an analytic framework that models transcriptome dynamics through the analysis of aggregated cell-cell statistical distances within biomolecular pathways. Cell-cell statistical distances are calculated from pathway mRNA fold changes between two cells. Within an elaborate case study of circulating tumor cells derived from prostate cancer patients, we develop analytic methods of aggregated distances to identify five differentially expressed pathways associated to therapeutic resistance. Our aggregation analyses perform comparably with Gene Set Enrichment Analysis and better than differentially expressed genes followed by gene set enrichment. However, these methods were not designed to inform on differential pathway expression for a single cell. As such, our framework culminates with the novel aggregation method, cell-centric statistics (CCS). CCS quantifies the effect size and significance of differentially expressed pathways for a single cell of interest. Improved rose plots of differentially expressed pathways in each cell highlight the utility of CCS for therapeutic decision-making.Availability and implementation:http://www.lussierlab.org/publications/CCS/ CONTACT: yves@email.arizona.edu or piegorsch@math.arizona.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",27307648,PMC4908332,10.1093/bioinformatics/btw248,10
A time-resolved meta-analysis of consensus gene expression profiles during human T-cell activation,"Background:The coordinated transcriptional regulation of activated T-cells is based on a complex dynamic behavior of signaling networks. Given an external stimulus, T-cell gene expression is characterized by impulse and sustained patterns over the course. Here, we analyze the temporal pattern of activation across different T-cell populations to develop consensus gene signatures for T-cell activation.Results:Here, we identify and verify general biomarker signatures robustly evaluating T-cell activation in a time-resolved manner. We identify time-resolved gene expression profiles comprising 521 genes of up to 10 disjunct time points during activation and different polarization conditions. The gene signatures include central transcriptional regulators of T-cell activation, representing successive waves as well as sustained patterns of induction. They cover sustained repressed, intermediate, and late response expression rates across multiple T-cell populations, thus defining consensus biomarker signatures for T-cell activation. In addition, intermediate and late response activation signatures in CAR T-cell infusion products are correlated to immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome.Conclusion:This study is the first to describe temporally resolved gene expression patterns across T-cell populations. These biomarker signatures are a valuable source, e.g., monitoring transcriptional changes during T-cell activation with a reasonable number of genes, annotating T-cell states in single-cell transcriptome studies, or assessing dysregulated functions of human T-cell immunity.",38098113,PMC10722659,10.1186/s13059-023-03120-7,0
Patch-seq of mouse DRG neurons reveals candidate genes for specific mechanosensory functions,"A variety of mechanosensory neurons are involved in touch, proprioception, and pain. Many molecular components of the mechanotransduction machinery subserving these sensory modalities remain to be discovered. Here, we combine recordings of mechanosensitive (MS) currents in mechanosensory neurons with single-cell RNA sequencing. Transcriptional profiles are mapped onto previously identified sensory neuron types to identify cell-type correlates between datasets. Correlation of current signatures with single-cell transcriptomes provides a one-to-one correspondence between mechanoelectric properties and transcriptomically defined neuronal populations. Moreover, a gene-expression differential comparison provides a set of candidate genes for mechanotransduction complexes. Piezo2 is expectedly found to be enriched in rapidly adapting MS current-expressing neurons, whereas Tmem120a and Tmem150c, thought to mediate slow-type MS currents, are uniformly expressed in all mechanosensory neuron subtypes. Further knockdown experiments disqualify them as mediating MS currents in sensory neurons. This dataset constitutes an open resource to explore further the cell-type-specific determinants of mechanosensory properties.",34731626,PMC8578708,10.1016/j.celrep.2021.109914,24
Exercise reprograms the inflammatory landscape of multiple stem cell compartments during mammalian aging,"Exercise has the ability to rejuvenate stem cells and improve tissue regeneration in aging animals. However, the cellular and molecular changes elicited by exercise have not been systematically studied across a broad range of cell types in stem cell compartments. We subjected young and old mice to aerobic exercise and generated a single-cell transcriptomic atlas of muscle, neural, and hematopoietic stem cells with their niche cells and progeny, complemented by whole transcriptome analysis of single myofibers. We found that exercise ameliorated the upregulation of a number of inflammatory pathways associated with old age and restored aspects of intercellular communication mediated by immune cells within these stem cell compartments. Exercise has a profound impact on the composition and transcriptomic landscape of circulating and tissue-resident immune cells. Our study provides a comprehensive view of the coordinated responses of multiple aged stem cells and niche cells to exercise at the transcriptomic level.",37080206,PMC10216894,10.1016/j.stem.2023.03.016,12
Cluster-independent marker feature identification from single-cell omics data using SEMITONES,"Identification of cell identity markers is an essential step in single-cell omics data analysis. Current marker identification strategies typically rely on cluster assignments of cells. However, cluster assignment, particularly for developmental data, is nontrivial, potentially arbitrary, and commonly relies on prior knowledge. In response, we present SEMITONES, a principled method for cluster-free marker identification. We showcase and evaluate its application for marker gene and regulatory region identification from single-cell data of the human haematopoietic system. Additionally, we illustrate its application to spatial transcriptomics data and show how SEMITONES can be used for the annotation of cells given known marker genes. Using several simulated and curated data sets, we demonstrate that SEMITONES qualitatively and quantitatively outperforms existing methods for the retrieval of cell identity markers from single-cell omics data.",35909238,PMC9561473,10.1093/nar/gkac639,4
Integrative and comparative single-cell analysis reveals transcriptomic difference between human tumefactive demyelinating lesion and glioma,"Tumefactive demyelinating lesion (TDL) is an immune-mediated disease which can be misdiagnosed as glioma. At present, there is no study comparing difference between the two disorders at the cellular level. Here, we perform integrative and comparative single-cell RNA sequencing (ScRNA-seq) transcriptomic analysis on TDL and glioma lesions. At single-cell resolution, TDL is comprised primarily of immune cells, which is completely different from glioma. The integrated analysis reveals a TDL-specific microglial subset involving in B cell activation and proliferation. Comparative analysis highlights remyelination function of glial cells and demyelination function of T cells in TDL. Subclustering and pseudotime trajectory analysis of T cells in TDL reveal their heterogeneity and diverse functions involving in TDL pathogenesis and recovery process. Our study identifies substantial differences between TDL and glioma at single-cell resolution. The observed heterogeneity and potentially diverse functions of cells in TDL may be critical in disease progression.",36085357,PMC9463163,10.1038/s42003-022-03900-0,2
Single cell transcriptomics identifies a signaling network coordinating endoderm and mesoderm diversification during foregut organogenesis,"Visceral organs, such as the lungs, stomach and liver, are derived from the fetal foregut through a series of inductive interactions between the definitive endoderm (DE) and the surrounding splanchnic mesoderm (SM). While DE patterning is fairly well studied, the paracrine signaling controlling SM regionalization and how this is coordinated with epithelial identity is obscure. Here, we use single cell transcriptomics to generate a high-resolution cell state map of the embryonic mouse foregut. This identifies a diversity of SM cell types that develop in close register with the organ-specific epithelium. We infer a spatiotemporal signaling network of endoderm-mesoderm interactions that orchestrate foregut organogenesis. We validate key predictions with mouse genetics, showing the importance of endoderm-derived signals in mesoderm patterning. Finally, leveraging these signaling interactions, we generate different SM subtypes from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), which previously have been elusive. The single cell data can be explored at: https://research.cchmc.org/ZornLab-singlecell .",32855417,PMC7453027,10.1038/s41467-020-17968-x,72
Accurate estimation of cell-type composition from gene expression data,"The rapid development of single-cell transcriptomic technologies has helped uncover the cellular heterogeneity within cell populations. However, bulk RNA-seq continues to be the main workhorse for quantifying gene expression levels due to technical simplicity and low cost. To most effectively extract information from bulk data given the new knowledge gained from single-cell methods, we have developed a novel algorithm to estimate the cell-type composition of bulk data from a single-cell RNA-seq-derived cell-type signature. Comparison with existing methods using various real RNA-seq data sets indicates that our new approach is more accurate and comprehensive than previous methods, especially for the estimation of rare cell types. More importantly, our method can detect cell-type composition changes in response to external perturbations, thereby providing a valuable, cost-effective method for dissecting the cell-type-specific effects of drug treatments or condition changes. As such, our method is applicable to a wide range of biological and clinical investigations.",31278265,PMC6611906,10.1038/s41467-019-10802-z,86
Pathway identification through transcriptome analysis,"Systems-based, agnostic approaches focusing on transcriptomics data have been employed to understand the pathogenesis of polycystic kidney diseases (PKD). While multiple signaling pathways, including Wnt, mTOR and G-protein-coupled receptors, have been implicated in late stages of disease, there were few insights into the transcriptional cascade immediately downstream of Pkd1 inactivation. One of the consistent findings has been transcriptional evidence of dysregulated metabolic and cytoskeleton remodeling pathways. Recent technical developments, including bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing technologies and spatial transcriptomics, offer new angles to investigate PKD. In this article, we review what has been learned based on transcriptional approaches and consider future opportunities.",32649993,PMC9447370,10.1016/j.cellsig.2020.109701,6
Transcriptome Profiling of miRNA-mRNA Interactions and Associated Mechanisms in Chemotherapy-Induced Neuropathic Pain,"Chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain (CINP) is a dose-limiting adverse event affecting 40% of chemotherapy patients. MiRNA-mRNA interaction plays an important role in various processes. However, detailed profiling of miRNA-mRNA interactions in CINP remains unclear. Here, a rat-based CINP model was established using paclitaxel, followed by nociceptive behavioral tests related to mechanical allodynia, thermal hyperalgesia, and cold allodynia. The landscape of miRNA-mRNA interaction in the spinal dorsal horn was investigated through mRNA transcriptomics and small RNA sequencing. Under CINP condition, 86 differentially expressed mRNAs and 56 miRNAs were identified. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), Gene Ontology (GO), and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses indicated the activity of Odorant binding, postsynaptic specialization and synaptic density, extracellular matrix, mitochondrial matrix, retrograde endocannabinoid signaling, and GTPase activity. Protein-protein interaction (PPI), networks of circRNA-miRNA-mRNA, lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA, and TF-genes were demonstrated. We next explored the immune infiltration microenvironment and found a higher infiltration abundance of Th17 and a lower abundance of MDSC in CINP. RT-qPCR and dual-luciferase assays were used to verify the sequencing results, and single-cell analysis based on the SekSeeq database was conducted. Combined with bioinformatics analyses and experimental validations, Mpz, a protein-coding gene specifically expressed in Schwann cells, was found critical in maintaining CINP under miRNA regulation. Therefore, these data highlight the expression patterns of miRNA-mRNA, and the underlying mechanism in the spinal dorsal horn under CINP condition, and Mpz may serve as a promising therapeutic target for patients with CINP.",37332017,,10.1007/s12035-023-03398-5,1
Ultra-high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing and perturbation screening with combinatorial fluidic indexing,"Cell atlas projects and high-throughput perturbation screens require single-cell sequencing at a scale that is challenging with current technology. To enable cost-effective single-cell sequencing for millions of individual cells, we developed 'single-cell combinatorial fluidic indexing' (scifi). The scifi-RNA-seq assay combines one-step combinatorial preindexing of entire transcriptomes inside permeabilized cells with subsequent single-cell RNA-seq using microfluidics. Preindexing allows us to load several cells per droplet and computationally demultiplex their individual expression profiles. Thereby, scifi-RNA-seq massively increases the throughput of droplet-based single-cell RNA-seq, and provides a straightforward way of multiplexing thousands of samples in a single experiment. Compared with multiround combinatorial indexing, scifi-RNA-seq provides an easy and efficient workflow. Compared to cell hashing methods, which flag and discard droplets containing more than one cell, scifi-RNA-seq resolves and retains individual transcriptomes from overloaded droplets. We benchmarked scifi-RNA-seq on various human and mouse cell lines, validated it for primary human T cells and applied it in a highly multiplexed CRISPR screen with single-cell transcriptome readout of T cell receptor activation.",34059827,PMC7612019,10.1038/s41592-021-01153-z,77
Single-cell analysis delineates a trajectory toward the human early otic lineage,"Efficient pluripotent stem cell guidance protocols for the production of human posterior cranial placodes such as the otic placode that gives rise to the inner ear do not exist. Here we use a systematic approach including defined monolayer culture, signaling modulation, and single-cell gene expression analysis to delineate a developmental trajectory for human otic lineage specification in vitro. We found that modulation of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and WNT signaling combined with FGF and retinoic acid treatments over the course of 18 days generates cell populations that develop chronological expression of marker genes of non-neural ectoderm, preplacodal ectoderm, and early otic lineage. Gene expression along this differentiation path is distinct from other lineages such as endoderm, mesendoderm, and neural ectoderm. Single-cell analysis exposed the heterogeneity of differentiating cells and allowed discrimination of non-neural ectoderm and otic lineage cells from off-target populations. Pseudotemporal ordering of human embryonic stem cell and induced pluripotent stem cell-derived single-cell gene expression profiles revealed an initially synchronous guidance toward non-neural ectoderm, followed by comparatively asynchronous occurrences of preplacodal and otic marker genes. Positive correlation of marker gene expression between both cell lines and resemblance to mouse embryonic day 10.5 otocyst cells implied reasonable robustness of the guidance protocol. Single-cell trajectory analysis further revealed that otic progenitor cell types are induced in monolayer cultures, but further development appears impeded, likely because of lack of a lineage-stabilizing microenvironment. Our results provide a framework for future exploration of stabilizing microenvironments for efficient differentiation of stem cell-generated human otic cell types.",27402757,PMC4968758,10.1073/pnas.1605537113,37
Research progress on the application of single-cell sequencing in autoimmune diseases,"Autoimmune diseases (AIDs) are caused by immune tolerance deficiency or abnormal immune regulation, leading to damage to host organs. The complicated pathogenesis and varied clinical symptoms of AIDs pose great challenges in diagnosing and monitoring this disease. Regrettably, the etiological factors and pathogenesis of AIDs are still not completely understood. It is noteworthy that the development of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology provides a new tool for analyzing the transcriptome of AIDs. In this essay, we have summarized the development of scRNA-seq technology, and made a relatively systematic review of the current research progress of scRNA-seq technology in the field of AIDs, providing a reference to preferably understand the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of AIDs.",37550409,,10.1038/s41435-023-00216-9,0
Integrating spatial and single-cell transcriptomics reveals tumor heterogeneity and intercellular networks in colorectal cancer,"Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), a powerful tool for studying the tumor microenvironment (TME), does not preserve/provide spatial information on tissue morphology and cellular interactions. To understand the crosstalk between diverse cellular components in proximity in the TME, we performed scRNA-seq coupled with spatial transcriptomic (ST) assay to profile 41,700 cells from three colorectal cancer (CRC) tumor-normal-blood pairs. Standalone scRNA-seq analyses revealed eight major cell populations, including B cells, T cells, Monocytes, NK cells, Epithelial cells, Fibroblasts, Mast cells, Endothelial cells. After the identification of malignant cells from epithelial cells, we observed seven subtypes of malignant cells that reflect heterogeneous status in tumor, including tumor_CAV1, tumor_ATF3_JUN | FOS, tumor_ZEB2, tumor_VIM, tumor_WSB1, tumor_LXN, and tumor_PGM1. By transferring the cellular annotations obtained by scRNA-seq to ST spots, we annotated four regions in a cryosection from CRC patients, including tumor, stroma, immune infiltration, and colon epithelium regions. Furthermore, we observed intensive intercellular interactions between stroma and tumor regions which were extremely proximal in the cryosection. In particular, one pair of ligands and receptors (C5AR1 and RPS19) was inferred to play key roles in the crosstalk of stroma and tumor regions. For the tumor region, a typical feature of TMSB4X-high expression was identified, which could be a potential marker of CRC. The stroma region was found to be characterized by VIM-high expression, suggesting it fostered a stromal niche in the TME. Collectively, single cell and spatial analysis in our study reveal the tumor heterogeneity and molecular interactions in CRC TME, which provides insights into the mechanisms underlying CRC progression and may contribute to the development of anticancer therapies targeting on non-tumor components, such as the extracellular matrix (ECM) in CRC. The typical genes we identified may facilitate to new molecular subtypes of CRC.",38729966,PMC11087651,10.1038/s41419-024-06598-6,0
Parallel single-cell and bulk transcriptome analyses reveal key features of the gastric tumor microenvironment,"Background:The tumor microenvironment (TME) has been shown to strongly influence treatment outcome for cancer patients in various indications and to influence the overall survival. However, the cells forming the TME in gastric cancer have not been extensively characterized.Results:We combine bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing from tumors and matched normal tissue of 24 treatment-naïve GC patients to better understand which cell types and transcriptional programs are associated with malignant transformation of the stomach. Clustering 96,623 cells of non-epithelial origin reveals 81 well-defined TME cell types. We find that activated fibroblasts and endothelial cells are most prominently overrepresented in tumors. Intercellular network reconstruction and survival analysis of an independent cohort imply the importance of these cell types together with immunosuppressive myeloid cell subsets and regulatory T cells in establishing an immunosuppressive microenvironment that correlates with worsened prognosis and lack of response in anti-PD1-treated patients. In contrast, we find a subset of IFNγ activated T cells and HLA-II expressing macrophages that are linked to treatment response and increased overall survival.Conclusions:Our gastric cancer single-cell TME compendium together with the matched bulk transcriptome data provides a unique resource for the identification of new potential biomarkers for patient stratification. This study helps further to elucidate the mechanism of gastric cancer and provides insights for therapy.",36550535,PMC9773611,10.1186/s13059-022-02828-2,11
baredSC: Bayesian approach to retrieve expression distribution of single-cell data,"Background:The number of studies using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is constantly growing. This powerful technique provides a sampling of the whole transcriptome of a cell. However, sparsity of the data can be a major hurdle when studying the distribution of the expression of a specific gene or the correlation between the expressions of two genes.Results:We show that the main technical noise associated with these scRNA-seq experiments is due to the sampling, i.e., Poisson noise. We present a new tool named baredSC, for Bayesian Approach to Retrieve Expression Distribution of Single-Cell data, which infers the intrinsic expression distribution in scRNA-seq data using a Gaussian mixture model. baredSC can be used to obtain the distribution in one dimension for individual genes and in two dimensions for pairs of genes, in particular to estimate the correlation in the two genes' expressions. We apply baredSC to simulated scRNA-seq data and show that the algorithm is able to uncover the expression distribution used to simulate the data, even in multi-modal cases with very sparse data. We also apply baredSC to two real biological data sets. First, we use it to measure the anti-correlation between Hoxd13 and Hoxa11, two genes with known genetic interaction in embryonic limb. Then, we study the expression of Pitx1 in embryonic hindlimb, for which a trimodal distribution has been identified through flow cytometry. While other methods to analyze scRNA-seq are too sensitive to sampling noise, baredSC reveals this trimodal distribution.Conclusion:baredSC is a powerful tool which aims at retrieving the expression distribution of few genes of interest from scRNA-seq data.",35021985,PMC8756634,10.1186/s12859-021-04507-8,4
Decoding the Spermatogenesis Program: New Insights from Transcriptomic Analyses,"Spermatogenesis is a complex differentiation process coordinated spatiotemporally across and along seminiferous tubules. Cellular heterogeneity has made it challenging to obtain stage-specific molecular profiles of germ and somatic cells using bulk transcriptomic analyses. This has limited our ability to understand regulation of spermatogenesis and to integrate knowledge from model organisms to humans. The recent advancement of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies provides insights into the cell type diversity and molecular signatures in the testis. Fine-grained cell atlases of the testis contain both known and novel cell types and define the functional states along the germ cell developmental trajectory in many species. These atlases provide a reference system for integrated interspecies comparisons to discover mechanistic parallels and to enable future studies. Despite recent advances, we currently lack high-resolution data to probe germ cell-somatic cell interactions in the tissue environment, but the use of highly multiplexed spatial analysis technologies has begun to resolve this problem. Taken together, recent single-cell studies provide an improvedunderstanding of gametogenesis to examine underlying causes of infertility and enable the development of new therapeutic interventions.",36070560,PMC10722372,10.1146/annurev-genet-080320-040045,8
The subiculum is a patchwork of discrete subregions,"In the hippocampus, the classical pyramidal cell type of the subiculum acts as a primary output, conveying hippocampal signals to a diverse suite of downstream regions. Accumulating evidence suggests that the subiculum pyramidal cell population may actually be comprised of discrete subclasses. Here, we investigated the extent and organizational principles governing pyramidal cell heterogeneity throughout the mouse subiculum. Using single-cell RNA-seq, we find that the subiculum pyramidal cell population can be deconstructed into eight separable subclasses. These subclasses were mapped onto abutting spatial domains, ultimately producing a complex laminar and columnar organization with heterogeneity across classical dorsal-ventral, proximal-distal, and superficial-deep axes. We further show that these transcriptomically defined subclasses correspond to differential protein products and can be associated with specific projection targets. This work deconstructs the complex landscape of subiculum pyramidal cells into spatially segregated subclasses that may be observed, controlled, and interpreted in future experiments.",30375971,PMC6226292,10.7554/eLife.37701,42
PieParty: visualizing cells from scRNA-seq data as pie charts,"Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has been a transformative technology in many research fields. Dimensional reduction techniques such as UMAP and tSNE are used to visualize scRNA-seq data in two or three dimensions for cells to be clustered in biologically meaningful ways. Subsequently, gene expression is frequently mapped onto these plots to show the distribution of gene expression across the plots, for instance to distinguish cell types. However, plotting each cell with only a single color leads to repetitive and unintuitive representations. Here, we present PieParty, which allows scRNA-seq data to be plotted such that every cell is represented as a pie chart, and every slice in the pie charts corresponds to the gene expression of a single gene. This allows for the simultaneous visualization of the expression of multiple genes and gene networks. The resulting figures are information dense, space efficient, and highly intuitive. PieParty is publicly available on GitHub at https://github.com/harbourlab/PieParty.",33674364,PMC8008964,10.26508/lsa.202000986,1
New avenues for systematically inferring cell-cell communication: through single-cell transcriptomics data,"For multicellular organisms, cell-cell communication is essential to numerous biological processes. Drawing upon the latest development of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), high-resolution transcriptomic data have deepened our understanding of cellular phenotype heterogeneity and composition of complex tissues, which enables systematic cell-cell communication studies at a single-cell level. We first summarize a common workflow of cell-cell communication study using scRNA-seq data, which often includes data preparation, construction of communication networks, and result validation. Two common strategies taken to uncover cell-cell communications are reviewed, e.g., physically vicinal structure-based and ligand-receptor interaction-based one. To conclude, challenges and current applications of cell-cell communication studies at a single-cell resolution are discussed in details and future perspectives are proposed.",32435978,PMC7719148,10.1007/s13238-020-00727-5,52
Single-cell Transcriptomics and Solid Organ Transplantation,"Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) allows the measurement of transcriptomes from individual cells providing new insights into complex biological systems. scRNA-seq has enabled the identification of rare cell types, new cell states, and intercellular communication networks that may be masked by traditional bulk transcriptional profiling. Researchers are increasingly using scRNA-seq to comprehensively characterize complex organs in health and disease. The diversity of immune cell types, some present at low frequency, in a transplanted organ undergoing rejection makes scRNA-seq ideally suited to characterize transplant pathologies because it can quantify subtle transcriptional differences between rare cell types. In this review, we discuss single-cell sequencing methods and their application in transplantation to date, current challenges, and future directions. We believe that the remarkably rapid pace of technological development in this field makes it likely that single-cell technologies such as scRNA-seq will have an impact on clinical transplantation within a decade.",30946217,PMC6713581,10.1097/TP.0000000000002725,13
Transcriptomic and genomic profiling of multiple primary colorectal cancers reveals intratumor heterogeneity and a distinct immune microenvironment,"This study reported on the intratumor genomic and immunological heterogeneity of different tumor lesions from a single patient with multiple primary colorectal cancer (MPCC). The goal of this study was to explore the molecular and microenvironment characteristics of tumor lesions from different primary sites in a patient with MPCC. A total of three tumor lesions located in the hepatic flexure of the transverse colon, sigmoid colon, and rectum were collected from a 72-year-old male patient with MPCC. All three tumor samples were examined by using whole-exome sequencing (WES) and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). The transcriptome data of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) colon cancer (COAD) dataset were explored to characterize the biological impacts of certain immune cells. Only three nonsynonymous mutations were shared by all of the tumor lesions, whereas a number of single nucleotide variant (SNV) and copy number variation (CNV) mutations were shared by tumor samples from the sigmoid colon and rectum. Transcriptomic analysis showed that tumor lesions derived from the transverse colon had decreased levels of RTK, ERK, and AKT pathway activity, thus suggesting lower oncogenic properties in the transverse lesion compared to the other two samples. Further immune landscape evaluation by using single-cell transcriptomic analysis displayed significant intratumor heterogeneity in MPCC. Specifically, more abundant mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cell infiltration was found in transverse colon tumor lesions. Afterwards, we found that higher MAIT cell infiltration may correlate with a better prognosis of patients with colon cancer (immunohistochemical status was MSI-L/pMMR) by using a publicly available TCGA dataset.",38016348,,10.1016/j.intimp.2023.111276,0
Cell Heterogeneity Analysis in Single-Cell RNA-seq Data Using Mixture Exponential Graph and Markov Random Field Model,"Advanced single-cell profiling technologies promote exploration of cell heterogeneity, and clustering of single-cell RNA (scRNA-seq) data enables discovery of coexpression genes and network relationships between genes. In particular, single-cell profiling of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) can provide unique insights into tumor heterogeneity (including in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)), while scRNA-seq leads to better understanding of subclonal architecture and biological function. Despite numerous reports suggesting a direct correlation between circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and poor clinical outcomes, few studies have provided a thorough heterogeneity characterization of CTCs. In addition, TNBC is a disease with not only intertumor but also intratumor heterogeneity and represents various biological distinct subgroups that may have relationships with immune functions that are not clearly established yet. In this article, we introduce a new scheme for detecting genotypic characterization of single-cell heterogeneities and apply it to CTC and TNBC single-cell RNA-seq data. First, we use an existing mixture exponential family graph model to partition the cell-cell network; then, with the Markov random field model, we obtain more flexible network rewiring. Finally, we find the cell heterogeneity and network relationships according to different high coexpression gene modules in different cell subsets. Our results demonstrate that this scheme provides a reasonable and effective way to model different cell clusters and different biological enrichment gene clusters. Thus, using different internal coexpression genes of different cell clusters, we can infer the differences in tumor composition and diversity.",34095314,PMC8164540,10.1155/2021/9919080,0
A single-cell type transcriptomics map of human tissues,"Advances in molecular profiling have opened up the possibility to map the expression of genes in cells, tissues, and organs in the human body. Here, we combined single-cell transcriptomics analysis with spatial antibody-based protein profiling to create a high-resolution single-cell type map of human tissues. An open access atlas has been launched to allow researchers to explore the expression of human protein-coding genes in 192 individual cell type clusters. An expression specificity classification was performed to determine the number of genes elevated in each cell type, allowing comparisons with bulk transcriptomics data. The analysis highlights distinct expression clusters corresponding to cell types sharing similar functions, both within the same organs and between organs.",34321199,PMC8318366,10.1126/sciadv.abh2169,434
Correlation analysis between Raman spectral signature and transcriptomic features of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae,"The Raman microspectroscopy technology has been successfully applied to evaluate the molecular composition of living cells for identifying cell types and states, but the rationale behind it was not well investigated. In this study, we acquired single-cell Raman spectra (SCRS) of three Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) strains with different Carbapenem resistant mechanisms and analyzed them with machine learning algorithm. Two carbapenem resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) strains can be successfully distinguished from susceptible strain and CRKP with KPC or IMP carbapenemases can be classified with an overall accuracy achieving 100 %. Furthermore, we performed a correlation analysis between transcriptome and Raman spectra, and found that Raman shifts such as 752 and 1039 cm-1highly correlated with drug resistance genes expression and could be regarded as Raman biomarkers for CRKP with different mechanisms. The findings of the study provide a theoretical basis for identifying the relationship between Raman spectra and transcriptome of bacteria, as well as a novel method for rapid identification of CRKP and their carbapenemases types.",38043297,,10.1016/j.saa.2023.123699,1
"Integrating Deep Supervised, Self-Supervised and Unsupervised Learning for Single-Cell RNA-seq Clustering and Annotation","As single-cell RNA sequencing technologies mature, massive gene expression profiles can be obtained. Consequently, cell clustering and annotation become two crucial and fundamental procedures affecting other specific downstream analyses. Most existing single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data clustering algorithms do not take into account the available cell annotation results on the same tissues or organisms from other laboratories. Nonetheless, such data could assist and guide the clustering process on the target dataset. Identifying marker genes through differential expression analysis to manually annotate large amounts of cells also costs labor and resources. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end cell supervised clustering and annotation framework called scAnCluster, which fully utilizes the cell type labels available from reference data to facilitate the cell clustering and annotation on the unlabeled target data. Our algorithm integrates deep supervised learning, self-supervised learning and unsupervised learning techniques together, and it outperforms other customized scRNA-seq supervised clustering methods in both simulation and real data. It is particularly worth noting that our method performs well on the challenging task of discovering novel cell types that are absent in the reference data.",32674393,PMC7397036,10.3390/genes11070792,9
Elucidating tissue specific genes using the Benford distribution,"Background:The RNA-seq technique is applied for the investigation of transcriptional behaviour. The reduction in sequencing costs has led to an unprecedented trove of gene expression data from diverse biological systems. Subsequently, principles from other disciplines such as the Benford law, which can be properly judged only in data-rich systems, can now be examined on this high-throughput transcriptomic information. The Benford law, states that in many count-rich datasets the distribution of the first significant digit is not uniform but rather logarithmic.Results:All tested digital gene expression datasets showed a Benford-like distribution when observing an entire gene set. This phenomenon was conserved in development and does not demonstrate tissue specificity. However, when obedience to the Benford law is calculated for individual expressed genes across thousands of cells, genes that best and least adhere to the Benford law are enriched with tissue specific or cell maintenance descriptors, respectively. Surprisingly, a positive correlation was found between the obedience a gene exhibits to the Benford law and its expression level, despite the former being calculated solely according to first digit frequency while totally ignoring the expression value itself. Nevertheless, genes with low expression that exhibit Benford behavior demonstrate tissue specific associations. These observations were extended to predict the likelihood of tissue specificity based on Benford behaviour in a supervised learning approach.Conclusions:These results demonstrate the applicability and potential predictability of the Benford law for gleaning biological insight from simple count data.",27506195,PMC4979126,10.1186/s12864-016-2921-x,3
Isolation of high-quality total RNA and RNA sequencing of single bovine oocytes,"Studying individual mammalian oocytes has been extremely valuable for the understanding of the molecular composition of oocytes including RNA storage. Here, a detailed protocol for isolation of oocytes, extraction of total RNA from single oocytes followed by full-length cDNA amplification, and library preparation is presented. The procedure permits the production of cost-effective and high-quality sequencing libraries. This protocol can be adapted for transcriptome analysis of oocytes from other species and be used to generate high-quality data from single embryos.

Reference-free inferring of transcriptomic events in cancer cells on single-cell data,"Background:Cancerous cells' identity is determined via a mixture of multiple factors such as genomic variations, epigenetics, and the regulatory variations that are involved in transcription. The differences in transcriptome expression as well as abnormal structures in peptides determine phenotypical differences. Thus, bulk RNA-seq and more recent single-cell RNA-seq data (scRNA-seq) are important to identify pathogenic differences. In this case, we rely on k-mer decomposition of sequences to identify pathogenic variations in detail which does not need a reference, so it outperforms more traditional Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) analysis techniques depending on the alignment of the sequences to a reference.Results:Via our alignment-free analysis, over esophageal and glioblastoma cancer patients, high-frequency variations over multiple different locations (repeats, intergenic regions, exons, introns) as well as multiple different forms (fusion, polyadenylation, splicing, etc.) could be discovered. Additionally, we have analyzed the importance of less-focused events systematically in a classic transcriptome analysis pipeline where these events are considered as indicators for tumor prognosis, tumor prediction, tumor neoantigen inference, as well as their connection with respect to the immune microenvironment.Conclusions:Our results suggest that esophageal cancer (ESCA) and glioblastoma processes can be explained via pathogenic microbial RNA, repeated sequences, novel splicing variants, and long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs). We expect our application of reference-free process and analysis to be helpful in tumor and normal samples differential scRNA-seq analysis, which in turn offers a more comprehensive scheme for major cancer-associated events.",38769480,PMC11107047,10.1186/s12885-024-12331-5,0
β-Cells are not uniform after all-Novel insights into molecular heterogeneity of insulin-secreting cells,"While the β-cells of the endocrine pancreas are defined as cells with high levels of insulin production and tight stimulus-secretion coupling, the existence of functional heterogeneity among them has been known for decades. Recent advances in molecular technologies, in particular single-cell profiling on both the protein and messenger RNA level, have uncovered that β-cells exist in several antigenically and molecularly definable states. Using antibodies to cell surface markers or multidimensional clustering of β-cells using more than 20 protein markers by mass cytometry, 4 distinct groups of β-cells could be differentiated. However, whether these states represent permanent cell lineages or are readily interconvertible from one group to another remains to be determined. Nevertheless, future analysis of the pathogenesis of type 1 and type 2 diabetes will certainly benefit from a growing appreciation of β-cell heterogeneity. Here, we aim to summarize concisely the recent advances in the field and their possible impact on our understanding of β-cell physiology and pathophysiology.",28880481,PMC5659199,10.1111/dom.13019,14

Here we present Giotto, a comprehensive and open-source toolbox for spatial data analysis and visualization. The analysis module provides end-to-end analysis by implementing a wide range of algorithms for characterizing tissue composition, spatial expression patterns, and cellular interactions. Furthermore, single-cell RNAseq data can be integrated for spatial cell-type enrichment analysis. The visualization module allows users to interactively visualize analysis outputs and imaging features.

Using single-nucleus RNA-sequencing to interrogate transcriptomic profiles of archived human pancreatic islets,"Background:Human pancreatic islets are a central focus of research in metabolic studies. Transcriptomics is frequently used to interrogate alterations in cultured human islet cells using single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq). We introduce single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) as an alternative approach for investigating transplanted human islets.Methods:The Nuclei EZ protocol was used to obtain nuclear preparations from fresh and frozen human islet cells. Such preparations were first used to generate snRNA-seq datasets and compared to scRNA-seq output obtained from cells from the same donor. Finally, we employed snRNA-seq to obtain the transcriptomic profile of archived human islets engrafted in immunodeficient animals.Results:We observed virtually complete concordance in identifying cell types and gene proportions as well as a strong association of global and islet cell type gene signatures between scRNA-seq and snRNA-seq applied to fresh and frozen cultured or transplanted human islet samples.Conclusions:We propose snRNA-seq as a reliable strategy to probe transcriptomic profiles of freshly harvested or frozen sources of transplanted human islet cells especially when scRNA-seq is not ideal.",34376240,PMC8356387,10.1186/s13073-021-00941-8,12
Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis to characterize cells and gene expression landscapes in atrial septal defect,"This study aimed to characterize the cells and gene expression landscape in atrial septal defect (ASD). We performed single-cell RNA sequencing of cells derived from cardiac tissue of an ASD patient. Unsupervised clustering analysis was performed to identify different cell populations, followed by the investigation of the cellular crosstalk by analysing ligand-receptor interactions across cell types. Finally, differences between ASD and normal samples for all cell types were further investigated. An expression matrix of 18,411 genes in 6487 cells was obtained and used in this analysis. Five cell types, including cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts and macrophages were identified. ASD showed a decreased proportion of cardiomyocytes and an increased proportion of fibroblasts. There was more cellular crosstalk among cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts and macrophages, especially between fibroblast and macrophage. For all cell types, the majority of the DEGs were downregulated in ASD samples. For cardiomyocytes, there were 199 DEGs (42 upregulated and 157 downregulated) between ASD and normal samples. PPI analysis showed that cardiomyocyte marker gene FABP4 interacted with FOS, while FOS showed interaction with NPPA. Cell trajectory analysis showed that FABP4, FOS, and NPPA showed different expression changes along the pseudotime trajectory. Our results showed that single-cell RNA sequencing provides a powerful tool to study DEG profiles in the cell subpopulations of interest at the single-cell level. These findings enhance the understanding of the underlying mechanisms of ASD at both the cellular and molecular level and highlight potential targets for the treatment of ASD.",34514716,PMC8505850,10.1111/jcmm.16914,1
Analyzing the cellular and molecular atlas of ovarian mesenchymal cells provides a strategy against female reproductive aging,"Ovarian mesenchymal cells (oMCs) constitute a distinct microenvironment that supports folliculogenesis under physiological conditions. Supplementation of exogenous non-ovarian mesenchymal-related cells has been reported to be an efficient approach to improve ovarian functions. However, the development and cellular and molecular characteristics of endogenous oMCs remain largely unexplored. In this study, we surveyed the single-cell transcriptomic landscape to dissect the cellular and molecular changes associated with the aging of oMCs in mice. Our results showed that the oMCs were composed of five ovarian differentiated MC (odMC) populations and one ovarian mesenchymal progenitor (oMP) cell population. These cells could differentiate into various odMCs via an oMP-derived route to construct the ovarian stroma structures. Comparative analysis revealed that ovarian aging was associated with decreased quantity of oMP cells and reduced quality of odMCs. Based on the findings of bioinformatics analysis, we designed different strategies involving supplementation with young oMCs to examine their effects on female fertility and health. Our functional investigations revealed that oMCs supplementation prior to ovarian senescence was the optimal method to improve female fertility and extend the reproductive lifespan of aged females in the long-term.",37460714,,10.1007/s11427-022-2335-6,1
Droplet-based transcriptome profiling of individual synapses,"Synapses are crucial structures that mediate signal transmission between neurons in complex neural circuits and display considerable morphological and electrophysiological heterogeneity. So far we still lack a high-throughput method to profile the molecular heterogeneity among individual synapses. In the present study, we develop a droplet-based single-cell (sc) total-RNA-sequencing platform, called Multiple-Annealing-and-Tailing-based Quantitative scRNA-seq in Droplets, for transcriptome profiling of individual neurites, primarily composed of synaptosomes. In the synaptosome transcriptome, or 'synaptome', profiling of both mouse and human brain samples, we detect subclusters among synaptosomes that are associated with neuronal subtypes and characterize the landscape of transcript splicing that occurs within synapses. We extend synaptome profiling to synaptopathy in an Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse model and discover AD-associated synaptic gene expression changes that cannot be detected by single-nucleus transcriptome profiling. Overall, our results show that this platform provides a high-throughput, single-synaptosome transcriptome profiling tool that will facilitate future discoveries in neuroscience.",36646931,,10.1038/s41587-022-01635-1,10
Single-cell transcriptome analysis defines mesenchymal stromal cells in the mouse incisor dental pulp,"The dental pulp is known to be highly heterogenous, comprising distinct cell types including mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), which represent neural-crest-derived cells with the ability to differentiate into multiple cell lineages. However, the cellular heterogeneity and the transcriptome signature of different cell clusters within the dental pulp remain to be established. To better understand discrete cell types, we applied a single-cell RNA sequencing strategy to establish the RNA expression profiles of individual dental pulp cells from 5- to 6-day-old mouse incisors. Our study revealed distinct subclasses of cells representing osteoblast, odontoblast, endothelial, pancreatic, neuronal, immune, pericyte and ameloblast lineages. Collectively, our research demonstrates the complexity and diversity of cell subclasses within the incisor dental pulp, thus providing a foundation for uncovering the molecular processes that govern cell fate decisions and lineage commitment in dental pulp-derived MSCs.",34915194,,10.1016/j.gep.2021.119228,4
Performance of computational algorithms to deconvolve heterogeneous bulk ovarian tumor tissue depends on experimental factors,"Background:Single-cell gene expression profiling provides unique opportunities to understand tumor heterogeneity and the tumor microenvironment. Because of cost and feasibility, profiling bulk tumors remains the primary population-scale analytical strategy. Many algorithms can deconvolve these tumors using single-cell profiles to infer their composition. While experimental choices do not change the true underlying composition of the tumor, they can affect the measurements produced by the assay.Results:We generated a dataset of high-grade serous ovarian tumors with paired expression profiles from using multiple strategies to examine the extent to which experimental factors impact the results of downstream tumor deconvolution methods. We find that pooling samples for single-cell sequencing and subsequent demultiplexing has a minimal effect. We identify dissociation-induced differences that affect cell composition, leading to changes that may compromise the assumptions underlying some deconvolution algorithms. We also observe differences across mRNA enrichment methods that introduce additional discrepancies between the two data types. We also find that experimental factors change cell composition estimates and that the impact differs by method.Conclusions:Previous benchmarks of deconvolution methods have largely ignored experimental factors. We find that methods vary in their robustness to experimental factors. We provide recommendations for methods developers seeking to produce the next generation of deconvolution approaches and for scientists designing experiments using deconvolution to study tumor heterogeneity.",37864274,PMC10588129,10.1186/s13059-023-03077-7,5
A resource of single-cell gene expression profiles in a planarian Dugesia japonica,"The freshwater planarian Dugesia japonica maintains an abundant heterogeneous cell population called neoblasts, which include adult pluripotent stem cells. Thus, it is an excellent model organism for stem cell and regeneration research. Recently, many single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) databases of several model organisms, including other planarian species, have become publicly available; these are powerful and useful resources to search for gene expression in various tissues and cells. However, the only scRNA-seq dataset for D. japonica has been limited by the number of genes detected. Herein, we collected D. japonica cells, and conducted an scRNA-seq analysis. A novel, automatic, iterative cell clustering strategy produced a dataset of 3,404 cells, which could be classified into 63 cell types based on gene expression profiles. We introduced two examples for utilizing the scRNA-seq dataset in this study using D. japonica. First, the dataset provided results consistent with previous studies as well as novel functionally relevant insights, that is, the expression of DjMTA and DjP2X-A genes in neoblasts that give rise to differentiated cells. Second, we conducted an integrative analysis of the scRNA-seq dataset and time-course bulk RNA-seq of irradiated animals, demonstrating that the dataset can help interpret differentially expressed genes captured via bulk RNA-seq. Using the R package ""Seurat"" and GSE223927, researchers can easily access and utilize this dataset.",37779230,,10.1111/dgd.12893,0
tauFisher predicts circadian time from a single sample of bulk and single-cell pseudobulk transcriptomic data,"As the circadian clock regulates fundamental biological processes, disrupted clocks are often observed in patients and diseased tissues. Determining the circadian time of the patient or the tissue of focus is essential in circadian medicine and research. Here we present tauFisher, a computational pipeline that accurately predicts circadian time from a single transcriptomic sample by finding correlations between rhythmic genes within the sample. We demonstrate tauFisher's performance in adding timestamps to both bulk and single-cell transcriptomic samples collected from multiple tissue types and experimental settings. Application of tauFisher at a cell-type level in a single-cell RNAseq dataset collected from mouse dermal skin implies that greater circadian phase heterogeneity may explain the dampened rhythm of collective core clock gene expression in dermal immune cells compared to dermal fibroblasts. Given its robustness and generalizability across assay platforms, experimental setups, and tissue types, as well as its potential application in single-cell RNAseq data analysis, tauFisher is a promising tool that facilitates circadian medicine and research.",38714698,PMC11076472,10.1038/s41467-024-48041-6,0
Spatiotemporal mapping of gene expression landscapes and developmental trajectories during zebrafish embryogenesis,"A major challenge in understanding vertebrate embryogenesis is the lack of topographical transcriptomic information that can help correlate microenvironmental cues within the hierarchy of cell-fate decisions. Here, we employed Stereo-seq to profile 91 zebrafish embryo sections covering six critical time points during the first 24 h of development, obtaining a total of 152,977 spots at a resolution of 10 × 10 × 15 μm3(close to cellular size) with spatial coordinates. Meanwhile, we identified spatial modules and co-varying genes for specific tissue organizations. By performing the integrated analysis of the Stereo-seq and scRNA-seq data from each time point, we reconstructed the spatially resolved developmental trajectories of cell-fate transitions and molecular changes during zebrafish embryogenesis. We further investigated the spatial distribution of ligand-receptor pairs and identified potentially important interactions during zebrafish embryo development. Our study constitutes a fundamental reference for further studies aiming to understand vertebrate development.",35512701,,10.1016/j.devcel.2022.04.009,34
TENET: gene network reconstruction using transfer entropy reveals key regulatory factors from single cell transcriptomic data,"Accurate prediction of gene regulatory rules is important towards understanding of cellular processes. Existing computational algorithms devised for bulk transcriptomics typically require a large number of time points to infer gene regulatory networks (GRNs), are applicable for a small number of genes and fail to detect potential causal relationships effectively. Here, we propose a novel approach 'TENET' to reconstruct GRNs from single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) datasets. Employing transfer entropy (TE) to measure the amount of causal relationships between genes, TENET predicts large-scale gene regulatory cascades/relationships from scRNAseq data. TENET showed better performance than other GRN reconstructors, in identifying key regulators from public datasets. Specifically from scRNAseq, TENET identified key transcriptional factors in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and during direct cardiomyocytes reprogramming, where other predictors failed. We further demonstrate that known target genes have significantly higher TE values, and TENET predicted higher TE genes were more influenced by the perturbation of their regulator. Using TENET, we identified and validated that Nme2 is a culture condition specific stem cell factor. These results indicate that TENET is uniquely capable of identifying key regulators from scRNAseq data.",33170214,PMC7797076,10.1093/nar/gkaa1014,15
Single-cell transcriptomes of the human skin reveal age-related loss of fibroblast priming,"Fibroblasts are an essential cell population for human skin architecture and function. While fibroblast heterogeneity is well established, this phenomenon has not been analyzed systematically yet. We have used single-cell RNA sequencing to analyze the transcriptomes of more than 5,000 fibroblasts from a sun-protected area in healthy human donors. Our results define four main subpopulations that can be spatially localized and show differential secretory, mesenchymal and pro-inflammatory functional annotations. Importantly, we found that this fibroblast 'priming' becomes reduced with age. We also show that aging causes a substantial reduction in the predicted interactions between dermal fibroblasts and other skin cells, including undifferentiated keratinocytes at the dermal-epidermal junction. Our work thus provides evidence for a functional specialization of human dermal fibroblasts and identifies the partial loss of cellular identity as an important age-related change in the human dermis. These findings have important implications for understanding human skin aging and its associated phenotypes.",32327715,PMC7181753,10.1038/s42003-020-0922-4,151
scGRN: a comprehensive single-cell gene regulatory network platform of human and mouse,"Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) are interpretable graph models encompassing the regulatory interactions between transcription factors (TFs) and their downstream target genes. Making sense of the topology and dynamics of GRNs is fundamental to interpreting the mechanisms of disease etiology and translating corresponding findings into novel therapies. Recent advances in single-cell multi-omics techniques have prompted the computational inference of GRNs from single-cell transcriptomic and epigenomic data at an unprecedented resolution. Here, we present scGRN (https://bio.liclab.net/scGRN/), a comprehensive single-cell multi-omics gene regulatory network platform of human and mouse. The current version of scGRN catalogs 237 051 cell type-specific GRNs (62 999 692 TF-target gene pairs), covering 160 tissues/cell lines and 1324 single-cell samples. scGRN is the first resource documenting large-scale cell type-specific GRN information of diverse human and mouse conditions inferred from single-cell multi-omics data. We have implemented multiple online tools for effective GRN analysis, including differential TF-target network analysis, TF enrichment analysis, and pathway downstream analysis. We also provided details about TF binding to promoters, super-enhancers and typical enhancers of target genes in GRNs. Taken together, scGRN is an integrative and useful platform for searching, browsing, analyzing, visualizing and downloading GRNs of interest, enabling insight into the differences in regulatory mechanisms across diverse conditions.",37889053,PMC10767939,10.1093/nar/gkad885,0
Comprehensive characterization of single-cell full-length isoforms in human and mouse with long-read sequencing,"A modified Chromium 10x droplet-based protocol that subsamples cells for both short-read and long-read (nanopore) sequencing together with a new computational pipeline (FLAMES) is developed to enable isoform discovery, splicing analysis, and mutation detection in single cells. We identify thousands of unannotated isoforms and find conserved functional modules that are enriched for alternative transcript usage in different cell types and species, including ribosome biogenesis and mRNA splicing. Analysis at the transcript level allows data integration with scATAC-seq on individual promoters, improved correlation with protein expression data, and linked mutations known to confer drug resistance to transcriptome heterogeneity.",34763716,PMC8582192,10.1186/s13059-021-02525-6,66
The relationship between regulatory changes in cis and trans and the evolution of gene expression in humans and chimpanzees,"Background:Comparative gene expression studies in apes are fundamentally limited by the challenges associated with sampling across different tissues. Here, we used single-cell RNA sequencing of embryoid bodies to collect transcriptomic data from over 70 cell types in three humans and three chimpanzees.Results:We find hundreds of genes whose regulation is conserved across cell types, as well as genes whose regulation likely evolves under directional selection in one or a handful of cell types. Using embryoid bodies from a human-chimpanzee fused cell line, we also infer the proportion of inter-species regulatory differences due to changes in cis and trans elements between the species. Using the cis/trans inference and an analysis of transcription factor binding sites, we identify dozens of transcription factors whose inter-species differences in expression are affecting expression differences between humans and chimpanzees in hundreds of target genes.Conclusions:Here, we present the most comprehensive dataset of comparative gene expression from humans and chimpanzees to date, including a catalog of regulatory mechanisms associated with inter-species differences.",37697401,PMC10496171,10.1186/s13059-023-03019-3,2
Reference component analysis of single-cell transcriptomes elucidates cellular heterogeneity in human colorectal tumors,"Intratumoral heterogeneity is a major obstacle to cancer treatment and a significant confounding factor in bulk-tumor profiling. We performed an unbiased analysis of transcriptional heterogeneity in colorectal tumors and their microenvironments using single-cell RNA-seq from 11 primary colorectal tumors and matched normal mucosa. To robustly cluster single-cell transcriptomes, we developed reference component analysis (RCA), an algorithm that substantially improves clustering accuracy. Using RCA, we identified two distinct subtypes of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Additionally, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related genes were found to be upregulated only in the CAF subpopulation of tumor samples. Notably, colorectal tumors previously assigned to a single subtype on the basis of bulk transcriptomics could be divided into subgroups with divergent survival probability by using single-cell signatures, thus underscoring the prognostic value of our approach. Overall, our results demonstrate that unbiased single-cell RNA-seq profiling of tumor and matched normal samples provides a unique opportunity to characterize aberrant cell states within a tumor.",28319088,,10.1038/ng.3818,518
Simultaneous Profiling of mRNA Transcriptome and DNA Methylome from a Single Cell,"Single-cell transcriptome and single-cell methylome analysis have successfully revealed the heterogeneity in transcriptome and DNA methylome between single cells, and have become powerful tools to understand the dynamics of transcriptome and DNA methylome during the complicated biological processes, such as differentiation and carcinogenesis.Inspired by the success of using these single-cell -omics methods to understand the regulation of a particular ""-ome,"" more interests have been put on elucidating the regulatory relationship among multiple-omics at single-cell resolution. The simultaneous profiling of multiple-omics from the same single cell would provide us the ultimate power to understand the relationship among different ""-omes,"" but this idea is not materialized for decades due to difficulties to assay extremely tiny amount of DNA or RNA in a single cell.To address this technical challenge, we have recently developed a novel method named scMT-seq that can simultaneously profile both DNA methylome and RNA transcriptome from the same cell. This method enabled us to measure, from a single cell, the DNA methylation status of the most informative 0.5-1 million CpG sites and mRNA level of 10,000 genes, of which 3200 genes can be further analyzed with both promoter DNA methylation and RNA transcription. Using the scMT-seq data, we have successfully shown the regulatory relationship between DNA methylation and transcriptional level in a single dorsal root ganglion neuron (Hu et al., Genome Biol 17:88, 2016). We believe the scMT-seq would be a powerful technique to uncover the regulatory mechanism between transcription and DNA methylation, and would be of wide interest beyond the epigenetics community.",31028648,,10.1007/978-1-4939-9240-9_21,10
Characterization of the Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid by Single Cell Gene Expression Analysis in Healthy Dogs: A Promising Technique,"Single-cell mRNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a technique which enables unbiased, high throughput and high-resolution transcriptomic analysis of the heterogeneity of cells within a population. This recent technique has been described in humans, mice and other species in various conditions to cluster cells in populations and identify new subpopulations, as well as to study the gene expression of cells in various tissues, conditions and origins. In dogs, a species for which markers of cell populations are often limiting, scRNA-seq presents with elevated yet untested potential for the study of tissue composition. As a proof of principle, we used scRNA-seq to identify cellular populations of the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) in healthy dogs (n= 4). A total of 5,710 cells were obtained and analyzed by scRNA-seq. Fourteen distinct clusters of cells were identified, further identified as macrophages/monocytes (4 clusters), T cells (2 clusters) and B cells (1 cluster), neutrophils (1 cluster), mast cells (1 cluster), mature or immature dendritic cells (1 cluster each), ciliated or non-ciliated epithelial cells (1 cluster each) and cycling cells (1 cluster). We used for the first time in dogs the scRNA-seq to investigate cellular subpopulations of the BALF of dog. This study hence expands our knowledge on dog lung immune cell populations, paves the way for the investigation at single-cell level of lower respiratory diseases in dogs, and establishes that scRNA-seq is a powerful tool for the study of dog tissue composition.",32849601,PMC7406785,10.3389/fimmu.2020.01707,8
A new dawn for the study of cell type evolution,"Animal evolution is influenced by the emergence of new cell types, yet our understanding of this process remains elusive. This prompts the need for a broader exploration across diverse research organisms, facilitated by recent breakthroughs, such as gene editing tools and single-cell genomics. Essential to our understanding of cell type evolution is the accurate identification of homologous cells. We delve into the significance of considering developmental ontogeny and potential pitfalls when drawing conclusions about cell type homology. Additionally, we highlight recent discoveries in the study of cell type evolution through the application of single-cell transcriptomics and pinpoint areas ripe for further exploration.",38722217,,10.1242/dev.200884,0
The transcriptome dynamics of single cells during the cell cycle,"The cell cycle is among the most basic phenomena in biology. Despite advances in single-cell analysis, dynamics and topology of the cell cycle in high-dimensional gene expression space remain largely unknown. We developed a linear analysis of transcriptome data which reveals that cells move along a planar circular trajectory in transcriptome space during the cycle. Non-cycling gene expression adds a third dimension causing helical motion on a cylinder. We find in immortalized cell lines that cell cycle transcriptome dynamics occur largely independently from other cellular processes. We offer a simple method (""Revelio"") to order unsynchronized cells in time. Precise removal of cell cycle effects from the data becomes a straightforward operation. The shape of the trajectory implies that each gene is upregulated only once during the cycle, and only two dynamic components represented by groups of genes drive transcriptome dynamics. It indicates that the cell cycle has evolved to minimize changes of transcriptional activity and the related regulatory effort. This design principle of the cell cycle may be of relevance to many other cellular differentiation processes.",33205894,PMC7672610,10.15252/msb.20209946,18
Anaplastic transformation in thyroid cancer revealed by single-cell transcriptomics,"The deadliest anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) often transforms from indolent differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC); however, the complex intratumor transformation process is poorly understood. We investigated an anaplastic transformation model by dissecting both cell lineage and cell fate transitions using single-cell transcriptomic and genetic alteration data from patients with different subtypes of thyroid cancer. The resulting spectrum of ATC transformation included stress-responsive DTC cells, inflammatory ATC cells (iATCs), and mitotic-defective ATC cells and extended all the way to mesenchymal ATC cells (mATCs). Furthermore, our analysis identified 2 important milestones: (a) a diploid stage, in which iATC cells were diploids with inflammatory phenotypes and (b) an aneuploid stage, in which mATCs gained aneuploid genomes and mesenchymal phenotypes, producing excessive amounts of collagen and collagen-interacting receptors. In parallel, cancer-associated fibroblasts showed strong interactions among mesenchymal cell types, macrophages shifted from M1 to M2 states, and T cells reprogrammed from cytotoxic to exhausted states, highlighting new therapeutic opportunities for the treatment of ATC.",37053016,PMC10231997,10.1172/JCI169653,16
Comparative transcriptomic analyses and single-cell RNA sequencing of the freshwater planarian Schmidtea mediterranea identify major cell types and pathway conservation,"Background:In the Lophotrochozoa/Spiralia superphylum, few organisms have as high a capacity for rapid testing of gene function and single-cell transcriptomics as the freshwater planaria. The species Schmidtea mediterranea in particular has become a powerful model to use in studying adult stem cell biology and mechanisms of regeneration. Despite this, systematic attempts to define gene complements and their annotations are lacking, restricting comparative analyses that detail the conservation of biochemical pathways and identify lineage-specific innovations.Results:In this study we compare several transcriptomes and define a robust set of 35,232 transcripts. From this, we perform systematic functional annotations and undertake a genome-scale metabolic reconstruction for S. mediterranea. Cross-species comparisons of gene content identify conserved, lineage-specific, and expanded gene families, which may contribute to the regenerative properties of planarians. In particular, we find that the TRAF gene family has been greatly expanded in planarians. We further provide a single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of 2000 cells, revealing both known and novel cell types defined by unique signatures of gene expression. Among these are a novel mesenchymal cell population as well as a cell type involved in eye regeneration. Integration of our metabolic reconstruction further reveals the extent to which given cell types have adapted energy and nucleotide biosynthetic pathways to support their specialized roles.Conclusions:In general, S. mediterranea displays a high level of gene and pathway conservation compared with other model systems, rendering it a viable model to study the roles of these pathways in stem cell biology and regeneration.",30143032,PMC6109357,10.1186/s13059-018-1498-x,20
Single-cell transcriptomic heterogeneity between conduit and resistance mesenteric arteries in rats,"The endothelium contains morphologically similar cells throughout the vasculature, but individual cells along the length of a single vascular tree or in different regional circulations function dissimilarly. When observations made in large arteries are extrapolated to explain the function of endothelial cells (ECs) in the resistance vasculature, only a fraction of these observations are consistent between artery sizes. To what extent endothelial (EC) and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) from different arteriolar segments of the same tissue differ phenotypically at the single-cell level remains unknown. Therefore, single-cell RNA-seq (10x Genomics) was performed using a 10X Genomics Chromium system. Cells were enzymatically digested from large (>300 µm) and small (<150 µm) mesenteric arteries from nine adult male Sprague-Dawley rats, pooled to create six samples (3 rats/sample, 3 samples/group). After normalized integration, the dataset was scaled before unsupervised cell clustering and cluster visualization using UMAP plots. Differential gene expression analysis allowed us to infer the biological identity of different clusters. Our analysis revealed 630 and 641 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between conduit and resistance arteries for ECs and VSMCs, respectively. Gene ontology analysis (GO-Biological Processes, GOBP) of scRNA-seq data discovered 562 and 270 pathways for ECs and VSMCs, respectively, that differed between large and small arteries. We identified eight and seven unique ECs and VSMCs subpopulations, respectively, with DEGs and pathways identified for each cluster. These results and this dataset allow the discovery and support of novel hypotheses needed to identify mechanisms that determine the phenotypic heterogeneity between conduit and resistance arteries.",36912534,PMC10085562,10.1152/physiolgenomics.00126.2022,2
A High-Efficiency Capture-Based NGS Approach for Comprehensive Analysis of Mitochondrial Transcriptome,"The transcription of the mitochondrial genome is pivotal for maintenance of mitochondrial functions, and the deregulated mitochondrial transcriptome contributes to various pathological changes. Despite substantial progress having been achieved in uncovering the transcriptional complexity of the nuclear transcriptome, many unknowns and controversies remain for the mitochondrial transcriptome, partially owing to the lack of a highly efficient mitochondrial RNA (mtRNA) sequencing and analysis approach. Here, we first comprehensively evaluated the influence of essential experimental protocols, including strand-specific library construction, two RNA enrichment strategies, and optimal rRNA depletion, on accurately profiling mitochondrial transcriptome in whole-transcriptome sequencing (WTS) data. Based on these insights, we developed a highly efficient approach specifically suitable for targeted sequencing of whole mitochondrial transcriptome, termed capture-based mtRNA seq (CAP), in which strand-specific library construction and optimal rRNA depletion were applied. Compared with WTS, CAP has a great decrease of required data volume without affecting the sensitivity and accuracy of detection. In addition, CAP also characterized the unannotated mt-tRNA transcripts whose expression levels are below the detection limits of conventional WTS. As a proof-of-concept characterization of mtRNAs, the transcription initiation sites and mtRNA cleavage ratio were accurately identified in CAP data. Moreover, CAP had very reliable performance in plasma and single-cell samples, highlighting its wide application. Altogether, the present study has established a highly efficient pipeline for targeted sequencing of mtRNAs, which may pave the way toward functional annotation of mtRNAs and mtRNA-based diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in various diseases.",37937716,,10.1021/acs.analchem.3c03741,0
Kidney and organoid single-cell transcriptomics: the end of the beginning,"Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies are increasingly being applied to reveal cellular heterogeneity in kidney development and disease. In just the last year, multiple scRNA-seq datasets have been generated from kidney organoids, developing mouse and human kidney, adult kidney, and kidney cancer. The data generated enables a much deeper understanding of biological processes within and between cells. It has also elucidated unforeseen cell lineage relationships, defined the presence of off-target cell types in kidney organoids, and revealed a diverse inflammatory response in a human kidney allograft undergoing rejection. This review summarizes the recent rapid progress in scRNA-seq of the kidney and outlines future directions for single-cell technologies as applied to the kidney.",30607565,PMC6609508,10.1007/s00467-018-4177-y,9
High-resolution anatomical and spatial transcriptome analyses reveal two types of meristematic cell pools within the secondary vascular tissue of poplar stem,"The secondary vascular tissue emanating from meristems is central to understanding how vascular plants such as forest trees evolve, grow, and regulate secondary radial growth. However, the overall molecular characterization of meristem origins and developmental trajectories from primary to secondary vascular tissues in woody tree stems is technically challenging. In this study, we combined high-resolution anatomic analysis with a spatial transcriptome (ST) technique to define features of meristematic cells in a developmental gradient from primary to secondary vascular tissues in poplar stems. The tissue-specific gene expression of meristems and derived vascular tissue types were accordingly mapped to specific anatomical domains. Pseudotime analyses were used to track the origins and changes of meristems throughout the development from primary to secondary vascular tissues. Surprisingly, two types of meristematic-like cell pools within secondary vascular tissues were inferred based on high-resolution microscopy combined with ST, and the results were confirmed by in situ hybridization of, transgenic trees, and single-cell sequencing. The rectangle shape procambium-like (PCL) cells develop from procambium meristematic cells and are located within the phloem domain to produce phloem cells, whereas fusiform shape cambium zone (CZ) meristematic cells develop from fusiform metacambium meristematic cells and are located inside the CZ to produce xylem cells. The gene expression atlas and transcriptional networks spanning the primary transition to secondary vascular tissues generated in this work provide new resources for studying the regulation of meristem activities and the evolution of vascular plants. A web server (https://pgx.zju.edu.cn/stRNAPal/) was also established to facilitate the use of ST RNA-seq data.",36895162,,10.1016/j.molp.2023.03.005,10
LONGO: an R package for interactive gene length dependent analysis for neuronal identity,"Motivation:Reprogramming somatic cells into neurons holds great promise to model neuronal development and disease. The efficiency and success rate of neuronal reprogramming, however, may vary between different conversion platforms and cell types, thereby necessitating an unbiased, systematic approach to estimate neuronal identity of converted cells. Recent studies have demonstrated that long genes (>100 kb from transcription start to end) are highly enriched in neurons, which provides an opportunity to identify neurons based on the expression of these long genes.Results:We have developed a versatile R package, LONGO, to analyze gene expression based on gene length. We propose a systematic analysis of long gene expression (LGE) with a metric termed the long gene quotient (LQ) that quantifies LGE in RNA-seq or microarray data to validate neuronal identity at the single-cell and population levels. This unique feature of neurons provides an opportunity to utilize measurements of LGE in transcriptome data to quickly and easily distinguish neurons from non-neuronal cells. By combining this conceptual advancement and statistical tool in a user-friendly and interactive software package, we intend to encourage and simplify further investigation into LGE, particularly as it applies to validating and improving neuronal differentiation and reprogramming methodologies.Availability and implementation:LONGO is freely available for download at https://github.com/biohpc/longo.Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",29950021,PMC6022641,10.1093/bioinformatics/bty243,13
High-resolution genome-wide expression analysis of single myofibers using SMART-Seq,"Skeletal muscle is a heterogeneous tissue. Individual myofibers that make up muscle tissue exhibit variation in their metabolic and contractile properties. Although biochemical and histological assays are available to study myofiber heterogeneity, efficient methods to analyze the whole transcriptome of individual myofibers are lacking. Here, we report on a single-myofiber RNA-sequencing (smfRNA-Seq) approach to analyze the whole transcriptome of individual myofibers by combining single-fiber isolation with Switching Mechanism at 5' end of RNA Template (SMART) technology. Using smfRNA-Seq, we first determined the genes that are expressed in the whole muscle, including in nonmyogenic cells. We also analyzed the differences in the transcriptome of myofibers from young and old mice to validate the effectiveness of this new method. Our results suggest that aging leads to significant changes in the expression of metabolic genes, such asNos1, and structural genes, such asMyl1, in myofibers. We conclude that smfRNA-Seq is a powerful tool to study developmental, disease-related, and age-related changes in the gene expression profile of skeletal muscle.",31753917,PMC6937554,10.1074/jbc.RA119.011506,15
Single-cell transcriptomics provide insight into metastasis-related subsets of breast cancer,"Breast cancer metastasis is a complex, multi-step process, with high cellular heterogeneity between primary and metastatic breast cancer, and more complex interactions between metastatic cancer cells and other cells in the tumor microenvironment. High-resolution single-cell transcriptome sequencing technology can visualize the heterogeneity of malignant and non-malignant cells in the tumor microenvironment in real time, especially combined with spatial transcriptome analysis, which can directly compare changes between different stages of metastatic samples. Therefore, this study takes single-cell analysis as the first perspective to deeply explore special or rare cell subpopulations related to breast cancer metastasis, systematically summarizes their functions, molecular features, and corresponding treatment strategies, which will contribute to accurately identify, understand, and target tumor metastasis-related driving events, provide a research basis for the mechanistic study of breast cancer metastasis, and provide new clues for its personalized precision treatment.",37858183,PMC10588105,10.1186/s13058-023-01728-y,0
"Single-cell RNA sequencing for the study of development, physiology and disease","An ongoing technological revolution is continually improving our ability to carry out very high-resolution studies of gene expression patterns. Current technology enables the global gene expression profiles of single cells to be defined, facilitating dissection of heterogeneity in cell populations that was previously hidden. In contrast to gene expression studies that use bulk RNA samples and provide only a virtual average of the diverse constituent cells, single-cell studies enable the molecular distinction of all cell types within a complex population mix, such as a tumour or developing organ. For instance, single-cell gene expression profiling has contributed to improved understanding of how histologically identical, adjacent cells make different differentiation decisions during development. Beyond development, single-cell gene expression studies have enabled the characteristics of previously known cell types to be more fully defined and facilitated the identification of novel categories of cells, contributing to improvements in our understanding of both normal and disease-related physiological processes and leading to the identification of new treatment approaches. Although limitations remain to be overcome, technology for the analysis of single-cell gene expression patterns is improving rapidly and beginning to provide a detailed atlas of the gene expression patterns of all cell types in the human body.",29789704,PMC6070143,10.1038/s41581-018-0021-7,229
Single-cell transcriptomics of human embryos identifies multiple sympathoblast lineages with potential implications for neuroblastoma origin,"Characterization of the progression of cellular states during human embryogenesis can provide insights into the origin of pediatric diseases. We examined the transcriptional states of neural crest- and mesoderm-derived lineages differentiating into adrenal glands, kidneys, endothelium and hematopoietic tissue between post-conception weeks 6 and 14 of human development. Our results reveal transitions connecting the intermediate mesoderm and progenitors of organ primordia, the hematopoietic system and endothelial subtypes. Unexpectedly, by using a combination of single-cell transcriptomics and lineage tracing, we found that intra-adrenal sympathoblasts at that stage are directly derived from nerve-associated Schwann cell precursors, similarly to local chromaffin cells, whereas the majority of extra-adrenal sympathoblasts arise from the migratory neural crest. In humans, this process persists during several weeks of development within the large intra-adrenal ganglia-like structures, which may also serve as reservoirs of originating cells in neuroblastoma.",33833454,PMC7610777,10.1038/s41588-021-00818-x,58
Creation of a High-Throughput Microfluidic Platform for Single-Cell Transcriptome Sequencing of Cell-Cell Interactions,"Cell-cell interaction is one of the major modalities for transmitting information between cells and activating the effects of functional cells. However, the construction of high-throughput analysis technologies from cell omics focusing on the impact of interactions of functional cells on targets has been relatively unexplored. Here, they propose a droplet-based microfluidic platform for cell-cell interaction sequencing (c-c-seq) and screening in vitro to address this challenge. A class of interacting cells is pre-labeled using cell molecular tags, and additional single-cell sequencing reagents are introduced to quickly form functional droplet mixes. Lastly, gene expression analysis is used to deduce the impact of the interaction, while molecular sequence tracing identifies the type of interaction. Research into the active effect between antigen-presenting cells and T cells, one of the most common cell-to-cell interactions, is crucial for the advancement of cancer therapy, particularly T cell receptor-engineered T cell therapy. As it allows for high throughput, this platform is superior to well plates as a research platform for cell-to-cell interactions. When combined with the next generation of sequencing, the platform may be able to more accurately evaluate interactions between epitopes and receptors and verify their functional relevance.",37712212,,10.1002/smtd.202300730,0
MARS: discovering novel cell types across heterogeneous single-cell experiments,"Although tremendous effort has been put into cell-type annotation, identification of previously uncharacterized cell types in heterogeneous single-cell RNA-seq data remains a challenge. Here we present MARS, a meta-learning approach for identifying and annotating known as well as new cell types. MARS overcomes the heterogeneity of cell types by transferring latent cell representations across multiple datasets. MARS uses deep learning to learn a cell embedding function as well as a set of landmarks in the cell embedding space. The method has a unique ability to discover cell types that have never been seen before and annotate experiments that are as yet unannotated. We apply MARS to a large mouse cell atlas and show its ability to accurately identify cell types, even when it has never seen them before. Further, MARS automatically generates interpretable names for new cell types by probabilistically defining a cell type in the embedding space.",33077966,,10.1038/s41592-020-00979-3,51
Advances in Genomics for Drug Development,"Drug development (target identification, advancing drug leads to candidates for preclinical and clinical studies) can be facilitated by genetic and genomic knowledge. Here, we review the contribution of population genomics to target identification, the value of bulk and single cell gene expression analysis for understanding the biological relevance of a drug target, and genome-wide CRISPR editing for the prioritization of drug targets. In genomics, we discuss the different scope of genome-wide association studies using genotyping arrays, versus exome and whole genome sequencing. In transcriptomics, we discuss the information from drug perturbation and the selection of biomarkers. For CRISPR screens, we discuss target discovery, mechanism of action and the concept of gene to drug mapping. Harnessing genetic support increases the probability of drug developability and approval.",32824125,PMC7465049,10.3390/genes11080942,11
Single-cell transcriptomics of the developing lateral geniculate nucleus reveals insights into circuit assembly and refinement,"Coordinated changes in gene expression underlie the early patterning and cell-type specification of the central nervous system. However, much less is known about how such changes contribute to later stages of circuit assembly and refinement. In this study, we employ single-cell RNA sequencing to develop a detailed, whole-transcriptome resource of gene expression across four time points in the developing dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), a visual structure in the brain that undergoes a well-characterized program of postnatal circuit development. This approach identifies markers defining the major LGN cell types, including excitatory relay neurons, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, microglia, and endothelial cells. Most cell types exhibit significant transcriptional changes across development, dynamically expressing genes involved in distinct processes including retinotopic mapping, synaptogenesis, myelination, and synaptic refinement. Our data suggest that genes associated with synapse and circuit development are expressed in a larger proportion of nonneuronal cell types than previously appreciated. Furthermore, we used this single-cell expression atlas to identify the Prkcd-Cre mouse line as a tool for selective manipulation of relay neurons during a late stage of sensory-driven synaptic refinement. This transcriptomic resource provides a cellular map of gene expression across several cell types of the LGN, and offers insight into the molecular mechanisms of circuit development in the postnatal brain.",29343640,PMC5798372,10.1073/pnas.1717871115,36
Analysis of single-cell transcriptomes links enrichment of olfactory receptors with cancer cell differentiation status and prognosis,"Ectopically expressed olfactory receptors (ORs) have been linked with multiple clinically-relevant physiological processes. Previously used tissue-level expression estimation largely shadowed the potential role of ORs due to their overall low expression levels. Even after the introduction of the single-cell transcriptomics, a comprehensive delineation of expression dynamics of ORs in tumors remained unexplored. Our targeted investigation into single malignant cells revealed a complex landscape of combinatorial OR expression events. We observed differentiation-dependent decline in expressed OR counts per cell as well as their expression intensities in malignant cells. Further, we constructed expression signatures based on a large spectrum of ORs and tracked their enrichment in bulk expression profiles of tumor samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). TCGA tumor samples stratified based on OR-centric signatures exhibited divergent survival probabilities. In summary, our comprehensive analysis positions ORs at the cross-road of tumor cell differentiation status and cancer prognosis.",32917933,PMC7486295,10.1038/s42003-020-01232-5,8
Single-cell transcriptome analysis of the in vivo response to viral infection in the cave nectar bat Eonycteris spelaea,"Bats are reservoir hosts of many zoonotic viruses with pandemic potential. We utilized single-cell transcriptome sequencing (scRNA-seq) to analyze the immune response in bat lungs upon in vivo infection with a double-stranded RNA virus, Pteropine orthoreovirus PRV3M. Bat neutrophils were distinguished by high basal IDO1 expression. NK cells and T cells were the most abundant immune cells in lung tissue. Three distinct CD8+effector T cell populations could be delineated by differential expression of KLRB1, GFRA2, and DPP4. Select NK and T clusters increased expression of genes involved in T cell activation and effector function early after viral infection. Alveolar macrophages and classical monocytes drove antiviral interferon signaling. Infection expanded a CSF1R+population expressing collagen-like genes, which became the predominant myeloid cell type post-infection. This work uncovers features relevant to viral disease tolerance in bats, lays a foundation for future experimental work, and serves as a resource for comparative immunology studies.",36351376,,10.1016/j.immuni.2022.10.008,4
Mechanisms of fate decision and lineage commitment during haematopoiesis,"Blood stem cells need to both perpetuate themselves (self-renew) and differentiate into all mature blood cells to maintain blood formation throughout life. However, it is unclear how the underlying gene regulatory network maintains this population of self-renewing and differentiating stem cells and how it accommodates the transition from a stem cell to a mature blood cell. Our current knowledge of transcriptomes of various blood cell types has mainly been advanced by population-level analysis. However, a population of seemingly homogenous blood cells may include many distinct cell types with substantially different transcriptomes and abilities to make diverse fate decisions. Therefore, understanding the cell-intrinsic differences between individual cells is necessary for a deeper understanding of the molecular basis of their behaviour. Here we review recent single-cell studies in the haematopoietic system and their contribution to our understanding of the mechanisms governing cell fate choices and lineage commitment.",26526619,,10.1038/icb.2015.96,13
Systematic mapping of TF-mediated cell fate changes by a pooled induction coupled with scRNA-seq and multi-omics approaches,"Transcriptional regulation controls cellular functions through interactions between transcription factors (TFs) and their chromosomal targets. However, understanding the fate conversion potential of multiple TFs in an inducible manner remains limited. Here, we introduce iTF-seq as a method for identifying individual TFs that can alter cell fate toward specific lineages at a single-cell level. iTF-seq enables time course monitoring of transcriptome changes, and with biotinylated individual TFs, it provides a multi-omics approach to understanding the mechanisms behind TF-mediated cell fate changes. Our iTF-seq study in mouse embryonic stem cells identified multiple TFs that trigger rapid transcriptome changes indicative of differentiation within a day of induction. Moreover, cells expressing these potent TFs often show a slower cell cycle and increased cell death. Further analysis using bioChIP-seq revealed that GCM1 and OTX2 act as pioneer factors and activators by increasing gene accessibility and activating the expression of lineage specification genes during cell fate conversion. iTF-seq has utility in both mapping cell fate conversion and understanding cell fate conversion mechanisms.",38580401,PMC11067882,10.1101/gr.277926.123,0
Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals developmental heterogeneity among Plasmodium berghei sporozoites,"In the malaria-causing parasite's life cycle, Plasmodium sporozoites must travel from the midgut of a mosquito to the salivary glands before they can infect a mammalian host. However, only a fraction of sporozoites complete the journey. Since salivary gland invasion is required for transmission of sporozoites, insights at the molecular level can contribute to strategies for malaria prevention. Recent advances in single-cell RNA sequencing provide an opportunity to assess sporozoite heterogeneity at a resolution unattainable by bulk RNA sequencing methods. In this study, we use a droplet-based single-cell RNA sequencing workflow to analyze the transcriptomes of over 8000 Plasmodium berghei sporozoites derived from the midguts and salivary glands of Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes. The detection of known marker genes confirms the successful capture and sequencing of samples composed of a mixed population of sporozoites. Using data integration, clustering, and trajectory analyses, we reveal differences in gene expression profiles of individual sporozoites, and identify both annotated and unannotated markers associated with sporozoite development. Our work highlights the utility of a high-throughput workflow for the transcriptomic profiling of Plasmodium sporozoites, and provides new insights into gene usage during the parasite's development in the mosquito.",33619283,PMC7900125,10.1038/s41598-021-82914-w,9
Cell atlas of the foetal human heart and implications for autoimmune-mediated congenital heart block,"Aims:Investigating human heart development and applying this to deviations resulting in disease is incomplete without molecular characterization of the cell types required for normal functioning. We investigated foetal human heart single-cell transcriptomes from mid-gestational healthy and anti-SSA/Ro associated congenital heart block (CHB) samples.Methods and results:Three healthy foetal human hearts (19th to 22nd week of gestation) and one foetal heart affected by autoimmune-associated CHB (21st week of gestation) were subjected to enzymatic dissociation using the Langendorff preparation to obtain single-cell suspensions followed by 10× Genomics- and Illumina-based single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq). In addition to the myocytes, fibroblasts, immune cells, and other minor cell types, previously uncharacterized diverse sub-populations of endothelial cells were identified in the human heart. Differential gene expression analysis revealed increased and heterogeneous interferon responses in varied cell types of the CHB heart compared with the healthy controls. In addition, we also identified matrisome transcripts enriched in CHB stromal cells that potentially contribute to extracellular matrix deposition and subsequent fibrosis.Conclusion:These data provide an information-rich resource to further our understanding of human heart development, which, as illustrated by comparison to a heart exposed to a maternal autoimmune environment, can be leveraged to provide insight into the pathogenesis of disease.",31589297,PMC7314636,10.1093/cvr/cvz257,41
Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of the lateral hypothalamic area reveals molecularly distinct populations of inhibitory and excitatory neurons,"The lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) coordinates an array of fundamental behaviors, including sleeping, waking, feeding, stress and motivated behavior. The wide spectrum of functions ascribed to the LHA may be explained by a heterogeneous population of neurons, the full diversity of which is poorly understood. We employed a droplet-based single-cell RNA-sequencing approach to develop a comprehensive census of molecularly distinct cell types in the mouse LHA. Neuronal populations were classified based on fast neurotransmitter phenotype and expression of neuropeptides, transcription factors and synaptic proteins, among other gene categories. We define 15 distinct populations of glutamatergic neurons and 15 of GABAergic neurons, including known and novel cell types. We further characterize a novel population of somatostatin-expressing neurons through anatomical and behavioral approaches, identifying a role for these neurons in specific forms of innate locomotor behavior. This study lays the groundwork for better understanding the circuit-level underpinnings of LHA function.",30858605,PMC7043322,10.1038/s41593-019-0349-8,122
The molecular classification of cancer-associated fibroblasts on a pan-cancer single-cell transcriptional atlas,"Background:Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), integral to the tumour microenvironment, are pivotal in cancer progression, exhibiting either pro-tumourigenic or anti-tumourigenic functions. Their inherent phenotypic and functional diversity allows for the subdivision of CAFs into various subpopulations. While several classification systems have been suggested for different cancer types, a unified molecular classification of CAFs on a single-cell pan-cancer scale has yet to be established.Methods:We employed a comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic atlas encompassing 12 solid tumour types. Our objective was to establish a novel molecular classification and to elucidate the evolutionary trajectories of CAFs. We investigated the functional profiles of each CAF subtype using Single-Cell Regulatory Network Inference and Clustering and single-cell gene set enrichment analysis. The clinical relevance of these subtypes was assessed through survival curve analysis. Concurrently, we employed multiplex immunofluorescence staining on tumour tissues to determine the dynamic changes of CAF subtypes across different tumour stages. Additionally, we identified the small molecule procyanidin C1 (PCC1) as a target for matrix-producing CAF (matCAF) using molecular docking techniques and further validated these findings through in vitro and in vivo experiments.Results:In our investigation of solid tumours, we identified four molecular clusters of CAFs: progenitor CAF (proCAF), inflammatory CAF (iCAF), myofibroblastic CAF (myCAF) and matCAF, each characterised by distinct molecular traits. This classification was consistently applicable across all nine studied solid tumour types. These CAF subtypes displayed unique evolutionary pathways, functional roles and clinical relevance in various solid tumours. Notably, the matCAF subtype was associated with poorer prognoses in several cancer types. The targeting of matCAF using the identified small molecule, PCC1, demonstrated promising antitumour activity.Conclusions:Collectively, the various subtypes of CAFs, particularly matCAF, are crucial in the initiation and progression of cancer. Focusing therapeutic strategies on targeting matCAF in solid tumours holds significant potential for cancer treatment.",38148640,PMC10751516,10.1002/ctm2.1516,0
Hedgehog-FGF signaling axis patterns anterior mesoderm during gastrulation,"The mechanisms used by embryos to pattern tissues across their axes has fascinated developmental biologists since the founding of embryology. Here, using single-cell technology, we interrogate complex patterning defects and define a Hedgehog (Hh)-fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling axis required for anterior mesoderm lineage development during gastrulation. Single-cell transcriptome analysis of Hh-deficient mesoderm revealed selective deficits in anterior mesoderm populations, culminating in defects to anterior embryonic structures, including the pharyngeal arches, heart, and anterior somites. Transcriptional profiling of Hh-deficient mesoderm during gastrulation revealed disruptions to both transcriptional patterning of the mesoderm and FGF signaling for mesoderm migration. Mesoderm-specificFgf4/Fgf8double-mutants recapitulated anterior mesoderm defects and Hh-dependent GLI transcription factors modulated enhancers at FGF gene loci. Cellular migration defects during gastrulation induced by Hh pathway antagonism were mitigated by the addition of FGF4 protein. These findings implicate a multicomponent signaling hierarchy activated by Hh ligands from the embryonic node and executed by FGF signals in nascent mesoderm to control anterior mesoderm patterning.",32561646,PMC7354932,10.1073/pnas.1914167117,18

In contrast to other single-cell databases, SPICA hosts curated, cell type-specific reference atlases that describe immune cell states at high resolution, and published single-cell datasets analysed in the context of these atlases. Additionally, users can privately analyse their own data in the context of existing atlases and contribute to the SPICA database.

Emerging Imaging and Genomic Tools for Developmental Systems Biology,"Animal development is a complex and dynamic process orchestrated by exquisitely timed cell lineage commitment, divisions, migration, and morphological changes at the single-cell level. In the past decade, extensive genetic, stem cell, and genomic studies provided crucial insights into molecular underpinnings and the functional importance of genetic pathways governing various cellular differentiation processes. However, it is still largely unknown how the precise coordination of these pathways is achieved at the whole-organism level and how the highly regulated spatiotemporal choreography of development is established in turn. Here, we discuss the latest technological advances in imaging and single-cell genomics that hold great promise for advancing our understanding of this intricate process. We propose an integrated approach that combines such methods to quantitatively decipher in vivo cellular dynamic behaviors and their underlying molecular mechanisms at the systems level with single-cell, single-molecule resolution.",27003934,,10.1016/j.devcel.2016.02.016,15
Single-cell screening and quantification of transcripts in cancer tissues by second-harmonic generation microscopy,"Fluorescence-based single molecule techniques to interrogate gene expression in tissues present a very low signal-to-noise ratio due to the strong autofluorescence and other background signals from tissue sections. This report presents a background-free method using second-harmonic generation (SHG) nanocrystals as probes to quantify the messenger RNA (mRNA) of human epidermal growth receptor 2 (Her2) at single molecule resolution in specific phenotypes at single-cell resolution directly in tissues. Coherent SHG emission from individual barium titanium oxide (BTO) nanoprobes was demonstrated, allowing for a stable signal beyond the autofluorescence window. Her2 surface marker and Her2 mRNA were specifically labeled with BTO probes, and Her2 mRNA was quantified at single copy sensitivity in Her2 expressing phenotypes directly in cancer tissues. Our approach provides the first proof of concept of a cross-platform strategy to probe tissues at single-cell resolution in situ.",26405822,PMC4688913,10.1117/1.JBO.20.9.096016,1
Simultaneous deep transcriptome and proteome profiling in a single mouse oocyte,"Although single-cell multi-omics technologies are undergoing rapid development, simultaneous transcriptome and proteome analysis of a single-cell individual still faces great challenges. Here, we developed a single-cell simultaneous transcriptome and proteome (scSTAP) analysis platform based on microfluidics, high-throughput sequencing, and mass spectrometry technology to achieve deep and joint quantitative analysis of transcriptome and proteome at the single-cell level, providing an important resource for understanding the relationship between transcription and translation in cells. This platform was applied to analyze single mouse oocytes at different meiotic maturation stages, reaching an average quantification depth of 19,948 genes and 2,663 protein groups in single mouse oocytes. In particular, we analyzed the correlation of individual RNA and protein pairs, as well as the meiosis regulatory network with unprecedented depth, and identified 30 transcript-protein pairs as specific oocyte maturational signatures, which could be productive for exploring transcriptional and translational regulatory features during oocyte meiosis.",37976159,,10.1016/j.celrep.2023.113455,1
Single-Cell Transcriptomic Analyses of the Developing Meninges Reveal Meningeal Fibroblast Diversity and Function,"The meninges are a multilayered structure composed of fibroblasts, blood and lymphatic vessels, and immune cells. Meningeal fibroblasts secrete a variety of factors that control CNS development, yet strikingly little is known about their heterogeneity or development. Using single-cell sequencing, we report distinct transcriptional signatures for fibroblasts in the embryonic dura, arachnoid, and pia. We define new markers for meningeal layers and show conservation in human meninges. We find that embryonic meningeal fibroblasts are transcriptionally distinct between brain regions and identify a regionally localized pial subpopulation marked by the expression of μ-crystallin. Developmental analysis reveals a progressive, ventral-to-dorsal maturation of telencephalic meninges. Our studies have generated an unparalleled view of meningeal fibroblasts, providing molecular profiles of embryonic meningeal fibroblasts by layer and yielding insights into the mechanisms of meninges development and function.",32634398,PMC7769050,10.1016/j.devcel.2020.06.009,74
The landscape of human tissue and cell type specific expression and co-regulation of senescence genes,"Background:Cellular senescence is a complex stress response that impacts cellular function and organismal health. Multiple developmental and environmental factors, such as intrinsic cellular cues, radiation, oxidative stress, oncogenes, and protein accumulation, activate genes and pathways that can lead to senescence. Enormous efforts have been made to identify and characterize senescence genes (SnGs) in stress and disease systems. However, the prevalence of senescent cells in healthy human tissues and the global SnG expression signature in different cell types are poorly understood.Methods:This study performed an integrative gene network analysis of bulk and single-cell RNA-seq data in non-diseased human tissues to investigate SnG co-expression signatures and their cell-type specificity.Results:Through a comprehensive transcriptomic network analysis of 50 human tissues in the Genotype-Tissue Expression Project (GTEx) cohort, we identified SnG-enriched gene modules, characterized SnG co-expression patterns, and constructed aggregated SnG networks across primary tissues of the human body. Our network approaches identified 51 SnGs highly conserved across the human tissues, including CDKN1A (p21)-centered regulators that control cell cycle progression and the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). The SnG-enriched modules showed remarkable cell-type specificity, especially in fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and immune cells. Further analyses of single-cell RNA-seq and spatial transcriptomic data independently validated the cell-type specific SnG signatures predicted by the network analysis.Conclusions:This study systematically revealed the co-regulated organizations and cell type specificity of SnGs in major human tissues, which can serve as a blueprint for future studies to map senescent cells and their cellular interactions in human tissues.",35000600,PMC8744330,10.1186/s13024-021-00507-7,36
Mixed-species RNA-seq for elucidation of non-cell-autonomous control of gene transcription,"Transcriptomic changes induced in one cell type by another mediate many biological processes in the brain and elsewhere; however, achieving artifact-free physical separation of cell types to study them is challenging and generally allows for analysis of only a single cell type. We describe an approach using a co-culture of distinct cell types from different species that enables physical cell sorting to be replaced by in silico RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) read sorting, which is possible because of evolutionary divergence of messenger RNA (mRNA) sequences. As an exemplary experiment, we describe the co-culture of purified neurons, astrocytes, and microglia from different species (12-14 d). We describe how to use our Python tool, Sargasso, to separate the reads from conventional RNA-seq according to species and to eliminate any artifacts borne of imperfect genome annotation (10 h). We show how this procedure, which requires no special skills beyond those that might normally be expected of wet lab and bioinformatics researchers, enables the simultaneous transcriptomic profiling of different cell types, revealing the distinct influence of microglia on astrocytic and neuronal transcriptomes under inflammatory conditions.",30250293,,10.1038/s41596-018-0029-2,14
Spatially resolved transcriptomic profiles reveal unique defining molecular features of infiltrative 5ALA-metabolizing cells associated with glioblastoma recurrence,"Background:Spatiotemporal heterogeneity originating from genomic and transcriptional variation was found to contribute to subtype switching in isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 wild-type glioblastoma (GBM) prior to and upon recurrence. Fluorescence-guided neurosurgical resection utilizing 5-aminolevulinic acid (5ALA) enables intraoperative visualization of infiltrative tumors outside the magnetic resonance imaging contrast-enhanced regions. The cell population and functional status of tumor responsible for enhancing 5ALA-metabolism to fluorescence-active PpIX remain elusive. The close spatial proximity of 5ALA-metabolizing (5ALA +) cells to residual disease remaining post-surgery renders 5ALA + biology an early a priori proxy of GBM recurrence, which is poorly understood.Methods:We performed spatially resolved bulk RNA profiling (SPRP) analysis of unsorted Core, Rim, Invasive margin tissue, and FACS-isolated 5ALA + /5ALA - cells from the invasive margin across IDH-wt GBM patients (N = 10) coupled with histological, radiographic, and two-photon excitation fluorescence microscopic analyses. Deconvolution of SPRP followed by functional analyses was performed using CIBEROSRTx and UCell enrichment algorithms, respectively. We further investigated the spatial architecture of 5ALA + enriched regions by analyzing spatial transcriptomics from an independent IDH-wt GBM cohort (N = 16). Lastly, we performed survival analysis using Cox Proportinal-Hazards model on large GBM cohorts.Results:SPRP analysis integrated with single-cell and spatial transcriptomics uncovered that the GBM molecular subtype heterogeneity is likely to manifest regionally in a cell-type-specific manner. Infiltrative 5ALA + cell population(s) harboring transcriptionally concordant GBM and myeloid cells with mesenchymal subtype, -active wound response, and glycolytic metabolic signature, was shown to reside within the invasive margin spatially distinct from the tumor core. The spatial co-localization of the infiltrating MES GBM and myeloid cells within the 5ALA + region indicates PpIX fluorescence can effectively be utilized to resect the immune reactive zone beyond the tumor core. Finally, 5ALA + gene signatures were associated with poor survival and recurrence in GBM, signifying that the transition from primary to recurrent GBM is not discrete but rather a continuum whereby primary infiltrative 5ALA + remnant tumor cells more closely resemble the eventual recurrent GBM.Conclusions:Elucidating the unique molecular and cellular features of the 5ALA + population within tumor invasive margin opens up unique possibilities to develop more effective treatments to delay or block GBM recurrence, and warrants commencement of such treatments as early as possible post-surgical resection of the primary neoplasm.",37434262,PMC10337060,10.1186/s13073-023-01207-1,1
Plant Nuclei Isolation for Single-Nucleus RNA Sequencing,"Transcriptome profiling has been significantly hampered by the heterogeneity among individual cells within a tissue or an organ. Recent advances in single cell transcriptome profiling have significantly advanced our understanding of the transcriptome. However, plant single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) relies on the isolation of protoplasts, which is not only impossible for many cell types but also induces acute wounding responses. To solve these problems, single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) has been applied to plant research, in which nuclei are isolated and subject to encapsulation and profiling. Compared with scRNA-seq, snRNA-seq can be applied to a wider range of tissue types and plant species. Nevertheless, fewer transcripts can be obtained from each nucleus than each protoplast. In this chapter, we describe a detailed and general protocol to prepare nuclei from plant tissues that are ready for subsequent library construction and high-throughput sequencing.",37540366,,10.1007/978-1-0716-3299-4_15,0
Overcoming confounding plate effects in differential expression analyses of single-cell RNA-seq data,"An increasing number of studies are using single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to characterize the gene expression profiles of individual cells. One common analysis applied to scRNA-seq data involves detecting differentially expressed (DE) genes between cells in different biological groups. However, many experiments are designed such that the cells to be compared are processed in separate plates or chips, meaning that the groupings are confounded with systematic plate effects. This confounding aspect is frequently ignored in DE analyses of scRNA-seq data. In this article, we demonstrate that failing to consider plate effects in the statistical model results in loss of type I error control. A solution is proposed whereby counts are summed from all cells in each plate and the count sums for all plates are used in the DE analysis. This restores type I error control in the presence of plate effects without compromising detection power in simulated data. Summation is also robust to varying numbers and library sizes of cells on each plate. Similar results are observed in DE analyses of real data where the use of count sums instead of single-cell counts improves specificity and the ranking of relevant genes. This suggests that summation can assist in maintaining statistical rigour in DE analyses of scRNA-seq data with plate effects.",28334062,PMC5862359,10.1093/biostatistics/kxw055,66
Scrublet: Computational Identification of Cell Doublets in Single-Cell Transcriptomic Data,"Single-cell RNA-sequencing has become a widely used, powerful approach for studying cell populations. However, these methods often generate multiplet artifacts, where two or more cells receive the same barcode, resulting in a hybrid transcriptome. In most experiments, multiplets account for several percent of transcriptomes and can confound downstream data analysis. Here, we present Single-Cell Remover of Doublets (Scrublet), a framework for predicting the impact of multiplets in a given analysis and identifying problematic multiplets. Scrublet avoids the need for expert knowledge or cell clustering by simulating multiplets from the data and building a nearest neighbor classifier. To demonstrate the utility of this approach, we test Scrublet on several datasets that include independent knowledge of cell multiplets. Scrublet is freely available for download at github.com/AllonKleinLab/scrublet.",30954476,PMC6625319,10.1016/j.cels.2018.11.005,791
Dissection of intercellular communication using the transcriptome-based framework ICELLNET,"Cell-to-cell communication can be inferred from ligand-receptor expression in cell transcriptomic datasets. However, important challenges remain: global integration of cell-to-cell communication; biological interpretation; and application to individual cell population transcriptomic profiles. We develop ICELLNET, a transcriptomic-based framework integrating: 1) an original expert-curated database of ligand-receptor interactions accounting for multiple subunits expression; 2) quantification of communication scores; 3) the possibility to connect a cell population of interest with 31 reference human cell types; and 4) three visualization modes to facilitate biological interpretation. We apply ICELLNET to three datasets generated through RNA-seq, single-cell RNA-seq, and microarray. ICELLNET reveals autocrine IL-10 control of human dendritic cell communication with up to 12 cell types. Four of them (T cells, keratinocytes, neutrophils, pDC) are further tested and experimentally validated. In summary, ICELLNET is a global, versatile, biologically validated, and easy-to-use framework to dissect cell communication from individual or multiple cell-based transcriptomic profiles.",33597528,PMC7889941,10.1038/s41467-021-21244-x,76
scTEA-db: a comprehensive database of novel terminal exon isoforms identified from human single cell transcriptomes,"The usage of alternative terminal exons results in messenger RNA (mRNA) isoforms that differ in their 3' untranslated regions (3' UTRs) and often also in their protein-coding sequences. Alternative 3' UTRs contain different sets of cis-regulatory elements known to regulate mRNA stability, translation and localization, all of which are vital to cell identity and function. In previous work, we revealed that ∼25 percent of the experimentally observed RNA 3' ends are located within regions currently annotated as intronic, indicating that many 3' end isoforms remain to be uncovered. Also, the inclusion of not yet annotated terminal exons is more tissue specific compared to the already annotated ones. Here, we present the single cell-based Terminal Exon Annotation database (scTEA-db, www.scTEA-db.org) that provides the community with 12 063 so far not yet annotated terminal exons and associated transcript isoforms identified by analysing 53 069 publicly available single cell transcriptomes. Our scTEA-db web portal offers an array of features to find and explore novel terminal exons belonging to 5538 human genes, 110 of which are known cancer drivers. In summary, scTEA-db provides the foundation for studying the biological role of large numbers of so far not annotated terminal exon isoforms in cell identity and function.",37850641,PMC10767918,10.1093/nar/gkad878,1
Single-Cell Transcriptomic Profiling Unveils Dynamic Immune Cell Responses duringHaemonchus contortusInfection,"Background:Haemonchus contortusis a parasite widely distributed in tropical, subtropical, and warm temperate regions, causing significant economic losses in the livestock industry worldwide. However, little is known about the genetics ofH. contortusresistance in livestock. In this study, we monitor the dynamic immune cell responses in diverse peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) duringH. contortusinfection in goats through single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) analysis.Methods and results:A total of four Boer goats, two goats with oral infection with the L3 larvae ofH. contortusand two healthy goats as controls, were used in the animal test. The infection model in goats was established and validated by the fecal egg count (FEC) test and qPCR analysis of the gene expression of IL-5 and IL-6. Using scRNA-Seq, we identified seven cell types, including T cells, monocytes, natural killer cells, B cells, and dendritic cells with distinct gene expression signatures. After identifying cell subpopulations of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the case and control groups, we observed the upregulation of multiple inflammation-associated genes, including NFKBIA and NFKBID. Kyoto Encyclopedia of the Genome (KEGG) enrichment analysis revealed significant enrichment of NOD-like receptor pathways and Th1/Th2 cell differentiation signaling pathways in CD4 T cells DEGs. Furthermore, the analysis of ligand-receptor interaction networks showed a more active state of cellular communication in the PBMCs from the case group, and the inflammatory response associated MIF-(CD74 + CXCR4) ligand receptor complex was significantly more activated in the case group, suggesting a potential inflammatory response.Conclusions:Our study preliminarily revealed transcriptomic profiling characterizing the cell type specific mechanisms in host PBMCs at the single-cell level duringH. contortusinfection.",38786064,PMC11120485,10.3390/cells13100842,0
Single-cell transcriptome analysis reveals aberrant stromal cells and heterogeneous endothelial cells in alcohol-induced osteonecrosis of the femoral head,"Alcohol-induced osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) is a disabling disease with a high incidence and elusive pathogenesis. Here, we used single-cell RNA sequencing to explore the transcriptomic landscape of mid- and advanced-stage alcohol-induced ONFH. Cells derived from age-matched hip osteoarthritis and femoral neck fracture samples were used as control. Our bioinformatics analysis revealed the disorder of osteogenic-adipogenic differentiation of stromal cells in ONFH and altered regulons such as MEF2C and JUND. In addition, we reported that one of the endothelial cell clusters with ACKR1 expression exhibited strong chemotaxis and a weak angiogenic ability and expanded with disease progression. Furthermore, ligand-receptor-based cell-cell interaction analysis indicated that ACKR1+ endothelial cells might specifically communicate with stromal cells through the VISFATIN and SELE pathways, thus influencing stromal cell differentiation in ONFH. Overall, our data revealed single cell transcriptome characteristics in alcohol-induced ONFH, which may contribute to the further investigation of ONFH pathogenesis.",35388143,PMC8987047,10.1038/s42003-022-03271-6,3
A Bayesian mixture model for clustering droplet-based single-cell transcriptomic data from population studies,"The recently developed droplet-based single-cell transcriptome sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology makes it feasible to perform a population-scale scRNA-seq study, in which the transcriptome is measured for tens of thousands of single cells from multiple individuals. Despite the advances of many clustering methods, there are few tailored methods for population-scale scRNA-seq studies. Here, we develop a Bayesian mixture model for single-cell sequencing (BAMM-SC) method to cluster scRNA-seq data from multiple individuals simultaneously. BAMM-SC takes raw count data as input and accounts for data heterogeneity and batch effect among multiple individuals in a unified Bayesian hierarchical model framework. Results from extensive simulation studies and applications of BAMM-SC to in-house experimental scRNA-seq datasets using blood, lung and skin cells from humans or mice demonstrate that BAMM-SC outperformed existing clustering methods with considerable improved clustering accuracy, particularly in the presence of heterogeneity among individuals.",30967541,PMC6456731,10.1038/s41467-019-09639-3,30
Cell lineage inference from SNP and scRNA-Seq data,"Several recent studies focus on the inference of developmental and response trajectories from single cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) data. A number of computational methods, often referred to as pseudo-time ordering, have been developed for this task. Recently, CRISPR has also been used to reconstruct lineage trees by inserting random mutations. However, both approaches suffer from drawbacks that limit their use. Here, we develop a method to detect significant, cell type specific, sequence mutations from scRNA-Seq data. We show that only a few mutations are enough for reconstructing good branching models. Integrating these mutations with expression data further improves the accuracy of the reconstructed models. As we show, the majority of mutations we identify are likely RNA editing events indicating that such information can be used to distinguish cell types.",30820578,PMC6547431,10.1093/nar/gkz146,12
Systematic dissection of tumor-normal single-cell ecosystems across a thousand tumors of 30 cancer types,"The complexity of the tumor microenvironment poses significant challenges in cancer therapy. Here, to comprehensively investigate the tumor-normal ecosystems, we perform an integrative analysis of 4.9 million single-cell transcriptomes from 1070 tumor and 493 normal samples in combination with pan-cancer 137 spatial transcriptomics, 8887 TCGA, and 1261 checkpoint inhibitor-treated bulk tumors. We define a myriad of cell states constituting the tumor-normal ecosystems and also identify hallmark gene signatures across different cell types and organs. Our atlas characterizes distinctions between inflammatory fibroblasts marked by AKR1C1 or WNT5A in terms of cellular interactions and spatial co-localization patterns. Co-occurrence analysis reveals interferon-enriched community states including tertiary lymphoid structure (TLS) components, which exhibit differential rewiring between tumor, adjacent normal, and healthy normal tissues. The favorable response of interferon-enriched community states to immunotherapy is validated using immunotherapy-treated cancers (n = 1261) including our lung cancer cohort (n = 497). Deconvolution of spatial transcriptomes discriminates TLS-enriched from non-enriched cell types among immunotherapy-favorable components. Our systematic dissection of tumor-normal ecosystems provides a deeper understanding of inter- and intra-tumoral heterogeneity.",38744958,PMC11094150,10.1038/s41467-024-48310-4,0
BANKSY unifies cell typing and tissue domain segmentation for scalable spatial omics data analysis,"Spatial omics data are clustered to define both cell types and tissue domains. We present Building Aggregates with a Neighborhood Kernel and Spatial Yardstick (BANKSY), an algorithm that unifies these two spatial clustering problems by embedding cells in a product space of their own and the local neighborhood transcriptome, representing cell state and microenvironment, respectively. BANKSY's spatial feature augmentation strategy improved performance on both tasks when tested on diverse RNA (imaging, sequencing) and protein (imaging) datasets. BANKSY revealed unexpected niche-dependent cell states in the mouse brain and outperformed competing methods on domain segmentation and cell typing benchmarks. BANKSY can also be used for quality control of spatial transcriptomics data and for spatially aware batch effect correction. Importantly, it is substantially faster and more scalable than existing methods, enabling the processing of millions of cell datasets. In summary, BANKSY provides an accurate, biologically motivated, scalable and versatile framework for analyzing spatially resolved omics data.",38413725,PMC10937399,10.1038/s41588-024-01664-3,5
The molecular cytoarchitecture of the adult mouse brain,"The function of the mammalian brain relies upon the specification and spatial positioning of diversely specialized cell types. Yet, the molecular identities of the cell types and their positions within individual anatomical structures remain incompletely known. To construct a comprehensive atlas of cell types in each brain structure, we paired high-throughput single-nucleus RNA sequencing with Slide-seq1,2-a recently developed spatial transcriptomics method with near-cellular resolution-across the entire mouse brain. Integration of these datasets revealed the cell type composition of each neuroanatomical structure. Cell type diversity was found to be remarkably high in the midbrain, hindbrain and hypothalamus, with most clusters requiring a combination of at least three discrete gene expression markers to uniquely define them. Using these data, we developed a framework for genetically accessing each cell type, comprehensively characterized neuropeptide and neurotransmitter signalling, elucidated region-specific specializations in activity-regulated gene expression and ascertained the heritability enrichment of neurological and psychiatric phenotypes. These data, available as an online resource ( www.BrainCellData.org ), should find diverse applications across neuroscience, including the construction of new genetic tools and the prioritization of specific cell types and circuits in the study of brain diseases.",38092915,PMC10719111,10.1038/s41586-023-06818-7,7
Going the Distance: Optimizing RNA-Seq Strategies for Transcriptomic Analysis of Complex Viral Genomes,"Transcriptome profiling has become routine in studies of many biological processes. However, the favored approaches such as short-read Illumina RNA sequencing are giving way to long-read sequencing platforms better suited to interrogating the complex transcriptomes typical of many RNA and DNA viruses. Here, we provide a guide-tailored to molecular virologists-to the ins and outs of viral transcriptome sequencing and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the major RNA sequencing technologies as tools to analyze the abundance and diversity of the viral transcripts made during infection.",30305358,PMC6288342,10.1128/JVI.01342-18,24
High-throughput intracellular biopsy of microRNAs for dissecting the temporal dynamics of cellular heterogeneity,"The capability to analyze small RNAs responsible for post-transcriptional regulation of genes expression is essential for characterizing cellular phenotypes. Here, we describe an intracellular biopsy technique (inCell-Biopsy) for fast, multiplexed, and highly sensitive profiling of microRNAs (miRNAs). The technique uses an array of diamond nanoneedles that are functionalized with size-dependent RNA binding proteins, working as ""fishing rods"" to directly pull miRNAs out of cytoplasm while keeping the cells alive, thus enabling quasi-single-cell miRNA analysis. Each nanoneedle works as a reaction chamber for parallel in situ amplification, visualization, and quantification of miRNAs as low as femtomolar, which is sufficient to detect miRNAs of a single-copy intracellular abundance with specificity to single-nucleotide variation. Using inCell-Biopsy, we analyze the temporal miRNA transcriptome over the differentiation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs). The combinatorial miRNA expression patterns derived by inCell-Biopsy identify emerging cell subpopulations differentiated from ESCs and reveal the dynamic evolution of cellular heterogeneity.",32577522,PMC7286670,10.1126/sciadv.aba4971,6
A single-cell transcriptomic atlas characterizes cell types and their molecular features in yak ovarian cortex,"The ovary as one of the most dynamic organs produces steroids to orchestrate female secondary sexual characteristics, harbors ovarian reserve for oocytes, releases mature oocytes for fertilization, and maintains pregnancy. Yak (Bos grunniens) is the only bovid animal that can adapt to the harsh climatic conditions on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (altitudes of over 3000 m above sea level). However, the cellular atlas is composed of oocytes and other somatic cells, and their individual molecular characteristics remain to be elucidated in the yak ovary. Here, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was performed to delineate the molecular signature of various cell types in the yak ovarian cortex. A cellular atlas of yak ovarian cortex was constructed successfully on the basis of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from the distinct cell types and their functional enrichment analysis, comprising endothelial cells, nature kill cells, stromal cells, smooth muscle cells, oocytes, macrophages, epithelial cells, and granulosa cells. Meanwhile, the signature genes were determined based on their expression specificity in each cell type. A cell-to-cell communication network was built in light of the differentially overexpressed ligand and receptor genes from each cell type. Further, the oocytes were subdivided into four subtypes based on their individual DEGs and the functional enrichment of the DEGs. FST and TOP2A were identified as maker genes for oocytes by immunostaining in the yak ovarian cortex. The cellular atlas reveals the biological characteristics of the ovarian cortex at the cellular molecular level and provides insights into female reproductive biology via cellular communications in the yak.",36527406,,10.1096/fj.202201176RR,4
Data Analysis in Single-Cell Transcriptome Sequencing,"Single-cell transcriptome sequencing, often referred to as single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), is used to measure gene expression at the single-cell level and provides a higher resolution of cellular differences than bulk RNA-seq. With more detailed and accurate information, scRNA-seq will greatly promote the understanding of cell functions, disease progression, and treatment response. Although the scRNA-seq experimental protocols have been improved very quickly, many challenges in the scRNA-seq data analysis still need to be overcome. In this chapter, we focus on the introduction and discussion of the research status in the field of scRNA-seq data normalization and cluster analysis, which are the two most important challenges in the scRNA-seq data analysis. Particularly, we present a protocol to discover and validate cancer stem cells (CSCs) using scRNA-seq. Suggestions have also been made to help researchers rationally design their scRNA-seq experiments and data analysis in their future studies.",29536451,,10.1007/978-1-4939-7717-8_18,26
RNA sequencing: new technologies and applications in cancer research,"Over the past few decades, RNA sequencing has significantly progressed, becoming a paramount approach for transcriptome profiling. The revolution from bulk RNA sequencing to single-molecular, single-cell and spatial transcriptome approaches has enabled increasingly accurate, individual cell resolution incorporated with spatial information. Cancer, a major malignant and heterogeneous lethal disease, remains an enormous challenge in medical research and clinical treatment. As a vital tool, RNA sequencing has been utilized in many aspects of cancer research and therapy, including biomarker discovery and characterization of cancer heterogeneity and evolution, drug resistance, cancer immune microenvironment and immunotherapy, cancer neoantigens and so on. In this review, the latest studies on RNA sequencing technology and their applications in cancer are summarized, and future challenges and opportunities for RNA sequencing technology in cancer applications are discussed.",33276803,PMC7716291,10.1186/s13045-020-01005-x,155
Single-cell transcriptome analysis of human skin identifies novel fibroblast subpopulation and enrichment of immune subsets in atopic dermatitis,"Background:Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a prevalent inflammatory skin disease with a complex pathogenesis involving immune cell and epidermal abnormalities. Despite whole tissue biopsy studies that have advanced the mechanistic understanding of AD, single cell-based molecular alterations are largely unknown.Objective:Our aims were to construct a detailed, high-resolution atlas of cell populations and assess variability in cell composition and cell-specific gene expression in the skin of patients with AD versus in controls.Methods:We performed single-cell RNA sequencing on skin biopsy specimens from 5 patients with AD (4 lesional samples and 5 nonlesional samples) and 7 healthy control subjects, using 10× Genomics.Results:We created transcriptomic profiles for 39,042 AD (lesional and nonlesional) and healthy skin cells. Fibroblasts demonstrated a novel COL6A5+COL18A1+subpopulation that was unique to lesional AD and expressed CCL2 and CCL19 cytokines. A corresponding LAMP3+dendritic cell (DC) population that expressed the CCL19 receptor CCR7 was also unique to AD lesions, illustrating a potential role for fibroblast signaling to immune cells. The lesional AD samples were characterized by expansion of inflammatory DCs (CD1A+FCER1A+) and tissue-resident memory T cells (CD69+CD103+). The frequencies of type 2 (IL13+)/type 22 (IL22+) T cells were higher than those of type 1 (IFNG+) in lesional AD, whereas this ratio was slightly diminished in nonlesional AD and further diminished in controls.Conclusion:AD lesions were characterized by expanded type 2/type 22 T cells and inflammatory DCs, and by a unique inflammatory fibroblast that may interact with immune cells to regulate lymphoid cell organization and type 2 inflammation.",32035984,,10.1016/j.jaci.2020.01.042,141
Ageing affects DNA methylation drift and transcriptional cell-to-cell variability in mouse muscle stem cells,"Age-related tissue alterations have been associated with a decline in stem cell number and function. Although increased cell-to-cell variability in transcription or epigenetic marks has been proposed to be a major hallmark of ageing, little is known about the molecular diversity of stem cells during ageing. Here we present a single cell multi-omics study of mouse muscle stem cells, combining single-cell transcriptome and DNA methylome profiling. Aged cells show a global increase of uncoordinated transcriptional heterogeneity biased towards genes regulating cell-niche interactions. We find context-dependent alterations of DNA methylation in aged stem cells. Importantly, promoters with increased methylation heterogeneity are associated with increased transcriptional heterogeneity of the genes they drive. These results indicate that epigenetic drift, by accumulation of stochastic DNA methylation changes in promoters, is associated with the degradation of coherent transcriptional networks during stem cell ageing. Furthermore, our observations also shed light on the mechanisms underlying the DNA methylation clock.",31554804,PMC6761124,10.1038/s41467-019-12293-4,96
Single cell analysis of the inner ear sensory organs,"The inner ear is composed of a complex mixture of cells, which together allow organisms to hear and maintain balance. The cells in the inner ear, which undergo an extraordinary process of development, have only recently begun to be studied on an individual level. As it has recently become clear that individual cells, previously considered to be of uniform character, may differ dramatically from each other, the need to study cell-to-cell variation, along with distinct transcriptional and regulatory signatures, has taken hold in the scientific community. In conjunction with high-throughput technologies, attempts are underway to dissect the inter- and intra-cellular variability of different cell types and developmental states of the inner ear from a novel perspective. Single cell analysis of the inner ear sensory organs holds the promise of providing a significant boost in building an omics network that translates into a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms of hearing and balance. These networks may uncover critical elements for trans-differentiation, regeneration and/or reprogramming, providing entry points for therapeutics of deafness and vestibular pathologies.",28621418,PMC5709810,10.1387/ijdb.160453ka,3
Likelihood-based tests for detecting circadian rhythmicity and differential circadian patterns in transcriptomic applications,"Circadian rhythmicity in transcriptomic profiles has been shown in many physiological processes, and the disruption of circadian patterns has been found to associate with several diseases. In this paper, we developed a series of likelihood-based methods to detect (i) circadian rhythmicity (denoted as LR_rhythmicity) and (ii) differential circadian patterns comparing two experimental conditions (denoted as LR_diff). In terms of circadian rhythmicity detection, we demonstrated that our proposed LR_rhythmicity could better control the type I error rate compared to existing methods under a wide variety of simulation settings. In terms of differential circadian patterns, we developed methods in detecting differential amplitude, differential phase, differential basal level and differential fit, which also successfully controlled the type I error rate. In addition, we demonstrated that the proposed LR_diff could achieve higher statistical power in detecting differential fit, compared to existing methods. The superior performance of LR_rhythmicity and LR_diff was demonstrated in four real data applications, including a brain aging data (gene expression microarray data of human postmortem brain), a time-restricted feeding data (RNA sequencing data of human skeletal muscles) and a scRNAseq data (single cell RNA sequencing data of mouse suprachiasmatic nucleus). An R package for our methods is publicly available on GitHub https://github.com/diffCircadian/diffCircadian.",34117739,PMC8575021,10.1093/bib/bbab224,9
Creation of a Single Cell RNASeq Meta-Atlas to Define Human Liver Immune Homeostasis,"The liver is unique in both its ability to maintain immune homeostasis and in its potential for immune tolerance following solid organ transplantation. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA seq) is a powerful approach to generate highly dimensional transcriptome data to understand cellular phenotypes. However, when scRNA data is produced by different groups, with different data models, different standards, and samples processed in different ways, it can be challenging to draw meaningful conclusions from the aggregated data. The goal of this study was to establish a method to combine 'human liver' scRNA seq datasets by 1) characterizing the heterogeneity between studies and 2) using the meta-atlas to define the dominant phenotypes across immune cell subpopulations in healthy human liver. Publicly available scRNA seq data generated from liver samples obtained from a combined total of 17 patients and ~32,000 cells were analyzed. Liver-specific immune cells (CD45+) were extracted from each dataset, and immune cell subpopulations (myeloid cells, NK and T cells, plasma cells, and B cells) were examined using dimensionality reduction (UMAP), differential gene expression, and ingenuity pathway analysis. All datasets co-clustered, but cell proportions differed between studies. Gene expression correlation demonstrated similarity across all studies, and canonical pathways that differed between datasets were related to cell stress and oxidative phosphorylation rather than immune-related function. Next, a meta-atlas was generatedviadata integration and compared against PBMC data to define gene signatures for each hepatic immune subpopulation. This analysis defined key features of hepatic immune homeostasis, with decreased expression across immunologic pathways and enhancement of pathways involved with cell death. This method for meta-analysis of scRNA seq data provides a novel approach to broadly define the features of human liver immune homeostasis. Specific pathways and cellular phenotypes described in this human liver immune meta-atlas provide a critical reference point for further study of immune mediated disease processes within the liver.",34335581,PMC8322955,10.3389/fimmu.2021.679521,8
Detecting retinal neural and stromal cell classes and ganglion cell subtypes based on transcriptome data with deep transfer learning,"Motivation:To develop and assess the accuracy of deep learning models that identify different retinal cell types, as well as different retinal ganglion cell (RGC) subtypes, based on patterns of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) in multiple datasets.Results:Deep domain adaptation models were developed and tested using three different datasets. The first dataset included 44 808 single retinal cells from mice (39 cell types) with 24 658 genes, the second dataset included 6225 single RGCs from mice (41 subtypes) with 13 616 genes and the third dataset included 35 699 single RGCs from mice (45 subtypes) with 18 222 genes. We used four loss functions in the learning process to align the source and target distributions, reduce misclassification errors and maximize robustness. Models were evaluated based on classification accuracy and confusion matrix. The accuracy of the model for correctly classifying 39 different retinal cell types in the first dataset was ∼92%. Accuracy in the second and third datasets reached ∼97% and 97% in correctly classifying 40 and 45 different RGCs subtypes, respectively. Across a range of seven different batches in the first dataset, the accuracy of the lead model ranged from 74% to nearly 100%. The lead model provided high accuracy in identifying retinal cell types and RGC subtypes based on scRNA-seq data. The performance was reasonable based on data from different batches as well. The validated model could be readily applied to scRNA-seq data to identify different retinal cell types and subtypes.Availability and implementation:The code and datasets are available on https://github.com/DM2LL/Detecting-Retinal-Cell-Classes-and-Ganglion-Cell-Subtypes. We have also added the class labels of all samples to the datasets.Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",35876552,PMC9991888,10.1093/bioinformatics/btac514,1
Low bias multiple displacement amplification with confinement effect based on agarose gel,"Multiple displacement amplification (MDA) is a popular single-cell whole-genome amplification (WGA) technique that can greatly improve the amplification efficiency of single-cell genomes. However, there is an inherent problem that cannot be completely solved, that is, the amplification bias. We here propose an improved MDA method based on low melting agarose gel, named gelMDA. Firstly, the agarose gel and solution were characterized with SEM and fluorescent reagent. Then, we used gelMDA for cDNA amplification in library preparation of RNA-seq, and conventional MDA was used as a comparison. The sensitivity, efficiency of gelMDA, and amplification bias were evaluated with fluorescence curve, product yield, and the sequencing results. Finally, gelMDA was used for single-cell transcriptome sequencing. The results showed that the sensitivity and product yield of gelMDA were significantly higher than those of conventional MDA. A lower coefficient of variation (CV) and a higher reproducibility were obtained from gelMDA sequencing results. A region of 30 μm in diameter was amplified from the tissue sections and successfully sequenced. In conclusion, gelMDA obtained higher amplification efficiency and lower amplification bias in the present study. It suggested the great potential in single-cell RNA amplification and sequencing.",34050387,,10.1007/s00216-021-03415-3,0
Insights into Gonadal Sex Differentiation Provided by Single-Cell Transcriptomics in the Chicken Embryo,"Although the genetic triggers for gonadal sex differentiation vary across species, the cell biology of gonadal development was long thought to be largely conserved. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of gonadal sex differentiation, using single-cell sequencing in the embryonic chicken gonad during sexual differentiation. The data show that chicken embryonic-supporting cells do not derive from the coelomic epithelium, in contrast to other vertebrates studied. Instead, they derive from a DMRT1+/PAX2+/WNT4+/OSR1+mesenchymal cell population. We find a greater complexity of gonadal cell types than previously thought, including the identification of two distinct sub-populations of Sertoli cells in developing testes and derivation of embryonic steroidogenic cells from a differentiated supporting-cell lineage. Altogether, these results indicate that, just as the genetic trigger for sex differs across vertebrate groups, cell lineage specification in the gonad may also vary substantially.",32268081,,10.1016/j.celrep.2020.03.055,39
Single-Cell Transcriptomics ofMtb/HIV Co-Infection,"Tuberculosis (TB) and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) co-infection continues to pose a significant healthcare burden. HIV co-infection during TB predisposes the host to the reactivation of latent TB infection (LTBI), worsening disease conditions and mortality. There is a lack of biomarkers of LTBI reactivation and/or immune-related transcriptional signatures to distinguish active TB from LTBI and predict TB reactivation upon HIV co-infection. Characterizing individual cells using next-generation sequencing-based technologies has facilitated novel biological discoveries about infectious diseases, including TB and HIV pathogenesis. Compared to the more conventional sequencing techniques that provide a bulk assessment, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) can reveal complex and new cell types and identify more high-resolution cellular heterogeneity. This review will summarize the progress made in defining the immune atlas of TB and HIV infections using scRNA-seq, including host-pathogen interactions, heterogeneity in HIV pathogenesis, and the animal models employed to model disease. This review will also address the tools needed to bridge the gap between disease outcomes in single infection vs. co-infection. Finally, it will elaborate on the translational benefits of single-cell sequencing in TB/HIV diagnosis in humans.",37759517,PMC10529032,10.3390/cells12182295,0
Sequencing dropout-and-batch effect normalization for single-cell mRNA profiles: a survey and comparative analysis,"Single-cell mRNA sequencing has been adopted as a powerful technique for understanding gene expression profiles at the single-cell level. However, challenges remain due to factors such as the inefficiency of mRNA molecular capture, technical noises and separate sequencing of cells in different batches. Normalization methods have been developed to ensure a relatively accurate analysis. This work presents a survey on 10 tools specifically designed for single-cell mRNA sequencing data preprocessing steps, among which 6 tools are used for dropout normalization and 4 tools are for batch effect correction. In this survey, we outline the main methodology for each of these tools, and we also compare these tools to evaluate their normalization performance on datasets which are simulated under the constraints of dropout inefficiency, batch effect or their combined effects. We found that Saver and Baynorm performed better than other methods in dropout normalization, in most cases. Beer and Batchelor performed better in the batch effect normalization, and the Saver-Beer tool combination and the Baynorm-Beer combination performed better in the mixed dropout-and-batch effect normalization. Over-normalization is a common issue occurred to these dropout normalization tools that is worth of future investigation. For the batch normalization tools, the capability of retaining heterogeneity between different groups of cells after normalization can be another direction for future improvement.",33073843,,10.1093/bib/bbaa248,4
SCeQTL: an R package for identifying eQTL from single-cell parallel sequencing data,"Background:With the rapid development of single-cell genomics, technologies for parallel sequencing of the transcriptome and genome in each single cell is being explored in several labs and is becoming available. This brings us the opportunity to uncover association between genotypes and gene expression phenotypes at single-cell level by eQTL analysis on single-cell data. New method is needed for such tasks due to special characteristics of single-cell sequencing data.Results:We developed an R package SCeQTL that uses zero-inflated negative binomial regression to do eQTL analysis on single-cell data. It can distinguish two type of gene-expression differences among different genotype groups. It can also be used for finding gene expression variations associated with other grouping factors like cell lineages or cell types.Conclusions:The SCeQTL method is capable for eQTL analysis on single-cell data as well as detecting associations of gene expression with other grouping factors.

PANoptosis-related signature in melanoma: Transcriptomic mapping and clinical prognostication,"Programmed cell death plays a pivotal role in maintaining tissue homeostasis, and recent advancements in cell biology have uncovered PANoptosis-a novel paradigm integrating pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis. This study investigates the implications of PANoptosis in melanoma, a formidable skin cancer known for its metastatic potential and resistance to conventional therapies. Leveraging bulk and single-cell transcriptome analyses, machine learning modeling, and immune correlation assessments, we unveil the molecular intricacies of PANoptosis in melanoma. Single-cell sequencing identifies diverse cell types involved in PANoptosis, while bulk transcriptome analysis reveals key gene sets correlated with PANoptosis. Machine learning algorithms construct a robust prognostic model, demonstrating consistent predictive power across diverse cohorts. Patients with different cohorts can be divided into high-risk and low-risk groups according to this PANoptosis score, with the high-risk group having a significantly worse prognosis. Immune correlation analyses unveil a link between PANoptosis and immunotherapy response, with potential therapeutic implications. Mutation analysis and enrichment studies provide insights into the mutational landscape associated with PANoptosis. Finally, we used cell experiments to verify the expression and function of key gene PARVA, showing that PARVA was highly expressed in melanoma cell lines, and after PARVA is knocked down, cell invasion, migration, and colony formation ability were significantly decreased. This study advances our understanding of PANoptosis in melanoma, offering a comprehensive framework for targeted therapeutic interventions and personalized medicine strategies in combating this aggressive malignancy.",38189554,,10.1002/tox.24126,0
Spatially resolved gene regulatory networks in Asian rice (Oryza sativa cv. Nipponbare) leaves,"Transcriptome profiles in plants are heterogenous at every level of morphological organization. Even within organs, cells of the same type can have different patterns of gene expression depending on where they are positioned within tissues. This heterogeneity is associated with non-uniform distribution of biological processes within organs. The regulatory mechanisms that establish and sustain the spatial heterogeneity are unknown. Here, we identify regulatory modules that support functional specialization of different parts of Oryza sativa cv. Nipponbare leaves by leveraging transcriptome data, transcription factor binding motifs and global gene regulatory network prediction algorithms. We generated a global gene regulatory network in which we identified six regulatory modules that were active in different parts of the leaf. The regulatory modules were enriched for genes involved in spatially relevant biological processes, such as cell wall deposition, environmental sensing and photosynthesis. Strikingly, more than 86.9% of genes in the network were regulated by members of only five transcription factor families. We also generated targeted regulatory networks for the large MYB and bZIP/bHLH families to identify interactions that were masked in the global prediction. This analysis will provide a baseline for future single cell and array-based spatial transcriptome studies and for studying responses to environmental stress and demonstrates the extent to which seven coarse spatial transcriptome analysis can provide insight into the regulatory mechanisms supporting functional specialization within leaves.",37390084,,10.1111/tpj.16375,0
"Bulk and single-cell transcriptome profiling reveal necroptosis-based molecular classification, tumor microenvironment infiltration characterization, and prognosis prediction in colorectal cancer","Background:Necroptosis is a new form of programmed cell death that is associated with cancer initiation, progression, immunity, and chemoresistance. However, the roles of necroptosis-related genes (NRGs) in colorectal cancer (CRC) have not been explored comprehensively.Methods:In this study, we obtained NRGs and performed consensus molecular subtyping by ""ConsensusClusterPlus"" to determine necroptosis-related subtypes in CRC bulk transcriptomic data. The ssGSEA and CIBERSORT algorithms were used to evaluate the relative infiltration levels of different cell types in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Single-cell transcriptomic analysis was performed to confirm classification related to NRGs. NRG_score was developed to predict patients' survival outcomes with low-throughput validation in a patients' cohort from Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center.Results:We identified three distinct necroptosis-related classifications (NRCs) with discrepant clinical outcomes and biological functions. Characterization of TME revealed that there were two stable necroptosis-related phenotypes in CRC: a phenotype characterized by few TME cells infiltration but with EMT/TGF-pathways activation, and another phenotype recognized as immune-excluded. NRG_score for predicting survival outcomes was established and its predictive capability was verified. In addition, we found NRCs and NRG_score could be used for patient or drug selection when considering immunotherapy and chemotherapy.Conclusions:Based on comprehensive analysis, we revealed the potential roles of NRGs in the TME, and their correlations with clinicopathological parameters and patients' prognosis in CRC. These findings could enhance our understanding of the biological functions of necroptosis, which thus may aid in prognosis prediction, drug selection, and therapeutics development.",35590418,PMC9118791,10.1186/s12967-022-03431-6,6
A comprehensive transcriptome signature of murine hematopoietic stem cell aging,"We surveyed 16 published and unpublished data sets to determine whether a consistent pattern of transcriptional deregulation in aging murine hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) exists. Despite substantial heterogeneity between individual studies, we uncovered a core and robust HSC aging signature. We detected increased transcriptional activation in aged HSCs, further confirmed by chromatin accessibility analysis. Unexpectedly, using 2 independent computational approaches, we established that deregulated aging genes consist largely of membrane-associated transcripts, including many cell surface molecules previously not associated with HSC biology. We show that Selp (P-selectin), the most consistent deregulated gene, is not merely a marker for aged HSCs but is associated with HSC functional decline. Additionally, single-cell transcriptomics analysis revealed increased heterogeneity of the aged HSC pool. We identify the presence of transcriptionally ""young-like"" HSCs in aged bone marrow. We share our results as an online resource and demonstrate its utility by confirming that exposure to sympathomimetics or deletion of Dnmt3a/b molecularly resembles HSC rejuvenation or aging, respectively.",33876187,,10.1182/blood.2020009729,40
Gene selection for optimal prediction of cell position in tissues from single-cell transcriptomics data,"Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNAseq) technologies are rapidly evolving. Although very informative, in standard scRNAseq experiments, the spatial organization of the cells in the tissue of origin is lost. Conversely, spatial RNA-seq technologies designed to maintain cell localization have limited throughput and gene coverage. Mapping scRNAseq to genes with spatial information increases coverage while providing spatial location. However, methods to perform such mapping have not yet been benchmarked. To fill this gap, we organized the DREAM Single-Cell Transcriptomics challenge focused on the spatial reconstruction of cells from theDrosophilaembryo from scRNAseq data, leveraging as silver standard, genes with in situ hybridization data from the BerkeleyDrosophilaTranscription Network Project reference atlas. The 34 participating teams used diverse algorithms for gene selection and location prediction, while being able to correctly localize clusters of cells. Selection of predictor genes was essential for this task. Predictor genes showed a relatively high expression entropy, high spatial clustering and included prominent developmental genes such as gap and pair-rule genes and tissue markers. Application of the top 10 methods to a zebra fish embryo dataset yielded similar performance and statistical properties of the selected genes than in theDrosophiladata. This suggests that methods developed in this challenge are able to extract generalizable properties of genes that are useful to accurately reconstruct the spatial arrangement of cells in tissues.",32972997,PMC7536825,10.26508/lsa.202000867,6
Using transfer learning from prior reference knowledge to improve the clustering of single-cell RNA-Seq data,"In many research areas scientists are interested in clustering objects within small datasets while making use of prior knowledge from large reference datasets. We propose a method to apply the machine learning concept of transfer learning to unsupervised clustering problems and show its effectiveness in the field of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq). The goal of scRNA-Seq experiments is often the definition and cataloguing of cell types from the transcriptional output of individual cells. To improve the clustering of small disease- or tissue-specific datasets, for which the identification of rare cell types is often problematic, we propose a transfer learning method to utilize large and well-annotated reference datasets, such as those produced by the Human Cell Atlas. Our approach modifies the dataset of interest while incorporating key information from the larger reference dataset via Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF). The modified dataset is subsequently provided to a clustering algorithm. We empirically evaluate the benefits of our approach on simulated scRNA-Seq data as well as on publicly available datasets. Finally, we present results for the analysis of a recently published small dataset and find improved clustering when transferring knowledge from a large reference dataset. Implementations of the method are available at https://github.com/nicococo/scRNA.",31889137,PMC6937257,10.1038/s41598-019-56911-z,12
An eQTL Landscape of Kidney Tissue in Human Nephrotic Syndrome,"Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) studies illuminate the genetics of gene expression and, in disease research, can be particularly illuminating when using the tissues directly impacted by the condition. In nephrology, there is a paucity of eQTL studies of human kidney. Here, we used whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and microdissected glomerular (GLOM) and tubulointerstitial (TI) transcriptomes from 187 individuals with nephrotic syndrome (NS) to describe the eQTL landscape in these functionally distinct kidney structures. Using MatrixEQTL, we performed cis-eQTL analysis on GLOM (n = 136) and TI (n = 166). We used the Bayesian ""Deterministic Approximation of Posteriors"" (DAP) to fine-map these signals, eQTLBMA to discover GLOM- or TI-specific eQTLs, and single-cell RNA-seq data of control kidney tissue to identify the cell type specificity of significant eQTLs. We integrated eQTL data with an IgA Nephropathy (IgAN) GWAS to perform a transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS). We discovered 894 GLOM eQTLs and 1,767 TI eQTLs at FDR < 0.05. 14% and 19% of GLOM and TI eQTLs, respectively, had >1 independent signal associated with its expression. 12% and 26% of eQTLs were GLOM specific and TI specific, respectively. GLOM eQTLs were most significantly enriched in podocyte transcripts and TI eQTLs in proximal tubules. The IgAN TWAS identified significant GLOM and TI genes, primarily at the HLA region. In this study, we discovered GLOM and TI eQTLs, identified those that were tissue specific, deconvoluted them into cell-specific signals, and used them to characterize known GWAS alleles. These data are available for browsing and download via our eQTL browser, ""nephQTL.""",30057032,PMC6081280,10.1016/j.ajhg.2018.07.004,91
Single-cell transcriptomics of human islet ontogeny defines the molecular basis of β-cell dedifferentiation in T2D,"Objective:Dedifferentiation of pancreatic β-cells may reduce islet function in type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, the prevalence, plasticity and functional consequences of this cellular state remain unknown.Methods:We employed single-cell RNAseq to detail the maturation program of α- and β-cells during human ontogeny. We also compared islets from non-diabetic and T2D individuals.Results:Both α- and β-cells mature in part by repressing non-endocrine genes; however, α-cells retain hallmarks of an immature state, while β-cells attain a full β-cell specific gene expression program. In islets from T2D donors, both α- and β-cells have a less mature expression profile, de-repressing the juvenile genetic program and exocrine genes and increasing expression of exocytosis, inflammation and stress response signalling pathways. These changes are consistent with the increased proportion of β-cells displaying suboptimal function observed in T2D islets.Conclusions:These findings provide new insights into the molecular program underlying islet cell maturation during human ontogeny and the loss of transcriptomic maturity that occurs in islets of type 2 diabetics.",32739450,PMC7471622,10.1016/j.molmet.2020.101057,37
Cell type atlas and lineage tree of a whole complex animal by single-cell transcriptomics,"Flatworms of the speciesSchmidtea mediterraneaare immortal-adult animals contain a large pool of pluripotent stem cells that continuously differentiate into all adult cell types. Therefore, single-cell transcriptome profiling of adult animals should reveal mature and progenitor cells. By combining perturbation experiments, gene expression analysis, a computational method that predicts future cell states from transcriptional changes, and a lineage reconstruction method, we placed all major cell types onto a single lineage tree that connects all cells to a single stem cell compartment. We characterized gene expression changes during differentiation and discovered cell types important for regeneration. Our results demonstrate the importance of single-cell transcriptome analysis for mapping and reconstructing fundamental processes of developmental and regenerative biology at high resolution.",29674432,,10.1126/science.aaq1723,212
Single-cell RNA sequencing identifies diverse roles of epithelial cells in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a lethal interstitial lung disease characterized by airway remodeling, inflammation, alveolar destruction, and fibrosis. We utilized single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to identify epithelial cell types and associated biological processes involved in the pathogenesis of IPF. Transcriptomic analysis of normal human lung epithelial cells defined gene expression patterns associated with highly differentiated alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells, indicated by enrichment of RNAs critical for surfactant homeostasis. In contrast, scRNA-seq of IPF cells identified 3 distinct subsets of epithelial cell types with characteristics of conducting airway basal and goblet cells and an additional atypical transitional cell that contributes to pathological processes in IPF. Individual IPF cells frequently coexpressed alveolar type 1 (AT1), AT2, and conducting airway selective markers, demonstrating ""indeterminate"" states of differentiation not seen in normal lung development. Pathway analysis predicted aberrant activation of canonical signaling via TGF-β, HIPPO/YAP, P53, WNT, and AKT/PI3K. Immunofluorescence confocal microscopy identified the disruption of alveolar structure and loss of the normal proximal-peripheral differentiation of pulmonary epithelial cells. scRNA-seq analyses identified loss of normal epithelial cell identities and unique contributions of epithelial cells to the pathogenesis of IPF. The present study provides a rich data source to further explore lung health and disease.",27942595,PMC5135277,10.1172/jci.insight.90558,292
Transcriptomic and Proteomic Characterization of the Immune Response to Elective Spinal Reconstructive Surgery: Impact of Aging and Comparison with Traumatic Injury Response,"Background:Major surgery triggers trauma-like stress responses linked to age, surgery duration, and blood loss, resembling polytrauma. This similarity suggests elective surgery as a surrogate model for studying polytrauma immune responses. We investigated stress responses across age groups and compared them with those of polytrauma patients.Study design:Patients undergoing major spinal reconstruction surgery were divided into older (age >65 years, n = 5) and young (age 18 to 39 years, n = 6) groups. A comparison group consisted of matched trauma patients (n = 8). Blood samples were collected before, during, and after surgery. Bone marrow mononuclear cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells were analyzed using cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes sequencing or single-cell RNA sequencing. Plasma was subjected to dual-platform proteomic analysis (SomaLogic and O-link).Results:Response to polytrauma was highest within 4 hours. By comparison, the response to surgery was highest at 24 hours. Both insults triggered significant changes in cluster of differentiation 14 monocytes, with increased inflammation and lower major histocompatibility complex-class 2 expression. Older patient's cluster of differentiation 14 monocytes displayed higher inflammation and less major histocompatibility complex-class 2 suppression; a trend was also seen in bone marrow mononuclear cells. Although natural killer cells were markedly activated after polytrauma, they were suppressed after surgery, especially in older patients. In plasma, innate immunity proteins dominated at 24 hours, shifting to adaptive immunity proteins by 6 weeks with heightened inflammation in older patients. Senescence-associated secretory phenotype proteins were higher in older patients at baseline and further elevated during and after surgery.Conclusions:Although both major surgery and polytrauma initiate immune and stress responses, substantial differences exist in timing and cellular profiles, suggesting major elective surgery is not a suitable surrogate for the polytrauma response. Nonetheless, distinct responses in young vs older patients highlight the utility of elective spinal in studying patient-specific factors affecting outcomes after major elective surgery.",38095316,PMC11017837,10.1097/XCS.0000000000000922,0
Integrated analysis of single-cell RNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq unravels tumour heterogeneity plus M2-like tumour-associated macrophage infiltration and aggressiveness in TNBC,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is characterized by a more aggressive clinical course with extensive inter- and intra-tumour heterogeneity. Combination of single-cell and bulk tissue transcriptome profiling allows the characterization of tumour heterogeneity and identifies the association of the immune landscape with clinical outcomes. We identified inter- and intra-tumour heterogeneity at a single-cell resolution. Tumour cells shared a high correlation amongst stemness, angiogenesis, and EMT in TNBC. A subset of cells with concurrent high EMT, stemness and angiogenesis was identified at the single-cell level. Amongst tumour-infiltrating immune cells, M2-like tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs) made up the majority of macrophages and displayed immunosuppressive characteristics. CIBERSORT was applied to estimate the abundance of M2-like TAM in bulk tissue transcriptome file from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). M2-like TAMs were associated with unfavourable prognosis in TNBC patients. A TAM-related gene signature serves as a promising marker for predicting prognosis and response to immunotherapy. Two commonly used machine learning methods, random forest and SVM, were applied to find the genes that were mostly associated with M2-like TAM densities in the gene signature. A neural network-based deep learning framework based on the TAM-related gene signature exhibits high accuracy in predicting the immunotherapy response.",32681241,PMC10992761,10.1007/s00262-020-02669-7,60
Simultaneous multiplexed amplicon sequencing and transcriptome profiling in single cells,"We describe droplet-assisted RNA targeting by single-cell sequencing (DART-seq), a versatile technology that enables multiplexed amplicon sequencing and transcriptome profiling in single cells. We applied DART-seq to simultaneously characterize the non-A-tailed transcripts of a segmented dsRNA virus and the transcriptome of the infected cell. In addition, we used DART-seq to simultaneously determine the natively paired, variable region heavy and light chain amplicons and the transcriptome of B lymphocytes.",30559431,PMC6378878,10.1038/s41592-018-0259-9,37
Current approaches to fate mapping and lineage tracing using image data,"Visualizing, tracking and reconstructing cell lineages in developing embryos has been an ongoing effort for well over a century. Recent advances in light microscopy, labelling strategies and computational methods to analyse complex image datasets have enabled detailed investigations into the fates of cells. Combined with powerful new advances in genomics and single-cell transcriptomics, the field of developmental biology is able to describe the formation of the embryo like never before. In this Review, we discuss some of the different strategies and applications to lineage tracing in live-imaging data and outline software methodologies that can be applied to various cell-tracking challenges.",34498046,,10.1242/dev.198994,7
"Single Cell Explorer, collaboration-driven tools to leverage large-scale single cell RNA-seq data","Background:Single cell transcriptome sequencing has become an increasingly valuable technology for dissecting complex biology at a resolution impossible with bulk sequencing. However, the gap between the technical expertise required to effectively work with the resultant high dimensional data and the biological expertise required to interpret the results in their biological context remains incompletely addressed by the currently available tools.Results:Single Cell Explorer is a Python-based web server application we developed to enable computational and experimental scientists to iteratively and collaboratively annotate cell expression phenotypes within a user-friendly and visually appealing platform. These annotations can be modified and shared by multiple users to allow easy collaboration between computational scientists and experimental biologists. Data processing and analytic workflows can be integrated into the system using Jupyter notebooks. The application enables powerful yet accessible features such as the identification of differential gene expression patterns for user-defined cell populations and convenient annotation of cell types using marker genes or differential gene expression patterns. Users are able to produce plots without needing Python or R coding skills. As such, by making single cell RNA-seq data sharing and querying more user-friendly, the software promotes deeper understanding and innovation by research teams applying single cell transcriptomic approaches.Conclusions:Single cell explorer is a freely-available single cell transcriptomic analysis tool that enables computational and experimental biologists to collaboratively explore, annotate, and share results in a flexible software environment and a centralized database server that supports data portal functionality.",31455220,PMC6712711,10.1186/s12864-019-6053-y,12
Single-Cell Transcriptomic Analysis Reveals Myocardial Fibrosis Mechanism of Doxorubicin-Induced Cardiotoxicity,"Myocardial fibrosis is a pathological feature of doxorubicin-induced chronic cardiotoxicity that severely affects the prognosis of oncology patients. However, the specific cellular and molecular mediators driving doxorubicin-induced cardiac fibrosis, and the relative impact of different cell populations on cardiac fibrosis, remain unclear.This study aimed to explore the mechanism of doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity and myocardial fibrosis and to find potential therapeutic targets. Single-cell RNA sequencing was used to analyze the transcriptome of non-cardiomyocytes from normal and doxorubicin-induced chronic cardiotoxicity in mouse model heart tissue.We established a mouse model of doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity with a well-defined fibrotic phenotype. Analysis of single-cell sequencing results showed that fibroblasts were the major origin of extracellular matrix in doxorubicin-induced myocardial fibrosis. Further resolution of fibroblast subclusters showed that resting fibroblasts were converted to matrifibrocytes and then to myofibroblasts to participate in the myocardial remodeling process in response to doxorubicin treatment. Ctsb expression was significantly upregulated in fibroblasts after doxorubicin-induced.This study provides a comprehensive map of the non-cardiomyocyte landscape at high resolution, reveals multiple cell populations contributing to pathological remodeling of the cardiac extracellular matrix, and identifies major cellular sources of myofibroblasts and dynamic gene-expression changes in fibroblast activation. Finally, we used this strategy to detect potential therapeutic targets and identified Ctsb as a specific target for fibroblasts in doxorubicin-induced myocardial fibrosis.",38749755,,10.1536/ihj.23-302,0
Gene Expression Profiling of the Habenula in Rats Exposed to Chronic Restraint Stress,"Chronic stress contributes to the risk of developing depression; the habenula, a nucleus in epithalamus, is associated with many neuropsychiatric disorders. Using genome-wide gene expression analysis, we analyzed the transcriptome of the habenula in rats exposed to chronic restraint stress for 14 days. We identified 379 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that were affected by chronic stress. These genes were enriched in neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, the cAMP (cyclic adenosine monophosphate) signaling pathway, circadian entrainment, and synaptic signaling from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis and responded to corticosteroids, positive regulation of lipid transport, anterograde trans-synaptic signaling, and chemical synapse transmission from the Gene Ontology analysis. Based on protein-protein interaction network analysis of the DEGs, we identified neuroactive ligand-receptor interactions, circadian entrainment, and cholinergic synapse-related subclusters. Additionally, cell type and habenular regional expression of DEGs, evaluated using a recently published single-cell RNA sequencing study (GSE137478), strongly suggest that DEGs related to neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction and trans-synaptic signaling are highly enriched in medial habenular neurons. Taken together, our findings provide a valuable set of molecular targets that may play important roles in mediating the habenular response to stress and the onset of chronic stress-induced depressive behaviors.",35534192,PMC9095505,10.14348/molcells.2022.2257,2
Understanding human gut diseases at single-cell resolution,"Our understanding of gut functioning and pathophysiology has grown considerably in the past decades, and advancing technologies enable us to deepen this understanding. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has opened a new realm of cellular diversity and transcriptional variation in the human gut at a high, single-cell resolution. ScRNA-seq has pushed the science of the digestive system forward by characterizing the function of distinct cell types within complex intestinal cellular environments, by illuminating the heterogeneity within specific cell populations and by identifying novel cell types in the human gut that could contribute to a variety of intestinal diseases. In this review, we highlight recent discoveries made with scRNA-seq that significantly advance our understanding of the human gut both in health and across the spectrum of gut diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease, colorectal carcinoma and celiac disease.",32588873,PMC7530522,10.1093/hmg/ddaa130,10
Single-cell transcriptomics of 20 mouse organs creates a Tabula Muris,"Here we present a compendium of single-cell transcriptomic data from the model organism Mus musculus that comprises more than 100,000 cells from 20 organs and tissues. These data represent a new resource for cell biology, reveal gene expression in poorly characterized cell populations and enable the direct and controlled comparison of gene expression in cell types that are shared between tissues, such as T lymphocytes and endothelial cells from different anatomical locations. Two distinct technical approaches were used for most organs: one approach, microfluidic droplet-based 3'-end counting, enabled the survey of thousands of cells at relatively low coverage, whereas the other, full-length transcript analysis based on fluorescence-activated cell sorting, enabled the characterization of cell types with high sensitivity and coverage. The cumulative data provide the foundation for an atlas of transcriptomic cell biology.",30283141,PMC6642641,10.1038/s41586-018-0590-4,1028
A single-cell atlas depicting the cellular and molecular features in human anterior cruciate ligamental degeneration: A single cell combined spatial transcriptomics study,"Background:To systematically identify cell types in the human ligament, investigate how ligamental cell identities, functions, and interactions participated in the process of ligamental degeneration, and explore the changes of ligamental microenvironment homeostasis in the disease progression.Methods:Using single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial RNA sequencing of approximately 49,356 cells, we created a comprehensive cell atlas of healthy and degenerated human anterior cruciate ligaments. We explored the variations of the cell subtypes' spatial distributions and the different processes involved in the disease progression, linked them with the ligamental degeneration process using computational analysis, and verified findings with immunohistochemical and immunofluorescent staining.Results:We identified new fibroblast subgroups that contributed to the disease, mapped out their spatial distribution in the tissue and revealed two dynamic trajectories in the process of the degenerative process. We compared the cellular interactions between different tissue states and identified important signaling pathways that may contribute to the disease.Conclusions:This cell atlas provides the molecular foundation for investigating how ligamental cell identities, biochemical functions, and interactions contributed to the ligamental degeneration process. The discoveries revealed the pathogenesis of ligamental degeneration at the single-cell and spatial level, which is characterized by extracellular matrix remodeling. Our results provide new insights into the control of ligamental degeneration and potential clues to developing novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.Funding:This study was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (81972123, 82172508, 82372490) and 1.3.5 Project for Disciplines of Excellence of West China Hospital Sichuan University (ZYJC21030, ZY2017301).",37970848,PMC10688969,10.7554/eLife.85700,0
"A developmental coordinate of pluripotency among mice, monkeys and humans","The epiblast (EPI) is the origin of all somatic and germ cells in mammals, and of pluripotent stem cells in vitro. To explore the ontogeny of human and primate pluripotency, here we perform comprehensive single-cell RNA sequencing for pre- and post-implantation EPI development in cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis). We show that after specification in the blastocysts, EPI from cynomolgus monkeys (cyEPI) undergoes major transcriptome changes on implantation. Thereafter, while generating gastrulating cells, cyEPI stably maintains its transcriptome over a week, retains a unique set of pluripotency genes and acquires properties for 'neuron differentiation'. Human and monkey pluripotent stem cells show the highest similarity to post-implantation late cyEPI, which, despite co-existing with gastrulating cells, bears characteristics of pre-gastrulating mouse EPI and epiblast-like cells in vitro. These findings not only reveal the divergence and coherence of EPI development, but also identify a developmental coordinate of the spectrum of pluripotency among key species, providing a basis for better regulation of human pluripotency in vitro.",27556940,,10.1038/nature19096,214
Single-cell RNA-seq identifies unique transcriptional landscapes of human nucleus pulposus and annulus fibrosus cells,"Intervertebral disc (IVD) disease (IDD) is a complex, multifactorial disease. While various aspects of IDD progression have been reported, the underlying molecular pathways and transcriptional networks that govern the maintenance of healthy nucleus pulposus (NP) and annulus fibrosus (AF) have not been fully elucidated. We defined the transcriptome map of healthy human IVD by performing single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) in primary AF and NP cells isolated from non-degenerated lumbar disc. Our systematic and comprehensive analyses revealed distinct genetic architecture of human NP and AF compartments and identified 2,196 differentially expressed genes. Gene enrichment analysis showed that SFRP1, BIRC5, CYTL1, ESM1 and CCNB2 genes were highly expressed in the AF cells; whereas, COL2A1, DSC3, COL9A3, COL11A1, and ANGPTL7 were mostly expressed in the NP cells. Further, functional annotation clustering analysis revealed the enrichment of receptor signaling pathways genes in AF cells, while NP cells showed high expression of genes related to the protein synthesis machinery. Subsequent interaction network analysis revealed a structured network of extracellular matrix genes in NP compartments. Our regulatory network analysis identified FOXM1 and KDM4E as signature transcription factor of AF and NP respectively, which might be involved in the regulation of core genes of AF and NP transcriptome.",32943704,PMC7499307,10.1038/s41598-020-72261-7,32
ClusterMap for multi-scale clustering analysis of spatial gene expression,"Quantifying RNAs in their spatial context is crucial to understanding gene expression and regulation in complex tissues. In situ transcriptomic methods generate spatially resolved RNA profiles in intact tissues. However, there is a lack of a unified computational framework for integrative analysis of in situ transcriptomic data. Here, we introduce an unsupervised and annotation-free framework, termed ClusterMap, which incorporates the physical location and gene identity of RNAs, formulates the task as a point pattern analysis problem, and identifies biologically meaningful structures by density peak clustering (DPC). Specifically, ClusterMap precisely clusters RNAs into subcellular structures, cell bodies, and tissue regions in both two- and three-dimensional space, and performs consistently on diverse tissue types, including mouse brain, placenta, gut, and human cardiac organoids. We demonstrate ClusterMap to be broadly applicable to various in situ transcriptomic measurements to uncover gene expression patterns, cell niche, and tissue organization principles from images with high-dimensional transcriptomic profiles.",34625546,PMC8501103,10.1038/s41467-021-26044-x,28
Single-cell gene expression analysis reveals regulators of distinct cell subpopulations among developing human neurons,"The stochastic dynamics and regulatory mechanisms that govern differentiation of individual human neural precursor cells (NPC) into mature neurons are currently not fully understood. Here, we used single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) of developing neurons to dissect/identify NPC subtypes and critical developmental stages of alternative lineage specifications. This study comprises an unsupervised, high-resolution strategy for identifying cell developmental bifurcations, tracking the stochastic transcript kinetics of the subpopulations, elucidating regulatory networks, and finding key regulators. Our data revealed the bifurcation and developmental tracks of the two NPC subpopulations, and we captured an early (24 h) transition phase that leads to alternative neuronal specifications. The consequent up-regulation and down-regulation of stage- and subpopulation-specific gene groups during the course of maturation revealed biological insights with regard to key regulatory transcription factors and lincRNAs that control cellular programs in the identified neuronal subpopulations.",29030469,PMC5668937,10.1101/gr.223313.117,22
Spatiotemporal single-cell RNA sequencing of developing chicken hearts identifies interplay between cellular differentiation and morphogenesis,"Single-cell RNA sequencing is a powerful tool to study developmental biology but does not preserve spatial information about tissue morphology and cellular interactions. Here, we combine single-cell and spatial transcriptomics with algorithms for data integration to study the development of the chicken heart from the early to late four-chambered heart stage. We create a census of the diverse cellular lineages in developing hearts, their spatial organization, and their interactions during development. Spatial mapping of differentiation transitions in cardiac lineages defines transcriptional differences between epithelial and mesenchymal cells within the epicardial lineage. Using spatially resolved expression analysis, we identify anatomically restricted expression programs, including expression of genes implicated in congenital heart disease. Last, we discover a persistent enrichment of the small, secreted peptide, thymosin beta-4, throughout coronary vascular development. Overall, our study identifies an intricate interplay between cellular differentiation and morphogenesis.",33741943,PMC7979764,10.1038/s41467-021-21892-z,72
Integrative genomic and transcriptomic analysis reveals genetic alterations associated with the early progression of follicular lymphoma,"Follicular lymphoma (FL), the most common indolent lymphoma, is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disease. However, the prognostic value of driver gene mutations and copy number alterations has not been systematically assessed. Here, we analysed the clinical-biological features of 415 FL patients to identify variables associated with disease progression within 24 months of first-line therapy (POD24). Patients with B symptoms, elevated lactate dehydrogenase and β2-microglobulin levels, unfavourable baseline haemoglobin levels, advanced stage, and high-risk FL International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) scores had an increased risk of POD24, with FLIPI being the most important factor in logistic regression. HIST1H1D, identified as a driver mutation, was correlated with POD24. Gains of 6p22.2 (HIST1H1D) and 18q21.33 (BCL2) and loss of 1p36.13 (NBPF1) predicted POD24 independent of FLIPI. Gene expression profiling of FL samples showed that the POD24 cohort was significantly enriched in the inflammatory response (mediated by interferon and tumour necrosis factor), cell cycle regulation (transcription, replication and proliferation) sets and PI3K-AKT-mTOR signalling. This result was further validated with transcriptome-wide information provided by RNA-seq at single-cell resolution. Our study, performed on a large cohort of FL patients, highlights the importance of distinctive genetic alterations and gene expression relevant to disease diagnosis and early progression.",37455019,,10.1111/bjh.18974,2
The Stress-Like Cancer Cell State Is a Consistent Component of Tumorigenesis,"Transcriptional profiling of tumors has revealed a stress-like state among the cancer cells with the concerted expression of genes such as fos, jun, and heat-shock proteins, though this has been controversial given possible dissociation-effects associated with single-cell RNA sequencing. Here, we validate the existence of this state using a combination of zebrafish melanoma modeling, spatial transcriptomics, and human samples. We found that the stress-like subpopulation of cancer cells is present from the early stages of tumorigenesis. Comparing with previously reported single-cell RNA sequencing datasets from diverse cancer types, including triple-negative breast cancer, oligodendroglioma, and pancreatic adenocarcinoma, indicated the conservation of this state during tumorigenesis. We also provide evidence that this state has higher tumor-seeding capabilities and that its induction leads to increased growth under both MEK and BRAF inhibitors. Collectively, our study supports the stress-like cells as a cancer cell state expressing a coherent set of genes and exhibiting drug-resistance properties.",32910905,PMC8027961,10.1016/j.cels.2020.08.018,36
Combined protein and transcript single-cell RNA sequencing in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells,"Background:Cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are frequently collected and provide disease- and treatment-relevant data in clinical studies. Here, we developed combined protein (40 antibodies) and transcript single-cell (sc)RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) in PBMCs.Results:Among 31 participants in the Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS), we sequenced 41,611 cells. Using Boolean gating followed by Seurat UMAPs (tool for visualizing high-dimensional data) and Louvain clustering, we identified 50 subsets among CD4+ T, CD8+ T, B, NK cells, and monocytes. This resolution was superior to flow cytometry, mass cytometry, or scRNA-seq without antibodies. Combined protein and transcript scRNA-seq allowed for the assessment of disease-related changes in transcriptomes and cell type proportions. As a proof-of-concept, we showed such differences between healthy and matched individuals living with HIV with and without cardiovascular disease.Conclusions:In conclusion, combined protein and transcript scRNA sequencing is a suitable and powerful method for clinical investigations using PBMCs.",36045343,PMC9434837,10.1186/s12915-022-01382-4,11
Investigating Cell Fate Decisions with ICGS Analysis of Single Cells,"Advances in single-cell transcriptome profiling have contributed to new insights into the cellular states and underlying regulatory networks that govern lineage commitment. Such cell states include multipotent progenitors that can manifest as mixed-lineage patterns of gene expression at a single-cell level. Multipotent and other self-renewing progenitors are often difficult to isolate and characterized by subtle transcriptional differences that are challenging to define. This chapter examines the application of newly developed analytical tools to define heterogeneity in diverse stem cell and multipotent progenitor populations from single-cell RNA-Seq data. In addition to the methodology and output of these approaches, we explore their application to diverse single-cell technologies (e.g., Fluidigm, Drop-Seq, 10× Genomics Chromium) and their usability by computational and non-computational biologists. We focus specifically on the use of one tool, called Iterative Clustering and Guide-gene Selection (ICGS), which has been shown to uncover novel committed, transitional, and metastable progenitor cell states. As a component of the AltAnalyze toolkit, ICGS provides advanced methods to evaluate cellular heterogeneity in combination with regulatory prediction, pathway, and alternative splicing analyses. We walk through the individual steps required to perform these analyses in hematopoietic and embryonic kidney progenitor datasets in both graphical user and command-line interfaces. By the end of this chapter, users should be able to analyze their own single-cell RNA-Seq data and obtain deeper insights into the regulatory biology of the discovered cell states.",31062314,,10.1007/978-1-4939-9224-9_12,2
Dissecting stem cell differentiation using single cell expression profiling,"Many assumptions about the way cells behave are based on analyses of populations. However, it is now widely recognized that even apparently pure populations can display a remarkable level of heterogeneity. This is particularly true in stem cell biology where it hinders our understanding of normal development and the development of strategies for regenerative medicine. Over the past decade technologies facilitating gene expression analysis at the single cell level have become widespread, providing access to rare cell populations and insights into population structure and function. Here we review the contributions of single cell biology to understanding stem cell differentiation so far, both as a new methodology for defining cell types and a tool for understanding the complexities of cellular decision-making.",27665068,,10.1016/j.ceb.2016.08.005,8
Coronary blood vessels from distinct origins converge to equivalent states during mouse and human development,"Most cell fate trajectories during development follow a diverging, tree-like branching pattern, but the opposite can occur when distinct progenitors contribute to the same cell type. During this convergent differentiation, it is unknown if cells 'remember' their origins transcriptionally or whether this influences cell behavior. Most coronary blood vessels of the heart develop from two different progenitor sources-the endocardium (Endo) and sinus venosus (SV)-but whether transcriptional or functional differences related to origin are retained is unknown. We addressed this by combining lineage tracing with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) in embryonic and adult mouse hearts. Shortly after coronary development begins, capillary endothelial cells (ECs) transcriptionally segregated into two states that retained progenitor-specific gene expression. Later in development, when the coronary vasculature is well established but still remodeling, capillary ECs again segregated into two populations, but transcriptional differences were primarily related to tissue localization rather than lineage. Specifically, ECs in the heart septum expressed genes indicative of increased local hypoxia and decreased blood flow. Adult capillary ECs were more homogeneous with respect to both lineage and location. In agreement, SV- and Endo-derived ECs in adult hearts displayed similar responses to injury. Finally, scRNAseq of developing human coronary vessels indicated that the human heart followed similar principles. Thus, over the course of development, transcriptional heterogeneity in coronary ECs is first influenced by lineage, then by location, until heterogeneity declines in the homeostatic adult heart. These results highlight the plasticity of ECs during development, and the validity of the mouse as a model for human coronary development.",34910626,PMC8673841,10.7554/eLife.70246,11
Single-cell transcriptomics to explore the immune system in health and disease,"The immune system varies in cell types, states, and locations. The complex networks, interactions, and responses of immune cells produce diverse cellular ecosystems composed of multiple cell types, accompanied by genetic diversity in antigen receptors. Within this ecosystem, innate and adaptive immune cells maintain and protect tissue function, integrity, and homeostasis upon changes in functional demands and diverse insults. Characterizing this inherent complexity requires studies at single-cell resolution. Recent advances such as massively parallel single-cell RNA sequencing and sophisticated computational methods are catalyzing a revolution in our understanding of immunology. Here we provide an overview of the state of single-cell genomics methods and an outlook on the use of single-cell techniques to decipher the adaptive and innate components of immunity.",28983043,PMC5654495,10.1126/science.aan6828,239
Spatial transcriptomic and single-nucleus analysis reveals heterogeneity in a gigantic single-celled syncytium,"In multicellular organisms, the specification, coordination, and compartmentalization of cell types enable the formation of complex body plans. However, some eukaryotic protists such as slime molds generate diverse and complex structures while remaining in a multinucleate syncytial state. It is unknown if different regions of these giant syncytial cells have distinct transcriptional responses to environmental encounters and if nuclei within the cell diversify into heterogeneous states. Here, we performed spatial transcriptome analysis of the slime moldPhysarum polycephalumin the plasmodium state under different environmental conditions and used single-nucleus RNA-sequencing to dissect gene expression heterogeneity among nuclei. Our data identifies transcriptome regionality in the organism that associates with proliferation, syncytial substructures, and localized environmental conditions. Further, we find that nuclei are heterogenous in their transcriptional profile and may process local signals within the plasmodium to coordinate cell growth, metabolism, and reproduction. To understand how nuclei variation within the syncytium compares to heterogeneity in single-nucleus cells, we analyzed states in singlePhysarumamoebal cells. We observed amoebal cell states at different stages of mitosis and meiosis, and identified cytokinetic features that are specific to nuclei divisions within the syncytium. Notably, we do not find evidence for predefined transcriptomic states in the amoebae that are observed in the syncytium. Our data shows that a single-celled slime mold can control its gene expression in a region-specific manner while lacking cellular compartmentalization and suggests that nuclei are mobile processors facilitating local specialized functions. More broadly, slime molds offer the extraordinary opportunity to explore how organisms can evolve regulatory mechanisms to divide labor, specialize, balance competition with cooperation, and perform other foundational principles that govern the logic of life.",35195068,PMC8865844,10.7554/eLife.69745,3
Multiregional transcriptomics identifies congruent consensus subtypes with prognostic value beyond tumor heterogeneity of colorectal cancer,"Intra-tumor heterogeneity compromises the clinical value of transcriptomic classifications of colorectal cancer. We investigated the prognostic effect of transcriptomic heterogeneity and the potential for classifications less vulnerable to heterogeneity in a single-hospital series of 1093 tumor samples from 692 patients, including multiregional samples from 98 primary tumors and 35 primary-metastasis sets. We show that intra-tumor heterogeneity of the consensus molecular subtypes (CMS) is frequent and has poor-prognostic associations independently of tumor microenvironment markers. Multiregional transcriptomics uncover cancer cell-intrinsic and low-heterogeneity signals that recapitulate the intrinsic CMSs proposed by single-cell sequencing. Further subclassification identifies congruent CMSs that explain a larger proportion of variation in patient survival than intra-tumor heterogeneity. Plasticity is indicated by discordant intrinsic phenotypes of matched primary and metastatic tumors. We conclude that multiregional sampling reconciles the prognostic power of tumor classifications from single-cell and bulk transcriptomics in the context of intra-tumor heterogeneity, and phenotypic plasticity challenges the reconciliation of primary and metastatic subtypes.",38773143,PMC11109119,10.1038/s41467-024-48706-2,0
A Single-Cell Transcriptomics CRISPR-Activation Screen Identifies Epigenetic Regulators of the Zygotic Genome Activation Program,"Zygotic genome activation (ZGA) is an essential transcriptional event in embryonic development that coincides with extensive epigenetic reprogramming. Complex manipulation techniques and maternal stores of proteins preclude large-scale functional screens for ZGA regulators within early embryos. Here, we combined pooled CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) with single-cell transcriptomics to identify regulators of ZGA-like transcription in mouse embryonic stem cells, which serve as a tractable, in vitro proxy of early mouse embryos. Using multi-omics factor analysis (MOFA+) applied to ∼200,000 single-cell transcriptomes comprising 230 CRISPRa perturbations, we characterized molecular signatures of ZGA and uncovered 24 factors that promote a ZGA-like response. Follow-up assays validated top screen hits, including the DNA-binding protein Dppa2, the chromatin remodeler Smarca5, and the transcription factor Patz1, and functional experiments revealed that Smarca5's regulation of ZGA-like transcription is dependent on Dppa2. Together, our single-cell transcriptomic profiling of CRISPRa-perturbed cells provides both system-level and molecular insights into the mechanisms that orchestrate ZGA.",32634384,PMC7383230,10.1016/j.cels.2020.06.004,37
Joint dimension reduction and clustering analysis of single-cell RNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics data,"Dimension reduction and (spatial) clustering is usually performed sequentially; however, the low-dimensional embeddings estimated in the dimension-reduction step may not be relevant to the class labels inferred in the clustering step. We therefore developed a computation method, Dimension-Reduction Spatial-Clustering (DR-SC), that can simultaneously perform dimension reduction and (spatial) clustering within a unified framework. Joint analysis by DR-SC produces accurate (spatial) clustering results and ensures the effective extraction of biologically informative low-dimensional features. DR-SC is applicable to spatial clustering in spatial transcriptomics that characterizes the spatial organization of the tissue by segregating it into multiple tissue structures. Here, DR-SC relies on a latent hidden Markov random field model to encourage the spatial smoothness of the detected spatial cluster boundaries. Underlying DR-SC is an efficient expectation-maximization algorithm based on an iterative conditional mode. As such, DR-SC is scalable to large sample sizes and can optimize the spatial smoothness parameter in a data-driven manner. With comprehensive simulations and real data applications, we show that DR-SC outperforms existing clustering and spatial clustering methods: it extracts more biologically relevant features than conventional dimension reduction methods, improves clustering performance, and offers improved trajectory inference and visualization for downstream trajectory inference analyses.",35349708,PMC9262606,10.1093/nar/gkac219,16
Single-cell transcriptomics defines keratinocyte differentiation in avian scutate scales,"The growth of skin appendages, such as hair, feathers and scales, depends on terminal differentiation of epidermal keratinocytes. Here, we investigated keratinocyte differentiation in avian scutate scales. Cells were isolated from the skin on the legs of 1-day old chicks and subjected to single-cell transcriptomics. We identified two distinct populations of differentiated keratinocytes. The first population was characterized by mRNAs encoding cysteine-rich keratins and corneous beta-proteins (CBPs), also known as beta-keratins, of the scale type, indicating that these cells form hard scales. The second population of differentiated keratinocytes contained mRNAs encoding cysteine-poor keratins and keratinocyte-type CBPs, suggesting that these cells form the soft interscale epidermis. We raised an antibody against keratin 9-like cysteine-rich 2 (KRT9LC2), which is encoded by an mRNA enriched in the first keratinocyte population. Immunostaining confirmed expression of KRT9LC2 in the suprabasal epidermal layers of scutate scales but not in interscale epidermis. Keratinocyte differentiation in chicken leg skin resembled that in human skin with regard to the transcriptional upregulation of epidermal differentiation complex genes and genes involved in lipid metabolism and transport. In conclusion, this study defines gene expression programs that build scutate scales and interscale epidermis of birds and reveals evolutionarily conserved keratinocyte differentiation genes.",34997067,PMC8742010,10.1038/s41598-021-04082-1,5
SAME-clustering: Single-cell Aggregated Clustering via Mixture Model Ensemble,"Clustering is an essential step in the analysis of single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data to shed light on tissue complexity including the number of cell types and transcriptomic signatures of each cell type. Due to its importance, novel methods have been developed recently for this purpose. However, different approaches generate varying estimates regarding the number of clusters and the single-cell level cluster assignments. This type of unsupervised clustering is challenging and it is often times hard to gauge which method to use because none of the existing methods outperform others across all scenarios. We present SAME-clustering, a mixture model-based approach that takes clustering solutions from multiple methods and selects a maximally diverse subset to produce an improved ensemble solution. We tested SAME-clustering across 15 scRNA-seq datasets generated by different platforms, with number of clusters varying from 3 to 15, and number of single cells from 49 to 32 695. Results show that our SAME-clustering ensemble method yields enhanced clustering, in terms of both cluster assignments and number of clusters. The mixture model ensemble clustering is not limited to clustering scRNA-seq data and may be useful to a wide range of clustering applications.",31777938,PMC6943136,10.1093/nar/gkz959,34
Decoding the biology and clinical implication of neutrophils in intracranial aneurysm,"Objective:Abundant neutrophils have been identified in both ruptured and unruptured intracranial aneurysm (IA) domes, with their function and clinical implication being poorly characterized.Materials and methods:We employed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) datasets of both human and murine model, and external bulk mRNA sequencing datasets to thoroughly explore the features and functional heterogeneous of neutrophils infiltrating the IA dome.Results:We found that both unruptured and ruptured IA dome contain a substantial population of neutrophils, characterized by FCGR3B, G0S2, CSF3R, and CXCR2. These cells exhibited heterogeneity in terms of function and differentiation. Despite similar transcriptional activation, neutrophils in IA dome expressed a repertoire of gene programs that mimicked transcriptomic alterations observed from bone marrow to peripheral blood, showing self-similarity. In addition, the recruitment of neutrophils in unruptured IA was primarily mediated by monocytes/macrophages, and once ruptured, both neutrophils, and a specific subset of inflammatory smooth muscle cells (SMCs) were involved in the process. The receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC) analysis indicated that distinct neutrophil subclusters were associated with IA formation and rupture, respectively. By reviewing current studies, we found that neutrophils play a detrimental role to IA wall integrity through secreting specific ligands, ferroptosis driven by ALOX5AP and PTGS2, and the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) mediated by PADI4.Interpretation:This study delineated the biology and potential clinical implications of neutrophils in IA dome and provided a reliable basis for future researches.",38317016,PMC11021671,10.1002/acn3.52014,0
Spatiotemporal transcriptomic atlas of mouse organogenesis using DNA nanoball-patterned arrays,"Spatially resolved transcriptomic technologies are promising tools to study complex biological processes such as mammalian embryogenesis. However, the imbalance between resolution, gene capture, and field of view of current methodologies precludes their systematic application to analyze relatively large and three-dimensional mid- and late-gestation embryos. Here, we combined DNA nanoball (DNB)-patterned arrays and in situ RNA capture to create spatial enhanced resolution omics-sequencing (Stereo-seq). We applied Stereo-seq to generate the mouse organogenesis spatiotemporal transcriptomic atlas (MOSTA), which maps with single-cell resolution and high sensitivity the kinetics and directionality of transcriptional variation during mouse organogenesis. We used this information to gain insight into the molecular basis of spatial cell heterogeneity and cell fate specification in developing tissues such as the dorsal midbrain. Our panoramic atlas will facilitate in-depth investigation of longstanding questions concerning normal and abnormal mammalian development.",35512705,,10.1016/j.cell.2022.04.003,277
Spatially informed cell-type deconvolution for spatial transcriptomics,"Many spatially resolved transcriptomic technologies do not have single-cell resolution but measure the average gene expression for each spot from a mixture of cells of potentially heterogeneous cell types. Here, we introduce a deconvolution method, conditional autoregressive-based deconvolution (CARD), that combines cell-type-specific expression information from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) with correlation in cell-type composition across tissue locations. Modeling spatial correlation allows us to borrow the cell-type composition information across locations, improving accuracy of deconvolution even with a mismatched scRNA-seq reference. CARD can also impute cell-type compositions and gene expression levels at unmeasured tissue locations to enable the construction of a refined spatial tissue map with a resolution arbitrarily higher than that measured in the original study and can perform deconvolution without an scRNA-seq reference. Applications to four datasets, including a pancreatic cancer dataset, identified multiple cell types and molecular markers with distinct spatial localization that define the progression, heterogeneity and compartmentalization of pancreatic cancer.",35501392,PMC9464662,10.1038/s41587-022-01273-7,84
Single-cell transcriptomic atlas of the human endometrium during the menstrual cycle,"In a human menstrual cycle the endometrium undergoes remodeling, shedding and regeneration, all of which are driven by substantial gene expression changes in the underlying cellular hierarchy. Despite its importance in human fertility and regenerative biology, our understanding of this unique type of tissue homeostasis remains rudimentary. We characterized the transcriptomic transformation of human endometrium at single-cell resolution across the menstrual cycle, resolving cellular heterogeneity in multiple dimensions. We profiled the behavior of seven endometrial cell types, including a previously uncharacterized ciliated cell type, during four major phases of endometrial transformation, and found characteristic signatures for each cell type and phase. We discovered that the human window of implantation opens with an abrupt and discontinuous transcriptomic activation in the epithelia, accompanied with a widespread decidualization feature in the stromal fibroblasts. Our study provides a high-resolution molecular and cellular characterization of human endometrial transformation across the menstrual cycle, providing insights into this essential physiological process.",32929266,,10.1038/s41591-020-1040-z,168
Simultaneous epitope and transcriptome measurement in single cells,"High-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing has transformed our understanding of complex cell populations, but it does not provide phenotypic information such as cell-surface protein levels. Here, we describe cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing (CITE-seq), a method in which oligonucleotide-labeled antibodies are used to integrate cellular protein and transcriptome measurements into an efficient, single-cell readout. CITE-seq is compatible with existing single-cell sequencing approaches and scales readily with throughput increases.",28759029,PMC5669064,10.1038/nmeth.4380,1214
Single-cell transcriptomic and spatial landscapes of the developing human pancreas,"Current differentiation protocols have not been successful in reproducibly generating fully functional human beta cells in vitro, partly due to incomplete understanding of human pancreas development. Here, we present detailed transcriptomic analysis of the various cell types of the developing human pancreas, including their spatial gene patterns. We integrated single-cell RNA sequencing with spatial transcriptomics at multiple developmental time points and revealed distinct temporal-spatial gene cascades. Cell trajectory inference identified endocrine progenitor populations and branch-specific genes as the progenitors differentiate toward alpha or beta cells. Spatial differentiation trajectories indicated that Schwann cells are spatially co-located with endocrine progenitors, and cell-cell connectivity analysis predicted that they may interact via L1CAM-EPHB2 signaling. Our integrated approach enabled us to identify heterogeneity and multiple lineage dynamics within the mesenchyme, showing that it contributed to the exocrine acinar cell state. Finally, we have generated an interactive web resource for investigating human pancreas development for the research community.",36513063,,10.1016/j.cmet.2022.11.009,7
Single-cell transcriptome analysis reveals cell lineage specification in temporal-spatial patterns in human cortical development,"Neurogenesis processes differ in different areas of the cortex in many species, including humans. Here, we performed single-cell transcriptome profiling of the four cortical lobes and pons during human embryonic and fetal development. We identified distinct subtypes of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and their molecular signatures, including a group of previously unidentified transient NPCs. We specified the neurogenesis path and molecular regulations of the human deep-layer, upper-layer, and mature neurons. Neurons showed clear spatial and temporal distinctions, while glial cells of different origins showed development patterns similar to those of mice, and we captured the developmental trajectory of oligodendrocyte lineage cells until the human mid-fetal stage. Additionally, we verified region-specific characteristics of neurons in the cortex, including their distinct electrophysiological features. With systematic single-cell analysis, we decoded human neuronal development in temporal and spatial dimensions from GW7 to GW28, offering deeper insights into the molecular regulations underlying human neurogenesis and cortical development.",32923614,PMC7450478,10.1126/sciadv.aaz2978,48
Temporal modelling using single-cell transcriptomics,"Methods for profiling genes at the single-cell level have revolutionized our ability to study several biological processes and systems including development, differentiation, response programmes and disease progression. In many of these studies, cells are profiled over time in order to infer dynamic changes in cell states and types, sets of expressed genes, active pathways and key regulators. However, time-series single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) also raises several new analysis and modelling issues. These issues range from determining when and how deep to profile cells, linking cells within and between time points, learning continuous trajectories, and integrating bulk and single-cell data for reconstructing models of dynamic networks. In this Review, we discuss several approaches for the analysis and modelling of time-series scRNA-seq, highlighting their steps, key assumptions, and the types of data and biological questions they are most appropriate for.",35102309,PMC10354343,10.1038/s41576-021-00444-7,38
"Embryo-scale, single-cell spatial transcriptomics","Spatial patterns of gene expression manifest at scales ranging from local (e.g., cell-cell interactions) to global (e.g., body axis patterning). However, current spatial transcriptomics methods either average local contexts or are restricted to limited fields of view. Here, we introduce sci-Space, which retains single-cell resolution while resolving spatial heterogeneity at larger scales. Applying sci-Space to developing mouse embryos, we captured approximate spatial coordinates and whole transcriptomes of about 120,000 nuclei. We identify thousands of genes exhibiting anatomically patterned expression, leverage spatial information to annotate cellular subtypes, show that cell types vary substantially in their extent of spatial patterning, and reveal correlations between pseudotime and the migratory patterns of differentiating neurons. Looking forward, we anticipate that sci-Space will facilitate the construction of spatially resolved single-cell atlases of mammalian development.",34210887,PMC9118175,10.1126/science.abb9536,94
Single Cell RNA Sequencing in Atherosclerosis Research,"Technological advances in characterizing molecular heterogeneity at the single cell level have ushered in a deeper understanding of the biological diversity of cells present in tissues including atherosclerotic plaques. New subsets of cells have been discovered among cell types previously considered homogenous. The commercial availability of systems to obtain transcriptomes and matching surface phenotypes from thousands of single cells is rapidly changing our understanding of cell types and lineage identity. Emerging methods to infer cellular functions are beginning to shed new light on the interplay of components involved in multifaceted disease responses, like atherosclerosis. Here, we provide a technical guide for design, implementation, assembly, and interpretations of current single cell transcriptomics approaches from the perspective of employing these tools for advancing cardiovascular disease research.",32324494,PMC7185048,10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.119.315940,57
Integrated pseudotime analysis of human pre-implantation embryo single-cell transcriptomes reveals the dynamics of lineage specification,"Understanding lineage specification during human pre-implantation development is a gateway to improving assisted reproductive technologies and stem cell research. Here we employ pseudotime analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data to reconstruct early mouse and human embryo development. Using time-lapse imaging of annotated embryos, we provide an integrated, ordered, and continuous analysis of transcriptomics changes throughout human development. We reveal that human trophectoderm/inner cell mass transcriptomes diverge at the transition from the B2 to the B3 blastocyst stage, just before blastocyst expansion. We explore the dynamics of the fate markers IFI16 and GATA4 and show that they gradually become mutually exclusive upon establishment of epiblast and primitive endoderm fates, respectively. We also provide evidence that NR2F2 marks trophectoderm maturation, initiating from the polar side, and subsequently spreads to all cells after implantation. Our study pinpoints the precise timing of lineage specification events in the human embryo and identifies transcriptomics hallmarks and cell fate markers.",34004179,,10.1016/j.stem.2021.04.027,56
A single-cell transcriptome atlas for zebrafish development,"The ability to define cell types and how they change during organogenesis is central to our understanding of animal development and human disease. Despite the crucial nature of this knowledge, we have yet to fully characterize all distinct cell types and the gene expression differences that generate cell types during development. To address this knowledge gap, we produced an atlas using single-cell RNA-sequencing methods to investigate gene expression from the pharyngula to early larval stages in developing zebrafish. Our single-cell transcriptome atlas encompasses transcriptional profiles from 44,102 ​cells across four days of development using duplicate experiments that confirmed high reproducibility. We annotated 220 identified clusters and highlighted several strategies for interrogating changes in gene expression associated with the development of zebrafish embryos at single-cell resolution. Furthermore, we highlight the power of this analysis to assign new cell-type or developmental stage-specific expression information to many genes, including those that are currently known only by sequence and/or that lack expression information altogether. The resulting atlas is a resource for biologists to generate hypotheses for functional analysis, which we hope integrates with existing efforts to define the diversity of cell-types during zebrafish organogenesis, and to examine the transcriptional profiles that produce each cell type over developmental time.",31782996,PMC7080588,10.1016/j.ydbio.2019.11.008,107
A Single-Cell Transcriptomic Map of the Human and Mouse Pancreas Reveals Inter- and Intra-cell Population Structure,"Although the function of the mammalian pancreas hinges on complex interactions of distinct cell types, gene expression profiles have primarily been described with bulk mixtures. Here we implemented a droplet-based, single-cell RNA-seq method to determine the transcriptomes of over 12,000 individual pancreatic cells from four human donors and two mouse strains. Cells could be divided into 15 clusters that matched previously characterized cell types: all endocrine cell types, including rare epsilon-cells; exocrine cell types; vascular cells; Schwann cells; quiescent and activated stellate cells; and four types of immune cells. We detected subpopulations of ductal cells with distinct expression profiles and validated their existence with immuno-histochemistry stains. Moreover, among human beta- cells, we detected heterogeneity in the regulation of genes relating to functional maturation and levels of ER stress. Finally, we deconvolved bulk gene expression samples using the single-cell data to detect disease-associated differential expression. Our dataset provides a resource for the discovery of novel cell type-specific transcription factors, signaling receptors, and medically relevant genes.",27667365,PMC5228327,10.1016/j.cels.2016.08.011,601
CellPhoneDB: inferring cell-cell communication from combined expression of multi-subunit ligand-receptor complexes,"Cell-cell communication mediated by ligand-receptor complexes is critical to coordinating diverse biological processes, such as development, differentiation and inflammation. To investigate how the context-dependent crosstalk of different cell types enables physiological processes to proceed, we developed CellPhoneDB, a novel repository of ligands, receptors and their interactions. In contrast to other repositories, our database takes into account the subunit architecture of both ligands and receptors, representing heteromeric complexes accurately. We integrated our resource with a statistical framework that predicts enriched cellular interactions between two cell types from single-cell transcriptomics data. Here, we outline the structure and content of our repository, provide procedures for inferring cell-cell communication networks from single-cell RNA sequencing data and present a practical step-by-step guide to help implement the protocol. CellPhoneDB v.2.0 is an updated version of our resource that incorporates additional functionalities to enable users to introduce new interacting molecules and reduces the time and resources needed to interrogate large datasets. CellPhoneDB v.2.0 is publicly available, both as code and as a user-friendly web interface; it can be used by both experts and researchers with little experience in computational genomics. In our protocol, we demonstrate how to evaluate meaningful biological interactions with CellPhoneDB v.2.0 using published datasets. This protocol typically takes ~2 h to complete, from installation to statistical analysis and visualization, for a dataset of ~10 GB, 10,000 cells and 19 cell types, and using five threads.",32103204,,10.1038/s41596-020-0292-x,1150
Best practices on the differential expression analysis of multi-species RNA-seq,"Advances in transcriptome sequencing allow for simultaneous interrogation of differentially expressed genes from multiple species originating from a single RNA sample, termed dual or multi-species transcriptomics. Compared to single-species differential expression analysis, the design of multi-species differential expression experiments must account for the relative abundances of each organism of interest within the sample, often requiring enrichment methods and yielding differences in total read counts across samples. The analysis of multi-species transcriptomics datasets requires modifications to the alignment, quantification, and downstream analysis steps compared to the single-species analysis pipelines. We describe best practices for multi-species transcriptomics and differential gene expression.",33926528,PMC8082843,10.1186/s13059-021-02337-8,24
A comprehensive comparison on cell-type composition inference for spatial transcriptomics data,"Spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies allow researchers to examine transcriptional profiles along with maintained positional information. Such spatially resolved transcriptional characterization of intact tissue samples provides an integrated view of gene expression in its natural spatial and functional context. However, high-throughput sequencing-based ST technologies cannot yet reach single cell resolution. Thus, similar to bulk RNA-seq data, gene expression data at ST spot-level reflect transcriptional profiles of multiple cells and entail the inference of cell-type composition within each ST spot for valid and powerful subsequent analyses. Realizing the critical importance of cell-type decomposition, multiple groups have developed ST deconvolution methods. The aim of this work is to review state-of-the-art methods for ST deconvolution, comparing their strengths and weaknesses. In particular, we construct ST spots from single-cell level ST data to assess the performance of 10 methods, with either ideal reference or non-ideal reference. Furthermore, we examine the performance of these methods on spot- and bead-level ST data by comparing estimated cell-type proportions to carefully matched single-cell ST data. In comparing the performance on various tissues and technological platforms, we concluded that RCTD and stereoscope achieve more robust and accurate inferences.",35753702,PMC9294426,10.1093/bib/bbac245,18
Single-Cell Resolution of Temporal Gene Expression during Heart Development,"Activation of complex molecular programs in specific cell lineages governs mammalian heart development, from a primordial linear tube to a four-chamber organ. To characterize lineage-specific, spatiotemporal developmental programs, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of >1,200 murine cells isolated at seven time points spanning embryonic day 9.5 (primordial heart tube) to postnatal day 21 (mature heart). Using unbiased transcriptional data, we classified cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells, and fibroblast-enriched cells, thus identifying markers for temporal and chamber-specific developmental programs. By harnessing these datasets, we defined developmental ages of human and mouse pluripotent stem-cell-derived cardiomyocytes and characterized lineage-specific maturation defects in hearts of mice with heterozygous mutations in Nkx2.5 that cause human heart malformations. This spatiotemporal transcriptome analysis of heart development reveals lineage-specific gene programs underlying normal cardiac development and congenital heart disease.",27840107,PMC5198784,10.1016/j.devcel.2016.10.001,232
Spatial heterogeneity in the mammalian liver,"Hepatocytes operate in highly structured repeating anatomical units termed liver lobules. Blood flow along the lobule radial axis creates gradients of oxygen, nutrients and hormones, which, together with morphogenetic fields, give rise to a highly variable microenvironment. In line with this spatial variability, key liver functions are expressed non-uniformly across the lobules, a phenomenon termed zonation. Technologies based on single-cell transcriptomics have constructed a global spatial map of hepatocyte gene expression in mice revealing that ~50% of hepatocyte genes are expressed in a zonated manner. This broad spatial heterogeneity suggests that hepatocytes in different lobule zones might have not only different gene expression profiles but also distinct epigenetic features, regenerative capacities, susceptibilities to damage and other functional aspects. Here, we present genomic approaches for studying liver zonation, describe the principles of liver zonation and discuss the intrinsic and extrinsic factors that dictate zonation patterns. We also explore the challenges and solutions for obtaining zonation maps of liver non-parenchymal cells. These approaches facilitate global characterization of liver function with high spatial resolution along physiological and pathological timescales.",30936469,,10.1038/s41575-019-0134-x,154
Single-cell transcriptomic analyses provide insights into the developmental origins of neuroblastoma,"Neuroblastoma is a pediatric tumor of the developing sympathetic nervous system. However, the cellular origin of neuroblastoma has yet to be defined. Here we studied the single-cell transcriptomes of neuroblastomas and normal human developing adrenal glands at various stages of embryonic and fetal development. We defined normal differentiation trajectories from Schwann cell precursors over intermediate states to neuroblasts or chromaffin cells and showed that neuroblastomas transcriptionally resemble normal fetal adrenal neuroblasts. Importantly, neuroblastomas with varying clinical phenotypes matched different temporal states along normal neuroblast differentiation trajectories, with the degree of differentiation corresponding to clinical prognosis. Our work highlights the roles of oncogenic MYCN and loss of TFAP2B in blocking differentiation and may provide the basis for designing therapeutic interventions to overcome differentiation blocks.",33767450,,10.1038/s41588-021-00806-1,94
Single cell transcriptome profiling of the human alcohol-dependent brain,"Alcoholism remains a prevalent health concern throughout the world. Previous studies have identified transcriptomic patterns in the brain associated with alcohol dependence in both humans and animal models. But none of these studies have systematically investigated expression within the unique cell types present in the brain. We utilized single nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) to examine the transcriptomes of over 16 000 nuclei isolated from the prefrontal cortex of alcoholic and control individuals. Each nucleus was assigned to one of seven major cell types by unsupervised clustering. Cell type enrichment patterns varied greatly among neuroinflammatory-related genes, which are known to play roles in alcohol dependence and neurodegeneration. Differential expression analysis identified cell type-specific genes with altered expression in alcoholics. The largest number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), including both protein-coding and non-coding, were detected in astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and microglia. To our knowledge, this is the first single cell transcriptome analysis of alcohol-associated gene expression in any species and the first such analysis in humans for any addictive substance. These findings greatly advance the understanding of transcriptomic changes in the brain of alcohol-dependent individuals.",32142123,PMC7206851,10.1093/hmg/ddaa038,43
Revealing the heterogeneity of CD4+T cells through single-cell transcriptomics,"Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) offers the ability to resolve whole transcriptomes of single cells with substantial throughput, and it has revolutionized studies of gene expression. The transcriptional resolution available can uncover fine structures of biologic heterogeneity that are manifest among cell populations. Here, we review the applications of scRNA-seq to profile the phenotypes and clonotypes of CD4+T cells. First, we describe challenges inherent to scRNA-seq that are important for analysis of CD4+T cells, as well as the technical solutions that are emerging to address these challenges. We then consider major themes of the application of scRNA-seq to CD4+T cells, including investigation of CD4+T-cell heterogeneity in model systems, analysis of populations from the peripheral blood, and the profiling of tissue-resident populations. We place emphasis on capabilities unique to scRNA-seq, such as the ability to obtain paired T-cell receptor and transcriptome information from single T cells and the potential to elucidate interactions between CD4+T cells and other cells in their environment. Finally, we conclude by considering future areas of technologic advancement and innovation through which scRNA-seq may further shape our understanding of the roles of CD4+T cells in health and disease.",36205449,,10.1016/j.jaci.2022.08.010,3
Profiling human breast epithelial cells using single cell RNA sequencing identifies cell diversity,"Breast cancer arises from breast epithelial cells that acquire genetic alterations leading to subsequent loss of tissue homeostasis. Several distinct epithelial subpopulations have been proposed, but complete understanding of the spectrum of heterogeneity and differentiation hierarchy in the human breast remains elusive. Here, we use single-cell mRNA sequencing (scRNAseq) to profile the transcriptomes of 25,790 primary human breast epithelial cells isolated from reduction mammoplasties of seven individuals. Unbiased clustering analysis reveals the existence of three distinct epithelial cell populations, one basal and two luminal cell types, which we identify as secretory L1- and hormone-responsive L2-type cells. Pseudotemporal reconstruction of differentiation trajectories produces one continuous lineage hierarchy that closely connects the basal lineage to the two differentiated luminal branches. Our comprehensive cell atlas provides insights into the cellular blueprint of the human breast epithelium and will form the foundation to understand how the system goes awry during breast cancer.",29795293,PMC5966421,10.1038/s41467-018-04334-1,165
Single-cell RNA and protein profiling of immune cells from the mouse brain and its border tissues,"Brain-immune cross-talk and neuroinflammation critically shape brain physiology in health and disease. A detailed understanding of the brain immune landscape is essential for developing new treatments for neurological disorders. Single-cell technologies offer an unbiased assessment of the heterogeneity, dynamics and functions of immune cells. Here we provide a protocol that outlines all the steps involved in performing single-cell multi-omic analysis of the brain immune compartment. This includes a step-by-step description on how to microdissect the border regions of the mouse brain, together with dissociation protocols tailored to each of these tissues. These combine a high yield with minimal dissociation-induced gene expression changes. Next, we outline the steps involved for high-dimensional flow cytometry and droplet-based single-cell RNA sequencing via the 10x Genomics platform, which can be combined with cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing (CITE-seq) and offers a higher throughput than plate-based methods. Importantly, we detail how to implement CITE-seq with large antibody panels to obtain unbiased protein-expression screening coupled to transcriptome analysis. Finally, we describe the main steps involved in the analysis and interpretation of the data. This optimized workflow allows for a detailed assessment of immune cell heterogeneity and activation in the whole brain or specific border regions, at RNA and protein level. The wet lab workflow can be completed by properly trained researchers (with basic proficiency in cell and molecular biology) and takes between 6 and 11 h, depending on the chosen procedures. The computational analysis requires a background in bioinformatics and programming in R.",35931780,,10.1038/s41596-022-00716-4,9
Single-cell transcriptome profiling of the human developing spinal cord reveals a conserved genetic programme with human-specific features,"The spinal cord receives input from peripheral sensory neurons and controls motor output by regulating muscle innervating motor neurons. These functions are carried out by neural circuits comprising molecularly distinct neuronal subtypes generated in a characteristic spatiotemporal arrangement from progenitors in the embryonic neural tube. To gain insight into the diversity and complexity of cells in the developing human neural tube, we used single-cell mRNA sequencing to profile cervical and thoracic regions in four human embryos of Carnegie stages (CS) CS12, CS14, CS17 and CS19 from gestational weeks 4-7. Analysis of progenitor and neuronal populations from the neural tube and dorsal root ganglia identified dozens of distinct cell types and facilitated the reconstruction of the differentiation pathways of specific neuronal subtypes. Comparison with mouse revealed overall similarity of mammalian neural tube development while highlighting some human-specific features. These data provide a catalogue of gene expression and cell type identity in the human neural tube that will support future studies of sensory and motor control systems. The data can be explored at https://shiny.crick.ac.uk/scviewer/neuraltube/.",34351410,PMC8353162,10.1242/dev.199711,31
Live-seq enables temporal transcriptomic recording of single cells,"Single-cell transcriptomics (scRNA-seq) has greatly advanced our ability to characterize cellular heterogeneity1. However, scRNA-seq requires lysing cells, which impedes further molecular or functional analyses on the same cells. Here, we established Live-seq, a single-cell transcriptome profiling approach that preserves cell viability during RNA extraction using fluidic force microscopy2,3, thus allowing to couple a cell's ground-state transcriptome to its downstream molecular or phenotypic behaviour. To benchmark Live-seq, we used cell growth, functional responses and whole-cell transcriptome read-outs to demonstrate that Live-seq can accurately stratify diverse cell types and states without inducing major cellular perturbations. As a proof of concept, we show that Live-seq can be used to directly map a cell's trajectory by sequentially profiling the transcriptomes of individual macrophages before and after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation, and of adipose stromal cells pre- and post-differentiation. In addition, we demonstrate that Live-seq can function as a transcriptomic recorder by preregistering the transcriptomes of individual macrophages that were subsequently monitored by time-lapse imaging after LPS exposure. This enabled the unsupervised, genome-wide ranking of genes on the basis of their ability to affect macrophage LPS response heterogeneity, revealing basal Nfkbia expression level and cell cycle state as important phenotypic determinants, which we experimentally validated. Thus, Live-seq can address a broad range of biological questions by transforming scRNA-seq from an end-point to a temporal analysis approach.",35978187,PMC9402441,10.1038/s41586-022-05046-9,57
Cell segmentation in imaging-based spatial transcriptomics,"Single-molecule spatial transcriptomics protocols based on in situ sequencing or multiplexed RNA fluorescent hybridization can reveal detailed tissue organization. However, distinguishing the boundaries of individual cells in such data is challenging and can hamper downstream analysis. Current methods generally approximate cells positions using nuclei stains. We describe a segmentation method, Baysor, that optimizes two-dimensional (2D) or three-dimensional (3D) cell boundaries considering joint likelihood of transcriptional composition and cell morphology. While Baysor can take into account segmentation based on co-stains, it can also perform segmentation based on the detected transcripts alone. To evaluate performance, we extend multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH) to incorporate immunostaining of cell boundaries. Using this and other benchmarks, we show that Baysor segmentation can, in some cases, nearly double the number of cells compared to existing tools while reducing segmentation artifacts. We demonstrate that Baysor performs well on data acquired using five different protocols, making it a useful general tool for analysis of imaging-based spatial transcriptomics.",34650268,,10.1038/s41587-021-01044-w,68
Slingshot: cell lineage and pseudotime inference for single-cell transcriptomics,"Background:Single-cell transcriptomics allows researchers to investigate complex communities of heterogeneous cells. It can be applied to stem cells and their descendants in order to chart the progression from multipotent progenitors to fully differentiated cells. While a variety of statistical and computational methods have been proposed for inferring cell lineages, the problem of accurately characterizing multiple branching lineages remains difficult to solve.Results:We introduce Slingshot, a novel method for inferring cell lineages and pseudotimes from single-cell gene expression data. In previously published datasets, Slingshot correctly identifies the biological signal for one to three branching trajectories. Additionally, our simulation study shows that Slingshot infers more accurate pseudotimes than other leading methods.Conclusions:Slingshot is a uniquely robust and flexible tool which combines the highly stable techniques necessary for noisy single-cell data with the ability to identify multiple trajectories. Accurate lineage inference is a critical step in the identification of dynamic temporal gene expression.",29914354,PMC6007078,10.1186/s12864-018-4772-0,926
De novo analysis of bulk RNA-seq data at spatially resolved single-cell resolution,"Uncovering the tissue molecular architecture at single-cell resolution could help better understand organisms' biological and pathological processes. However, bulk RNA-seq can only measure gene expression in cell mixtures, without revealing the transcriptional heterogeneity and spatial patterns of single cells. Herein, we introduce Bulk2Space ( https://github.com/ZJUFanLab/bulk2space ), a deep learning framework-based spatial deconvolution algorithm that can simultaneously disclose the spatial and cellular heterogeneity of bulk RNA-seq data using existing single-cell and spatial transcriptomics references. The use of bulk transcriptomics to validate Bulk2Space unveils, in particular, the spatial variance of immune cells in different tumor regions, the molecular and spatial heterogeneity of tissues during inflammation-induced tumorigenesis, and spatial patterns of novel genes in different cell types. Moreover, Bulk2Space is utilized to perform spatial deconvolution analysis on bulk transcriptome data from two different mouse brain regions derived from our in-house developed sequencing approach termed Spatial-seq. We have not only reconstructed the hierarchical structure of the mouse isocortex but also further annotated cell types that were not identified by original methods in the mouse hypothalamus.",36310179,PMC9618574,10.1038/s41467-022-34271-z,12
Integrated spatial transcriptome and metabolism study reveals metabolic heterogeneity in human injured brain,"Single-cell transcriptomics can provide quantitative molecular signatures for large, unbiased samples of the diverse cell types in the brain. With the advances of multi-omics datasets, a major challenge is to validate and integrate results into a biological understanding of spatial organization and functional orientation. Here, we generate spatial transcriptomes and metabolites from six patients with brain trauma with surgical samples. The resulting spatial marker gene, which is highly replicable across analysis methods, sequencing technologies, and modalities, is a comprehensive molecular marker of the diverse metabolic changes in human injured brains. The atlas includes an area of lipid peroxidation that resembles injured neurons in the brain. We further discover imbalanced myo-inositol and myo-inositol phosphate and related spatial markers. Our results highlight the complex transcriptomic regulation and metabolic alterations in the injured brain and will directly enable the design of reagents to target specific genes in the human brain for functional analysis.",37263268,PMC10313933,10.1016/j.xcrm.2023.101057,7
Spatial transcriptomics at subspot resolution with BayesSpace,"Recent spatial gene expression technologies enable comprehensive measurement of transcriptomic profiles while retaining spatial context. However, existing analysis methods do not address the limited resolution of the technology or use the spatial information efficiently. Here, we introduce BayesSpace, a fully Bayesian statistical method that uses the information from spatial neighborhoods for resolution enhancement of spatial transcriptomic data and for clustering analysis. We benchmark BayesSpace against current methods for spatial and non-spatial clustering and show that it improves identification of distinct intra-tissue transcriptional profiles from samples of the brain, melanoma, invasive ductal carcinoma and ovarian adenocarcinoma. Using immunohistochemistry and an in silico dataset constructed from scRNA-seq data, we show that BayesSpace resolves tissue structure that is not detectable at the original resolution and identifies transcriptional heterogeneity inaccessible to histological analysis. Our results illustrate BayesSpace's utility in facilitating the discovery of biological insights from spatial transcriptomic datasets.",34083791,PMC8763026,10.1038/s41587-021-00935-2,178
High-resolution alignment of single-cell and spatial transcriptomes with CytoSPACE,"Recent studies have emphasized the importance of single-cell spatial biology, yet available assays for spatial transcriptomics have limited gene recovery or low spatial resolution. Here we introduce CytoSPACE, an optimization method for mapping individual cells from a single-cell RNA sequencing atlas to spatial expression profiles. Across diverse platforms and tissue types, we show that CytoSPACE outperforms previous methods with respect to noise tolerance and accuracy, enabling tissue cartography at single-cell resolution.",36879008,PMC10635828,10.1038/s41587-023-01697-9,26
"Dictionary learning for integrative, multimodal and scalable single-cell analysis","Mapping single-cell sequencing profiles to comprehensive reference datasets provides a powerful alternative to unsupervised analysis. However, most reference datasets are constructed from single-cell RNA-sequencing data and cannot be used to annotate datasets that do not measure gene expression. Here we introduce 'bridge integration', a method to integrate single-cell datasets across modalities using a multiomic dataset as a molecular bridge. Each cell in the multiomic dataset constitutes an element in a 'dictionary', which is used to reconstruct unimodal datasets and transform them into a shared space. Our procedure accurately integrates transcriptomic data with independent single-cell measurements of chromatin accessibility, histone modifications, DNA methylation and protein levels. Moreover, we demonstrate how dictionary learning can be combined with sketching techniques to improve computational scalability and harmonize 8.6 million human immune cell profiles from sequencing and mass cytometry experiments. Our approach, implemented in version 5 of our Seurat toolkit ( http://www.satijalab.org/seurat ), broadens the utility of single-cell reference datasets and facilitates comparisons across diverse molecular modalities.",37231261,PMC10928517,10.1038/s41587-023-01767-y,109
A graph neural network model to estimate cell-wise metabolic flux using single-cell RNA-seq data,"The metabolic heterogeneity and metabolic interplay between cells are known as significant contributors to disease treatment resistance. However, with the lack of a mature high-throughput single-cell metabolomics technology, we are yet to establish systematic understanding of the intra-tissue metabolic heterogeneity and cooperative mechanisms. To mitigate this knowledge gap, we developed a novel computational method, namely, single-cell flux estimation analysis (scFEA), to infer the cell-wise fluxome from single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. scFEA is empowered by a systematically reconstructed human metabolic map as a factor graph, a novel probabilistic model to leverage the flux balance constraints on scRNA-seq data, and a novel graph neural network-based optimization solver. The intricate information cascade from transcriptome to metabolome was captured using multilayer neural networks to capitulate the nonlinear dependency between enzymatic gene expressions and reaction rates. We experimentally validated scFEA by generating an scRNA-seq data set with matched metabolomics data on cells of perturbed oxygen and genetic conditions. Application of scFEA on this data set showed the consistency between predicted flux and the observed variation of metabolite abundance in the matched metabolomics data. We also applied scFEA on five publicly available scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics data sets and identified context- and cell group-specific metabolic variations. The cell-wise fluxome predicted by scFEA empowers a series of downstream analyses including identification of metabolic modules or cell groups that share common metabolic variations, sensitivity evaluation of enzymes with regards to their impact on the whole metabolic flux, and inference of cell-tissue and cell-cell metabolic communications.",34301623,PMC8494226,10.1101/gr.271205.120,32
Tracing the temporal-spatial transcriptome landscapes of the human fetal digestive tract using single-cell RNA-sequencing,"The development of the digestive tract is critical for proper food digestion and nutrient absorption. Here, we analyse the main organs of the digestive tract, including the oesophagus, stomach, small intestine and large intestine, from human embryos between 6 and 25 weeks of gestation as well as the large intestine from adults using single-cell RNA-seq analyses. In total, 5,227 individual cells are analysed and 40 cell types clearly identified. Their crucial biological features, including developmental processes, signalling pathways, cell cycle, nutrient digestion and absorption metabolism, and transcription factor networks, are systematically revealed. Moreover, the differentiation and maturation processes of the large intestine are thoroughly investigated by comparing the corresponding transcriptome profiles between embryonic and adult stages. Our work offers a rich resource for investigating the gene regulation networks of the human fetal digestive tract and adult large intestine at single-cell resolution.",29802404,,10.1038/s41556-018-0105-4,82
Reconstituting the transcriptome and DNA methylome landscapes of human implantation,"Implantation is a milestone event during mammalian embryogenesis. Implantation failure is a considerable cause of early pregnancy loss in humans1. Owing to the difficulty of obtaining human embryos early after implantation in vivo, it remains unclear how the gene regulatory network and epigenetic mechanisms control the implantation process. Here, by combining an in vitro culture system for the development human embryos after implantation and single-cell multi-omics sequencing technologies, more than 8,000 individual cells from 65 human peri-implantation embryos were systematically analysed. Unsupervised dimensionality reduction and clustering algorithms of the transcriptome data show stepwise implantation routes for the epiblast, primitive endoderm and trophectoderm lineages, suggesting robust preparation for the proper establishment of a mother-to-offspring connection during implantation. Female embryos showed initiation of random X chromosome inactivation based on analysis of parental allele-specific expression of X-chromosome-linked genes during implantation. Notably, using single-cell triple omics sequencing analysis, the re-methylation of the genome in cells from the primitive endoderm lineage was shown to be much slower than in cells of both epiblast and trophectoderm lineages during the implantation process, which indicates that there are distinct re-establishment features in the DNA methylome of the epiblast and primitive endoderm-even though both lineages are derived from the inner cell mass. Collectively, our work provides insights into the complex molecular mechanisms that regulate the implantation of human embryos, and helps to advance future efforts to understanding early embryonic development and reproductive medicine.",31435013,,10.1038/s41586-019-1500-0,123
Single-Cell Transcriptome Profiling,"Over the last decade, single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) became an increasingly viable solution for analyzing cellular heterogeneity and cell-specific expression differences. While not as mature or fully realized as bulk sequencing, newly developed computational methods offer a solution to the challenges of scRNAseq data analysis, providing previously inaccessible biological insight at unprecedented levels of detail. Here, we go over the inherent challenges of single-cell data analysis and the computational methods used to overcome them. We cover current and future applications of scRNAseq in research of cellular dynamics and as an integrative component of biological research.",33606265,,10.1007/978-1-0716-1103-6_16,3
Characterizing cancer metabolism from bulk and single-cell RNA-seq data using METAFlux,"Cells often alter metabolic strategies under nutrient-deprived conditions to support their survival and growth. Characterizing metabolic reprogramming in the tumor microenvironment (TME) is of emerging importance in cancer research and patient care. However, recent technologies only measure a subset of metabolites and cannot provide in situ measurements. Computational methods such as flux balance analysis (FBA) have been developed to estimate metabolic flux from bulk RNA-seq data and can potentially be extended to single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data. However, it is unclear how reliable current methods are, particularly in TME characterization. Here, we present a computational framework METAFlux (METAbolic Flux balance analysis) to infer metabolic fluxes from bulk or single-cell transcriptomic data. Large-scale experiments using cell-lines, the cancer genome atlas (TCGA), and scRNA-seq data obtained from diverse cancer and immunotherapeutic contexts, including CAR-NK cell therapy, have validated METAFlux's capability to characterize metabolic heterogeneity and metabolic interaction amongst cell types.",37573313,PMC10423258,10.1038/s41467-023-40457-w,5
Tracing the first hematopoietic stem cell generation in human embryo by single-cell RNA sequencing,"Tracing the emergence of the first hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in human embryos, particularly the scarce and transient precursors thereof, is so far challenging, largely due to the technical limitations and the material rarity. Here, using single-cell RNA sequencing, we constructed the first genome-scale gene expression landscape covering the entire course of endothelial-to-HSC transition during human embryogenesis. The transcriptomically defined HSC-primed hemogenic endothelial cells (HECs) were captured at Carnegie stage (CS) 12-14 in an unbiased way, showing an unambiguous feature of arterial endothelial cells (ECs) with the up-regulation of RUNX1, MYB and ANGPT1. Importantly, subcategorizing CD34+CD45-ECs into a CD44+population strikingly enriched HECs by over 10-fold. We further mapped the developmental path from arterial ECs via HSC-primed HECs to hematopoietic stem progenitor cells, and revealed a distinct expression pattern of genes that were transiently over-represented upon the hemogenic fate choice of arterial ECs, including EMCN, PROCR and RUNX1T1. We also uncovered another temporally and molecularly distinct intra-embryonic HEC population, which was detected mainly at earlier CS 10 and lacked the arterial feature. Finally, we revealed the cellular components of the putative aortic niche and potential cellular interactions acting on the HSC-primed HECs. The cellular and molecular programs that underlie the generation of the first HSCs from HECs in human embryos, together with the ability to distinguish the HSC-primed HECs from others, will shed light on the strategies for the production of clinically useful HSCs from pluripotent stem cells.",31501518,PMC6888893,10.1038/s41422-019-0228-6,85
"Single nucleus RNA-sequencing: how it's done, applications and limitations","Single nuclei RNA-sequencing (sNuc-Seq) is a methodology which uses isolated nuclei instead of whole cells to profile gene expression. By using droplet microfluidic technologies, users are able to profile thousands of single transcriptomes at high throughput from their chosen tissue. This article aims to introduce sNuc-Seq as a method and its utility in multiple tissue types. Furthermore, we discuss the risks associated with the use of nuclei, which must be considered before committing to a methodology.",34515767,,10.1042/ETLS20210074,7
Large-Scale Integration of Single-Cell RNA-Seq Data Reveals Astrocyte Diversity and Transcriptomic Modules across Six Central Nervous System Disorders,"The dysfunction of astrocytes in response to environmental factors contributes to many neurological diseases by impacting neuroinflammation responses, glutamate and ion homeostasis, and cholesterol and sphingolipid metabolism, which calls for comprehensive and high-resolution analysis. However, single-cell transcriptome analyses of astrocytes have been hampered by the sparseness of human brain specimens. Here, we demonstrate how large-scale integration of multi-omics data, including single-cell and spatial transcriptomic and proteomic data, overcomes these limitations. We created a single-cell transcriptomic dataset of human brains by integration, consensus annotation, and analyzing 302 publicly available single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets, highlighting the power to resolve previously unidentifiable astrocyte subpopulations. The resulting dataset includes nearly one million cells that span a wide variety of diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), multiple sclerosis (MS), epilepsy (Epi), and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). We profiled the astrocytes at three levels, subtype compositions, regulatory modules, and cell-cell communications, and comprehensively depicted the heterogeneity of pathological astrocytes. We constructed seven transcriptomic modules that are involved in the onset and progress of disease development, such as the M2 ECM and M4 stress modules. We validated that the M2 ECM module could furnish potential markers for AD early diagnosis at both the transcriptome and protein levels. In order to accomplish a high-resolution, local identification of astrocyte subtypes, we also carried out a spatial transcriptome analysis of mouse brains using the integrated dataset as a reference. We found that astrocyte subtypes are regionally heterogeneous. We identified dynamic cell-cell interactions in different disorders and found that astrocytes participate in key signaling pathways, such as NRG3-ERBB4, in epilepsy. Our work supports the utility of large-scale integration of single-cell transcriptomic data, which offers new insights into underlying multiple CNS disease mechanisms where astrocytes are involved.",37189441,PMC10135484,10.3390/biom13040692,5
Integrated analysis of single-cell and bulk transcriptomics develops a robust neuroendocrine cell-intrinsic signature to predict prostate cancer progression,"Neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) typically implies severe lethality and limited treatment options. The precise identification of NEPC cells holds paramount significance for both research and clinical applications, yet valid NEPC biomarker remains to be defined.Methods:Leveraging 11 published NE-related gene sets, 11 single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) cohorts, 15 bulk transcriptomic cohorts, and 13 experimental models of prostate cancer (PCa), we employed multiple advanced algorithms to construct and validate a robust NEPC risk prediction model.Results:Through the compilation of a comprehensive scRNA-seq reference atlas (comprising a total of 210,879 single cells, including 66 tumor samples) from 9 multicenter datasets of PCa, we observed inconsistent and inefficient performance among the 11 published NE gene sets. Therefore, we developed an integrative analysis pipeline, identifying 762 high-quality NE markers. Subsequently, we derived the NE cell-intrinsic gene signature, and developed an R package named NEPAL, to predict NEPC risk scores. By applying to multiple independent validation datasets, NEPAL consistently and accurately assigned NE feature and delineated PCa progression. Intriguingly, NEPAL demonstrated predictive capabilities for prognosis and therapy responsiveness, as well as the identification of potential epigenetic drivers of NEPC.Conclusion:The present study furnishes a valuable tool for the identification of NEPC and the monitoring of PCa progression through transcriptomic profiles obtained from both bulk and single-cell sources.",38250042,PMC10797290,10.7150/thno.92336,1
Comparative single-cell transcriptomic profiles of human androgenotes and parthenogenotes during early development,"Objective:To unravel the differential transcriptomic behavior of human androgenotes (AGs) and parthenogenotes (PGs) throughout the first cell cycles, analyze the differential expression of genes related to key biologic processes, and determine the time frame for embryonic genome activation (EGA) in AGs and PGs.Design:Laboratory study.Setting:Private fertility clinic.Patient(s):Mature oocytes were retrieved from healthy donors and subjected to artificial oocyte activation using calcium ionophore and puromycin to generate PGs (n = 6) or enucleated and subjected to intracytoplasmic sperm injection to generate AGs (n = 10).Intervention(s):Uniparental constructs at different early stages of development were disaggregated into constituent single cells (we suggest the terms parthenocytes and androcytes) to characterize the single-cell transcriptional landscape using next-generation sequencing.Main outcomes measure(s):Transcriptomic profiles comparison between different stages of early development in AGs and PGs.Result(s):The uniparental transcriptomic profiles at the first cell cycle showed 68 down-regulated and 26 up-regulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in PGs compared with AGs. During the third cell cycle, we found 60 up-regulated and 504 down-regulated DEGs in PGs compared with AGs. In the fourth cell cycle, 1,771 up-regulated and 1,171 down-regulated DEGs were found in PGs compared with AGs. The AGs and PGs had reduced EGA profiles during the first 3 cell cycles, and a spike of EGA at the fourth cell cycle was observed in PGs.Conclusion(s):Transcriptomic analysis of AGs and PGs revealed their complementary behavior until the fourth cell cycle. Androgenotes undergo a low wave of transcription during the first cell cycle, which reflects the paternal contribution to cell cycle coordination, mechanics of cell division, and novel transcription regulation. Maternal transcripts are most prominent in the third and fourth cell cycles, with amplification of transcription related to morphogenic progression and embryonic developmental competence acquisition. Regarding EGA, in PGs, a primitive EGA begins at the 1-cell stage and gradually progresses until the 4-cell stage, when crucial epigenetic reprogramming (through methylation) is up-regulated. In addition, our longitudinal single-cell transcriptomic analysis challenges that the zygote and early cleavage stages are the only totipotent entities, by revealing potential totipotency in cleavage-stage AGs and implications of paternal transcripts.",36563838,,10.1016/j.fertnstert.2022.12.027,0
Nx1-Seq (Well Based Single-Cell Analysis System),"Research on the hierarchical nature of cell differentiation and heterogeneity in tissues has been performed by isolating and identifying cells by the use of monoclonal antibodies, cell sorting, microdissection, and functional assays. However, it is difficult to analyze continuous changes in cell differentiation and the identification of cells for which cell markers are unclear. Furthermore, cell populations considered identical were shown to be diverse. Recently, single cell gene expression analysis was performed to help understand the complexity of cell populations. Single-cell analysis can analyze the diversity of individual cell populations as well as the tissue microenvironment, and is extremely useful for research on intercellular interactions in diseases and identifying specific marker genes. Recent advances in technology have made it possible to analyze hundreds of single cells. In this paper, we introduce our newly developed well-based single-cell transcriptome method, which includes other methods.",30968360,,10.1007/978-981-13-6037-4_4,5
Constructing cell lineages from single-cell transcriptomes,"Advances in single-cell RNA-sequencing have helped reveal the previously underappreciated level of cellular heterogeneity present during cellular differentiation. A static snapshot of single-cell transcriptomes provides a good representation of the various stages of differentiation as differentiation is rarely synchronized between cells. Data from numerous single-cell analyses has suggested that cellular differentiation and development can be conceptualized as continuous processes. Consequently, computational algorithms have been developed to infer lineage relationships between cell types and construct developmental trajectories along which cells are re-ordered such that similarity between successive cell pairs is maximized. Here, we compare and contrast the existing computational methods, and illustrate how they may be applied to build mouse myeloid progenitor lineages from massively parallel RNA single-cell sequencing data.",29107741,,10.1016/j.mam.2017.10.004,12
The spatial landscape of gene expression isoforms in tissue sections,"In situ capturing technologies add tissue context to gene expression data, with the potential of providing a greater understanding of complex biological systems. However, splicing variants and full-length sequence heterogeneity cannot be characterized at spatial resolution with current transcriptome profiling methods. To that end, we introduce spatial isoform transcriptomics (SiT), an explorative method for characterizing spatial isoform variation and sequence heterogeneity using long-read sequencing. We show in mouse brain how SiT can be used to profile isoform expression and sequence heterogeneity in different areas of the tissue. SiT reveals regional isoform switching of Plp1 gene between different layers of the olfactory bulb, and the use of external single-cell data allows the nomination of cell types expressing each isoform. Furthermore, SiT identifies differential isoform usage for several major genes implicated in brain function (Snap25, Bin1, Gnas) that are independently validated by in situ sequencing. SiT also provides for the first time an in-depth A-to-I RNA editing map of the adult mouse brain. Data exploration can be performed through an online resource (https://www.isomics.eu), where isoform expression and RNA editing can be visualized in a spatial context.",36928528,PMC10164556,10.1093/nar/gkad169,15
Leveraging spatial transcriptomics data to recover cell locations in single-cell RNA-seq with CeLEry,"Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revolutionized our understanding of cellular heterogeneity in health and disease. However, the lack of physical relationships among dissociated cells has limited its applications. To address this issue, we present CeLEry (Cell Location recovEry), a supervised deep learning algorithm that leverages gene expression and spatial location relationships learned from spatial transcriptomics to recover the spatial origins of cells in scRNA-seq. CeLEry has an optional data augmentation procedure via a variational autoencoder, which improves the method's robustness and allows it to overcome noise in scRNA-seq data. We show that CeLEry can infer the spatial origins of cells in scRNA-seq at multiple levels, including 2D location and spatial domain of a cell, while also providing uncertainty estimates for the recovered locations. Our comprehensive benchmarking evaluations on multiple datasets generated from brain and cancer tissues using Visium, MERSCOPE, MERFISH, and Xenium demonstrate that CeLEry can reliably recover the spatial location information for cells using scRNA-seq data.",37422469,PMC10329686,10.1038/s41467-023-39895-3,2
Plant Single-Cell/Nucleus RNA-seq Workflow,"Single-cell transcriptomics technologies allow researchers to investigate how individual cells, in complex multicellular organisms, differentially use their common genomic DNA. In plant biology, these technologies were recently applied to reveal the transcriptomes of various plant cells isolated from different organs and different species and in response to environmental stresses. These first studies support the potential of single-cell transcriptomics technology to decipher the biological function of plant cells, their developmental programs, cell-type-specific gene networks, programs controlling plant cell response to environmental stresses, etc. In this chapter, we provide information regarding the critical steps and important information to consider when developing an experimental design in plant single-cell biology. We also describe the current status of bioinformatics tools used to analyze single-cell RNA-seq datasets and how additional emerging technologies such as spatial transcriptomics and long-read sequencing technologies will provide additional information on the differential use of the genome by plant cells.",36495448,,10.1007/978-1-0716-2756-3_6,0
Co-expression in Single-Cell Analysis: Saving Grace or Original Sin?,"As a fundamental unit of life, the cell has rightfully been the subject of intense investigation throughout the history of biology. Technical innovations now make it possible to assay cellular features at genomic scale, yielding breakthroughs in our understanding of the molecular organization of tissues, and even whole organisms. As these data accumulate we will soon be faced with a new challenge: making sense of the plethora of results. Early investigations into the replicability of cell type profiles inferred from single-cell RNA sequencing data have indicated that this is likely to be surprisingly straightforward due to consistent gene co-expression. In this opinion article we discuss the evidence for this claim and its implications for interpreting cell type-specific gene expression.",30146183,PMC6195469,10.1016/j.tig.2018.07.007,16
Spatial transcriptomics and the kidney,"Purpose of review:The application of spatial transcriptomics technologies to the interrogation of kidney tissue is a burgeoning effort. These technologies share a common purpose in mapping both the expression of individual molecules and entire transcriptomic signatures of kidney cell types and structures. Such information is often superimposed upon a histologic image. The resulting datasets are readily merged with other imaging and transcriptomic techniques to establish a spatially anchored atlas of the kidney. This review provides an overview of the various spatial transcriptomic technologies and recent studies in kidney disease. Potential applications gleaned from the interrogation of other organ systems, but relative to the kidney, are also discussed.Recent findings:Spatial transcriptomic technologies have enabled localization of whole transcriptome mRNA expression, correlation of mRNA to histology, measurement of in situ changes in expression across time, and even subcellular localization of transcripts within the kidney. These innovations continue to aid in the development of human cellular atlases of the kidney, the reclassification of disease, and the identification of important therapeutic targets.Summary:Spatial localization of gene expression will complement our current understanding of disease derived from single cell RNA sequencing, histopathology, protein immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy. Although spatial technologies continue to evolve rapidly, their importance in the localization of disease signatures is already apparent. Further efforts are required to integrate whole transcriptome and subcellular expression signatures into the individualized assessment of human kidney disease.",35125393,PMC9035033,10.1097/MNH.0000000000000781,2
Single-Cell Transcriptome Analysis of Uniparental Embryos Reveals Parent-of-Origin Effects on Human Preimplantation Development,"To investigate the contribution of parental genomes to early embryogenesis, we profiled the single-cell transcriptomes of human biparental and uniparental embryos systematically from the 1-cell to the morula stage. We observed that uniparental embryos exhibited variable and decreased embryonic genome activation (EGA). Comparative transcriptome analysis identified 807 maternally biased expressed genes (MBGs) and 581 paternally biased expressed genes (PBGs) in the preimplantation stages. MBGs became apparent at the 4-cell stage and contributed to the initiation of EGA, whereas PBGs preferentially appeared at the 8-cell stage and might affect embryo compaction and trophectoderm specification. Regulatory network analysis revealed that DUX4, EGR2, and DUXA are key transcription factors in MBGs' expression; ZNF263 and KLF3 are important for PBGs' expression. We demonstrated that parent-specific DNA methylation might account for the expression of most PBGs. Our results provide a valuable resource to understand parental genome activation and might help to elucidate parent-of-origin effects in early human development.",31588047,,10.1016/j.stem.2019.09.004,37

Single-Cell Transcriptomic Profiling Identifies Molecular Phenotypes of Newborn Human Lung Cells,"While animal model studies have extensively defined the mechanisms controlling cell diversity in the developing mammalian lung, there exists a significant knowledge gap with regards to late-stage human lung development. The NHLBI Molecular Atlas of Lung Development Program (LungMAP) seeks to fill this gap by creating a structural, cellular and molecular atlas of the human and mouse lung. Transcriptomic profiling at the single-cell level created a cellular atlas of newborn human lungs. Frozen single-cell isolates obtained from two newborn human lungs from the LungMAP Human Tissue Core Biorepository, were captured, and library preparation was completed on the Chromium 10X system. Data was analyzed in Seurat, and cellular annotation was performed using the ToppGene functional analysis tool. Transcriptional interrogation of 5500 newborn human lung cells identified distinct clusters representing multiple populations of epithelial, endothelial, fibroblasts, pericytes, smooth muscle, immune cells and their gene signatures. Computational integration of data from newborn human cells and with 32,000 cells from postnatal days 1 through 10 mouse lungs generated by the LungMAP Cincinnati Research Center facilitated the identification of distinct cellular lineages among all the major cell types. Integration of the newborn human and mouse cellular transcriptomes also demonstrated cell type-specific differences in maturation states of newborn human lung cells. Specifically, newborn human lung matrix fibroblasts could be separated into those representative of younger cells (n= 393), or older cells (n= 158). Cells with each molecular profile were spatially resolved within newborn human lung tissue. This is the first comprehensive molecular map of the cellular landscape of neonatal human lung, including biomarkers for cells at distinct states of maturity.",38540357,PMC10970229,10.3390/genes15030298,1
Spatial transcriptomic survey of human embryonic cerebral cortex by single-cell RNA-seq analysis,"The cellular complexity of human brain development has been intensively investigated, although a regional characterization of the entire human cerebral cortex based on single-cell transcriptome analysis has not been reported. Here, we performed RNA-seq on over 4,000 individual cells from 22 brain regions of human mid-gestation embryos. We identified 29 cell sub-clusters, which showed different proportions in each region and the pons showed especially high percentage of astrocytes. Embryonic neurons were not as diverse as adult neurons, although they possessed important features of their destinies in adults. Neuron development was unsynchronized in the cerebral cortex, as dorsal regions appeared to be more mature than ventral regions at this stage. Region-specific genes were comprehensively identified in each neuronal sub-cluster, and a large proportion of these genes were neural disease related. Our results present a systematic landscape of the regionalized gene expression and neuron maturation of the human cerebral cortex.",29867213,PMC6028726,10.1038/s41422-018-0053-3,101
Research strategies for single-cell transcriptome analysis in plant leaves,"The recent and continuous improvement in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology has led to its emergence as an efficient experimental approach in plant research. However, compared with single-cell research in animals and humans, the application of scRNA-seq in plant research is limited by several challenges, including cell separation, cell type annotation, cellular function analysis, and cell-cell communication networks. In addition, the unavailability of corresponding reliable and stable analysis methods and standards has resulted in the relative decentralization of plant single-cell research. Considering these shortcomings, this review summarizes the research progress in plant leaf using scRNA-seq. In addition, it describes the corresponding feasible analytical methods and associated difficulties and problems encountered in the current research. In the end, we provide a speculative overview of the development of plant single-cell transcriptome research in the future.",35904970,,10.1111/tpj.15927,7

The emergence of Patch-sequencing (Patch-seq) directly links transcriptomics, morphology, and electrophysiology, taking neuroscience research to a multimodal era. In this review, we summarized the development of Patch-seq and recent applications in the cortex, hippocampus, and other nervous systems. Through generating multimodal cell type atlases, targeting specific cell populations, and correlating transcriptomic data with phenotypic information, Patch-seq has provided new insight into outstanding questions in neuroscience. We highlight the challenges and opportunities of Patch-seq in neuroscience and hope to shed new light on future neuroscience research.",38123823,,10.1007/s10571-023-01436-3,0
Identifying cell populations with scRNASeq,"Single-cell RNASeq (scRNASeq) has emerged as a powerful method for quantifying the transcriptome of individual cells. However, the data from scRNASeq experiments is often both noisy and high dimensional, making the computational analysis non-trivial. Here we provide an overview of different experimental protocols and the most popular methods for facilitating the computational analysis. We focus on approaches for identifying biologically important genes, projecting data into lower dimensions and clustering data into putative cell-populations.

This resource offers diverse functional modules to address key cancer research questions at multiple levels, including the screening of tumor cell types, metabolic features, cell communication and gene expression patterns within the tumor microenvironment. Moreover, SCAR enables the analysis of biomarker expression patterns and cell developmental trajectories. SCAR also provides a comprehensive analysis of multi-dimensional datasets based on 34 state-of-the-art omics techniques, serving as an essential tool for in-depth mining and understanding of cell heterogeneity and spatial location. The implications of this resource extend to both cancer biology research and cancer immunotherapy development.",37739405,PMC10767865,10.1093/nar/gkad753,2
Single-cell and spatial transcriptomics approaches of cardiovascular development and disease,"Recent advancements in the resolution and throughput of single-cell analyses, including single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), have achieved significant progress in biomedical research in the last decade. These techniques have been used to understand cellular heterogeneity by identifying many rare and novel cell types and characterizing subpopulations of cells that make up organs and tissues. Analysis across various datasets can elucidate temporal patterning in gene expression and developmental cues and is also employed to examine the response of cells to acute injury, damage, or disruption. Specifically, scRNA-seq and spatially resolved transcriptomics have been used to describe the identity of novel or rare cell subpopulations and transcriptional variations that are related to normal and pathological conditions in mammalian models and human tissues. These applications have critically contributed to advance basic cardiovascular research in the past decade by identifying novel cell types implicated in development and disease.

Human organomics: a fresh approach to understanding human development using single-cell transcriptomics,"Innovative methods designed to recapitulate human organogenesis from pluripotent stem cells provide a means to explore human developmental biology. New technologies to sequence and analyze single-cell transcriptomes can deconstruct these 'organoids' into constituent parts, and reconstruct lineage trajectories during cell differentiation. In this Spotlight article we summarize the different approaches to performing single-cell transcriptomics on organoids, and discuss the opportunities and challenges of applying these techniques to generate organ-level, mechanistic models of human development and disease.

Single-Cell Transcriptome Analysis Revealed Heterogeneity and Identified Novel Therapeutic Targets for Breast Cancer Subtypes,"Breast cancer (BC) is a heterogeneous disease, which is primarily classified according to hormone receptors and HER2 expression. Despite the many advances in BC diagnosis and management, the identification of novel actionable therapeutic targets expressed by cancerous cells has always been a daunting task due to the large heterogeneity of the disease and the presence of non-cancerous cells (i.e., immune cells and stromal cells) within the tumor microenvironment. In the current study, we employed computational algorithms to decipher the cellular composition of estrogen receptor-positive (ER+), HER2+, ER+HER2+, and triple-negative BC (TNBC) subtypes from a total of 49,899 single cells' publicly available transcriptomic data derived from 26 BC patients. Restricting the analysis to EPCAM+Lin-tumor epithelial cells, we identified the enriched gene sets in each BC molecular subtype. Integration of single-cell transcriptomic with CRISPR-Cas9 functional screen data identified 13 potential therapeutic targets for ER+, 44 potential therapeutic targets for HER2+, and 29 potential therapeutic targets for TNBC. Interestingly, several of the identified therapeutic targets outperformed the current standard of care for each BC subtype. Given the aggressive nature and lack of targeted therapies for TNBC, elevated expression of ENO1, FDPS, CCT6A, TUBB2A, and PGK1 predicted worse relapse-free survival (RFS) in basal BC (n= 442), while elevated expression of ENO1, FDPS, CCT6A, and PGK1 was observed in the most aggressive BLIS TNBC subtype. Mechanistically, targeted depletion of ENO1 and FDPS halted TNBC cell proliferation, colony formation, and organoid tumor growth under 3-dimensional conditions and increased cell death, suggesting their potential use as novel therapeutic targets for TNBC. Differential expression and gene set enrichment analysis in TNBC revealed enrichment in the cycle and mitosis functional categories in FDPShigh, while ENO1highwas associated with numerous functional categories, including cell cycle, glycolysis, and ATP metabolic processes. Taken together, our data are the first to unravel the unique gene signatures and to identify novel dependencies and therapeutic vulnerabilities for each BC molecular subtype, thus setting the foundation for the future development of more effective targeted therapies for BC.",37190091,PMC10137100,10.3390/cells12081182,3

Single Cell RNA-Seq: Cell Isolation and Data Analysis,"Single-cell RNA-sequencing technologies have revolutionized the way that researchers can interrogate cellular relationships and the level of detail by which tissue architecture can be characterized. Multiple cell capturing methods have been developed that, when coupled to next-generation sequencing, can yield cell-to-cell specific information regarding gene expression profiles. One of the commonalities between all of the cell capturing techniques to succeed is the necessity to submit samples with a high cell viability. In addition, these cells should have undergone minimal processing to limit induced stress responses so that their transcriptomes, when sequenced, closely reflect their transcriptomes in vivo at the time of isolation. Below we present a streamlined protocol to isolate fresh cells from tissues in vivo. We also share extensive notes to highlight considerations researchers should take into account before beginning their cell isolation protocol.",34913118,,10.1007/978-1-0716-1847-9_7,2
Single Cell Sequencing Analysis for Blood Tissue,"Single-cell sequencing is a technique based on sequencing genomic, transcriptomic and epigenomic analysis at the level of individual cells.

A Single-Cell Roadmap of Lineage Bifurcation in Human ESC Models of Embryonic Brain Development,"During human brain development, multiple signaling pathways generate diverse cell types with varied regional identities. Here, we integrate single-cell RNA sequencing and clonal analyses to reveal lineage trees and molecular signals underlying early forebrain and mid/hindbrain cell differentiation from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). Clustering single-cell transcriptomic data identified 41 distinct populations of progenitor, neuronal, and non-neural cells across our differentiation time course. Comparisons with primary mouse and human gene expression data demonstrated rostral and caudal progenitor and neuronal identities from early brain development. Bayesian analyses inferred a unified cell-type lineage tree that bifurcates between cortical and mid/hindbrain cell types. Two methods of clonal analyses confirmed these findings and further revealed the importance of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in controlling this lineage decision. Together, these findings provide a rich transcriptome-based lineage map for studying human brain development and modeling developmental disorders.",28094016,PMC5261831,10.1016/j.stem.2016.09.011,69
Single cell transcriptomics: moving towards multi-omics,"As the basic units of life, cells present dramatic heterogeneity which, although crucial to an organism's behavior, is undetected by bulk analysis. Recently, much attention has been paid to reveal cellular types and states at the single-cell level including genome, transcriptome, epigenome or proteome-based on sequencing and immunological methods, etc. Among these approaches, transcriptomic analysis provides knowledge of the molecular linkages between genetic information and the proteome, leading to a comprehensive understanding of biological processes and diseases. Compared to single-dimensional inspection, multi-dimensional analysis combines the transcriptome with other ""omics"" to enable a comprehensive understanding of single-cell processes and functions. Moreover, compared to separate observations or single snapshots, spatial dimension and lineage time tracing can provide a more multifaceted understanding of the micro-environment and dynamic processes. In this review, we will introduce current transcriptomic analysis methods, as well as their combination with other omics methods including genomic, proteomic, and epigenetic approaches.

Differential Expression Analysis in Single-Cell Transcriptomics,"Differential expression analysis is an important aspect of bulk RNA sequencing (RNAseq). A lot of tools are available, and among them DESeq2 and edgeR are widely used. Since single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) expression data are zero inflated, single-cell data are quite different from those generated by conventional bulk RNA sequencing. Comparative analysis of tools used to detect differentially expressed genes between two groups of single cells showed that edgeR with quasi-likelihood F-test (QLF) outperforms other methods.In bulk RNAseq, differential expression is mainly used to compare limited number of replicates of two or more biological conditions. However, scRNAseq differential expression analysis might be also instrumental to identify the main players of cells subpopulation organization, thus requiring the use of multiple comparisons tools. Nowadays, edgeR is one of the few tools that are able to handle both zero inflated matrices and multiple comparisons. Here, we provide a guide to the use of edgeR as a tool to detect differential expression in single-cell data.",31028652,,10.1007/978-1-4939-9240-9_25,11
Single-cell analysis of nonhuman primate preimplantation development in comparison to humans and mice,"Background:Genetic programs underlying preimplantation development and early lineage segregation are highly conserved across mammals. It has been suggested that nonhuman primates would be better model organisms for human embryogenesis, but a limited number of studies have investigated the monkey preimplantation development. In this study, we collect single cells from cynomolgus monkey preimplantation embryos for transcriptome profiling and compare with single-cell RNA-seq data derived from human and mouse embryos.Results:By weighted gene-coexpression network analysis, we found that cynomolgus gene networks have greater conservation with human embryos including a greater number of conserved hub genes than that of mouse embryos. Consistently, we found that early ICM/TE lineage-segregating genes in monkeys exhibit greater similarity with human when compared to mouse, so are the genes in signaling pathways such as LRP1 and TCF7 involving in WNT pathway. Last, we tested the role of one conserved pre-EGA hub gene, SIN3A, using a morpholino knockdown of maternal RNA transcripts in monkey embryos followed by single-cell RNA-seq. We found that SIN3A knockdown disrupts the gene-silencing program during the embryonic genome activation transition and results in developmental delay of cynomolgus embryos.Conclusion:Taken together, our study provided new insight into evolutionarily conserved and divergent transcriptome dynamics during mammalian preimplantation development.",33449399,,10.1002/dvdy.295,2

Single-cell network biology for resolving cellular heterogeneity in human diseases,"Understanding cellular heterogeneity is the holy grail of biology and medicine. Cells harboring identical genomes show a wide variety of behaviors in multicellular organisms. Genetic circuits underlying cell-type identities will facilitate the understanding of the regulatory programs for differentiation and maintenance of distinct cellular states. Such a cell-type-specific gene network can be inferred from coregulatory patterns across individual cells. Conventional methods of transcriptome profiling using tissue samples provide only average signals of diverse cell types. Therefore, reconstructing gene regulatory networks for a particular cell type is not feasible with tissue-based transcriptome data. Recently, single-cell omics technology has emerged and enabled the capture of the transcriptomic landscape of every individual cell. Although single-cell gene expression studies have already opened up new avenues, network biology using single-cell transcriptome data will further accelerate our understanding of cellular heterogeneity. In this review, we provide an overview of single-cell network biology and summarize recent progress in method development for network inference from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. Then, we describe how cell-type-specific gene networks can be utilized to study regulatory programs specific to disease-associated cell types and cellular states.

Single-Cell Antibody Sequencing in Atherosclerosis Research,"The transcriptomic information obtained by single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) can be supplemented by information on the cell surface phenotype by using oligonucleotide-tagged monoclonal antibodies (scAb-Seq). This is of particular importance in immune cells, where the correlation between mRNA and cell surface expression is very weak. scAb-Seq is facilitated by the availability of commercial antibodies and antibody mixes. Now panels of up to 200 antibodies are available for human and mouse cells. Proteins are detected by antibodies conjugated to a tripartite DNA sequence that contains a primer for amplification and sequencing, a unique oligonucleotide that acts as an antibody barcode and a poly(dA) sequence, simultaneously detecting extension of antibody-specific DNA sequences and cDNAs in the same poly(dT)-primed reaction. For each cell, surface protein expression is captured and sequenced along with the cell's transcriptome. Here, we list the steps needed to produce antibody sequencing data from tissue or blood cells.",35238000,PMC10155217,10.1007/978-1-0716-1924-7_46,2
Cell-specific gene association network construction from single-cell RNA sequence,"The recent development of a high throughput single-cell RNA sequence devises the opportunity to study entire transcriptomes in the smallest detail. It also leads to the characterization of molecules and subtypes of a cell. Cancer epigenetics induced not only from individual molecules but also from the dysfunction of the system and the coupling effect of genes. While rapid advances are being made in the development of tools for single-cell RNA-seq data analysis, few slants are noticed in the potential advantages of single-cell network construction.Here, we used network perturbation theory with significant analysis to develop a cell-specific network that provides an insight into gene-gene association based on molecular expressions in a single-cell resolution. Besides, using this method, we can characterize each cell by inspecting how genes are connected and can identify the hub genes using network degree theory. Pathway & Gene enrichment analysis of the identified cell-specific high network degree genes supported the effectiveness of this method. This method could be beneficial for personalized drug design and even therapeutics.",34530677,PMC8794512,10.1080/15384101.2021.1978265,1
Single-cell and spatial transcriptomics during human organogenesis,"The molecular and cellular events that occur during the onset of human organogenesis remain mysterious. We used single-cell and spatial transcriptomics to provide a global view of human embryonic cell-type specification, shedding light on developmental processes such as axial patterning, stage transition, and differences between human and mouse embryonic development.",36949166,PMC10032247,10.1038/s41556-023-01113-z,0
Kernel-based testing for single-cell differential analysis,"Single-cell technologies offer insights into molecular feature distributions, but comparing them poses challenges. We propose a kernel-testing framework for non-linear cell-wise distribution comparison, analyzing gene expression and epigenomic modifications. Our method allows feature-wise and global transcriptome/epigenome comparisons, revealing cell population heterogeneities. Using a classifier based on embedding variability, we identify transitions in cell states, overcoming limitations of traditional single-cell analysis. Applied to single-cell ChIP-Seq data, our approach identifies untreated breast cancer cells with an epigenomic profile resembling persister cells. This demonstrates the effectiveness of kernel testing in uncovering subtle population variations that might be missed by other methods.",38702740,PMC11069218,10.1186/s13059-024-03255-1,0
Single-Cell Sequencing Methodologies: From Transcriptome to Multi-Dimensional Measurement,"Cells are the basic building blocks of biological systems, with inherent unique molecular features and development trajectories. The study of single cells facilitates in-depth understanding of cellular diversity, disease processes, and organization of multicellular organisms. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies have become essential tools for the interrogation of gene expression patterns and the dynamics of single cells, allowing cellular heterogeneity to be dissected at unprecedented resolution. Nevertheless, measuring at only transcriptome level or 1D is incomplete; the cellular heterogeneity reflects in multiple dimensions, including the genome, epigenome, transcriptome, spatial, and even temporal dimensions. Hence, integrative single cell analysis is highly desired. In addition, the way to interpret sequencing data by virtue of bioinformatic tools also exerts critical roles in revealing differential gene expression. Here, a comprehensive review that summarizes the cutting-edge single-cell transcriptome sequencing methodologies, including scRNA-seq, spatial and temporal transcriptome profiling, multi-omics sequencing and computational methods developed for scRNA-seq data analysis is provided.

The recent advances in microfluidic technologies have greatly accelerated the development of single-cell transcriptomics with regard to throughput, sensitivity, cost, and automation. In this article, we review state-of-the-art microfluidic single-cell transcriptomics, with a focus on the methodologies. We first summarize six typical microfluidic platforms for isolation and transcriptomic analysis of single cells. Then the on-going trend of microfluidic transcriptomics towards multimodal omics, which integrates transcriptomics with other omics to provide more comprehensive pictures of gene expression networks, is discussed.

Cell type identification from single-cell transcriptomes in melanoma,"Background:Single-cell sequencing approaches allow gene expression to be measured at the single-cell level, providing opportunities and challenges to study the aetiology of complex diseases, including cancer.Methods:Based on single-cell gene and lncRNA expression levels, we proposed a computational framework for cell type identification that fully considers cell dropout characteristics. First, we defined the dropout features of the cells and identified the dropout clusters. Second, we constructed a differential co-expression network and identified differential modules. Finally, we identified cell types based on the differential modules.Results:The method was applied to single-cell melanoma data, and eight cell types were identified. Enrichment analysis of the candidate cell marker genes for the two key cell types showed that both key cell types were closely related to the physiological activities of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC); one key cell type was associated with mitosis-related activities, and the other with pathways related to ten diseases.Conclusions:Through identification and analysis of key melanoma-related cell types, we explored the molecular mechanism of melanoma, providing insight into melanoma research. Moreover, the candidate cell markers for the two key cell types are potential therapeutic targets for melanoma.",34784909,PMC8596920,10.1186/s12920-021-01118-3,0
Using Single-Cell and Spatial Transcriptomes to Understand Stem Cell Lineage Specification During Early Embryo Development,"Embryonic development and stem cell differentiation provide a paradigm to understand the molecular regulation of coordinated cell fate determination and the architecture of tissue patterning. Emerging technologies such as single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics are opening new avenues to dissect cell organization, the divergence of morphological and molecular properties, and lineage allocation. Rapid advances in experimental and computational tools have enabled researchers to make many discoveries and revisit old hypotheses.

Impact of single-cell RNA sequencing on understanding immune regulation,"Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), one of the most powerful technologies, can describe the transcriptomic heterogeneity of single cells and reveal previously unreported cell types or states in complex tissues. With the rapid development of scRNA-seq, it has renewed our view of cellular heterogeneity and its significance for deeply understanding cell development and function. There are a large number of studies applying scRNA-seq to investigate the heterogeneity of immune cells and disease pathogenesis, focusing on differences among every individual cell, which have provided novel inspiration for disease therapy and biological processes.

"Single cell transcriptome analysis of human, marmoset and mouse embryos reveals common and divergent features of preimplantation development","The mouse embryo is the canonical model for mammalian preimplantation development. Recent advances in single cell profiling allow detailed analysis of embryogenesis in other eutherian species, including human, to distinguish conserved from divergent regulatory programs and signalling pathways in the rodent paradigm. Here, we identify and compare transcriptional features of human, marmoset and mouse embryos by single cell RNA-seq. Zygotic genome activation correlates with the presence of polycomb repressive complexes in all three species, while ribosome biogenesis emerges as a predominant attribute in primate embryos, supporting prolonged translation of maternally deposited RNAs. We find that transposable element expression signatures are species, stage and lineage specific. The pluripotency network in the primate epiblast lacks certain regulators that are operative in mouse, but encompasses WNT components and genes associated with trophoblast specification. Sequential activation of GATA6, SOX17 and GATA4 markers of primitive endoderm identity is conserved in primates. Unexpectedly, OTX2 is also associated with primitive endoderm specification in human and non-human primate blastocysts. Our cross-species analysis demarcates both conserved and primate-specific features of preimplantation development, and underscores the molecular adaptability of early mammalian embryogenesis.",30413530,PMC6240320,10.1242/dev.167833,90
High-resolution single-cell transcriptomic survey of cardiomyocytes from patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a common inherited cardiovascular disease, which can cause heart failure and lead to death. In this study, we performed high-resolution single-cell RNA-sequencing of 2115 individual cardiomyocytes obtained from HCM patients and normal controls. Signature up- and down-regulated genes in HCM were identified by integrative analysis across 37 patients and 41 controls from our data and published human single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-seq datasets, which were further classified into gene modules by single-cell co-expression analysis. Using our high-resolution dataset, we also investigated the heterogeneity among individual cardiomyocytes and revealed five distinct clusters within HCM cardiomyocytes. Interestingly, we showed that some extracellular matrix (ECM) genes were up-regulated in the HCM cardiomyocytes, suggesting that they play a role in cardiac remodelling. Taken together, our study comprehensively profiled the transcriptomic programs of HCM cardiomyocytes and provided insights into molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of HCM.",37766635,PMC10905351,10.1111/cpr.13557,0
Single-Cell RNA Sequencing of Human Embryonic Stem Cell Differentiation Delineates Adverse Effects of Nicotine on Embryonic Development,"Nicotine, the main chemical constituent of tobacco, is highly detrimental to the developing fetus by increasing the risk of gestational complications and organ disorders. The effects of nicotine on human embryonic development and related mechanisms, however, remain poorly understood. Here, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived embryoid body (EB) in the presence or absence of nicotine. Nicotine-induced lineage-specific responses and dysregulated cell-to-cell communication in EBs, shedding light on the adverse effects of nicotine on human embryonic development. In addition, nicotine reduced cell viability, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), and altered cell cycling in EBs. Abnormal Ca2+signaling was found in muscle cells upon nicotine exposure, as verified in hESC-derived cardiomyocytes. Consequently, our scRNA-seq data suggest direct adverse effects of nicotine on hESC differentiation at the single-cell level and offer a new method for evaluating drug and environmental toxicity on human embryonic development in utero.",30827876,PMC6449785,10.1016/j.stemcr.2019.01.022,21
Encoding Method of Single-cell Spatial Transcriptomics Sequencing,"Despite significant advances in parallel single-cell RNA sequencing revealing astonishing cellular heterogeneity in many tissue types, the spatial information in the tissue context remains missing. Spatial transcriptome sequencing technology is designed to distinguish the gene expression of individual cells in their original location. The technology is important for the identification of tissue function, tracking developmental processes, and pathological and molecular detection. Encoding the position information is the key to spatial transcriptomics because different methods have different encoding efficiencies and application scenarios. In this review, we focus on the latest technologies of single-cell spatial transcriptomics, including technologies based on microwell plates, barcoded bead arrays, microdissection,in situhybridization, and barcodein situtargeting, as well as mixed separation-based technologies. Moreover, we compare these encoding methods for use as a reference when choosing the appropriate technology.",32792863,PMC7415427,10.7150/ijbs.43887,9
"Single-cell transcriptome analysis of CAR T-cell products reveals subpopulations, stimulation, and exhaustion signatures","Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell adoptive therapy is set to transform the treatment of a rapidly expanding range of malignancies. Although the activation process of normal T cells is well characterized, comparatively little is known about the activation of cells via the CAR. Here we have used flow cytometry together with single-cell transcriptome profiling to characterize the starting material (peripheral blood mononuclear cells) and CAR therapeutic products of 3 healthy donors in the presence and absence of antigen-specific stimulation. Analysis of 53,191 single-cell transcriptomes showed APRIL-based CAR products to contain several subpopulations of cells, with cellular composition reproducible from donor to donor, and all major cellular subsets compatible with CAR expression. Only 50% of CAR-expressing cells displayed transcriptional changes upon CAR-specific antigen exposure. The resulting molecular signature for CAR T-cell activation provides a rich resource for future dissection of underlying mechanisms. Targeted data interrogation also revealed that a small proportion of antigen-responding CAR-expressing cells displayed an exhaustion signature, with both known markers and genes not previously associated with T-cell exhaustion. Comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic analysis thus represents a powerful way to guide the assessment and optimization of clinical-grade CAR-T-cells, and inform future research into the underlying molecular processes.",33489472,PMC7801130,10.1080/2162402X.2020.1866287,14
Single-Cell RNA Sequencing for Plant Research: Insights and Possible Benefits,"In recent years, advances in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies have continued to change our views on biological systems by increasing the spatiotemporal resolution of our analysis to single-cell resolution. Application of scRNA-seq to plants enables the comprehensive characterization of both common and rare cell types and cell states, uncovering new cell types and revealing how cell types relate to each other spatially and developmentally. This review provides an overview of scRNA-seq methodologies, highlights the application of scRNA-seq in plant science, justifies why scRNA-seq is a master player of sequencing, and explains the role of single-cell transcriptomics technologies in environmental stress adaptation, alongside the challenges and prospects of single-cell transcriptomics.

scPlant: A versatile framework for single-cell transcriptomic data analysis in plants,"Single-cell transcriptomics has been fully embraced in plant biological research and is revolutionizing our understanding of plant growth, development, and responses to external stimuli. However, single-cell transcriptomic data analysis in plants is not trivial, given that there is currently no end-to-end solution and that integration of various bioinformatics tools involves a large number of required dependencies. Here, we present scPlant, a versatile framework for exploring plant single-cell atlases with minimum input data provided by users. The scPlant pipeline is implemented with numerous functions for diverse analytical tasks, ranging from basic data processing to advanced demands such as cell-type annotation and deconvolution, trajectory inference, cross-species data integration, and cell-type-specific gene regulatory network construction. In addition, a variety of visualization tools are bundled in a built-in Shiny application, enabling exploration of single-cell transcriptomic data on the fly.",37254480,PMC10504592,10.1016/j.xplc.2023.100631,2
Into the multiverse: advances in single-cell multiomic profiling,"Single-cell transcriptomic approaches have revolutionised the study of complex biological systems, with the routine measurement of gene expression in thousands of cells enabling construction of whole-organism cell atlases. However, the transcriptome is just one layer amongst many that coordinate to define cell type and state and, ultimately, function. In parallel with the widespread uptake of single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq), there has been a rapid emergence of methods that enable multiomic profiling of individual cells, enabling parallel measurement of intercellular heterogeneity in the genome, epigenome, transcriptome, and proteomes. Linking measurements from each of these layers has the potential to reveal regulatory and functional mechanisms underlying cell behaviour in healthy development and disease.",35537880,,10.1016/j.tig.2022.03.015,30
Identification of Cell Types from Single-Cell Transcriptomic Data,"Unprecedented technological advances in single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology have now made it possible to profile genome-wide expression in single cells at low cost and high throughput. There is substantial ongoing effort to use scRNA-seq measurements to identify the ""cell types"" that form components of a complex tissue, akin to taxonomizing species in ecology. Cell type classification from scRNA-seq data involves the application of computational tools rooted in dimensionality reduction and clustering, and statistical analysis to identify molecular signatures that are unique to each type. As datasets continue to grow in size and complexity, computational challenges abound, requiring analytical methods to be scalable, flexible, and robust. Moreover, careful consideration needs to be paid to experimental biases and statistical challenges that are unique to these measurements to avoid artifacts. This chapter introduces these topics in the context of cell-type identification, and outlines an instructive step-by-step example bioinformatic pipeline for researchers entering this field.",30758819,,10.1007/978-1-4939-9057-3_4,9
Single-cell transcriptomics analysis of cellular heterogeneity and immune mechanisms in neurodegenerative diseases,"Single-cell transcriptomics analysis is an advanced technology that can describe the intracellular transcriptome in complex tissues. It profiles and analyses datasets by single-cell RNA sequencing. Neurodegenerative diseases are identified by the abnormal apoptosis of neurons in the brain with few or no effective therapy strategies at present, which has been a growing healthcare concern and brought a great burden to society. The transcriptome of individual cells provides deep insights into previously unforeseen cellular heterogeneity and gene expression differences in neurodegenerative disorders. It detects multiple cell subsets and functional changes during pathological progression, which deepens the understanding of the molecular underpinnings and cellular basis of neurodegenerative diseases. Furthermore, the transcriptome analysis of immune cells shows the regulation of immune response. Different subtypes of immune cells and their interaction are found to contribute to disease progression. This finding enables the discovery of novel targets and biomarkers for early diagnosis. In this review, we emphasize the principles of the technology, and its recent progress in the study of cellular heterogeneity and immune mechanisms in neurodegenerative diseases. The application of single-cell transcriptomics analysis in neurodegenerative disorders would help explore the pathogenesis of these diseases and develop novel therapeutic methods.",38221677,,10.1111/ejn.16242,0
Single-Cell and Spatial Transcriptome Analysis of Dermal Fibroblast Development in Perinatal Mouse Skin: Dynamic Lineage Differentiation and Key Driver Genes,"Several single-cell RNA studies of developing mouse skin have elucidated the molecular and cellular processes involved in skin development. However, they have primarily focused on either the fetal or early postnatal period, leaving a gap in our understanding of skin development. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive time-series analysis by combining single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets collected at different stages of development (embryonic days 13.5, 14.5, and 16.5 and postnatal days 0, 2, and 4) and validated our findings through multipanel in situ spatial transcriptomics. Our analysis indicated that embryonic fibroblasts exhibit heterogeneity from a very early stage and that the rapid determination of each lineage occurs within days after birth. The expression of putative key driver genes, including Hey1, Ebf1, Runx3, and Sox11 for the dermal papilla trajectory; Lrrc15 for the dermal sheath trajectory; Zfp536 and Nrn1 for the papillary fibroblast trajectory; and Lrrn4cl and Mfap5 for the fascia fibroblast trajectory, was detected in the corresponding, spatially identified cell types. Finally, cell-to-cell interaction analysis indicated that the dermal papilla lineage is the primary source of the noncanonical Wnt pathway during skin development. Together, our study provides a transcriptomic reference for future research in the field of skin development and regeneration.",38072389,,10.1016/j.jid.2023.11.008,0
Dissecting the Global Dynamic Molecular Profiles of Human Fetal Kidney Development by Single-Cell RNA Sequencing,"Healthy renal function depends on normal nephrogenesis during embryonic development. However, a comprehensive gene expression profile of human fetal kidney development remains largely unexplored. Here, using a single-cell RNA-sequencing technique, we analyzed >3,000 human fetal renal cells spanning 4 months of development in utero. Unsupervised analysis identified two progenitor subtypes during cap mesenchyme development, suggesting a mechanism for sustaining their progenitor states. Furthermore, we identified critical transcriptional regulators and signaling pathways involved in the segmentation of nephron tubules. We explored the development of the highly heterogeneous collecting duct epithelia and dissected the metabolic gene repertoire and the extracellular matrix composition of the glomerular mesangium. The results provide insights on the molecular basis and regulatory events in human renal development. Moreover, the cell-type-specific expression features of causal genes in congenital renal diseases may be helpful in the treatment of these diseases.",30257215,,10.1016/j.celrep.2018.08.056,49
Pathway centric analysis for single-cell RNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics data with GSDensity,"Advances in single-cell technology have enabled molecular dissection of heterogeneous biospecimens at unprecedented scales and resolutions. Cluster-centric approaches are widely applied in analyzing single-cell data, however they have limited power in dissecting and interpreting highly heterogenous, dynamically evolving data. Here, we present GSDensity, a graph-modeling approach that allows users to obtain pathway-centric interpretation and dissection of single-cell and spatial transcriptomics (ST) data without performing clustering. Using pathway gene sets, we show that GSDensity can accurately detect biologically distinct cells and reveal novel cell-pathway associations ignored by existing methods. Moreover, GSDensity, combined with trajectory analysis can identify curated pathways that are active at various stages of mouse brain development. Finally, GSDensity can identify spatially relevant pathways in mouse brains and human tumors including those following high-order organizational patterns in the ST data. Particularly, we create a pan-cancer ST map revealing spatially relevant and recurrently active pathways across six different tumor types.",38110427,PMC10728201,10.1038/s41467-023-44206-x,2
Single-Cell Tagged Reverse Transcription (STRT-Seq),"Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has become an established approach to profile entire transcriptomes of individual cells from different cell types, tissues, species, and organisms.

Robust single-cell matching and multimodal analysis using shared and distinct features,"The ability to align individual cellular information from multiple experimental sources is fundamental for a systems-level understanding of biological processes. However, currently available tools are mainly designed for single-cell transcriptomics matching and integration, and generally rely on a large number of shared features across datasets for cell matching. This approach underperforms when applied to single-cell proteomic datasets due to the limited number of parameters simultaneously accessed and lack of shared markers across these experiments. Here, we introduce a cell-matching algorithm, matching with partial overlap (MARIO) that accounts for both shared and distinct features, while consisting of vital filtering steps to avoid suboptimal matching. MARIO accurately matches and integrates data from different single-cell proteomic and multimodal methods, including spatial techniques and has cross-species capabilities. MARIO robustly matched tissue macrophages identified from COVID-19 lung autopsies via codetection by indexing imaging to macrophages recovered from COVID-19 bronchoalveolar lavage fluid by cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing, revealing unique immune responses within the lung microenvironment of patients with COVID.",36624212,PMC9911356,10.1038/s41592-022-01709-7,10

Single-cell technologies to study the immune system,"The immune system is composed of a variety of cells that act in a coordinated fashion to protect the organism against a multitude of different pathogens. The great variability of existing pathogens corresponds to a similar high heterogeneity of the immune cells. The study of individual immune cells, the fundamental unit of immunity, has recently transformed from a qualitative microscopic imaging to a nearly complete quantitative transcriptomic analysis. This shift has been driven by the rapid development of multiple single-cell technologies. These new advances are expected to boost the detection of less frequent cell types and transient or intermediate cell states. They will highlight the individuality of each single cell and greatly expand the resolution of current available classifications and differentiation trajectories. In this review we discuss the recent advancement and application of single-cell technologies, their limitations and future applications to study the immune system.",26551575,PMC4717243,10.1111/imm.12553,35
Elucidating memory in the brain via single-cell transcriptomics,"Elucidating the neural mechanisms of memory in the brain is a central goal of neuroscience. Here, we discuss modern-day transcriptomics methodologies, and how they are well-poised to revolutionize our insight into memory mechanisms at unprecedented resolution and throughput. Focusing on the hippocampus and amygdala, two regions extensively examined in memory research, we show how single-cell transcriptomics technologies have been leveraged to understand the naïve state of these brain regions. Building upon this foundation, we show that these technologies can be applied to single-trial learning paradigms to comprehensively identify molecules and cells that participate in the encoding and retrieval of memory. Transcriptomics also provides an opportunity to understand the cell-type organization of the human hippocampus and amygdala, and due to conservation of these brain regions between humans and rodents, to infer behavioral and causal contributions in the human brain by leveraging rodent cell-type homologies and interventions. Ultimately, such transcriptomic technologies are poised to usher in a qualitatively novel understanding of memory in the brain.",33230878,,10.1111/jnc.15250,4
HelPredictor models single-cell transcriptome to predict human embryo lineage allocation,"The in-depth understanding of cellular fate decision of human preimplantation embryos has prompted investigations on how changes in lineage allocation, which is far from trivial and remains a time-consuming task by experimental methods. It is desirable to develop a novel effective bioinformatics strategy to consider transitions of coordinated embryo lineage allocation and stage-specific patterns. There are rapidly growing applications of machine learning models to interpret complex datasets for identifying candidate development-related factors and lineage-determining molecular events. Here we developed the first machine learning platform, HelPredictor, that integrates three feature selection methods, namely, principal components analysis, F-score algorithm and squared coefficient of variation, and four classical machine learning classifiers that different combinations of methods and classifiers have independent outputs by increment feature selection method. With application to single-cell sequencing data of human embryo, HelPredictor not only achieved 94.9% and 90.9% respectively with cross-validation and independent test, but also fast classified different embryonic lineages and their development trajectories using less HelPredictor-predicted factors. The above-mentioned candidate lineage-specific genes were discussed in detail and were clustered for exploring transitions of embryonic heterogeneity. Our tool can fast and efficiently reveal potential lineage-specific and stage-specific biomarkers and provide insights into how advanced computational tools contribute to development research.

SINGLE-CELL TRANSCRIPTOME ANALYSIS IN HEALTH AND DISEASE,"The analysis of the single-cell transcriptome has emerged as a powerful tool to gain insights on the basic mechanisms of health and disease. It is widely used to reveal the cellular diversity and complexity of tissues at cellular resolution by RNA sequencing of the whole transcriptome from a single cell. Equally, it is applied to discover an unknown, rare population of cells in the tissue. The prime advantage of single-cell transcriptome analysis is the detection of stochastic nature of gene expression of the cell in tissue. Moreover, the availability of multiple platforms for the single-cell transcriptome has broadened its approaches to using cells of different sizes and shapes, including the capture of short or full-length transcripts, which is helpful in the analysis of challenging biological samples. And with the development of numerous packages in R and Python, new directions in the computational analysis of single-cell transcriptomes can be taken to characterize healthy versus diseased tissues to obtain novel pathological insights. Downstream analysis such as differential gene expression analysis, gene ontology term analysis, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis, cell-cell interaction analysis, and trajectory analysis has become standard practice in the workflow of single-cell transcriptome analysis to further examine the biology of different cell types. Here, we provide a broad overview of single-cell transcriptome analysis in health and disease conditions currently applied in various studies.",37962963,PMC10883422,10.1097/SHK.0000000000002274,0
MAGNETO: Cell type marker panel generator from single-cell transcriptomic data,"Single-cell RNA sequencing experiments produce data useful to identify different cell types, including uncharacterized and rare ones. This enables us to study the specific functional roles of these cells in different microenvironments and contexts. After identifying a (novel) cell type of interest, it is essential to build succinct marker panels, composed of a few genes referring to cell surface proteins and clusters of differentiation molecules, able to discriminate the desired cells from the other cell populations. In this work, we propose a fully-automatic framework called MAGNETO, which can help construct optimal marker panels starting from a single-cell gene expression matrix and a cell type identity for each cell. MAGNETO builds effective marker panels solving a tailored bi-objective optimization problem, where the first objective regards the identification of the genes able to isolate a specific cell type, while the second conflicting objective concerns the minimization of the total number of genes included in the panel. Our results on three public datasets show that MAGNETO can identify marker panels that identify the cell populations of interest better than state-of-the-art approaches. Finally, by fine-tuning MAGNETO, our results demonstrate that it is possible to obtain marker panels with different specificity levels.",37797704,,10.1016/j.jbi.2023.104510,0
Single-cell sequencing analysis within biologically relevant dimensions,"The currently predominant approach to transcriptomic and epigenomic single-cell analysis depends on a rigid perspective constrained by reduced dimensions and algorithmically derived and annotated clusters. Here, we developed Seqtometry (sequencing-to-measurement), a single-cell analytical strategy based on biologically relevant dimensions enabled by advanced scoring with multiple gene sets (signatures) for examination of gene expression and accessibility across various organ systems. By utilizing information only in the form of specific signatures, Seqtometry bypasses unsupervised clustering and individual annotations of clusters. Instead, Seqtometry combines qualitative and quantitative cell-type identification with specific characterization of diverse biological processes under experimental or disease conditions. Comprehensive analysis by Seqtometry of various immune cells as well as other cells from different organs and disease-induced states, including multiple myeloma and Alzheimer's disease, surpasses corresponding cluster-based analytical output. We propose Seqtometry as a single-cell sequencing analysis approach applicable for both basic and clinical research.",38198894,,10.1016/j.cels.2023.12.005,1
Neural cell diversity in the light of single-cell transcriptomics,"The development of highly parallel and affordable high-throughput single-cell transcriptomics technologies has revolutionized our understanding of brain complexity. These methods have been used to build cellular maps of the brain, its different regions, and catalog the diversity of cells in each of them during development, aging and even in disease. Now we know that cellular diversity is way beyond what was previously thought. Single-cell transcriptomics analyses have revealed that cell types previously considered homogeneous based on imaging techniques differ depending on several factors including sex, age and location within the brain. The expression profiles of these cells have also been exploited to understand which are the regulatory programs behind cellular diversity and decipher the transcriptional pathways driving them. In this review, we summarize how single-cell transcriptomics have changed our view on the cellular diversity in the human brain, and how it could impact the way we study neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, we describe the new computational approaches that can be used to study cellular differentiation and gain insight into the functions of individual cell populations under different conditions and their alterations in disease.",38229529,PMC10807474,10.1080/21541264.2023.2295044,1
Unraveling Psychiatric Disorders through Neural Single-Cell Transcriptomics Approaches,"The development of single-cell and single-nucleus transcriptome technologies is enabling the unraveling of the molecular and cellular heterogeneity of psychiatric disorders. The complexity of the brain and the relationships between different brain regions can be better understood through the classification of individual cell populations based on their molecular markers and transcriptomic features. Analysis of these unique cell types can explain their involvement in the pathology of psychiatric disorders. Recent studies in both human and animal models have emphasized the importance of transcriptome analysis of neuronal cells in psychiatric disorders but also revealed critical roles for non-neuronal cells, such as oligodendrocytes and microglia. In this review, we update current findings on the brain transcriptome and explore molecular studies addressing transcriptomic alterations identified in human and animal models in depression and stress, neurodegenerative disorders (Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease), schizophrenia, opioid use disorder, and alcohol and psychostimulant abuse. We also comment on potential future directions in single-cell and single-nucleus studies.",36981041,PMC10047992,10.3390/genes14030771,1
Isoform-resolved transcriptome of the human preimplantation embryo,"Human preimplantation development involves extensive remodeling of RNA expression and splicing. However, its transcriptome has been compiled using short-read sequencing data, which fails to capture most full-length mRNAs. Here, we generate an isoform-resolved transcriptome of early human development by performing long- and short-read RNA sequencing on 73 embryos spanning the zygote to blastocyst stages. We identify 110,212 unannotated isoforms transcribed from known genes, including highly conserved protein-coding loci and key developmental regulators. We further identify 17,964 isoforms from 5,239 unannotated genes, which are largely non-coding, primate-specific, and highly associated with transposable elements. These isoforms are widely supported by the integration of published multi-omics datasets, including single-cell 8CLC and blastoid studies. Alternative splicing and gene co-expression network analyses further reveal that embryonic genome activation is associated with splicing disruption and transient upregulation of gene modules. Together, these findings show that the human embryo transcriptome is far more complex than currently known, and will act as a valuable resource to empower future studies exploring development.",37903791,PMC10616205,10.1038/s41467-023-42558-y,4
Single-cell transcriptome profiling reveals molecular heterogeneity in human umbilical cord tissue and culture-expanded mesenchymal stem cells,"Human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (UMSCs) demonstrate great therapeutic potential in regenerative medicine. The use of UMSCs for clinical applications requires high quantity and good quality of cells usually by in vitro expansion. However, the heterogeneity and the characteristics of cultured UMSCs and the cognate human umbilical cord tissue at single-cell resolution remain poorly defined. In this study, we created a single-cell transcriptome profile of human umbilical cord tissue and the cognate culture-expanded UMSCs. Based on the inferred characteristics of cell clusters and trajectory analysis, we identified three subgroups in culture-expanded UMSCs and putative novel transcription factors (TFs) in regulating UMSC state transition. Further, putative ligand-receptor interaction analysis demonstrated that cellular interactions most frequently occurred in epithelial-like cells with other cell groups in umbilical cord tissue. Moreover, we dissected the transcriptomic differences of in vitro and in vivo subgroups and inferred the telomere-related molecules and pathways that might be activated in UMSCs for cell expansion in vitro. Our study provides a comprehensive and integrative study of the transcriptomics of human umbilical cord tissue and their cognate-cultured counterparts, which paves the way for a deeper understanding of cellular heterogeneity and offers fundamental biological insight of UMSCs-based cell therapy.",33763993,,10.1111/febs.15834,8
Understanding development and stem cells using single cell-based analyses of gene expression,"In recent years, genome-wide profiling approaches have begun to uncover the molecular programs that drive developmental processes. In particular, technical advances that enable genome-wide profiling of thousands of individual cells have provided the tantalizing prospect of cataloging cell type diversity and developmental dynamics in a quantitative and comprehensive manner.

Pathway trajectory analysis with tensor imputation reveals drug-induced single-cell transcriptomic landscape,"Genome-wide identification of single-cell transcriptomic responses of drugs in various human cells is a challenging issue in medical and pharmaceutical research. Here we present a computational method, tensor-based imputation of gene-expression data at the single-cell level (TIGERS), which reveals the drug-induced single-cell transcriptomic landscape. With this algorithm, we predict missing drug-induced single-cell gene-expression data with tensor imputation, and identify trajectories of regulated pathways considering intercellular heterogeneity. Tensor imputation outperformed existing imputation methods for data completion, and provided cell-type-specific transcriptomic responses for unobserved drugs. For example, TIGERS correctly predicted the cell-type-specific expression of maker genes for pancreatic islets. Pathway trajectory analysis of the imputed gene-expression profiles of all combinations of drugs and human cells identified single-cell-specific drug activities and pathway trajectories that reflect drug-induced changes in pathway regulation. The proposed method is expected to expand our understanding of the single-cell mechanisms of drugs at the pathway level.",38177364,PMC10768635,10.1038/s43588-022-00352-8,0
"Identifying a Lung Stem Cell Subpopulation by Combining Single-Cell Morphometrics, Organoid Culture, and Transcriptomics","Single-cell RNA sequencing is a valuable tool for dissecting cellular heterogeneity in complex systems. However, it is still challenging to estimate the proliferation and differentiation potentials of subpopulations within dormant tissue stem cells. Here, we established a new single-cell analysis method for profiling the organoid-forming capacity and differentiation potential of tissue stem cells to disclose stem cell subpopulations by integrating single-cell morphometrics, organoid-forming assay, and RNA sequencing, a method named scMORN. To explore lung epithelial stem cells, we initially developed feeder-free culture system, which could expand all major lung stem cells, including basal, club, and alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells, and found that club cells contained a subpopulation, which showed better survival rate and high proliferation capacity and could differentiate into alveolar cells. Using the scMORN method, we discovered a club cell subpopulation named Muc5b+ and large club (ML-club) cells that efficiently formed organoids than other club or AT2 cells in our feeder-free organoid culture and differentiated into alveolar cells in vitro. Single-cell transcriptome profiling and immunohistochemical analysis revealed that ML-club cells localized at the intrapulmonary proximal airway and distinct from known subpopulations of club cells such as BASCs. Furthermore, we identified CD14 as a cell surface antigen of ML-club cells and showed that purified CD14+ club cells engrafted into injured mouse lungs had better engraftment rate and expansion than other major lung stem cells, reflecting the observations in organoid culture systems. The scMORN method could be adapted to different stem cell tissues to discover useful stem-cell subpopulations.",37468433,PMC10427966,10.1093/stmcls/sxad044,1

Differential gene regulatory networks in development and disease,"Gene regulatory networks, in which differential expression of regulator genes induce differential expression of their target genes, underlie diverse biological processes such as embryonic development, organ formation and disease pathogenesis. An archetypical systems biology approach to mapping these networks involves the combined application of (1) high-throughput sequencing-based transcriptome profiling (RNA-seq) of biopsies under diverse network perturbations and (2) network inference based on gene-gene expression correlation analysis. The comparative analysis of such correlation networks across cell types or states, differential correlation network analysis, can identify specific molecular signatures and functional modules that underlie the state transition or have context-specific function. Here, we review the basic concepts of network biology and correlation network inference, and the prevailing methods for differential analysis of correlation networks. We discuss applications of gene expression network analysis in the context of embryonic development, cancer, and congenital diseases.",29018868,PMC11105524,10.1007/s00018-017-2679-6,37

Single neuron transcriptome analysis can reveal more than cell type classification: Does it matter if every neuron is unique?,"A recent single cell mRNA sequencing study by Dueck et al. compares neuronal transcriptomes to the transcriptomes of adipocytes and cardiomyocytes. Single cell omic approaches such as those used by the authors are at the leading edge of molecular and biophysical measurement. Many groups are currently employing single cell sequencing approaches to understand cellular heterogeneity in cancer and during normal development. These single cell approaches also are beginning to address long-standing questions regarding nervous system diversity. Beyond an innate interest in cataloging cell type diversity in the brain, single cell neuronal diversity has important implications for neurotypic neural circuit function and for neurological disease.

"Interactive, integrated analysis of single-cell transcriptomic and phylogenetic data with PhyloVision","Recent advances in CRISPR-Cas9 engineering and single-cell assays have enabled the simultaneous measurement of single-cell transcriptomic and phylogenetic profiles. However, there are few computational tools enabling users to integrate and derive insight from a joint analysis of these two modalities. Here, we describe ""PhyloVision"": an open-source software for interactively exploring data from both modalities and for identifying and interpreting heritable gene modules whose concerted expression are associated with phylogenetic relationships. PhyloVision provides a feature-rich, interactive, and shareable web-based report for investigating these modules while also supporting several other data and meta-data exploration capabilities. We demonstrate the utility of PhyloVision using a published dataset of metastatic lung adenocarcinoma cells, whose phylogeny was resolved using a CRISPR-Cas9-based lineage-tracing system. Together, we anticipate that PhyloVision and the methods it implements will be a useful resource for scalable and intuitive data exploration for any assay that simultaneously measures cell state and lineage.",35497495,PMC9046453,10.1016/j.crmeth.2022.100200,3
SC2sepsis: sepsis single-cell whole gene expression database,"Sepsis, one of the major challenges in the intensive care unit, is characterized by complex host immune status. Improved understandings of the phenotypic changes of immune cells during sepsis and the driving molecular mechanisms are critical to the elucidation of sepsis pathogenesis. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), which interprets transcriptome at a single-cell resolution, serves as a useful tool to uncover disease-related gene expression signatures of different cell populations in various diseases. It has also been applied to studies on sepsis immunopathological mechanisms. Due to the fact that most sepsis-related studies utilizing scRNA-seq have very small sample sizes and there is a lack of an scRNA-seq database for sepsis, we developed Sepsis Single-cell Whole Gene Expression Database Website (SC2sepsis) (http://www.rjh-sc2sepsis.com/), integrating scRNA-seq datasets of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 45 septic patients and 26 healthy controls, with a total amount of 232 226 cells. SC2sepsis is a comprehensive resource database with two major features: (i) retrieval of 1988 differentially expressed genes between pathological and healthy conditions and (ii) automatic cell-type annotation, which is expected to facilitate researchers to gain more insights into the immune dysregulation of sepsis.Database url:http://www.rjh-sc2sepsis.com/.",35980286,PMC9387141,10.1093/database/baac061,2
High-quality single-cell transcriptomics from ovarian histological sections during folliculogenesis,"High-quality, straightforward single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) with spatial resolution remains challenging. Here, we developed DRaqL (direct RNA recovery and quenching for laser capture microdissection), an experimental approach for efficient cell lysis of tissue sections, directly applicable to cDNA amplification. Single-cell RNA-seq combined with DRaqL allowed transcriptomic profiling from alcohol-fixed sections with efficiency comparable with that of profiling from freshly dissociated cells, together with effective exon-exon junction profiling. The combination of DRaqL with protease treatment enabled robust and efficient single-cell transcriptome analysis from formalin-fixed tissue sections. Applying this method to mouse ovarian sections, we were able to predict the transcriptome of oocytes by their size and identified an anomaly in the size-transcriptome relationship relevant to growth retardation of oocytes, in addition to detecting oocyte-specific splice isoforms. Furthermore, we identified differentially expressed genes in granulosa cells in association with their proximity to the oocytes, suggesting distinct epigenetic regulations and cell-cycle activities governing the germ-soma relationship. Thus, DRaqL is a versatile, efficient approach for high-quality single-cell RNA-seq from tissue sections, thereby revealing histological heterogeneity in folliculogenic transcriptome.",37722727,PMC10507249,10.26508/lsa.202301929,2

Comprehensive visualization of cell-cell interactions in single-cell and spatial transcriptomics with NICHES,"Motivation:Recent years have seen the release of several toolsets that reveal cell-cell interactions from single-cell data. However, all existing approaches leverage mean celltype gene expression values, and do not preserve the single-cell fidelity of the original data. Here, we present NICHES (Niche Interactions and Communication Heterogeneity in Extracellular Signaling), a tool to explore extracellular signaling at the truly single-cell level.Results:NICHES allows embedding of ligand-receptor signal proxies to visualize heterogeneous signaling archetypes within cell clusters, between cell clusters and across experimental conditions. When applied to spatial transcriptomic data, NICHES can be used to reflect local cellular microenvironment. NICHES can operate with any list of ligand-receptor signaling mechanisms, is compatible with existing single-cell packages, and allows rapid, flexible analysis of cell-cell signaling at single-cell resolution.Availability and implementation:NICHES is an open-source software implemented in R under academic free license v3.0 and it is available at http://github.com/msraredon/NICHES.

Novel insights from spatial transcriptome analysis in solid tumors,"Since its first application in 2016, spatial transcriptomics has become a rapidly evolving technology in recent years. Spatial transcriptomics enables transcriptomic data to be acquired from intact tissue sections and provides spatial distribution information and remedies the disadvantage of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), whose data lack spatially resolved information. Presently, spatial transcriptomics has been widely applied to various tissue types, especially for the study of tumor heterogeneity. In this review, we provide a summary of the research progress in utilizing spatial transcriptomics to investigate tumor heterogeneity and the microenvironment with a focus on solid tumors. We summarize the research breakthroughs in various fields and perspectives due to the application of spatial transcriptomics, including cell clustering and interaction, cellular metabolism, gene expression, immune cell programs and combination with other techniques. As a combination of multiple transcriptomics, single-cell multiomics shows its superiority and validity in single-cell analysis. We also discuss the application prospect of single-cell multiomics, and we believe that with the progress of data integration from various transcriptomics, a multilayered subcellular landscape will be revealed.",37781515,PMC10539699,10.7150/ijbs.83098,0
Assessing single-cell transcriptomic variability through density-preserving data visualization,"Nonlinear data visualization methods, such as t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) and uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP), summarize the complex transcriptomic landscape of single cells in two dimensions or three dimensions, but they neglect the local density of data points in the original space, often resulting in misleading visualizations where densely populated subsets of cells are given more visual space than warranted by their transcriptional diversity in the dataset. Here we present den-SNE and densMAP, which are density-preserving visualization tools based on t-SNE and UMAP, respectively, and demonstrate their ability to accurately incorporate information about transcriptomic variability into the visual interpretation of single-cell RNA sequencing data. Applied to recently published datasets, our methods reveal significant changes in transcriptomic variability in a range of biological processes, including heterogeneity in transcriptomic variability of immune cells in blood and tumor, human immune cell specialization and the developmental trajectory of Caenorhabditis elegans. Our methods are readily applicable to visualizing high-dimensional data in other scientific domains.",33462509,PMC8195812,10.1038/s41587-020-00801-7,34
Longitudinal profiling of human androgenotes through single-cell analysis unveils paternal gene expression dynamics in early embryo development,"Study question:How do transcriptomics vary in haploid human androgenote embryos at single cell level in the first four cell cycles of embryo development?Summary answer:Gene expression peaks at the fourth cell cycle, however some androcytes exhibit unique transcriptional behaviors.What is known already:The developmental potential of an embryo is determined by the competence of the oocyte and the sperm. However, studies of the contribution of the paternal genome using pure haploid androgenotes are very scarce.Study design, size, duration:This study was performed analyzing the single-cell transcriptomic sequencing of 38 androcytes obtained from 10 androgenote bioconstructs previously produced in vitro (de Castro et al., 2023). These results were analyzed through different bioinformatics software such as g: Profiler, GSEA, Cytoscape, and Reactome.Participants/materials, setting, methods:Single cell sequencing was used to obtain the transcriptomic profiles of the different androcytes. The results obtained were compared between the different cycles studied using the DESeq2 program and functional enrichment pathways using g: Profiler, Cytoscape, and Reactome.Main results and the role of chance:A wave of paternally driven transcriptomic activation was found during the third-cell cycle, with 1128 upregulated and 225 downregulated genes and the fourth-cell cycle, with 1373 upregulated and 286 downregulated genes, compared to first-cell cycle androcytes. Differentially expressed routes related to cell differentiation, DNA-binding transcription, RNA biosynthesis and RNA polymerase II transcription regulatory complex, and cell death were found in the third and fourth with respect to the first-cell cycle. Conversely, in the fourth cell cycle, 153 downregulated and 332 upregulated genes were found compared with third cell cycle, associated with differentially expressed processes related to E-box binding and zinc finger protein 652 (ZNF652) transcription factor. Further, significant overexpression of LEUTX, PRAMEF1, DUXA, RFPL4A, TRIM43, and ZNF675 found in androgenotes, compared to biparental embryos, highlights the paternal contributions to zygote genome activation.Large scale data:All raw sequencing data are available through the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under accessions number: GSE216501.Limitations, reasons for caution:Extrapolation of biological events from uniparental constructs to biparental embryos should be done with caution. Maternal and paternal genomes do not act independently of each other in a natural condition. The absence of one genome may affect gene transcription of the other. In this sense, the haploid condition of the bioconstructs could mask the transcriptomic patterns of the single cells.Wider implications of the findings:The results obtained demonstrated the level of involvement of the human paternal haploid genome in the early stages of embryo development as well as its evolution at the transcriptomic level, laying the groundwork for the use of these bioconstructs as reliable models to dispel doubts about the genetic role played by the paternal genome in the early cycles of embryo development.Study funding/competing interest(s):This study was funded by Instituto de Salud Carlos III (ISCIII) through the project 'PI22/00924', co-funded by European Regional Development Fund (ERDF); 'A way to make Europe'. F.D. was supported by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness through the Miguel Servet program (CPII018/00002).

Single-cell RNA sequencing to study vascular diversity and function,"Purpose of review:Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) can capture the transcriptional profile of thousands of individual cells concurrently from complex tissues and with remarkable resolution. Either with the goal of seeking information about distinct cell subtypes or responses to a stimulus, the approach has provided robust information and promoted impressive advances in cardiovascular research. The goal of this review is to highlight strategies and approaches to leverage this technology and bypass potential caveats related to evaluation of the vascular cells.Recent findings:As the most recent technological development, details associated with experimental strategies, analysis, and interpretation of scRNA-seq data are still being discussed and scrutinized by investigators across the vascular field. Compilation of this information is valuable for those using the technology but particularly important to those about to start utilizing scRNA-seq to seek transcriptome information of vascular cells.Summary:As our field progresses to catalog transcriptomes from distinct vascular beds, it is undeniable that scRNA-seq technology is here to stay.

A Bioinformatic Toolkit for Single-Cell mRNA Analysis,"The recent technological developments in the field of single-cell RNA-Seq enable us to assay the transcriptome of up to a million single cells in parallel. However, the analyses of such big datasets present a major challenge. During the last decade, a wide variety of strategies have been proposed covering different steps of the analysis. Here, we introduce a selection of computational tools to provide an overview of a generic analysis pipeline.The first step of every scRNA-Seq experiment is proper study design, which does not require sophisticated experimental or informatics skills but is nonetheless presumably the most important step. The quality of the resulting data strictly depends on the proper planning of the experiment, including the selection of the most suitable technology for the biological question of interest as well as an elaborated study design to minimize the influence of confounding factors. Once the experiment has been conducted, the raw sequencing data needs to be processed to extract the gene expression information for each cell. This task comprises quality assessment of the sequenced reads, alignment against a reference genome, demultiplexing of the cell barcodes, and quantification of the reads/transcripts per gene. As any other transcriptomics technology, single-cell mRNA-Seq requires data normalization to assure sample-to-sample, here cell-to-cell, comparability and the consideration of confounding factors.Once gene expression values have been extracted from the reads and normalized, the researcher has the agony of choosing between a plethora of analysis approaches to investigate diverse aspects of the single-cell transcriptomes, such as dimensionality reduction and clustering to explore cellular heterogeneity or trajectory analysis to model differentiation processes.In this chapter, we present a wrap-up of the abovementioned steps to conduct single-cell RNA-Seq analyses and present a selection of existing tools.",31028653,,10.1007/978-1-4939-9240-9_26,2
Predicting drug response from single-cell expression profiles of tumours,"Background:Intra-tumour heterogeneity (ITH) presents a significant obstacle in formulating effective treatment strategies in clinical practice. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has evolved as a powerful instrument for probing ITH at the transcriptional level, offering an unparalleled opportunity for therapeutic intervention.Results:Drug response prediction at the single-cell level is an emerging field of research that aims to improve the efficacy and precision of cancer treatments. Here, we introduce DREEP (Drug Response Estimation from single-cell Expression Profiles), a computational method that leverages publicly available pharmacogenomic screens from GDSC2, CTRP2, and PRISM and functional enrichment analysis to predict single-cell drug sensitivity from transcriptomic data. We validated DREEP extensively in vitro using several independent single-cell datasets with over 200 cancer cell lines and showed its accuracy and robustness.

Immune cell identifier and classifier (ImmunIC) for single cell transcriptomic readouts,"Single cell RNA sequencing has a central role in immune profiling, identifying specific immune cells as disease markers and suggesting therapeutic target genes of immune cells. Immune cell-type annotation from single cell transcriptomics is in high demand for dissecting complex immune signatures from multicellular blood and organ samples. However, accurate cell type assignment from single-cell RNA sequencing data alone is complicated by a high level of gene expression heterogeneity. Many computational methods have been developed to respond to this challenge, but immune cell annotation accuracy is not highly desirable. We present ImmunIC, a simple and robust tool for immune cell identification and classification by combining marker genes with a machine learning method. With over two million immune cells and half-million non-immune cells from 66 single cell RNA sequencing studies, ImmunIC shows 98% accuracy in the identification of immune cells. ImmunIC outperforms existing immune cell classifiers, categorizing into ten immune cell types with 92% accuracy. We determine peripheral blood mononuclear cell compositions of severe COVID-19 cases and healthy controls using previously published single cell transcriptomic data, permitting the identification of immune cell-type specific differential pathways. Our publicly available tool can maximize the utility of single cell RNA profiling by functioning as a stand-alone bioinformatic cell sorter, advancing cell-type specific immune profiling for the discovery of disease-specific immune signatures and therapeutic targets.",37495649,PMC10372073,10.1038/s41598-023-39282-4,0

The rise of single-cell transcriptomics in yeast,"The field of single-cell omics has transformed our understanding of biological processes and is constantly advancing both experimentally and computationally. One of the most significant developments is the ability to measure the transcriptome of individual cells by single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq), which was pioneered in higher eukaryotes. While yeast has served as a powerful model organism in which to test and develop transcriptomic technologies, the implementation of scRNA-seq has been significantly delayed in this organism, mainly because of technical constraints associated with its intrinsic characteristics, namely the presence of a cell wall, a small cell size and little amounts of RNA. In this review, we examine the current technologies for scRNA-seq in yeast and highlight their strengths and weaknesses. Additionally, we explore opportunities for developing novel technologies and the potential outcomes of implementing single-cell transcriptomics and extension to other modalities. Undoubtedly, scRNA-seq will be invaluable for both basic and applied yeast research, providing unique insights into fundamental biological processes.",38403881,,10.1002/yea.3934,0
Recent Advances in Developmental Hematopoiesis: Diving Deeper With New Technologies,"The journey of a hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) involves the passage through successive anatomical sites where HSCs are in direct contact with their surrounding microenvironment, also known as niche. These spatial and temporal cellular interactions throughout development are required for the acquisition of stem cell properties, and for maintaining the HSC pool through balancing self-renewal, quiescence and lineage commitment. Understanding the context and consequences of these interactions will be imperative for our understanding of HSC biology and will lead to the improvement ofin vitroproduction of HSCs for clinical purposes. The aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region is in this light of particular interest since this is the cradle of HSC emergence during the embryonic development of all vertebrate species. In this review, we will focus on the developmental origin of HSCs and will discuss the novel technological approaches and recent progress made to identify the cellular composition of the HSC supportive niche and the underlying molecular events occurring in the AGM region.",34899758,PMC8652083,10.3389/fimmu.2021.790379,11
Spatial Transcriptomics: Emerging Technologies in Tissue Gene Expression Profiling,"In this Perspective, we discuss the current status and advances in spatial transcriptomics technologies, which allow high-resolution mapping of gene expression in intact cell and tissue samples. Spatial transcriptomics enables the creation of high-resolution maps of gene expression patterns within their native spatial context, adding an extra layer of information to the bulk sequencing data. Spatial transcriptomics has expanded significantly in recent years and is making a notable impact on a range of fields, including tissue architecture, developmental biology, cancer, and neurodegenerative and infectious diseases. The latest advancements in spatial transcriptomics have resulted in the development of highly multiplexed methods, transcriptomic-wide analysis, and single-cell resolution utilizing diverse technological approaches. In this Perspective, we provide a detailed analysis of the molecular foundations behind the main spatial transcriptomics technologies, including methods based on microdissection,in situsequencing, single-molecule FISH, spatial capturing, selection of regions of interest, and single-cell or nuclei dissociation. We contextualize the detection and capturing efficiency, strengths, limitations, tissue compatibility, and applications of these techniques as well as provide information on data analysis.

scTPA: a web tool for single-cell transcriptome analysis of pathway activation signatures,"Motivation:At present, a fundamental challenge in single-cell RNA-sequencing data analysis is functional interpretation and annotation of cell clusters. Biological pathways in distinct cell types have different activation patterns, which facilitates the understanding of cell functions using single-cell transcriptomics. However, no effective web tool has been implemented for single-cell transcriptome data analysis based on prior biological pathway knowledge.Results:Here, we present scTPA, a web-based platform for pathway-based analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data in human and mouse. scTPA incorporates four widely-used gene set enrichment methods to estimate the pathway activation scores of single cells based on a collection of available biological pathways with different functional and taxonomic classifications. The clustering analysis and cell-type-specific activation pathway identification were provided for the functional interpretation of cell types from a pathway-oriented perspective. An intuitive interface allows users to conveniently visualize and download single-cell pathway signatures. Overall, scTPA is a comprehensive tool for the identification of pathway activation signatures for the analysis of single cell heterogeneity.Availability and implementation:http://sctpa.bio-data.cn/sctpa.Contact:sujz@wmu.edu.cn or yufulong421@gmail.com or zgj@zjut.edu.cn.Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",32437538,,10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa532,19
Live Cell Genomics: Cell-Specific Transcriptome Capture in Live Single Cells from Complex Tissues,"Analysis of single-cell transcriptomes shows the single-cell heterogeneity between cells within a population which is vital to our understanding of normal function and disease development. To obtain single-cell transcriptome profiling, however, the poly-A RNA must be accurately isolated from the target cell. We developed a single-cell analysis procedure called transcriptome in vivo analysis (TIVA), which will allow accurate characterization of targeted cell-specific transcriptomes from live tissue. This is accomplished using a RNA capture molecule called TIVA tag that captures the transcriptome of selected cells in their natural microenvironment. An important aspect of the TIVA approach is that the tag is delivered into the cytoplasm of live cells using cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs). Once the TIVA tag is in the cellular cytoplasm, it binds to mRNA after photoactivation of the compound. Using CPPs in combination with photoactivation is the first noninvasive access method for accurately isolating single-cell mRNA from live single cells in tissues in their natural microenvironment.",34766318,,10.1007/978-1-0716-1752-6_40,0
Single-cell transcriptomes reveal characteristic features of human pancreatic islet cell types,"Pancreatic islets of Langerhans contain several specialized endocrine cell types, which are commonly identified by the expression of single marker genes. However, the established marker genes cannot capture the complete spectrum of cellular heterogeneity in human pancreatic islets, and existing bulk transcriptome datasets provide averages across several cell populations. To dissect the cellular composition of the human pancreatic islet and to establish transcriptomes for all major cell types, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing on 70 cells sorted from human primary tissue. We used this dataset to validate previously described marker genes at the single-cell level and to identify specifically expressed transcription factors for all islet cell subtypes. All data are available for browsing and download, thus establishing a useful resource of single-cell expression profiles for endocrine cells in human pancreatic islets.",26691212,PMC4784001,10.15252/embr.201540946,122
Endogenous hydrogen sulfide promotes human preimplantation embryonic development by regulating metabolism-related gene expression,"Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) as an endogenous gaseous signaling molecule had been proved to play a vital role in gametes physiology, covering meiosis, maturation and aging. However, little is known about H2S involvement in embryonic development. The present study explored the positive effect of H2S on human early embryonic development. Results validated that the two H2S producing enzymes, CBS and CSE mRNA and proteins were identified in donated human cleavage and blastocyst-stage embryos. The l-cysteine incubation produced endogenous H2S in human blastocysts. NaHS positively affected in vitro blastulation. Single-cell RNA-seq analysis identified 228 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) after NaHS treatment versus the control. The Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of DEGs showed that genes for protein modification and metabolism were significantly enriched in the NaHS treatment group. For the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis, 2-oxocarboxylic acid metabolism, glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis-keratan sulfate, steroid biosynthesis, carbon metabolism, and biosynthesis of amino acids were significantly enriched. Six DEGs, including Neural EGFL like 1 (NELL1), aconitase 1 (ACO1), phosphoglycerate mutase 1 (PGAM1), TP53 induced glycolysis regulatory phosphatase (TIGAR), UDP-GlcNAc:betaGal beta-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 2 (B3GNT2), and carbohydrate Sulfotransferase 4 (CHST4) were validate by real-time RT-PCR. These findings suggest that H2S is a positive regulator of early embryonic development and may alter the transcription of embryonic genes for protein modification and metabolism in human embryos.",34995767,,10.1016/j.niox.2021.12.008,2
Computational and analytical challenges in single-cell transcriptomics,"The development of high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) at the single-cell level has already led to profound new discoveries in biology, ranging from the identification of novel cell types to the study of global patterns of stochastic gene expression. Alongside the technological breakthroughs that have facilitated the large-scale generation of single-cell transcriptomic data, it is important to consider the specific computational and analytical challenges that still have to be overcome. Although some tools for analysing RNA-seq data from bulk cell populations can be readily applied to single-cell RNA-seq data, many new computational strategies are required to fully exploit this data type and to enable a comprehensive yet detailed study of gene expression at the single-cell level.",25628217,,10.1038/nrg3833,519
Spatial transcriptomics deconvolution at single-cell resolution using Redeconve,"Computational deconvolution with single-cell RNA sequencing data as reference is pivotal to interpreting spatial transcriptomics data, but the current methods are limited to cell-type resolution.

Differential transcript usage analysis of bulk and single-cell RNA-seq data with DTUrtle,"Motivation:Each year, the number of published bulk and single-cell RNA-seq datasets is growing exponentially. Studies analyzing such data are commonly looking at gene-level differences, while the collected RNA-seq data inherently represents reads of transcript isoform sequences. Utilizing transcriptomic quantifiers, RNA-seq reads can be attributed to specific isoforms, allowing for analysis of transcript-level differences. A differential transcript usage (DTU) analysis is testing for proportional differences in a gene's transcript composition, and has been of rising interest for many research questions, such as analysis of differential splicing or cell-type identification.Results:We present the R package DTUrtle, the first DTU analysis workflow for both bulk and single-cell RNA-seq datasets, and the first package to conduct a 'classical' DTU analysis in a single-cell context. DTUrtle extends established statistical frameworks, offers various result aggregation and visualization options and a novel detection probability score for tagged-end data. It has been successfully applied to bulk and single-cell RNA-seq data of human and mouse, confirming and extending key results. In addition, we present novel potential DTU applications like the identification of cell-type specific transcript isoforms as biomarkers.Availability and implementation:The R package DTUrtle is available at https://github.com/TobiTekath/DTUrtle with extensive vignettes and documentation at https://tobitekath.github.io/DTUrtle/.Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",34469510,PMC8570804,10.1093/bioinformatics/btab629,9
Cell type discovery using single-cell transcriptomics: implications for ontological representation,"Cells are fundamental function units of multicellular organisms, with different cell types playing distinct physiological roles in the body. The recent advent of single-cell transcriptional profiling using RNA sequencing is producing 'big data', enabling the identification of novel human cell types at an unprecedented rate. In this review, we summarize recent work characterizing cell types in the human central nervous and immune systems using single-cell and single-nuclei RNA sequencing, and discuss the implications that these discoveries are having on the representation of cell types in the reference Cell Ontology (CL). We propose a method, based on random forest machine learning, for identifying sets of necessary and sufficient marker genes, which can be used to assemble consistent and reproducible cell type definitions for incorporation into the CL. The representation of defined cell type classes and their relationships in the CL using this strategy will make the cell type classes being identified by high-throughput/high-content technologies findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR), allowing the CL to serve as a reference knowledgebase of information about the role that distinct cellular phenotypes play in human health and disease.",29590361,PMC5946857,10.1093/hmg/ddy100,32
Global coordination level in single-cell transcriptomic data,"Genes are linked by underlying regulatory mechanisms and by jointly implementing biological functions, working in coordination to apply different tasks in the cells. Assessing the coordination level between genes from single-cell transcriptomic data, without a priori knowledge of the map of gene regulatory interactions, is a challenge. A 'top-down' approach has recently been developed to analyze single-cell transcriptomic data by evaluating the global coordination level between genes (called GCL). Here, we systematically analyze the performance of the GCL in typical scenarios of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. We show that an individual anomalous cell can have a disproportionate effect on the GCL calculated over a cohort of cells. In addition, we demonstrate how the GCL is affected by the presence of clusters, which are very common in scRNA-seq data. Finally, we analyze the effect of the sampling size of the Jackknife procedure on the GCL statistics. The manuscript is accompanied by a description of a custom-built Python package for calculating the GCL. These results provide practical guidelines for properly pre-processing and applying the GCL measure in transcriptional data.",35534606,PMC9085802,10.1038/s41598-022-11507-y,2
Computational Approaches and Challenges in Spatial Transcriptomics,"The development of spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies has transformed genetic research from a single-cell data level to a two-dimensional spatial coordinate system and facilitated the study of the composition and function of various cell subsets in different environments and organs. The large-scale data generated by these ST technologies, which contain spatial gene expression information, have elicited the need for spatially resolved approaches to meet the requirements of computational and biological data interpretation. These requirements include dealing with the explosive growth of data to determine the cell-level and gene-level expression, correcting the inner batch effect and loss of expression to improve the data quality, conducting efficient interpretation and in-depth knowledge mining both at the single-cell and tissue-wide levels, and conducting multi-omics integration analysis to provide an extensible framework toward the in-depth understanding of biological processes. However, algorithms designed specifically for ST technologies to meet these requirements are still in their infancy. Here, we review computational approaches to these problems in light of corresponding issues and challenges, and present forward-looking insights into algorithm development.",36252814,PMC10372921,10.1016/j.gpb.2022.10.001,17
Advances in Transcriptomics: Investigating Cardiovascular Disease at Unprecedented Resolution,"Whole-genome transcriptional profiling has become a standard genomic approach to investigate biological processes. RNA sequencing (RNAseq) in particular has witnessed myriad applications in genetics and various biomedical fields. RNAseq involves a relatively simple experimental protocol of RNA extraction and cDNA library preparation and, because of decreasing next-generation sequencing cost and lower computational burden for data processing, has obtained a central role in the modern biology. The recent application of RNAseq methodology to single-cell transcriptional profiling has enabled the more precise characterization of cell lineage and cell state genetic profiles. The development of bioinformatic and statistical tools has provided for differential gene expression analysis, RNA isoform analysis, haplotype-specific analysis of gene expression (allele-specific expression), and analysis of expression quantitative trait loci. We give an overview of these and recent developments in RNAseq methodology with emphasis on quality control, read mapping, feature counting, differential gene expression, allele-specific expression and expression quantitative trait loci analysis, and fusion transcript detection. We describe utilization of RNAseq as a diagnostic tool in Mendelian diseases, complex phenotypes, and cancer and give an overview of long read RNAseq technology.

Single cell transcriptome sequencing of stimulated and frozen human peripheral blood mononuclear cells,"Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are blood cells that are a critical part of the immune system used to fight off infection, defending our bodies from harmful pathogens. In biomedical research, PBMCs are commonly used to study global immune response to disease outbreak and progression, pathogen infections, for vaccine development and a multitude of other clinical applications. Over the past few years, the revolution in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has enabled an unbiased quantification of gene expression in thousands of individual cells, which provides a more efficient tool to decipher the immune system in human diseases. In this work, we generate scRNA-seq data from human PBMCs at high sequencing depth (>100,000 reads/cell) for more than 30,000 cells, in resting, stimulated, fresh and frozen conditions. The data generated can be used for benchmarking batch correction and data integration methods, and to study the effect of freezing-thawing cycles on the quality of immune cell populations and their transcriptomic profiles.",37414801,PMC10326076,10.1038/s41597-023-02348-z,1
Benchmarking UMI-based single-cell RNA-seq preprocessing workflows,"Background:Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies and associated analysis methods have rapidly developed in recent years. This includes preprocessing methods, which assign sequencing reads to genes to create count matrices for downstream analysis. While several packaged preprocessing workflows have been developed to provide users with convenient tools for handling this process, how they compare to one another and how they influence downstream analysis have not been well studied.Results:Here, we systematically benchmark the performance of 10 end-to-end preprocessing workflows (Cell Ranger, Optimus, salmon alevin, alevin-fry, kallisto bustools, dropSeqPipe, scPipe, zUMIs, celseq2, and scruff) using datasets yielding different biological complexity levels generated by CEL-Seq2 and 10x Chromium platforms. We compare these workflows in terms of their quantification properties directly and their impact on normalization and clustering by evaluating the performance of different method combinations. While the scRNA-seq preprocessing workflows compared vary in their detection and quantification of genes across datasets, after downstream analysis with performant normalization and clustering methods, almost all combinations produce clustering results that agree well with the known cell type labels that provided the ground truth in our analysis.Conclusions:In summary, the choice of preprocessing method was found to be less important than other steps in the scRNA-seq analysis process. Our study comprehensively compares common scRNA-seq preprocessing workflows and summarizes their characteristics to guide workflow users.",34906205,PMC8672463,10.1186/s13059-021-02552-3,13
cellHarmony: cell-level matching and holistic comparison of single-cell transcriptomes,"To understand the molecular pathogenesis of human disease, precision analyses to define alterations within and between disease-associated cell populations are desperately needed. Single-cell genomics represents an ideal platform to enable the identification and comparison of normal and diseased transcriptional cell populations. We created cellHarmony, an integrated solution for the unsupervised analysis, classification, and comparison of cell types from diverse single-cell RNA-Seq datasets. cellHarmony efficiently and accurately matches single-cell transcriptomes using a community-clustering and alignment strategy to compute differences in cell-type specific gene expression over potentially dozens of cell populations. Such transcriptional differences are used to automatically identify distinct and shared gene programs among cell-types and identify impacted pathways and transcriptional regulatory networks to understand the impact of perturbations at a systems level. cellHarmony is implemented as a python package and as an integrated workflow within the software AltAnalyze. We demonstrate that cellHarmony has improved or equivalent performance to alternative label projection methods, is able to identify the likely cellular origins of malignant states, stratify patients into clinical disease subtypes from identified gene programs, resolve discrete disease networks impacting specific cell-types, and illuminate therapeutic mechanisms. Thus, this approach holds tremendous promise in revealing the molecular and cellular origins of complex disease.",31529053,PMC6868361,10.1093/nar/gkz789,40
Application of Computational Biology to Decode Brain Transcriptomes,"The rapid development of high-throughput sequencing technologies has generated massive valuable brain transcriptome atlases, providing great opportunities for systematically investigating gene expression characteristics across various brain regions throughout a series of developmental stages. Recent studies have revealed that the transcriptional architecture is the key to interpreting the molecular mechanisms of brain complexity. However, our knowledge of brain transcriptional characteristics remains very limited. With the immense efforts to generate high-quality brain transcriptome atlases, new computational approaches to analyze these high-dimensional multivariate data are greatly needed. In this review, we summarize some public resources for brain transcriptome atlases and discuss the general computational pipelines that are commonly used in this field, which would aid in making new discoveries in brain development and disorders.",31655213,PMC6943780,10.1016/j.gpb.2019.03.003,5
Protoplast Isolation for Plant Single-Cell RNA-seq,"The growth and development of plants depends on diversified gene expression in different cell types.

Single-cell mRNA quantification and differential analysis with Census,"Single-cell gene expression studies promise to reveal rare cell types and cryptic states, but the high variability of single-cell RNA-seq measurements frustrates efforts to assay transcriptional differences between cells. We introduce the Census algorithm to convert relative RNA-seq expression levels into relative transcript counts without the need for experimental spike-in controls. Analyzing changes in relative transcript counts led to dramatic improvements in accuracy compared to normalized read counts and enabled new statistical tests for identifying developmentally regulated genes. Census counts can be analyzed with widely used regression techniques to reveal changes in cell-fate-dependent gene expression, splicing patterns and allelic imbalances. We reanalyzed single-cell data from several developmental and disease studies, and demonstrate that Census enabled robust analysis at multiple layers of gene regulation.

Review: Challenges and perspectives in applying single nuclei RNA-seq technology in plant biology,"Plant single-cell RNA-seq technology quantifies the abundance of plant transcripts at a single-cell resolution. Deciphering the transcriptomes of each plant cell, their regulation during plant cell development, and their response to environmental stresses will support the functional study of genes, the establishment of precise transcriptional programs, the prediction of more accurate gene regulatory networks, and, in the long term, the design of de novo gene pathways to enhance selected crop traits. In this review, we will discuss the opportunities, challenges, and problems, and share tentative solutions associated with the generation and analysis of plant single-cell transcriptomes. We will discuss the benefit and limitations of using plant protoplasts vs. nuclei to conduct single-cell RNA-seq experiments on various plant species and organs, the functional annotation of plant cell types based on their transcriptomic profile, the characterization of the dynamic regulation of the plant genes during cell development or in response to environmental stress, the need to characterize and integrate additional layers of -omics datasets to capture new molecular modalities at the single-cell level and reveal their causalities, the deposition and access to single-cell datasets, and the accessibility of this technology to plant scientists.",36202294,,10.1016/j.plantsci.2022.111486,6
Data normalization for addressing the challenges in the analysis of single-cell transcriptomic datasets,"Background:Normalization is a critical step in the analysis of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets. Its main goal is to make gene counts comparable within and between cells. To do so, normalization methods must account for technical and biological variability. Numerous normalization methods have been developed addressing different sources of dispersion and making specific assumptions about the count data.Main body:The selection of a normalization method has a direct impact on downstream analysis, for example differential gene expression and cluster identification. Thus, the objective of this review is to guide the reader in making an informed decision on the most appropriate normalization method to use. To this aim, we first give an overview of the different single cell sequencing platforms and methods commonly used including isolation and library preparation protocols. Next, we discuss the inherent sources of variability of scRNA-seq datasets. We describe the categories of normalization methods and include examples of each. We also delineate imputation and batch-effect correction methods. Furthermore, we describe data-driven metrics commonly used to evaluate the performance of normalization methods. We also discuss common scRNA-seq methods and toolkits used for integrated data analysis.Conclusions:According to the correction performed, normalization methods can be broadly classified as within and between-sample algorithms. Moreover, with respect to the mathematical model used, normalization methods can further be classified into: global scaling methods, generalized linear models, mixed methods, and machine learning-based methods. Each of these methods depict pros and cons and make different statistical assumptions. However, there is no better performing normalization method. Instead, metrics such as silhouette width, K-nearest neighbor batch-effect test, or Highly Variable Genes are recommended to assess the performance of normalization methods.",38711017,PMC11073985,10.1186/s12864-024-10364-5,0
"Clustering ensemble in scRNA-seq data analysis: Methods, applications and challenges","With the rapid development of single-cell RNA-sequencing techniques, various computational methods and tools were proposed to analyze these high-throughput data, which led to an accelerated reveal of potential biological information. As one of the core steps of single-cell transcriptome data analysis, clustering plays a crucial role in identifying cell types and interpreting cellular heterogeneity. However, the results generated by different clustering methods showed distinguishing, and those unstable partitions can affect the accuracy of the analysis to a certain extent. To overcome this challenge and obtain more accurate results, currently clustering ensemble is frequently applied to cluster analysis of single-cell transcriptome datasets, and the results generated by all clustering ensembles are nearly more reliable than those from most of the single clustering partitions. In this review, we summarize applications and challenges of the clustering ensemble method in single-cell transcriptome data analysis, and provide constructive thoughts and references for researchers in this field.",37075602,,10.1016/j.compbiomed.2023.106939,0
Realizing the potential of full-length transcriptome sequencing,"Long-read sequencing holds great potential for transcriptome analysis because it offers researchers an affordable method to annotate the transcriptomes of non-model organisms. This, in turn, will greatly benefit future work on less-researched organisms like unicellular eukaryotes that cannot rely on large consortia to generate these transcriptome annotations. However, to realize this potential, several remaining molecular and computational challenges will have to be overcome. In this review, we have outlined the limitations of short-read sequencing technology and how long-read sequencing technology overcomes these limitations. We have also highlighted the unique challenges still present for long-read sequencing technology and provided some suggestions on how to overcome these challenges going forward.

Effective methods for bulk RNA-seq deconvolution using scnRNA-seq transcriptomes,"Background:RNA profiling technologies at single-cell resolutions, including single-cell and single-nuclei RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq and snRNA-seq, scnRNA-seq for short), can help characterize the composition of tissues and reveal cells that influence key functions in both healthy and disease tissues. However, the use of these technologies is operationally challenging because of high costs and stringent sample-collection requirements. Computational deconvolution methods that infer the composition of bulk-profiled samples using scnRNA-seq-characterized cell types can broaden scnRNA-seq applications, but their effectiveness remains controversial.Results:We produced the first systematic evaluation of deconvolution methods on datasets with either known or scnRNA-seq-estimated compositions. Our analyses revealed biases that are common to scnRNA-seq 10X Genomics assays and illustrated the importance of accurate and properly controlled data preprocessing and method selection and optimization. Moreover, our results suggested that concurrent RNA-seq and scnRNA-seq profiles can help improve the accuracy of both scnRNA-seq preprocessing and the deconvolution methods that employ them. Indeed, our proposed method, Single-cell RNA Quantity Informed Deconvolution (SQUID), which combines RNA-seq transformation and dampened weighted least-squares deconvolution approaches, consistently outperformed other methods in predicting the composition of cell mixtures and tissue samples.Conclusions:We showed that analysis of concurrent RNA-seq and scnRNA-seq profiles with SQUID can produce accurate cell-type abundance estimates and that this accuracy improvement was necessary for identifying outcomes-predictive cancer cell subclones in pediatric acute myeloid leukemia and neuroblastoma datasets. These results suggest that deconvolution accuracy improvements are vital to enabling its applications in the life sciences.",37528411,PMC10394903,10.1186/s13059-023-03016-6,8
Single-cell RNA sequencing of mouse lower respiratory tract epithelial cells: A meta-analysis,"The respiratory system is a vital component of our body, essential for both oxygen uptake and immune defense. Knowledge of cellular composition and function in different parts of the respiratory tract provides the basis for a better understanding of the pathological processes involved in various diseases such as chronic respiratory diseases and cancer. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a proficient approach for the identification and transcriptional characterization of cellular phenotypes. Although the mouse is an essential tool for the study of lung development, regeneration, and disease, a scRNA-seq mouse atlas of the lung in which all epithelial cell types are included and annotated systematically is lacking. Here, we established a single-cell transcriptome landscape of the mouse lower respiratory tract by performing a meta-analysis of seven different studies in which mouse lungs and trachea were analyzed by droplet and/or plate-based scRNA-seq technologies. We provide information on the best markers for each epithelial cell type, propose surface markers for the isolation of viable cells, harmonized the annotation of cell types, and compare the mouse single-cell transcriptomes with human scRNA-seq data of the lung.",37146757,,10.1016/j.cdev.2023.203847,0

Identifying gene expression from single cells to single genes,"Gene regulatory networks reveal how transcription factors contribute to a dynamic cascade of cellular information processing. Recent advances in technologies have enhanced the toolkit for testing GRN mechanisms and connections. Here we emphasize three approaches that we have found important for interrogating transcriptional mechanisms in echinoderms: single cell mRNA sequencing (drop-seq), nascent RNA detection and identification, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). We present these applications in order since it is a logical experimental protocol. With preliminary information from bulk mRNA transcriptome analysis and differential gene expression studies (DE-seq), one may need to test in what specific cells important genes may be expressed and to use single cell sequencing to define such links. Nascent RNA analysis with the Click-iT chemistry allows the investigator to deduce when the RNA was transcribed, not just identify its presence, and ChIP allows the investigator to study direct interactions of putative transcriptional regulators with the gene promoter of interest. This flow of thinking, and the technologies to support it, is presented here for echinoderms. While many of the procedures are general and applicable to many organisms and cell types, we emphasize unique aspects of the protocols for consideration in using echinoderm embryos, larvae, and adult tissues.",30948004,PMC7384399,10.1016/bs.mcb.2018.11.018,6
CAMML with the Integration of Marker Proteins (ChIMP),"Motivation:Cell typing is a critical task in the analysis of single-cell data, particularly when studying complex diseased tissues. Unfortunately, the sparsity and noise of single-cell data make accurate cell typing of individual cells difficult. To address these challenges, we previously developed the CAMML method for multi-label cell typing of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. CAMML uses weighted gene sets to score each profiled cell for multiple potential cell types. While CAMML outperforms other scRNA-seq cell typing techniques, it only leverages transcriptomic data so cannot take advantage of newer multi-omic single-cell assays that jointly profile gene expression and protein abundance (e.g. joint scRNA-seq/CITE-seq).Results:We developed the CAMML with the Integration of Marker Proteins (ChIMP) method to support multi-label cell typing of individual cells jointly profiled via scRNA-seq and CITE-seq. ChIMP combines cell type scores computed on scRNA-seq data via the CAMML approach with discretized CITE-seq measurements for cell type marker proteins. The multi-omic cell type scores generated by ChIMP allow researchers to more precisely and conservatively cell type joint scRNA-seq/CITE-seq data.Availability and implementation:An implementation of this work is available on CRAN at https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/CAMML/.Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",36214642,PMC9710548,10.1093/bioinformatics/btac674,2
Recent advances in deciphering hippocampus complexity using single-cell transcriptomics,"Single-cell and single-nucleus RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq and snRNA-seq) technologies have emerged as revolutionary and powerful tools, which have helped in achieving significant progress in biomedical research over the last decade. scRNA-seq and snRNA-seq resolve heterogeneous cell populations from different tissues and help reveal the function and dynamics at the single-cell level. The hippocampus is an essential component for cognitive functions, including learning, memory, and emotion regulation. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the activity of hippocampus have not been fully elucidated. The development of scRNA-seq and snRNA-seq technologies provides strong support for attaining an in-depth understanding of hippocampal cell types and gene expression regulation from the single-cell transcriptome profiling perspective. This review summarizes the applications of scRNA-seq and snRNA-seq in the hippocampus to further expand our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms related to hippocampal development, health, and diseases.",36878328,,10.1016/j.nbd.2023.106062,3
Single Cell Sequencing and Kidney Organoids Generated from Pluripotent Stem Cells,"Methods to differentiate human pluripotent stem cells into kidney organoids were first introduced about 5 years ago, and since that time, the field has grown substantially. Protocols are producing increasingly complex three-dimensional structures, have been used to model human kidney disease, and have been adapted for high-throughput screening. Over this same time frame, technologies for massively parallel, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) have matured. Now, both of these powerful approaches are being combined to better understand how kidney organoids can be applied to the understanding of kidney development and disease. There are several reasons why this is a synergistic combination. Kidney organoids are complicated and contain many different cell types of variable maturity. scRNA-seq is an unbiased technology that can comprehensively categorize cell types, making it ideally suited to catalog all cell types present in organoids. These same characteristics also make scRNA-seq a powerful approach for quantitative comparisons between protocols, batches, and pluripotent cell lines as it becomes clear that reproducibility and quality can vary across all three variables. Lineage trajectories can be reconstructed using scRNA-seq data, enabling the rational adjustment of differentiation strategies to promote maturation of desired kidney cell types or inhibit differentiation of undesired off-target cell types. Here, we review the ways that scRNA-seq has been successfully applied in the organoid field and predict future applications for this powerful technique. We also review other developing single-cell technologies and discuss how they may be combined, using ""multiomic"" approaches, to improve our understanding of kidney organoid differentiation and usefulness in modeling development, disease, and toxicity testing.",31992574,PMC7133134,10.2215/CJN.07470619,13
Revealing the vectors of cellular identity with single-cell genomics,"Single-cell genomics has now made it possible to create a comprehensive atlas of human cells. At the same time, it has reopened definitions of a cell's identity and of the ways in which identity is regulated by the cell's molecular circuitry. Emerging computational analysis methods, especially in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), have already begun to reveal, in a data-driven way, the diverse simultaneous facets of a cell's identity, from discrete cell types to continuous dynamic transitions and spatial locations. These developments will eventually allow a cell to be represented as a superposition of 'basis vectors', each determining a different (but possibly dependent) aspect of cellular organization and function. However, computational methods must also overcome considerable challenges-from handling technical noise and data scale to forming new abstractions of biology. As the scale of single-cell experiments continues to increase, new computational approaches will be essential for constructing and characterizing a reference map of cell identities.",27824854,PMC5465644,10.1038/nbt.3711,283
Integrated analysis of single-cell embryo data yields a unified transcriptome signature for the human pre-implantation epiblast,"Single-cell profiling techniques create opportunities to delineate cell fate progression in mammalian development. Recent studies have provided transcriptome data from human pre-implantation embryos, in total comprising nearly 2000 individual cells. Interpretation of these data is confounded by biological factors, such as variable embryo staging and cell-type ambiguity, as well as technical challenges in the collective analysis of datasets produced with different sample preparation and sequencing protocols. Here, we address these issues to assemble a complete gene expression time course spanning human pre-implantation embryogenesis. We identify key transcriptional features over developmental time and elucidate lineage-specific regulatory networks. We resolve post-hoc cell-type assignment in the blastocyst, and define robust transcriptional prototypes that capture epiblast and primitive endoderm lineages. Examination of human pluripotent stem cell transcriptomes in this framework identifies culture conditions that sustain a naïve state pertaining to the inner cell mass. Our approach thus clarifies understanding both of lineage segregation in the early human embryo and ofin vitrostem cell identity, and provides an analytical resource for comparative molecular embryology.",29361568,PMC5818005,10.1242/dev.158501,92
Advances and Challenges in Spatial Transcriptomics for Developmental Biology,"Development from single cells to multicellular tissues and organs involves more than just the exact replication of cells, which is known as differentiation. The primary focus of research into the mechanism of differentiation has been differences in gene expression profiles between individual cells. However, it has predominantly been conducted at low throughput and bulk levels, challenging the efforts to understand molecular mechanisms of differentiation during the developmental process in animals and humans. During the last decades, rapid methodological advancements in genomics facilitated the ability to study developmental processes at a genome-wide level and finer resolution. Particularly, sequencing transcriptomes at single-cell resolution, enabled by single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), was a breath-taking innovation, allowing scientists to gain a better understanding of differentiation and cell lineage during the developmental process. However, single-cell isolation during scRNA-seq results in the loss of the spatial information of individual cells and consequently limits our understanding of the specific functions of the cells performed by different spatial regions of tissues or organs. This greatly encourages the emergence of the spatial transcriptomic discipline and tools. Here, we summarize the recent application of scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomic tools for developmental biology. We also discuss the limitations of current spatial transcriptomic tools and approaches, as well as possible solutions and future prospects.",36671541,PMC9855858,10.3390/biom13010156,9
ACME dissociation: a versatile cell fixation-dissociation method for single-cell transcriptomics,"Single-cell sequencing technologies are revolutionizing biology, but they are limited by the need to dissociate live samples. Here, we present ACME (ACetic-MEthanol), a dissociation approach for single-cell transcriptomics that simultaneously fixes cells. ACME-dissociated cells have high RNA integrity, can be cryopreserved multiple times, and are sortable and permeable. As a proof of principle, we provide single-cell transcriptomic data of different species, using both droplet-based and combinatorial barcoding single-cell methods. ACME uses affordable reagents, can be done in most laboratories and even in the field, and thus will accelerate our knowledge of cell types across the tree of life.",33827654,PMC8028764,10.1186/s13059-021-02302-5,26
Mapping Cellular Coordinates through Advances in Spatial Transcriptomics Technology,"Complex cell-to-cell communication underlies the basic processes essential for homeostasis in the given tissue architecture. Obtaining quantitative gene-expression of cells in their native context has significantly advanced through single-cell RNA sequencing technologies along with mechanical and enzymatic tissue manipulation. This approach, however, is largely reliant on the physical dissociation of individual cells from the tissue, thus, resulting in a library with unaccounted positional information. To overcome this, positional information can be obtained by integrating imaging and positional barcoding. Collectively, spatial transcriptomics strategies provide tissue architecture-dependent as well as position-dependent cellular functions. This review discusses the current technologies for spatial transcriptomics ranging from the methods combining mechanical dissociation and single-cell RNA sequencing to computational spatial re-mapping.",32507771,PMC7398793,10.14348/molcells.2020.0020,13
Rapid Isolation of Single Cells from Mouse and Human Teeth,"Mouse and human teeth represent challenging organs for quick and efficient cell isolation for single-cell transcriptomic or other applications. The dental pulp tissue, rich in the extracellular matrix, requires a long and tedious dissociation process that is typically beyond the reasonable time for single-cell transcriptomics. For avoiding artificial changes in gene expression, the time elapsed from euthanizing an animal until the analysis of single cells needs to be minimized. This work presents a fast protocol enabling to obtain single-cell suspension from mouse and human teeth in an excellent quality suitable for scRNA-seq (single-cell RNA-sequencing). This protocol is based on accelerated tissue isolation steps, enzymatic digestion, and subsequent preparation of final single-cell suspension. This enables fast and gentle processing of tissues and allows using more animal or human samples for obtaining cell suspensions with high viability and minimal transcriptional changes. It is anticipated that this protocol might guide researchers interested in performing the scRNA-seq not only on the mouse or human teeth but also on other extracellular matrix-rich tissues, including cartilage, dense connective tissue, and dermis.",34779437,,10.3791/63043,1
Cell lineage and communication network inference via optimization for single-cell transcriptomics,"The use of single-cell transcriptomics has become a major approach to delineate cell subpopulations and the transitions between them. While various computational tools using different mathematical methods have been developed to infer clusters, marker genes, and cell lineage, none yet integrate these within a mathematical framework to perform multiple tasks coherently. Such coherence is critical for the inference of cell-cell communication, a major remaining challenge. Here, we present similarity matrix-based optimization for single-cell data analysis (SoptSC), in which unsupervised clustering, pseudotemporal ordering, lineage inference, and marker gene identification are inferred via a structured cell-to-cell similarity matrix. SoptSC then predicts cell-cell communication networks, enabling reconstruction of complex cell lineages that include feedback or feedforward interactions. Application of SoptSC to early embryonic development, epidermal regeneration, and hematopoiesis demonstrates robust identification of subpopulations, lineage relationships, and pseudotime, and prediction of pathway-specific cell communication patterns regulating processes of development and differentiation.",30923815,PMC6582411,10.1093/nar/gkz204,69
spSeudoMap: cell type mapping of spatial transcriptomics using unmatched single-cell RNA-seq data,"Since many single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data are obtained after cell sorting, such as when investigating immune cells, tracking cellular landscape by integrating single-cell data with spatial transcriptomic data is limited due to cell type and cell composition mismatch between the two datasets. We developed a method, spSeudoMap, which utilizes sorted scRNA-seq data to create virtual cell mixtures that closely mimic the gene expression of spatial data and trains a domain adaptation model for predicting spatial cell compositions. The method was applied in brain and breast cancer tissues and accurately predicted the topography of cell subpopulations. spSeudoMap may help clarify the roles of a few, but crucial cell types.",36932388,PMC10021938,10.1186/s13073-023-01168-5,5
Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Analysis Using Fluidigm C1 Platform for Characterization of Heterogeneous Transcriptomes,"Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is an innovative technology that can be used to characterize transcriptome heterogeneity at the single-cell resolution. The Fluidigm C1 is an automated system for preparing complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA) samples that have been synthesized and preamplified from single cells for next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis.

Single-cell transcriptomics of the ocular anterior segment: a comprehensive review,"Elucidating the cellular and genetic composition of ocular tissues is essential for uncovering the pathophysiology of ocular diseases. Since the introduction of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) in 2009, vision researchers have performed extensive single-cell analyses to better understand transcriptome complexity and heterogeneity of ocular structures. This technology has revolutionized our ability to identify rare cell populations and to make cross-species comparisons of gene expression in both steady state and disease conditions. Importantly, single-cell transcriptomic analyses have enabled the identification of cell-type specific gene markers and signalling pathways between ocular cell populations. While most scRNA-seq studies have been conducted on retinal tissues, large-scale transcriptomic atlases pertaining to the ocular anterior segment have also been constructed in the past three years. This timely review provides vision researchers with an overview of scRNA-seq experimental design, technical limitations, and clinical applications in a variety of anterior segment-related ocular pathologies. We review open-access anterior segment-related scRNA-seq datasets and illustrate how scRNA-seq can be an indispensable tool for the development of targeted therapeutics.",37138096,PMC10156079,10.1038/s41433-023-02539-3,0
Recent advances in spatially resolved transcriptomics: challenges and opportunities,"Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has greatly advanced our understanding of cellular heterogeneity by profiling individual cell transcriptomes. However, cell dissociation from the tissue structure causes a loss of spatial information, which hinders the identification of intercellular communication networks and global transcriptional patterns present in the tissue architecture. To overcome this limitation, novel transcriptomic platforms that preserve spatial information have been actively developed. Significant achievements in imaging technologies have enabled in situ targeted transcriptomic profiling in single cells at singlemolecule resolution. In addition, technologies based on mRNA capture followed by sequencing have made possible profiling of the genome-wide transcriptome at the 55-100 μm resolution. Unfortunately, neither imaging-based technology nor capturebased method elucidates a complete picture of the spatial transcriptome in a tissue. Therefore, addressing specific biological questions requires balancing experimental throughput and spatial resolution, mandating the efforts to develop computational algorithms that are pivotal to circumvent technology-specific limitations. In this review, we focus on the current state-of-the-art spatially resolved transcriptomic technologies, describe their applications in a variety of biological domains, and explore recent discoveries demonstrating their enormous potential in biomedical research. We further highlight novel integrative computational methodologies with other data modalities that provide a framework to derive biological insight into heterogeneous and complex tissue organization.

Resolving cellular dynamics using single-cell temporal transcriptomics,"Cellular dynamics, the transition of a cell from one state to another, is central to understanding developmental processes and disease progression. Single-cell transcriptomics has been pushing the frontiers of cellular dynamics studies into a genome-wide and single-cell level. While most single-cell RNA sequencing approaches are disruptive and only provide a snapshot of cell states, the dynamics of a cell could be reconstructed by either exploiting temporal information hiding in the transcriptomics data or integrating additional information. In this review, we describe these approaches, highlighting their underlying principles, key assumptions, and the rationality to interpret the results as models. We also discuss the recently emerging nondisruptive live-cell transcriptomics methods, which are highly complementary to the computational models for their assumption-free nature.",38194753,,10.1016/j.copbio.2023.103060,0
Functional Annotation of Custom Transcriptomes,"Many eukaryotic genes can give rise to different alternative transcripts depending on stage of development, cell type, and physiological cues. Current transcriptome-wide sequencing technologies highlight the remarkable extent of this regulation in metazoans and allow for RNA isoforms to be profiled in increasingly small biological samples and with a growing confidence. Understanding biological functions of sample-specific transcripts is a major challenge in genomics and RNA processing fields. Here we describe simple bioinformatics workflows that facilitate this task by streamlining reference-guided annotation of novel transcripts. A key part of our protocol is the R package factR that rapidly matches custom-assembled transcripts to their likely host genes, deduces the sequence and domain structure of novel protein products, and predicts sensitivity of newly identified RNA isoforms to nonsense-mediated decay.",35895263,,10.1007/978-1-0716-2521-7_9,1
Accurate and fast cell marker gene identification with COSG,"Accurate cell classification is the groundwork for downstream analysis of single-cell sequencing data, yet how to identify true marker genes for different cell types still remains a big challenge. Here, we report COSine similarity-based marker Gene identification (COSG) as a cosine similarity-based method for more accurate and scalable marker gene identification. COSG is applicable to single-cell RNA sequencing data, single-cell ATAC sequencing data and spatially resolved transcriptome data. COSG is fast and scalable for ultra-large datasets of million-scale cells. Application on both simulated and real experimental datasets showed that the marker genes or genomic regions identified by COSG have greater cell-type specificity, demonstrating the superior performance of COSG in terms of both accuracy and efficiency as compared with other available methods.",35048116,,10.1093/bib/bbab579,26
The use of single-cell RNA-Seq to understand virus-host interactions,"Single-cell analyses allow uncovering cellular heterogeneity, not only per se, but also in response to viral infection. Similarly, single cell transcriptome analyses (scRNA-Seq) can highlight specific signatures, identifying cell subsets with particular phenotypes, which are relevant in the understanding of virus-host interactions.",29558678,,10.1016/j.coviro.2018.03.001,29
Overview of Transcriptomic Research on Type 2 Diabetes: Challenges and Perspectives,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a common chronic disease whose etiology is known to have a strong genetic component. Standard genetic approaches, although allowing for the detection of a number of gene variants associated with the disease as well as differentially expressed genes, cannot fully explain the hereditary factor in T2D. The explosive growth in the genomic sequencing technologies over the last decades provided an exceptional impetus for transcriptomic studies and new approaches to gene expression measurement, such as RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) and single-cell technologies. The transcriptomic analysis has the potential to find new biomarkers to identify risk groups for developing T2D and its microvascular and macrovascular complications, which will significantly affect the strategies for early diagnosis, treatment, and preventing the development of complications. In this article, we focused on transcriptomic studies conducted using expression arrays, RNA-seq, and single-cell sequencing to highlight recent findings related to T2D and challenges associated with transcriptome experiments.",35885959,PMC9319211,10.3390/genes13071176,7
Analysis of Technical and Biological Variability in Single-Cell RNA Sequencing,"Profiling the transcriptomes of individual cells with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has been widely applied to provide a detailed molecular characterization of cellular heterogeneity within a population of cells. Despite recent technological advances of scRNA-seq, technical variability of gene expression in scRNA-seq is still much higher than that in bulk RNA-seq. Accounting for technical variability is therefore a prerequisite for correctly analyzing single-cell data. This chapter describes a computational pipeline for detecting highly variable genes exhibiting higher cell-to-cell variability than expected by technical noise. The basic pipeline using the scater and scran R/Bioconductor packages includes deconvolution-based normalization, fitting the mean-variance trend, testing for nonzero biological variability, and visualization with highly variable genes. An outline of the underlying theory of detecting highly variable genes is also presented. We illustrate how the pipeline works by using two case studies, one from mouse embryonic stem cells with external RNA spike-ins, and the other from mouse dentate gyrus cells without spike-ins.",30758818,,10.1007/978-1-4939-9057-3_3,2
Complexities of mammalian transcriptome revealed by targeted RNA enrichment techniques,"Studies using highly sensitive targeted RNA enrichment methods have shown that a large portion of the human transcriptome remains to be discovered and that most of the genome is transcribed in a complex, interleaved fashion characterized by a complex web of transcripts emanating from protein coding and noncoding loci. These results resonate with those from single-cell transcriptome profiling endeavors that reveal the existence of multiple novel, cell type-specific transcripts and clearly demonstrate that our understanding of the complexities of the human transcriptome is far from being complete. Here, we review the current status of the targeted RNA enrichment techniques, their application to the discovery of novel cell type-specific transcripts, and their impact on our understanding of the human genome and transcriptome.",36681580,,10.1016/j.tig.2022.12.004,1
"Statistical Power Analysis for Designing Bulk, Single-Cell, and Spatial Transcriptomics Experiments: Review, Tutorial, and Perspectives","Gene expression profiling technologies have been used in various applications such as cancer biology. The development of gene expression profiling has expanded the scope of target discovery in transcriptomic studies, and each technology produces data with distinct characteristics. In order to guarantee biologically meaningful findings using transcriptomic experiments, it is important to consider various experimental factors in a systematic way through statistical power analysis. In this paper, we review and discuss the power analysis for three types of gene expression profiling technologies from a practical standpoint, including bulk RNA-seq, single-cell RNA-seq, and high-throughput spatial transcriptomics. Specifically, we describe the existing power analysis tools for each research objective for each of the bulk RNA-seq and scRNA-seq experiments, along with recommendations. On the other hand, since there are no power analysis tools for high-throughput spatial transcriptomics at this point, we instead investigate the factors that can influence power analysis.",36830591,PMC9952882,10.3390/biom13020221,5
Single-cell genomic profile-based analysis of tissue differentiation in colorectal cancer,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) progression is associated with cancer cell dedifferentiation and sternness acquisition. Several methods have been developed to identify sternness signatures in CRCs. However, studies that directly measured the degree of dedifferentiation in CRC tissues are limited. It is unclear how the differentiation states change during CRC progression. To address this, we develop a method to analyze the tissue differentiation spectrum in colorectal cancer using normal gastrointestinal single-cell transcriptome data. Applying this method on 281 tumor samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas Colon Adenocarcinoma dataset, we identified three major CRC subtypes with distinct tissue differentiation pattern. We observed that differentiation states are closely correlated with anti-tumor immune response and patient outcomes in CRC. Highly dedifferentiated CRC samples escaped the immune surveillance and exhibited poor outcomes; mildly dedifferentiated CRC samples showed resistance to anti-tumor immune responses and had a worse survival rate; well-differentiated CRC samples showed sustained anti-tumor immune responses and had a good prognosis. Overall, the spectrum of tissue differentiation observed in CRCs can be used for future clinical risk stratification and subtype-based therapy selection.",33141303,,10.1007/s11427-020-1811-5,3
HeLa-CCL2 cell heterogeneity studied by single-cell DNA and RNA sequencing,"The HeLa cells are the earliest and mostly used laboratory human cells for biomedical particularly cancer research. They were derived from a patient's cervical cancerous tissue, and are known for their heterogeneous cellular origin and variable genomic landscapes. Single-cell sequencing techniques with faithful linear and uniformly amplified genomes (DNA) and transcriptomes (RNA) may facilitate the study of cellular differences at the individual cell level. In this work, we have performed single-cell DNA and RNA sequencing with HeLa-CCL2 cells to study their heterogeneity. We have studied the complexity of copy number variations (CNVs) of HeLa-CCL2 genome at the single cell level, and revealed the transcriptomic heterogeneity of HeLa-CCL2. We also analyzed the relationship between genome and transcriptome at the single-cell level, and found overall correlation between CNV and transcriptome expression patterns. Finally, we concluded that although single-cell sequencing techniques are applicable to study heterogeneous cells such as HeLa-CCL2, the data analyses need to be more careful and well controlled.",31790455,PMC6886862,10.1371/journal.pone.0225466,11
Dissecting transition cells from single-cell transcriptome data through multiscale stochastic dynamics,"Advances in single-cell technologies allow scrutinizing of heterogeneous cell states, however, detecting cell-state transitions from snap-shot single-cell transcriptome data remains challenging. To investigate cells with transient properties or mixed identities, we present MuTrans, a method based on multiscale reduction technique to identify the underlying stochastic dynamics that prescribes cell-fate transitions. By iteratively unifying transition dynamics across multiple scales, MuTrans constructs the cell-fate dynamical manifold that depicts progression of cell-state transitions, and distinguishes stable and transition cells. In addition, MuTrans quantifies the likelihood of all possible transition trajectories between cell states using coarse-grained transition path theory. Downstream analysis identifies distinct genes that mark the transient states or drive the transitions. The method is consistent with the well-established Langevin equation and transition rate theory. Applying MuTrans to datasets collected from five different single-cell experimental platforms, we show its capability and scalability to robustly unravel complex cell fate dynamics induced by transition cells in systems such as tumor EMT, iPSC differentiation and blood cell differentiation. Overall, our method bridges data-driven and model-based approaches on cell-fate transitions at single-cell resolution.",34556644,PMC8460805,10.1038/s41467-021-25548-w,33
Gene function and cell surface protein association analysis based on single-cell multiomics data,"Single-cell transcriptomics provides researchers with a powerful tool to resolve the transcriptome heterogeneity of individual cells. However, this method falls short in revealing cellular heterogeneity at the protein level. Previous single-cell multiomics studies have focused on data integration rather than exploiting the full potential of multiomics data. Here we introduce a new analysis framework, gene function and protein association (GFPA), that mines reliable associations between gene function and cell surface protein from single-cell multimodal data. Applying GFPA to human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), we observe an association of epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) with the CD99 protein in CD4 T cells, which is consistent with previous findings. Our results show that GFPA is reliable across multiple cell subtypes and PBMC samples.

Systematic comparison of high-throughput single-cell RNA-seq methods for immune cell profiling,"Background:Elucidation of immune populations with single-cell RNA-seq has greatly benefited the field of immunology by deepening the characterization of immune heterogeneity and leading to the discovery of new subtypes. However, single-cell methods inherently suffer from limitations in the recovery of complete transcriptomes due to the prevalence of cellular and transcriptional dropout events. This issue is often compounded by limited sample availability and limited prior knowledge of heterogeneity, which can confound data interpretation.Results:Here, we systematically benchmarked seven high-throughput single-cell RNA-seq methods. We prepared 21 libraries under identical conditions of a defined mixture of two human and two murine lymphocyte cell lines, simulating heterogeneity across immune-cell types and cell sizes. We evaluated methods by their cell recovery rate, library efficiency, sensitivity, and ability to recover expression signatures for each cell type. We observed higher mRNA detection sensitivity with the 10x Genomics 5' v1 and 3' v3 methods. We demonstrate that these methods have fewer dropout events, which facilitates the identification of differentially-expressed genes and improves the concordance of single-cell profiles to immune bulk RNA-seq signatures.Conclusion:Overall, our characterization of immune cell mixtures provides useful metrics, which can guide selection of a high-throughput single-cell RNA-seq method for profiling more complex immune-cell heterogeneity usually found in vivo.",33472597,PMC7818754,10.1186/s12864-020-07358-4,21
Molecular pathological classification of colorectal cancer-an update,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) has a broad range of molecular alterations with two major mechanisms of genomic instability (chromosomal instability and microsatellite instability) and has been subclassified into 4 consensus molecular subtypes (CMS) based on bulk RNA sequence data. Here, we update the molecular pathological classification of CRC with an overview of more recent bulk and single-cell RNA data analysis for development of transcriptional classifiers and risk stratification methods, taking into account the marked inter-tumoural and intra-tumoural heterogeneity of CRC. The importance of the stromal and immune components or tumour microenvironment (TME) to prognosis has emerged from these analyses. Attempts to remove the contribution of the tumour microenvironment and reveal neoplastic-specific transcriptional traits involved identification of the CRC intrinsic subtypes (CRIS). The use of immunohistochemistry and digital pathology to implement classification systems are evolving fields. Conventional adenoma versus serrated polyp pathway transcriptomic analysis and characterisation of canonical LGR5+ crypt base columnar stem cell versus ANXA1+ regenerative stem cell phenotypes emerged as key properties for improved understanding of transcriptional signals involved in molecular subclassification of colorectal cancers. Recently, classification by three pathway-derived subtypes (PDS1-3) has been developed, revealing a continuum of intrinsic biology associated with biological, stem cell, histopathological, and clinical attributes.",38319359,PMC10948573,10.1007/s00428-024-03746-3,0
Generation and Downstream Analysis of Single-Cell and Single-Nuclei Transcriptomes in Brain Organoids,"Over the past decade, single-cell transcriptomics has significantly evolved and become a standard laboratory method for simultaneous analysis of gene expression profiles of individual cells, allowing the capture of cellular diversity. In order to overcome limitations posed by difficult-to-isolate cell types, an alternative approach aiming at recovering single nuclei instead of intact cells can be utilized for sequencing, making transcriptome profiling of individual cells universally applicable. These techniques have become a cornerstone in the study of brain organoids, establishing them as models of the developing human brain. Leveraging the potential of single-cell and single-nucleus transcriptomics in brain organoid research, this protocol presents a step-by-step guide encompassing key procedures such as organoid dissociation, single-cell or nuclei isolation, library preparation and sequencing. By implementing these alternative approaches, researchers can obtain high-quality datasets, enabling the identification of neuronal and non-neuronal cell types, gene expression profiles, and cell lineage trajectories. This facilitates comprehensive investigations into cellular processes and molecular mechanisms shaping brain development.",38619271,,10.3791/66225,0
Single-cell RNA-seq reveals distinct dynamic behavior of sex chromosomes during early human embryogenesis,"Several animal and human studies have demonstrated that sex affects kinetics and metabolism during early embryo development. However, the mechanism governing these differences at the molecular level before the expression of the sex-determining gene SRY is unknown. We performed a systematic profiling of gene expression comparing male and female embryos using available single-cell RNA-sequencing data of 1607 individual cells from 99 human preimplantation embryos, covering development stages from 4-cell to late blastocyst. We observed consistent chromosome-wide transcription of autosomes, whereas expression from sex chromosomes exhibits significant differences after embryonic genome activation (EGA). Activation of the Y chromosome is initiated by expression of two genes, RPS4Y1 and DDX3Y, whereas the X chromosome is widely activated, with both copies in females being activated after EGA. In contrast to the stable activation of the Y chromosome, expression of X-linked genes in females declines at the late blastocyst stage, especially in trophectoderm cells, revealing a rapid process of dosage compensation. This dynamic behavior results in a dosage imbalance between male and female embryos, which influences genes involved in cell cycle, protein translation and metabolism. Our results reveal the dynamics of sex chromosomes expression and silencing during early embryogenesis. Studying sex differences during human embryogenesis, as well as understanding the process of X chromosome inactivation and their effects on the sex bias development of in vitro fertilized embryos, will expand the capabilities of assisted reproductive technology and possibly improve the treatment of infertility and enhance reproductive health.",31094050,,10.1002/mrd.23162,14
Prediction of cell position using single-cell transcriptomic data: an iterative procedure,"Single-cell sequencing reveals cellular heterogeneity but not cell localization. However, by combining single-cell transcriptomic data with a reference atlas of a small set of genes, it would be possible to predict the position of individual cells and reconstruct the spatial expression profile of thousands of genes reported in the single-cell study. With the purpose of developing new algorithms, the Dialogue for Reverse Engineering Assessments and Methods (DREAM) consortium organized a crowd-sourced competition known as DREAM Single Cell Transcriptomics Challenge (SCTC). Within this context, we describe here our proposed procedures for adequate reference genes selection, and an iterative procedure to predict spatial expression profile of other genes.",32399185,PMC7194340,10.12688/f1000research.20715.2,1
"Single-cell transcriptomics: background, technologies, applications, and challenges","Single-cell sequencing was developed as a high-throughput tool to elucidate unusual and transient cell states that are barely visible in the bulk. This technology reveals the evolutionary status of cells and differences between populations, helps to identify unique cell subtypes and states, reveals regulatory relationships between genes, targets and molecular mechanisms in disease processes, tumor heterogeneity, the state of the immune environment, etc. However, the high cost and technical limitations of single-cell sequencing initially prevented its widespread application, but with advances in research, numerous new single-cell sequencing techniques have been discovered, lowering the cost barrier. Many single-cell sequencing platforms and bioinformatics methods have recently become commercially available, allowing researchers to make fascinating observations. They are now increasingly being used in various industries. Several protocols have been discovered in this context and each technique has unique characteristics, capabilities and challenges. This review presents the latest advancements in single-cell transcriptomics technologies. This includes single-cell transcriptomics approaches, workflows and statistical approaches to data processing, as well as the potential advances, applications, opportunities and challenges of single-cell transcriptomics technology. You will also get an overview of the entry points for spatial transcriptomics and multi-omics.",38689046,,10.1007/s11033-024-09553-y,0
Bioinformatics approach to spatially resolved transcriptomics,"Spatially resolved transcriptomics encompasses a growing number of methods developed to enable gene expression profiling of individual cells within a tissue. Different technologies are available and they vary with respect to: the method used to define regions of interest, the method used to assess gene expression, and resolution. Since techniques based on next-generation sequencing are the most prevalent, and provide single-cell resolution, many bioinformatics tools for spatially resolved data are shared with single-cell RNA-seq. The analysis pipelines diverge at the level of quantification matrix, downstream of which spatial techniques require specific tools to answer key biological questions. Those questions include: (i) cell type classification; (ii) detection of genes with specific spatial distribution; (iii) identification of novel tissue regions based on gene expression patterns; (iv) cell-cell interactions. On the other hand, analysis of spatially resolved data is burdened by several specific challenges. Defining regions of interest, e.g. neoplastic tissue, often calls for manual annotation of images, which then poses a bottleneck in the pipeline. Another specific issue is the third spatial dimension and the need to expand the analysis beyond a single slice. Despite the problems, it can be predicted that the popularity of spatial techniques will keep growing until they replace single-cell assays (which will remain limited to specific cases, like blood). As soon as the computational protocol reach the maturity (e.g. bulk RNA-seq), one can foresee the expansion of spatial techniques beyond basic or translational research, even into routine medical diagnostics.",34369559,,10.1042/ETLS20210131,0
"Cell function and identity revealed by comparative scRNA-seq analysis in human nasal, bronchial and epididymis epithelia","The evolutionary relationship of cells within tissues having a similar function but located in different anatomical sites is of considerable biological interest. The development of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) protocols has greatly enhanced opportunities to address this topic. Here we focus on cells in the epithelium which lines two regions of the human respiratory tract and the male genital ducts to delineate the shared, differentiated functions of the different cell populations. Transcriptomic data were used to assess the gene expression profiles of human bronchial, nasal, and epididymal epithelium (HBE, HNE, and HEE). Bulk RNA-seq showed many shared genes expressed in cells from the nasal and bronchial epithelium and highlighted their divergence from the epididymal epithelium. ScRNA-seq in HBE and HNE cells demonstrated overlapping gene expression patterns within basal and secretory cell populations. Moreover, the distribution of cell types was altered in HNE cells derived from donors with cystic fibrosis (CF) when compared to cells from healthy donors. Next, the HBE and HNE datasets were merged and confirmed intersection of cell type gene expression profiles from the two sites. However, secretory and ciliated cells were the most abundant types in the HBE samples, while more basal cells were seen in the HNE populations. We then merged single-cell data from the epididymis to determine if overlapping functions of these cells corresponded to those in the airway. Of note, only the pulmonary ionocytes/epididymis clear cells showed a strongly conserved identity, which was confirmed by imputation in bulk RNA-seq datasets from the same cells.",35597096,PMC9357053,10.1016/j.ejcb.2022.151231,10
Single-cell transcriptomic analysis reveals genome evolution in predatory litostomatean ciliates,"Many ciliated protists prey on other large microbial organisms, including other protists and microscopic metazoans. The ciliate class Litostomatea unites both predatory and endosymbiotic species. The evolution of predation ability in ciliates remains poorly understood, in part, due to a lack of genomic data. To fill this gap, we acquired the transcriptome profiles of six predatory litostomateans using single-cell sequencing technology and investigated their transcriptomic features. Our results show that: (1) in contrast to non-predatory ciliates, the predatory litostomateans have expanded gene families associated with transmembrane activity and reactive oxidative stress response pathways, potentially as a result of cellular behaviors such as fast contraction and extension; (2) the expansion of the calcium-activated BK potassium channel gene family, which hypothetically regulates cell contractility, is an ancient evolutionary event for the class Litostomatea, suggesting a rewired metabolism associated with the hunting behavior of predatory ciliates; and (3) three whole genome duplication (WGD) events have been detected in litostomateans, with genes associated with biosynthetic processes, transmembrane activity, and calcium-activated potassium channel activity being retained during the WGD events. In addition, we explored the evolutionary relationships among 17 ciliate species, including eight litostomateans, and provided a rich foundational dataset for future in-depth phylogenomic studies of Litostomatea. Our comprehensive analyses suggest that the rewired cellular metabolism via expanded gene families and WGD events might be the potential genetic basis for the predation ability of raptorial ciliates.",38368736,,10.1016/j.ejop.2024.126062,0
Introducing single cell stereo-sequencing technology to transform the plant transcriptome landscape,"Single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) advancements have helped detect transcriptional heterogeneities in biological samples. However, scRNA-seq cannot currently provide high-resolution spatial transcriptome information or identify subcellular organs in biological samples. These limitations have led to the development of spatially enhanced-resolution omics-sequencing (Stereo-seq), which combines spatial information with single cell transcriptomics to address the challenges of scRNA-seq alone. In this review, we discuss the advantages of Stereo-seq technology. We anticipate that the application of such an integrated approach in plant research will advance our understanding of biological process in the plant transcriptomics era. We conclude with an outlook of how such integration will enhance crop improvement.",37914553,,10.1016/j.tplants.2023.10.002,4
Advanced sequencing-based high-throughput and long-read single-cell transcriptome analysis,"Cells are the fundamental building blocks of living systems, exhibiting significant heterogeneity. The transcriptome connects the cellular genotype and phenotype, and profiling single-cell transcriptomes is critical for uncovering distinct cell types, states, and the interplay between cells in development, health, and disease. Nevertheless, single-cell transcriptome analysis faces daunting challenges due to the low abundance and diverse nature of RNAs in individual cells, as well as their heterogeneous expression. The advent and continuous advancements of next-generation sequencing (NGS) and third-generation sequencing (TGS) technologies have solved these problems and facilitated the high-throughput, sensitive, full-length, and rapid profiling of single-cell RNAs. In this review, we provide a broad introduction to current methodologies for single-cell transcriptome sequencing. First, state-of-the-art advancements in high-throughput and full-length single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) platforms using NGS are reviewed. Next, TGS-based long-read scRNA-seq methods are summarized. Finally, a brief conclusion and perspectives for comprehensive single-cell transcriptome analysis are discussed.",38669201,,10.1039/d4lc00105b,0
Single Cell Transcriptome Analysis of Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells in Freshly Isolated versus Stored Blood Samples,"Background:Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are widely used as a model in the study of different human diseases. There is often a time delay from blood collection to PBMC isolation during the sampling process, which can result in an experimental bias, particularly when performing single cell RNA-seq (scRNAseq) studies.Methods:This study examined the impact of different time periods from blood draw to PBMC isolation on the subsequent transcriptome profiling of different cell types in PBMCs by scRNAseq using the 10X Chromium Single Cell Gene Expression assay.Results:Examining the five major cell types constituting the PBMC cell population, i.e., CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, NK cells, monocytes, and B cells, both common changes and cell-type-specific changes were observed in the single cell transcriptome profiling over time. In particular, the upregulation of genes regulated by NF-kB in response to TNF was observed in all five cell types. Significant changes in key genes involved in AP-1 signaling were also observed. RBC contamination was a major issue in stored blood, whereas RBC adherence had no direct impact on the cell transcriptome.Conclusions:Significant transcriptome changes were observed across different PBMC cell types as a factor of time from blood draw to PBMC isolation and as a consequence of blood storage. This should be kept in mind when interpreting experimental results.",36672883,PMC9859202,10.3390/genes14010142,1
VPAC: Variational projection for accurate clustering of single-cell transcriptomic data,"Background:Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies have advanced rapidly in recent years and enabled the quantitative characterization at a microscopic resolution. With the exponential growth of the number of cells profiled in individual scRNA-seq experiments, the demand for identifying putative cell types from the data has become a great challenge that appeals for novel computational methods. Although a variety of algorithms have recently been proposed for single-cell clustering, such limitations as low accuracy, inferior robustness, and inadequate stability greatly impede the scope of applications of these methods.Results:We propose a novel model-based algorithm, named VPAC, for accurate clustering of single-cell transcriptomic data through variational projection, which assumes that single-cell samples follow a Gaussian mixture distribution in a latent space. Through comprehensive validation experiments, we demonstrate that VPAC can not only be applied to datasets of discrete counts and normalized continuous data, but also scale up well to various data dimensionality, different dataset size and different data sparsity. We further illustrate the ability of VPAC to detect genes with strong unique signatures of a specific cell type, which may shed light on the studies in system biology. We have released a user-friendly python package of VPAC in Github ( https://github.com/ShengquanChen/VPAC ). Users can directly import our VPAC class and conduct clustering without tedious installation of dependency packages.Conclusions:VPAC enables highly accurate clustering of single-cell transcriptomic data via a statistical model. We expect to see wide applications of our method to not only transcriptome studies for fully understanding the cell identity and functionality, but also the clustering of more general data.",31074382,PMC6509870,10.1186/s12859-019-2742-4,2
hdWGCNA identifies co-expression networks in high-dimensional transcriptomics data,"Biological systems are immensely complex, organized into a multi-scale hierarchy of functional units based on tightly regulated interactions between distinct molecules, cells, organs, and organisms. While experimental methods enable transcriptome-wide measurements across millions of cells, popular bioinformatic tools do not support systems-level analysis. Here we present hdWGCNA, a comprehensive framework for analyzing co-expression networks in high-dimensional transcriptomics data such as single-cell and spatial RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). hdWGCNA provides functions for network inference, gene module identification, gene enrichment analysis, statistical tests, and data visualization. Beyond conventional single-cell RNA-seq, hdWGCNA is capable of performing isoform-level network analysis using long-read single-cell data. We showcase hdWGCNA using data from autism spectrum disorder and Alzheimer's disease brain samples, identifying disease-relevant co-expression network modules. hdWGCNA is directly compatible with Seurat, a widely used R package for single-cell and spatial transcriptomics analysis, and we demonstrate the scalability of hdWGCNA by analyzing a dataset containing nearly 1 million cells.",37426759,PMC10326379,10.1016/j.crmeth.2023.100498,38
Cell type transcriptome atlas for the planarianSchmidtea mediterranea,"The transcriptome of a cell dictates its unique cell type biology. We used single-cell RNA sequencing to determine the transcriptomes for essentially every cell type of a complete animal: the regenerative planarianSchmidtea mediterranea.Planarians contain a diverse array of cell types, possess lineage progenitors for differentiated cells (including pluripotent stem cells), and constitutively express positional information, making them ideal for this undertaking. We generated data for 66,783 cells, defining transcriptomes for known and many previously unknown planarian cell types and for putative transition states between stem and differentiated cells. We also uncovered regionally expressed genes in muscle, which harbors positional information. Identifying the transcriptomes for potentially all cell types for many organisms should be readily attainable and represents a powerful approach to metazoan biology.",29674431,PMC6563842,10.1126/science.aaq1736,183
A novel Bayesian framework for harmonizing information across tissues and studies to increase cell type deconvolution accuracy,"Computational cell type deconvolution on bulk transcriptomics data can reveal cell type proportion heterogeneity across samples. One critical factor for accurate deconvolution is the reference signature matrix for different cell types. Compared with inferring reference signature matrices from cell lines, rapidly accumulating single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data provide a richer and less biased resource. However, deriving cell type signature from scRNA-seq data is challenging due to high biological and technical noises. In this article, we introduce a novel Bayesian framework, tranSig, to improve signature matrix inference from scRNA-seq by leveraging shared cell type-specific expression patterns across different tissues and studies. Our simulations show that tranSig is robust to the number of signature genes and tissues specified in the model. Applications of tranSig to bulk RNA sequencing data from peripheral blood, bronchoalveolar lavage and aorta demonstrate its accuracy and power to characterize biological heterogeneity across groups. In summary, tranSig offers an accurate and robust approach to defining gene expression signatures of different cell types, facilitating improved in silico cell type deconvolutions.",36631398,PMC9851324,10.1093/bib/bbac616,0
Single-cell transcriptomics reveals gene expression dynamics of human fetal kidney development,"The current understanding of mammalian kidney development is largely based on mouse models. Recent landmark studies revealed pervasive differences in renal embryogenesis between mouse and human. The scarcity of detailed gene expression data in humans therefore hampers a thorough understanding of human kidney development and the possible developmental origin of kidney diseases. In this paper, we present a single-cell transcriptomics study of the human fetal kidney. We identified 22 cell types and a host of marker genes. Comparison of samples from different developmental ages revealed continuous gene expression changes in podocytes. To demonstrate the usefulness of our data set, we explored the heterogeneity of the nephrogenic niche, localized podocyte precursors, and confirmed disease-associated marker genes. With close to 18,000 renal cells from five different developmental ages, this study provides a rich resource for the elucidation of human kidney development, easily accessible through an interactive web application.",30789893,PMC6400406,10.1371/journal.pbio.3000152,66
Automatic Cell Type Annotation Using Marker Genes for Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Data,"Recent advancement in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology is gaining more and more attention. Cell type annotation plays an essential role in scRNA-seq data analysis. Several computational methods have been proposed for automatic annotation. Traditional cell type annotation is to first cluster the cells using unsupervised learning methods based on the gene expression profiles, then to label the clusters using the aggregated cluster-level expression profiles and the marker genes' information. Such procedure relies heavily on the clustering results. As the purity of clusters cannot be guaranteed, false detection of cluster features may lead to wrong annotations. In this paper, we improve this procedure and propose an Automatic Cell type Annotation Method (ACAM). ACAM delineates a clear framework to conduct automatic cell annotation through representative cluster identification, representative cluster annotation using marker genes, and the remaining cells' classification. Experiments on seven real datasets show the better performance of ACAM compared to six well-known cell type annotation methods.",36291748,PMC9599378,10.3390/biom12101539,3
Cancer biology deciphered by single-cell transcriptomic sequencing,"Tumors are complex ecosystems in which heterogeneous cancer cells interact with their microenvironment composed of diverse immune, endothelial, and stromal cells. Cancer biology had been studied using bulk genomic and gene expression profiling, which however mask the cellular diversity and average the variability among individual molecular programs. Recent advances in single-cell transcriptomic sequencing have enabled a detailed dissection of tumor ecosystems and promoted our understanding of tumorigenesis at single-cell resolution. In the present review, we discuss the main topics of recent cancer studies that have implemented single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). To study cancer cells, scRNA-seq has provided novel insights into the cancer stem-cell model, treatment resistance, and cancer metastasis. To study the tumor microenvironment, scRNA-seq has portrayed the diverse cell types and complex cellular states of both immune and non-immune cells interacting with cancer cells, with the promise to discover novel targets for future immunotherapy.",34405376,PMC8901819,10.1007/s13238-021-00868-1,16

(https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.20191130), using a single-cell RNA-seq approach, establish an atlas of human colon, rectum, and ileum epithelial cells. Their study reveals that different regions have specialized nutrient absorption preferences, microbe defenses, and endocrine function. They also identify new markers for a variety of cell types.",31922531,PMC7041719,10.1084/jem.20191997,1
Cellular origins and lineage relationships of the intestinal epithelium,"Knowledge of the development and hierarchical organization of tissues is key to understanding how they are perturbed in injury and disease, as well as how they may be therapeutically manipulated to restore homeostasis. The rapidly regenerating intestinal epithelium harbors diverse cell types and their lineage relationships have been studied using numerous approaches, from classical label-retaining and genetic lineage tracing methods to novel transcriptome-based annotations. Here, we describe the developmental trajectories that dictate differentiation and lineage specification in the intestinal epithelium. We focus on the most recent single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq)-based strategies for understanding intestinal epithelial cell lineage relationships, underscoring how they have refined our view of the development of this tissue and highlighting their advantages and limitations. We emphasize how these technologies have been applied to understand the dynamics of intestinal epithelial cells in homeostatic and injury-induced regeneration models.",34431400,PMC8560372,10.1152/ajpgi.00188.2021,7
FastCAR: fast correction for ambient RNA to facilitate differential gene expression analysis in single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets,"Cell type-specific differential gene expression analyses based on single-cell transcriptome datasets are sensitive to the presence of cell-free mRNA in the droplets containing single cells. This so-called ambient RNA contamination may differ between samples obtained from patients and healthy controls. Current ambient RNA correction methods were not developed specifically for single-cell differential gene expression (sc-DGE) analyses and might therefore not sufficiently correct for ambient RNA-derived signals. Here, we show that ambient RNA levels are highly sample-specific. We found that without ambient RNA correction, sc-DGE analyses erroneously identify transcripts originating from ambient RNA as cell type-specific disease-associated genes. We therefore developed a computationally lean and intuitive correction method, Fast Correction for Ambient RNA (FastCAR), optimized for sc-DGE analysis of scRNA-Seq datasets generated by droplet-based methods including the 10XGenomics Chromium platform. FastCAR uses the profile of transcripts observed in libraries that likely represent empty droplets to determine the level of ambient RNA in each individual sample, and then corrects for these ambient RNA gene expression values. FastCAR can be applied as part of the data pre-processing and QC in sc-DGE workflows comparing scRNA-Seq data in a health versus disease experimental design. We compared FastCAR with two methods previously developed to remove ambient RNA, SoupX and CellBender. All three methods identified additional genes in sc-DGE analyses that were not identified in the absence of ambient RNA correction. However, we show that FastCAR performs better at correcting gene expression values attributed to ambient RNA, resulting in a lower frequency of false-positive observations. Moreover, the use of FastCAR in a sc-DGE workflow increases the cell-type specificity of sc-DGE analyses across disease conditions.",38030970,PMC10687889,10.1186/s12864-023-09822-3,1
Comparative analysis of cell-cell communication at single-cell resolution,"Inference of cell-cell communication from single-cell RNA sequencing data is a powerful technique to uncover intercellular communication pathways, yet existing methods perform this analysis at the level of the cell type or cluster, discarding single-cell-level information. Here we present Scriabin, a flexible and scalable framework for comparative analysis of cell-cell communication at single-cell resolution that is performed without cell aggregation or downsampling. We use multiple published atlas-scale datasets, genetic perturbation screens and direct experimental validation to show that Scriabin accurately recovers expected cell-cell communication edges and identifies communication networks that can be obscured by agglomerative methods. Additionally, we use spatial transcriptomic data to show that Scriabin can uncover spatial features of interaction from dissociated data alone. Finally, we demonstrate applications to longitudinal datasets to follow communication pathways operating between timepoints. Our approach represents a broadly applicable strategy to reveal the full structure of niche-phenotype relationships in health and disease.",37169965,,10.1038/s41587-023-01782-z,12
A theoretical framework of immune cell phenotypic classification and discovery,"Immune cells are highly heterogeneous and show diverse phenotypes, but the underlying mechanism remains to be elucidated. In this study, we proposed a theoretical framework for immune cell phenotypic classification based on gene plasticity, which herein refers to expressional change or variability in response to conditions. The system contains two core points. One is that the functional subsets of immune cells can be further divided into subdivisions based on their highly plastic genes, and the other is that loss of phenotype accompanies gain of phenotype during phenotypic conversion. The first point suggests phenotypic stratification or layerability according to gene plasticity, while the second point reveals expressional compatibility and mutual exclusion during the change in gene plasticity states. Abundant transcriptome data analysis in this study from both microarray and RNA sequencing in human CD4 and CD8 single-positive T cells, B cells, natural killer cells and monocytes supports the logical rationality and generality, as well as expansibility, across immune cells. A collection of thousands of known immunophenotypes reported in the literature further supports that highly plastic genes play an important role in maintaining immune cell phenotypes and reveals that the current classification model is compatible with the traditionally defined functional subsets. The system provides a new perspective to understand the characteristics of dynamic, diversified immune cell phenotypes and intrinsic regulation in the immune system. Moreover, the current substantial results based on plasticitomics analysis of bulk and single-cell sequencing data provide a useful resource for big-data-driven experimental studies and knowledge discoveries.",36936975,PMC10018129,10.3389/fimmu.2023.1128423,3
DIMM-SC: a Dirichlet mixture model for clustering droplet-based single cell transcriptomic data,"Motivation:Single cell transcriptome sequencing (scRNA-Seq) has become a revolutionary tool to study cellular and molecular processes at single cell resolution. Among existing technologies, the recently developed droplet-based platform enables efficient parallel processing of thousands of single cells with direct counting of transcript copies using Unique Molecular Identifier (UMI). Despite the technology advances, statistical methods and computational tools are still lacking for analyzing droplet-based scRNA-Seq data. Particularly, model-based approaches for clustering large-scale single cell transcriptomic data are still under-explored.Results:We developed DIMM-SC, a Dirichlet Mixture Model for clustering droplet-based Single Cell transcriptomic data. This approach explicitly models UMI count data from scRNA-Seq experiments and characterizes variations across different cell clusters via a Dirichlet mixture prior. We performed comprehensive simulations to evaluate DIMM-SC and compared it with existing clustering methods such as K-means, CellTree and Seurat. In addition, we analyzed public scRNA-Seq datasets with known cluster labels and in-house scRNA-Seq datasets from a study of systemic sclerosis with prior biological knowledge to benchmark and validate DIMM-SC. Both simulation studies and real data applications demonstrated that overall, DIMM-SC achieves substantially improved clustering accuracy and much lower clustering variability compared to other existing clustering methods. More importantly, as a model-based approach, DIMM-SC is able to quantify the clustering uncertainty for each single cell, facilitating rigorous statistical inference and biological interpretations, which are typically unavailable from existing clustering methods.Availability and implementation:DIMM-SC has been implemented in a user-friendly R package with a detailed tutorial available on www.pitt.edu/∼wec47/singlecell.html.Contact:wei.chen@chp.edu or hum@ccf.org.Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",29036318,PMC6454475,10.1093/bioinformatics/btx490,24
Comprehensive evaluation of RNA-seq quantification methods for linearity,"Background:Deconvolution is a mathematical process of resolving an observed function into its constituent elements. In the field of biomedical research, deconvolution analysis is applied to obtain single cell-type or tissue specific signatures from a mixed signal and most of them follow the linearity assumption. Although recent development of next generation sequencing technology suggests RNA-seq as a fast and accurate method for obtaining transcriptomic profiles, few studies have been conducted to investigate best RNA-seq quantification methods that yield the optimum linear space for deconvolution analysis.Results:Using a benchmark RNA-seq dataset, we investigated the linearity of abundance estimated from seven most popular RNA-seq quantification methods both at the gene and isoform levels. Linearity is evaluated through parameter estimation, concordance analysis and residual analysis based on a multiple linear regression model. Results show that count data gives poor parameter estimations, large intercepts and high inter-sample variability; while TPM value from Kallisto and Salmon shows high linearity in all analyses.Conclusions:Salmon and Kallisto TPM data gives the best fit to the linear model studied. This suggests that TPM values estimated from Salmon and Kallisto are the ideal RNA-seq measurements for deconvolution studies.",28361706,PMC5374695,10.1186/s12859-017-1526-y,30
SORC: an integrated spatial omics resource in cancer,"The interactions between tumor cells and the microenvironment play pivotal roles in the initiation, progression and metastasis of cancer. The advent of spatial transcriptomics data offers an opportunity to unravel the intricate dynamics of cellular states and cell-cell interactions in cancer. Herein, we have developed an integrated spatial omics resource in cancer (SORC, http://bio-bigdata.hrbmu.edu.cn/SORC), which interactively visualizes and analyzes the spatial transcriptomics data in cancer. We manually curated currently available spatial transcriptomics datasets for 17 types of cancer, comprising 722 899 spots across 269 slices. Furthermore, we matched reference single-cell RNA sequencing data in the majority of spatial transcriptomics datasets, involving 334 379 cells and 46 distinct cell types. SORC offers five major analytical modules that address the primary requirements of spatial transcriptomics analysis, including slice annotation, identification of spatially variable genes, co-occurrence of immune cells and tumor cells, functional analysis and cell-cell communications. All these spatial transcriptomics data and in-depth analyses have been integrated into easy-to-browse and explore pages, visualized through intuitive tables and various image formats. In summary, SORC serves as a valuable resource for providing an unprecedented spatially resolved cellular map of cancer and identifying specific genes and functional pathways to enhance our understanding of the tumor microenvironment.",37811897,PMC10768140,10.1093/nar/gkad820,1
Single-cell transcriptomics sheds light on the identity and metabolism of developing leaf cells,"As the main photosynthetic instruments of vascular plants, leaves are crucial and complex plant organs. A strict organization of leaf mesophyll and epidermal cell layers orchestrates photosynthesis and gas exchange. In addition, water and nutrients for leaf growth are transported through the vascular tissue. To establish the single-cell transcriptomic landscape of these different leaf tissues, we performed high-throughput transcriptome sequencing of individual cells isolated from young leaves of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) seedlings grown in two different environmental conditions. The detection of approximately 19,000 different transcripts in over 1,800 high-quality leaf cells revealed 14 cell populations composing the young, differentiating leaf. Besides the cell populations comprising the core leaf tissues, we identified subpopulations with a distinct identity or metabolic activity. In addition, we proposed cell-type-specific markers for each of these populations. Finally, an intuitive web tool allows for browsing the presented dataset. Our data present insights on how the different cell populations constituting a developing leaf are connected via developmental, metabolic, or stress-related trajectories.",34687312,PMC8825278,10.1093/plphys/kiab489,18
Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Reveals Endothelial Cell Transcriptome Heterogeneity Under Homeostatic Laminar Flow,"Objective: Endothelial cells (ECs) that form the innermost layer of all vessels exhibit heterogeneous cell behaviors and responses to pro-angiogenic signals that are critical for vascular sprouting and angiogenesis. Once vessels form, remodeling and blood flow lead to EC quiescence, and homogeneity in cell behaviors and signaling responses. These changes are important for the function of mature vessels, but whether and at what level ECs regulate overall expression heterogeneity during this transition is poorly understood. Here, we profiled EC transcriptomic heterogeneity, and expression heterogeneity of selected proteins, under homeostatic laminar flow. Approach and Results: Single-cell RNA sequencing and fluorescence microscopy were used to characterize heterogeneity in RNA and protein gene expression levels of human ECs under homeostatic laminar flow compared to nonflow conditions. Analysis of transcriptome variance, Gini coefficient, and coefficient of variation showed that more genes increased RNA heterogeneity under laminar flow relative to genes whose expression became more homogeneous, although small subsets of cells did not follow this pattern. Analysis of a subset of genes for relative protein expression revealed little congruence between RNA and protein heterogeneity changes under flow. In contrast, the magnitude of expression level changes in RNA and protein was more coordinated among ECs in flow versus nonflow conditions. Conclusions: ECs exposed to homeostatic laminar flow showed overall increased heterogeneity in RNA expression levels, while expression heterogeneity of selected cognate proteins did not follow RNA heterogeneity changes closely. These findings suggest that EC homeostasis is imposed post-transcriptionally in response to laminar flow.",34433297,PMC8454496,10.1161/ATVBAHA.121.316797,14
Single cell transcriptomic analysis of human pluripotent stem cell chondrogenesis,"The therapeutic application of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) for cartilage regeneration is largely hindered by the low yield of chondrocytes accompanied by unpredictable and heterogeneous off-target differentiation of cells during chondrogenesis. Here, we combine bulk RNA sequencing, single cell RNA sequencing, and bioinformatic analyses, including weighted gene co-expression analysis (WGCNA), to investigate the gene regulatory networks regulating hiPSC differentiation under chondrogenic conditions. We identify specific WNTs and MITF as hub genes governing the generation of off-target differentiation into neural cells and melanocytes during hiPSC chondrogenesis. With heterocellular signaling models, we further show that WNT signaling produced by off-target cells is responsible for inducing chondrocyte hypertrophy. By targeting WNTs and MITF, we eliminate these cell lineages, significantly enhancing the yield and homogeneity of hiPSC-derived chondrocytes. Collectively, our findings identify the trajectories and molecular mechanisms governing cell fate decision in hiPSC chondrogenesis, as well as dynamic transcriptome profiles orchestrating chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation.",33441552,PMC7806634,10.1038/s41467-020-20598-y,67
Single-cell and spatially resolved analysis uncovers cell heterogeneity of breast cancer,"The heterogeneity and the complex cellular architecture have a crucial effect on breast cancer progression and response to treatment. However, deciphering the neoplastic subtypes and their spatial organization is still challenging. Here, we combine single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) with a microarray-based spatial transcriptomics (ST) to identify cell populations and their spatial distribution in breast cancer tissues. Malignant cells are clustered into distinct subpopulations. These cell clusters not only have diverse features, origins and functions, but also emerge to the crosstalk within subtypes. Furthermore, we find that these subclusters are mapped in distinct tissue regions, where discrepant enrichment of stromal cell types are observed. We also inferred the abundance of these tumorous subpopulations by deconvolution of large breast cancer RNA-seq cohorts, revealing differential association with patient survival and therapeutic response. Our study provides a novel insight for the cellular architecture of breast cancer and potential therapeutic strategies.",35241110,PMC8895670,10.1186/s13045-022-01236-0,23
A robust method to isolateDrosophilafat body nuclei for transcriptomic analysis,"Gene expression profiles are typically described at the level of the tissue or, often inDrosophila, at the level of the whole organism. Collapsing the gene expression of entire tissues into single measures averages over potentially important heterogeneity among the cells that make up that tissue. The advent of single-cell RNA-sequencing technology (sc-RNAseq) allows transcriptomic evaluation of the individual cells that make up a tissue. However, sc-RNAseq requires a high-quality suspension of viable cells or nuclei, and cell dissociation methods that yield healthy cells and nuclei are still lacking for many important tissues. The insect fat body is a polyfunctional tissue responsible for diverse physiological processes and therefore is an important target for sc-RNAseq. TheDrosophilaadult fat body consists of fragile cells that are difficult to dissociate while maintaining cell viability. As an alternative, we developed a method to isolate single fat body nuclei for RNA-seq. Our isolation method is largely free of mitochondrial contamination and yields higher capture of transcripts per nucleus compared to other nuclei preparation methods. Our method works well for single-cell nuclei sequencing and can potentially be implemented for bulk RNA-seq.",34612794,PMC8500699,10.1080/19336934.2021.1978776,3
From words to complete phrases: insight into single-cell isoforms using short and long reads,"The profiling of gene expression patterns to glean biological insights from single cells has become commonplace over the last few years. However, this approach overlooks the transcript contents that can differ between individual cells and cell populations. In this review, we describe early work in the field of single-cell short-read sequencing as well as full-length isoforms from single cells. We then describe recent work in single-cell long-read sequencing wherein some transcript elements have been observed to work in tandem. Based on earlier work in bulk tissue, we motivate the study of combination patterns of other RNA variables. Given that we are still blind to some aspects of isoform biology, we suggest possible future avenues such as CRISPR screens which can further illuminate the function of RNA variables in distinct cell populations.",37314295,PMC10807471,10.1080/21541264.2023.2213514,5
Visualizing and Interpreting Single-Cell Gene Expression Datasets with Similarity Weighted Nonnegative Embedding,"High-throughput single-cell gene expression profiling has enabled the definition of new cell types and developmental trajectories. Visualizing these datasets is crucial to biological interpretation, and a popular method is t-stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), which visualizes local patterns well but distorts global structure, such as distances between clusters. We developed similarity weighted nonnegative embedding (SWNE), which enhances interpretation of datasets by embedding the genes and factors that separate cell states on the visualization alongside the cells and maintains fidelity when visualizing local and global structure for both developmental trajectories and discrete cell types. SWNE uses nonnegative matrix factorization to decompose the gene expression matrix into biologically relevant factors; embeds the cells, genes, and factors in a 2D visualization; and uses a similarity matrix to smooth the embeddings. We demonstrate SWNE on single-cell RNA-seq data from hematopoietic progenitors and human brain cells. SWNE is available as an R package at github.com/yanwu2014/swne.",30528274,PMC6311449,10.1016/j.cels.2018.10.015,31
Optimal marker gene selection for cell type discrimination in single cell analyses,"Single-cell technologies characterize complex cell populations across multiple data modalities at unprecedented scale and resolution. Multi-omic data for single cell gene expression, in situ hybridization, or single cell chromatin states are increasingly available across diverse tissue types. When isolating specific cell types from a sample of disassociated cells or performing in situ sequencing in collections of heterogeneous cells, one challenging task is to select a small set of informative markers that robustly enable the identification and discrimination of specific cell types or cell states as precisely as possible. Given single cell RNA-seq data and a set of cellular labels to discriminate, scGeneFit selects gene markers that jointly optimize cell label recovery using label-aware compressive classification methods. This results in a substantially more robust and less redundant set of markers than existing methods, most of which identify markers that separate each cell label from the rest. When applied to a data set given a hierarchy of cell types as labels, the markers found by our method improves the recovery of the cell type hierarchy with fewer markers than existing methods using a computationally efficient and principled optimization.",33608535,PMC7895823,10.1038/s41467-021-21453-4,29
Functional-Feature-Based Data Reduction Using Sparsely Connected Autoencoders,"Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) allows for the creation of large collections of individual cells transcriptome. Unsupervised clustering is an essential element for the analysis of these data, and it represents the initial step for the identification of different cell types to investigate the cell subpopulation structure of a biological sample. However, it is possible that the clustering aggregation features do not perfectly match the underlying biology since scRNA-seq data are characterized by high noise. In this chapter, we describe a functional feature-driven data reduction approach, which could provide a better link among cell clusters and their underlying cell biology.",36495453,,10.1007/978-1-0716-2756-3_11,0
Transcriptomic changes in single yeast cells under various stress conditions,"Background:The stress response of Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been extensively studied in the past decade. However, with the advent of recent technology in single-cell transcriptome profiling, there is a new opportunity to expand and further understanding of the yeast stress response with greater resolution on a system level. To understand transcriptomic changes in baker's yeast S. cerevisiae cells under stress conditions, we sequenced 117 yeast cells under three stress treatments (hypotonic condition, glucose starvation and amino acid starvation) using a full-length single-cell RNA-Seq method.Results:We found that though single cells from the same treatment showed varying degrees of uniformity, technical noise and batch effects can confound results significantly. However, upon careful selection of samples to reduce technical artifacts and account for batch-effects, we were able to capture distinct transcriptomic signatures for different stress conditions as well as putative regulatory relationships between transcription factors and target genes.Conclusion:Our results show that a full-length single-cell based transcriptomic analysis of the yeast may help paint a clearer picture of how the model organism responds to stress than do bulk cell population-based methods.",36829151,PMC9960639,10.1186/s12864-023-09184-w,0
Automatic cell-type harmonization and integration across Human Cell Atlas datasets,"Harmonizing cell types across the single-cell community and assembling them into a common framework is central to building a standardized Human Cell Atlas. Here, we present CellHint, a predictive clustering tree-based tool to resolve cell-type differences in annotation resolution and technical biases across datasets. CellHint accurately quantifies cell-cell transcriptomic similarities and places cell types into a relationship graph that hierarchically defines shared and unique cell subtypes. Application to multiple immune datasets recapitulates expert-curated annotations. CellHint also reveals underexplored relationships between healthy and diseased lung cell states in eight diseases. Furthermore, we present a workflow for fast cross-dataset integration guided by harmonized cell types and cell hierarchy, which uncovers underappreciated cell types in adult human hippocampus. Finally, we apply CellHint to 12 tissues from 38 datasets, providing a deeply curated cross-tissue database with ∼3.7 million cells and various machine learning models for automatic cell annotation across human tissues.",38134877,,10.1016/j.cell.2023.11.026,7
An immunophenotype-coupled transcriptomic atlas of human hematopoietic progenitors,"Analysis of the human hematopoietic progenitor compartment is being transformed by single-cell multimodal approaches. Cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing (CITE-seq) enables coupled surface protein and transcriptome profiling, thereby revealing genomic programs underlying progenitor states. To perform CITE-seq systematically on primary human bone marrow cells, we used titrations with 266 CITE-seq antibodies (antibody-derived tags) and machine learning to optimize a panel of 132 antibodies. Multimodal analysis resolved >80 stem, progenitor, immune, stromal and transitional cells defined by distinctive surface markers and transcriptomes. This dataset enables flow cytometry solutions for in silico-predicted cell states and identifies dozens of cell surface markers consistently detected across donors spanning race and sex. Finally, aligning annotations from this atlas, we nominate normal marrow equivalents for acute myeloid leukemia stem cell populations that differ in clinical response. This atlas serves as an advanced digital resource for hematopoietic progenitor analyses in human health and disease.",38514887,PMC11003869,10.1038/s41590-024-01782-4,1
Single-cell transcriptome analysis reveals the dynamics of human immune cells during early fetal skin development,"The immune system of skin develops in stages in mice. However, the developmental dynamics of immune cells in human skin remains elusive. Here, we perform transcriptome profiling of CD45+hematopoietic cells in human fetal skin at an estimated gestational age of 10-17 weeks by single-cell RNA sequencing. A total of 13 immune cell types are identified. Skin macrophages show dynamic heterogeneity over the course of skin development. A major shift in lymphoid cell developmental states occurs from the first to the second trimester that implies an in situ differentiation process. Gene expression analysis reveals a typical developmental program in immune cells in accordance with their functional maturation, possibly involving metabolic reprogramming. Finally, we identify transcription factors (TFs) that potentially regulate cellular transitions by comparing TFs and TF target gene networks. These findings provide detailed insight into how the immune system of the human skin is established during development.",34380039,,10.1016/j.celrep.2021.109524,11
Model-based deep embedding for constrained clustering analysis of single cell RNA-seq data,"Clustering is a critical step in single cell-based studies. Most existing methods support unsupervised clustering without the a priori exploitation of any domain knowledge. When confronted by the high dimensionality and pervasive dropout events of scRNA-Seq data, purely unsupervised clustering methods may not produce biologically interpretable clusters, which complicates cell type assignment. In such cases, the only recourse is for the user to manually and repeatedly tweak clustering parameters until acceptable clusters are found. Consequently, the path to obtaining biologically meaningful clusters can be ad hoc and laborious. Here we report a principled clustering method named scDCC, that integrates domain knowledge into the clustering step. Experiments on various scRNA-seq datasets from thousands to tens of thousands of cells show that scDCC can significantly improve clustering performance, facilitating the interpretability of clusters and downstream analyses, such as cell type assignment.",33767149,PMC7994574,10.1038/s41467-021-22008-3,22
"Spotless, a reproducible pipeline for benchmarking cell type deconvolution in spatial transcriptomics","Spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies allow the profiling of the transcriptome of cells while keeping their spatial context. Since most commercial untargeted ST technologies do not yet operate at single-cell resolution, computational methods such as deconvolution are often used to infer the cell type composition of each sequenced spot. We benchmarked 11 deconvolution methods using 63 silver standards, 3 gold standards, and 2 case studies on liver and melanoma tissues. We developed a simulation engine calledsynthspotto generate silver standards from single-cell RNA-sequencing data, while gold standards are generated by pooling single cells from targeted ST data. We evaluated methods based on their performance, stability across different reference datasets, and scalability. We found that cell2location and RCTD are the top-performing methods, but surprisingly, a simple regression model outperforms almost half of the dedicated spatial deconvolution methods. Furthermore, we observe that the performance of all methods significantly decreased in datasets with highly abundant or rare cell types. Our results are reproducible in a Nextflow pipeline, which also allows users to generate synthetic data, run deconvolution methods and optionally benchmark them on their dataset (https://github.com/saeyslab/spotless-benchmark).",38787371,PMC11126312,10.7554/eLife.88431,0
Optimization of library preparation based on SMART for ultralow RNA-seq in mice brain tissues,"Background:Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides new insights to address biological and medical questions, and it will benefit more from the ultralow input RNA or subcellular sequencing.Results:Here, we present a highly sensitive library construction protocol for ultralow input RNA sequencing (ulRNA-seq). We systematically evaluate experimental conditions of this protocol, such as reverse transcriptase, template-switching oligos (TSO), and template RNA structure. It was found that Maxima H Minus reverse transcriptase and rN modified TSO, as well as all RNA templates capped with m7G improved the sequencing sensitivity and low abundance gene detection ability. RNA-seq libraries were successfully prepared from total RNA samples as low as 0.5 pg, and more than 2000 genes have been identified.Conclusions:The ability of low abundance gene detection and sensitivity were largely enhanced with this optimized protocol. It was also confirmed in single-cell sequencing, that more genes and cell markers were identified compared to conventional sequencing method. We expect that ulRNA-seq will sequence and transcriptome characterization for the subcellular of disease tissue, to find the corresponding treatment plan.",34758728,PMC8579666,10.1186/s12864-021-08132-w,4
Single cell transcriptomics clarifies the basophil differentiation trajectory and identifies pre-basophils upstream of mature basophils,"Basophils are the rarest granulocytes and are recognized as critical cells for type 2 immune responses. However, their differentiation pathway remains to be fully elucidated. Here, we assess the ontogenetic trajectory of basophils by single-cell RNA sequence analysis. Combined with flow cytometric and functional analyses, we identify c-Kit-CLEC12Ahipre-basophils located downstream of pre-basophil and mast cell progenitors (pre-BMPs) and upstream of CLEC12Alomature basophils. The transcriptomic analysis predicts that the pre-basophil population includes previously-defined basophil progenitor (BaP)-like cells in terms of gene expression profile. Pre-basophils are highly proliferative and respond better to non-IgE stimuli but less to antigen plus IgE stimulation than do mature basophils. Although pre-basophils usually remain in the bone marrow, they emerge in helminth-infected tissues, probably through IL-3-mediated inhibition of their retention in the bone marrow. Thus, the present study identifies pre-basophils that bridge the gap between pre-BMPs and mature basophils during basophil ontogeny.",37202383,PMC10195816,10.1038/s41467-023-38356-1,7
Single-Cell RNA Sequencing of Calvarial and Long-Bone Endocortical Cells,"Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) is emerging as a powerful technology to examine transcriptomes of individual cells. We determined whether scRNA-Seq could be used to detect the effect of environmental and pharmacologic perturbations on osteoblasts. We began with a commonly used in vitro system in which freshly isolated neonatal mouse calvarial cells are expanded and induced to produce a mineralized matrix. We used scRNA-Seq to compare the relative cell type abundances and the transcriptomes of freshly isolated cells to those that had been cultured for 12 days in vitro. We observed that the percentage of macrophage-like cells increased from 6% in freshly isolated calvarial cells to 34% in cultured cells. We also found that Bglap transcripts were abundant in freshly isolated osteoblasts but nearly undetectable in the cultured calvarial cells. Thus, scRNA-Seq revealed significant differences between heterogeneity of cells in vivo and in vitro. We next performed scRNA-Seq on freshly recovered long bone endocortical cells from mice that received either vehicle or sclerostin-neutralizing antibody for 1 week. We were unable to detect significant changes in bone anabolism-associated transcripts in immature and mature osteoblasts recovered from mice treated with sclerostin-neutralizing antibody; this might be a consequence of being underpowered to detect modest changes in gene expression, because only 7% of the sequenced endocortical cells were osteoblasts and a limited portion of their transcriptomes were sampled. We conclude that scRNA-Seq can detect changes in cell abundance, identity, and gene expression in skeletally derived cells. In order to detect modest changes in osteoblast gene expression at the single-cell level in the appendicular skeleton, larger numbers of osteoblasts from endocortical bone are required. © 2020 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.",32427356,PMC8265023,10.1002/jbmr.4052,34
Systematic Comparison of High-throughput Single-Cell and Single-Nucleus Transcriptomes during Cardiomyocyte Differentiation,"A comprehensive reference map of all cell types in the human body is necessary for improving our understanding of fundamental biological processes and in diagnosing and treating disease. High-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing techniques have emerged as powerful tools to identify and characterize cell types in complex and heterogeneous tissues. However, extracting intact cells from tissues and organs is often technically challenging or impossible, for example in heart or brain tissue. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing provides an alternative way to obtain transcriptome profiles of such tissues. To systematically assess the differences between high-throughput single-cell and single-nuclei RNA-seq approaches, we compared Drop-seq and DroNc-seq, two microfluidic-based 3' RNA capture technologies that profile total cellular and nuclear RNA, respectively, during a time course experiment of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) differentiating into cardiomyocytes. Clustering of time-series transcriptomes from Drop-seq and DroNc-seq revealed six distinct cell types, five of which were found in both techniques. Furthermore, single-cell trajectories reconstructed from both techniques reproduced expected differentiation dynamics. We then applied DroNc-seq to postmortem heart tissue to test its performance on heterogeneous human tissue samples. Our data confirm that DroNc-seq yields similar results to Drop-seq on matched samples and can be successfully used to generate reference maps for the human cell atlas.",32001747,PMC6992778,10.1038/s41598-020-58327-6,44
HUSCH: an integrated single-cell transcriptome atlas for human tissue gene expression visualization and analyses,"Understanding gene expression patterns across different human cell types is crucial for investigating mechanisms of cell type differentiation, disease occurrence and progression. The recent development of single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) technologies significantly boosted the characterization of cell type heterogeneities in different human tissues. However, the huge number of datasets in the public domain also posed challenges in data integration and reuse. We present Human Universal Single Cell Hub (HUSCH, http://husch.comp-genomics.org), an atlas-scale curated database that integrates single-cell transcriptomic profiles of nearly 3 million cells from 185 high-quality human scRNA-seq datasets from 45 different tissues. All the data in HUSCH were uniformly processed and annotated with a standard workflow. In the single dataset module, HUSCH provides interactive gene expression visualization, differentially expressed genes, functional analyses, transcription regulators and cell-cell interaction analyses for each cell type cluster. Besides, HUSCH integrated different datasets in the single tissue module and performs data integration, batch correction, and cell type harmonization. This allows a comprehensive visualization and analysis of gene expression within each tissue based on single-cell datasets from multiple sources and platforms. HUSCH is a flexible and comprehensive data portal that enables searching, visualizing, analyzing, and downloading single-cell gene expression for the human tissue atlas.",36318258,PMC9825509,10.1093/nar/gkac1001,8
Bento: a toolkit for subcellular analysis of spatial transcriptomics data,"The spatial organization of molecules in a cell is essential for their functions. While current methods focus on discerning tissue architecture, cell-cell interactions, and spatial expression patterns, they are limited to the multicellular scale. We present Bento, a Python toolkit that takes advantage of single-molecule information to enable spatial analysis at the subcellular scale. Bento ingests molecular coordinates and segmentation boundaries to perform three analyses: defining subcellular domains, annotating localization patterns, and quantifying gene-gene colocalization. We demonstrate MERFISH, seqFISH + , Molecular Cartography, and Xenium datasets.

Site-specific gene expression analysis using an automated tissue micro-dissection punching system,"Site-specific gene expression analyses are important for understanding tissue functions. Despite rapid developments in DNA-related technologies, the site-specific analysis of whole genome expression for a tissue remains challenging. Thus, a new tool is required for capturing multiple tissue micro-dissections or single cells while retaining the positional information. Here, we describe the development of such a system, which can pick up micro-dissections by punching a tissue repeatedly in a very short period, e.g., 5 s/sampling cycle. A photo of the punched tissue provides information on the dissected positions, allowing site-specific gene expression analysis. We demonstrate the site-specific analysis of a frozen tissue slice of mouse brain by analyzing many micro-dissections produced from the tissue at a 300-μm pitch. The site-specific analysis provided new insights into the gene expression profiles in a tissue and on tissue functions. The analysis of site-specific whole genome expression may therefore, open new avenues in life science.",28659603,PMC5489509,10.1038/s41598-017-04616-6,10
vissE: a versatile tool to identify and visualise higher-order molecular phenotypes from functional enrichment analysis,"Functional analysis of high throughput experiments using pathway analysis is now ubiquitous. Though powerful, these methods often produce thousands of redundant results owing to knowledgebase redundancies upstream. This scale of results hinders extensive exploration by biologists and can lead to investigator biases due to previous knowledge and expectations. To address this issue, we present vissE, a flexible network-based analysis and visualisation tool that organises information into semantic categories and provides various visualisation modules to characterise them with respect to the underlying data, thus providing a comprehensive view of the biological system. We demonstrate vissE's versatility by applying it to three different technologies: bulk, single-cell and spatial transcriptomics. Applying vissE to a factor analysis of a breast cancer spatial transcriptomic data, we identified stromal phenotypes that support tumour dissemination. Its adaptability allows vissE to enhance all existing gene-set enrichment and pathway analysis workflows, empowering biologists during molecular discovery.",38331751,PMC10854147,10.1186/s12859-024-05676-y,0
Isolation and Transcriptome Analysis of Plant Cell Types,"In multicellular organisms, developmental programming and environmental responses can be highly divergent in different cell types or even within cells, which is known as cellular heterogeneity. In recent years, single-cell and cell-type isolation combined with next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques have become important tools for studying biological processes at single-cell resolution. However, isolating plant cells is relatively more difficult due to the presence of plant cell walls, which limits the application of single-cell approaches in plants. This protocol describes a robust procedure for fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-based single-cell and cell-type isolation with plant cells, which is suitable for downstream multi-omics analysis and other studies. Using Arabidopsis root fluorescent marker lines, we demonstrate how particular cell types, such as xylem-pole pericycle cells, lateral root initial cells, lateral root cap cells, cortex cells, and endodermal cells, are isolated. Furthermore, an effective downstream transcriptome analysis method using Smart-seq2 is also provided. The cell isolation method and transcriptome analysis techniques can be adapted to other cell types and plant species and have broad application potential in plant science.",37092828,,10.3791/64913,0
Comparative Analysis of Droplet-Based Ultra-High-Throughput Single-Cell RNA-Seq Systems,"Since its establishment in 2009, single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has been a major driver behind progress in biomedical research. In developmental biology and stem cell studies, the ability to profile single cells confers particular benefits. Although most studies still focus on individual tissues or organs, the recent development of ultra-high-throughput single-cell RNA-seq has demonstrated potential power in characterizing more complex systems or even the entire body. However, although multiple ultra-high-throughput single-cell RNA-seq systems have attracted attention, no systematic comparison of these systems has been performed. Here, with the same cell line and bioinformatics pipeline, we developed directly comparable datasets for each of three widely used droplet-based ultra-high-throughput single-cell RNA-seq systems, inDrop, Drop-seq, and 10X Genomics Chromium. Although each system is capable of profiling single-cell transcriptomes, their detailed comparison revealed the distinguishing features and suitable applications for each system.",30472192,,10.1016/j.molcel.2018.10.020,164

Identification of genes expressed in a mesenchymal subset regulating prostate organogenesis using tissue and single cell transcriptomics,"Prostate organogenesis involves epithelial growth controlled by inductive signalling from specialised mesenchymal subsets. To identify pathways active in mesenchyme we used tissue and single cell transcriptomics to define mesenchymal subsets and subset-specific transcript expression. We documented transcript expression using Tag-seq and RNA-seq in female rat Ventral Mesenchymal Pad (VMP) as well as adjacent urethra comprised of smooth muscle and peri-urethral mesenchyme. Transcripts enriched in female VMP were identified with Tag-seq of microdissected tissue, RNA-seq of cell populations, and single cells. We identified 400 transcripts as enriched in the VMP using bio-informatic comparisons of Tag-seq and RNA-seq data, and 44 were confirmed by single cell RNA-seq. Cell subset analysis showed that VMP and adjacent mesenchyme were composed of distinct cell types and that each tissue contained two subgroups. Markers for these subgroups were highly subset specific. Thirteen transcripts were validated by qPCR to confirm cell specific expression in microdissected tissues, as well as expression in neonatal prostate. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated that Ebf3 and Meis2 showed a restricted expression pattern in female VMP and prostate mesenchyme. We conclude that prostate inductive mesenchyme shows limited cellular heterogeneity and that transcriptomic analysis identified new mesenchymal subset transcripts associated with prostate organogenesis.",29180763,PMC5703996,10.1038/s41598-017-16685-8,5
Transcriptomic profiling of immune cells in murine polymicrobial sepsis,"Introduction:Various immune cell types play critical roles in sepsis with numerous distinct subsets exhibiting unique phenotypes even within the same cell population. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables comprehensive transcriptome profiling and unbiased cell classification. In this study, we have unveiled the transcriptomic landscape of immune cells in sepsis through scRNA-seq analysis.Methods:We induced sepsis in mice by cecal ligation and puncture. 20 h after the surgery, the spleen and peritoneal lavage were collected. Single-cell suspensions were processed using a 10× Genomics pipeline and sequenced on an Illumina platform. Count matrices were generated using the Cell Ranger pipeline, which maps reads to the mouse reference transcriptome, GRCm38/mm10. Subsequent scRNA-seq analysis was performed using the R package Seurat.Results:After quality control, we subjected the entire data set to unsupervised classification. Four major clusters were identified as neutrophils, macrophages, B cells, and T cells according to their putative markers. Based on the differentially expressed genes, we identified activated pathways in sepsis for each cell type. In neutrophils, pathways related to inflammatory signaling, such as NF-κB and responses to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), cytokines, and hypoxia were activated. In macrophages, activated pathways were the ones related to cell aging, inflammatory signaling, and responses to PAMPs. In B cells, pathways related to endoplasmic reticulum stress were activated. In T cells, activated pathways were the ones related to inflammatory signaling, responses to PAMPs, and acute lung injury. Next, we further classified each cell type into subsets. Neutrophils consisted of four clusters. Some subsets were activated in inflammatory signaling or cell metabolism, whereas others possessed immunoregulatory or aging properties. Macrophages consisted of four clusters, namely, the ones with enhanced aging, lymphocyte activation, extracellular matrix organization, or cytokine activity. B cells consisted of four clusters, including the ones possessing the phenotype of cell maturation or aging. T cells consisted of six clusters, whose phenotypes include molecular translocation or cell activation.Conclusions:Transcriptomic analysis by scRNA-seq has unveiled a comprehensive spectrum of immune cell responses and distinct subsets in the context of sepsis. These findings are poised to enhance our understanding of sepsis pathophysiology, offering avenues for targeting novel molecules, cells, and pathways to combat infectious diseases.",38343542,PMC10853340,10.3389/fimmu.2024.1347453,0
Dissecting the initiation of female meiosis in the mouse at single-cell resolution,"Meiosis is one of the most finely orchestrated events during gametogenesis with distinct developmental patterns in males and females. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in this process remain not well known. Here, we report detailed transcriptome analyses of cell populations present in the mouse female gonadal ridges (E11.5) and the embryonic ovaries from E12.5 to E14.5 using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA seq). These periods correspond with the initiation and progression of meiosis throughout the first stage of prophase I. We identified 13 transcriptionally distinct cell populations and 7 transcriptionally distinct germ cell subclusters that correspond to mitotic (3 clusters) and meiotic (4 clusters) germ cells. By analysing cluster-specific gene expression profiles, we found four cell clusters correspond to different cell stages en route to meiosis and characterized their detailed transcriptome dynamics. Our scRNA seq analysis here represents a new important resource for deciphering the molecular pathways driving female meiosis initiation.",32367190,PMC11072979,10.1007/s00018-020-03533-8,24
Single-cell profiling of the developing mouse brain and spinal cord with split-pool barcoding,"To facilitate scalable profiling of single cells, we developed split-pool ligation-based transcriptome sequencing (SPLiT-seq), a single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) method that labels the cellular origin of RNA through combinatorial barcoding. SPLiT-seq is compatible with fixed cells or nuclei, allows efficient sample multiplexing, and requires no customized equipment. We used SPLiT-seq to analyze 156,049 single-nucleus transcriptomes from postnatal day 2 and 11 mouse brains and spinal cords. More than 100 cell types were identified, with gene expression patterns corresponding to cellular function, regional specificity, and stage of differentiation. Pseudotime analysis revealed transcriptional programs driving four developmental lineages, providing a snapshot of early postnatal development in the murine central nervous system. SPLiT-seq provides a path toward comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic analysis of other similarly complex multicellular systems.",29545511,PMC7643870,10.1126/science.aam8999,531
Epigenomic and transcriptomic analysis of chronic inflammatory diseases,"Chronic inflammatory diseases (CIDs) have complex pathologies that result from aberrant and persistent immune responses. However, the precise triggers and mechanisms remain elusive. An important aspect of CID research focuses on epigenetics modifications, which regulate gene expression and provide a dynamic transcriptional response to inflammation. In recent years, mounting evidence has demonstrated an association between epigenomic and transcriptomic dysregulation and the phenotypes of CIDs. In particular, epigenetic changes at cis-regulatory elements have provided new insights for immune cell-specific alterations that contribute to disease etiology. Furthermore, the advancements in single-cell genomics provide novel solutions to cell type heterogeneity, which has long posed challenges for CID diagnosis and treatment. In this review, we discuss the current state of epigenomics research of CID and the insights derived from single-cell transcriptomic and epigenomic studies.",33638813,,10.1007/s13258-021-01045-8,2
Scalable in situ single-cell profiling by electrophoretic capture of mRNA using EEL FISH,"Methods to spatially profile the transcriptome are dominated by a trade-off between resolution and throughput. Here we develop a method named Enhanced ELectric Fluorescence in situ Hybridization (EEL FISH) that can rapidly process large tissue samples without compromising spatial resolution. By electrophoretically transferring RNA from a tissue section onto a capture surface, EEL speeds up data acquisition by reducing the amount of imaging needed, while ensuring that RNA molecules move straight down toward the surface, preserving single-cell resolution. We apply EEL on eight entire sagittal sections of the mouse brain and measure the expression patterns of up to 440 genes to reveal complex tissue organization. Moreover, EEL can be used to study challenging human samples by removing autofluorescent lipofuscin, enabling the spatial transcriptome of the human visual cortex to be visualized. We provide full hardware specifications, all protocols and complete software for instrument control, image processing, data analysis and visualization.",36138169,PMC9931581,10.1038/s41587-022-01455-3,34
The technology and biology of single-cell RNA sequencing,"The differences between individual cells can have profound functional consequences, in both unicellular and multicellular organisms. Recently developed single-cell mRNA-sequencing methods enable unbiased, high-throughput, and high-resolution transcriptomic analysis of individual cells. This provides an additional dimension to transcriptomic information relative to traditional methods that profile bulk populations of cells. Already, single-cell RNA-sequencing methods have revealed new biology in terms of the composition of tissues, the dynamics of transcription, and the regulatory relationships between genes. Rapid technological developments at the level of cell capture, phenotyping, molecular biology, and bioinformatics promise an exciting future with numerous biological and medical applications.",26000846,,10.1016/j.molcel.2015.04.005,519
The Prognostic Potential of Human Prostate Cancer-Associated Macrophage Subtypes as Revealed by Single-Cell Transcriptomics,"Macrophages in the tumor microenvironment are causally linked with prostate cancer development and progression, yet little is known about their composition in neoplastic human tissue. By performing single cell transcriptomic analysis of human prostate cancer resident macrophages, three distinct populations were identified in the diseased prostate. Unexpectedly, no differences were observed between macrophages isolated from the tumorous and nontumorous portions of the prostatectomy specimens. Markers associated with canonical M1 and M2 macrophage phenotypes were identifiable, however these were not the main factors defining unique subtypes. The genes selectively associated with each macrophage cluster were used to develop a gene signature which was highly associated with both recurrence-free and metastasis-free survival. These results highlight the relevance of tissue-specific macrophage subtypes in the tumor microenvironment for prostate cancer progression and demonstrates the utility of profiling single-cell transcriptomics in human tumor samples as a strategy to design gene classifiers for patient prognostication. IMPLICATIONS: The specific macrophage subtypes present in a diseased human prostate have prognostic value, suggesting that the relative proportions of these populations are related to patient outcome. Understanding the relative contributions of these subtypes will not only inform patient prognostication, but will enable personalized immunotherapeutic strategies to increase beneficial populations or reduce detrimental populations.",34131070,PMC9398107,10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-20-0740,14
Predicting heterogeneity in clone-specific therapeutic vulnerabilities using single-cell transcriptomic signatures,"While understanding molecular heterogeneity across patients underpins precision oncology, there is increasing appreciation for taking intra-tumor heterogeneity into account. Based on large-scale analysis of cancer omics datasets, we highlight the importance of intra-tumor transcriptomic heterogeneity (ITTH) for predicting clinical outcomes. Leveraging single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) with a recommender system (CaDRReS-Sc), we show that heterogeneous gene-expression signatures can predict drug response with high accuracy (80%). Using patient-proximal cell lines, we established the validity of CaDRReS-Sc's monotherapy (Pearson r>0.6) and combinatorial predictions targeting clone-specific vulnerabilities (>10% improvement). Applying CaDRReS-Sc to rapidly expanding scRNA-seq compendiums can serve as in silico screen to accelerate drug-repurposing studies.

Single-cell transcriptomic characterization of a gastrulating human embryo,"Gastrulation is the fundamental process in all multicellular animals through which the basic body plan is first laid down1-4. It is pivotal in generating cellular diversity coordinated with spatial patterning. In humans, gastrulation occurs in the third week after fertilization. Our understanding of this process in humans is relatively limited and based primarily on historical specimens5-8, experimental models9-12or, more recently, in vitro cultured samples13-16. Here we characterize in a spatially resolved manner the single-cell transcriptional profile of an entire gastrulating human embryo, staged to be between 16 and 19 days after fertilization. We use these data to analyse the cell types present and to make comparisons with other model systems. In addition to pluripotent epiblast, we identified primordial germ cells, red blood cells and various mesodermal and endodermal cell types. This dataset offers a unique glimpse into a central but inaccessible stage of our development. This characterization provides new context for interpreting experiments in other model systems and represents a valuable resource for guiding directed differentiation of human cells in vitro.",34789876,PMC7615353,10.1038/s41586-021-04158-y,114
Are circulating endothelial cells the next target for transcriptome-level pathway analysis in ARDS?,"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has had no mortality-improving pharmacological intervention despite 50 years of high-caliber research due to its heterogeneity (Huppert LA, Matthay MA, Ware LB.Semin Respir Crit Care Med40: 31-39, 2019). For the field to advance, better definitions for ARDS subgroups that more uniformly respond to therapies are needed (Bos LDJ, Scicluna BP, Ong DSY, Cremer O, van der Poll T, Schultz MJ.Am J Respir Crit Care Med200: 42-50, 2019; Dickson RP, Schultz MJ, T van der P, Schouten LR, Falkowski NR, Luth JE, Sjoding MW, Brown CA, Chanderraj R, Huffnagle GB, Bos LDJ, Biomarker Analysis in Septic ICU Patients (BASIC) Consortium.Am J Respir Crit Care Med201: 555-563, 2020; Sinha P, Calfee CS.Am J Respir Crit Care Med200: 4-6, 2019; Calfee CS, Delucchi K, Parsons PE, Thompson BT, Ware LB, Matthay MA, NHLBI ARDS Network.Lancet Respir Med2: 611-620, 2014; Hendrickson CM, Matthay MA.Pulm Circ8: 1-12, 2018). A plethora of high-quality clinical research has uncovered the next generation of soluble biomarkers that provide the predictive enrichment necessary for trial recruitment; however, plasma-soluble markers do not specify the damaged organ of origin nor do they provide insight into disease mechanisms. In this perspective, we make the case for querying the transcriptome of circulating endothelial cells (CECs), which when shed from vessels after inflammatory insult, become heralds of site-specific inflammatory damage. We review the application of CEC quantification to multiple disease phenotypes (including myocardial infarction, vasculitides, cancer, and ARDS), in each case supporting the association of CEC number with disease severity. We also argue for the utility of single-cell RNA transcriptomics to the understanding of cell-specific contributions to disease pathophysiology and its potential to uncover novel insight on signals contributing to CEC shedding in ARDS.",36749906,PMC10110698,10.1152/ajplung.00353.2022,0
Single-cell RNA counting at allele and isoform resolution using Smart-seq3,"Large-scale sequencing of RNA from individual cells can reveal patterns of gene, isoform and allelic expression across cell types and states1. However, current short-read single-cell RNA-sequencing methods have limited ability to count RNAs at allele and isoform resolution, and long-read sequencing techniques lack the depth required for large-scale applications across cells2,3. Here we introduce Smart-seq3, which combines full-length transcriptome coverage with a 5' unique molecular identifier RNA counting strategy that enables in silico reconstruction of thousands of RNA molecules per cell. Of the counted and reconstructed molecules, 60% could be directly assigned to allelic origin and 30-50% to specific isoforms, and we identified substantial differences in isoform usage in different mouse strains and human cell types. Smart-seq3 greatly increased sensitivity compared to Smart-seq2, typically detecting thousands more transcripts per cell. We expect that Smart-seq3 will enable large-scale characterization of cell types and states across tissues and organisms.",32518404,,10.1038/s41587-020-0497-0,236
Cell type prioritization in single-cell data,"We present Augur, a method to prioritize the cell types most responsive to biological perturbations in single-cell data. Augur employs a machine-learning framework to quantify the separability of perturbed and unperturbed cells within a high-dimensional space. We validate our method on single-cell RNA sequencing, chromatin accessibility and imaging transcriptomics datasets, and show that Augur outperforms existing methods based on differential gene expression. Augur identified the neural circuits restoring locomotion in mice following spinal cord neurostimulation.",32690972,PMC7610525,10.1038/s41587-020-0605-1,58
A critical assessment of clustering algorithms to improve cell clustering and identification in single-cell transcriptome study,"Cell clustering is typically the initial step in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analyses. The performance of clustering considerably impacts the validity and reproducibility of cell identification. A variety of clustering algorithms have been developed for scRNA-seq data. These algorithms generate cell label sets that assign each cell to a cluster. However, different algorithms usually yield different label sets, which can introduce variations in cell-type identification based on the generated label sets. Currently, the performance of these algorithms has not been systematically evaluated in single-cell transcriptome studies. Herein, we performed a critical assessment of seven state-of-the-art clustering algorithms including four deep learning-based clustering algorithms and commonly used methods Seurat, Cosine-based Tanimoto similarity-refined graph for community detection using Leiden's algorithm (CosTaL) and Single-cell consensus clustering (SC3). We used diverse evaluation indices based on 10 different scRNA-seq benchmarks to systematically evaluate their clustering performance. Our results show that CosTaL, Seurat, Deep Embedding for Single-cell Clustering (DESC) and SC3 consistently outperformed Single-Cell Clustering Assessment Framework and scDeepCluster based on nine effectiveness scores. Notably, CosTaL and DESC demonstrated superior performance in clustering specific cell types. The performance of the single-cell Variational Inference tools varied across different datasets, suggesting its sensitivity to certain dataset characteristics. Notably, DESC exhibited promising results for cell subtype identification and capturing cellular heterogeneity. In addition, SC3 requires more memory and exhibits slower computation speed compared to other algorithms for the same dataset. In sum, this study provides useful guidance for selecting appropriate clustering methods in scRNA-seq data analysis.",38168839,PMC10782910,10.1093/bib/bbad497,0
Benchmarking full-length transcript single cell mRNA sequencing protocols,"Background:Single cell mRNA sequencing technologies have transformed our understanding of cellular heterogeneity and identity. For sensitive discovery or clinical marker estimation where high transcript capture per cell is needed only plate-based techniques currently offer sufficient resolution.Results:Here, we present a performance evaluation of four different plate-based scRNA-seq protocols. Our evaluation is aimed towards applications taxing high gene detection sensitivity, reproducibility between samples, and minimum hands-on time, as is required, for example, in clinical use. We included two commercial kits, NEBNext® Single Cell/ Low Input RNA Library Prep Kit (NEB®), SMART-seq® HT kit (Takara®), and the non-commercial protocols Genome & Transcriptome sequencing (G&T) and SMART-seq3 (SS3). G&T delivered the highest detection of genes per single cell. SS3 presented the highest gene detection per single cell at the lowest price. Takara® kit presented similar high gene detection per single cell, and high reproducibility between samples, but at the absolute highest price. NEB® delivered a lower detection of genes but remains an alternative to more expensive commercial kits.Conclusion:For the tested kits we found that ease-of-use came at higher prices. Takara can be selected for its ease-of-use to analyse a few samples, but we recommend the cheaper G&T-seq or SS3 for laboratories where a substantial sample flow can be expected.",36581800,PMC9801581,10.1186/s12864-022-09014-5,2
Single-cell transcriptomics reveals multiple chemoresistant properties in leukemic stem and progenitor cells in pediatric AML,"Background:Cancer patients can achieve dramatic responses to chemotherapy yet retain resistant tumor cells, which ultimately results in relapse. Although xenograft model studies have identified several cellular and molecular features that are associated with chemoresistance in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), to what extent AML patients exhibit these properties remains largely unknown.Results:We apply single-cell RNA sequencing to paired pre- and post-chemotherapy whole bone marrow samples obtained from 13 pediatric AML patients who had achieved disease remission, and distinguish AML clusters from normal cells based on their unique transcriptomic profiles. Approximately 50% of leukemic stem and progenitor populations actively express leukemia stem cell (LSC) and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) signatures, respectively. These clusters have a higher chance of tolerating therapy and exhibit an enhanced metabolic program in response to treatment. Interestingly, the transmembrane receptor CD69 is highly expressed in chemoresistant hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)-like populations (named the CD69+HSC-like subpopulation). Furthermore, overexpression of CD69 results in suppression of the mTOR signaling pathway and promotion of cell quiescence and adhesion in vitro. Finally, the presence of CD69+HSC-like cells is associated with unfavorable genetic mutations, the persistence of residual tumor cells in chemotherapy, and poor outcomes in independent pediatric and adult public AML cohorts.Conclusions:Our analysis reveals leukemia stem cell and OXPHOS as two major chemoresistant features in human AML patients. CD69 may serve as a potential biomarker in defining a subpopulation of chemoresistant leukemia stem cells. These findings have important implications for targeting residual chemo-surviving AML cells.",37653425,PMC10472599,10.1186/s13059-023-03031-7,9
Representation learning of RNA velocity reveals robust cell transitions,"RNA velocity is a promising technique for quantifying cellular transitions from single-cell transcriptome experiments and revealing transient cellular dynamics among a heterogeneous cell population. However, the cell transitions estimated from high-dimensional RNA velocity are often unstable or inaccurate, partly due to the high technical noise and less informative projection. Here, we present Velocity Autoencoder (VeloAE), a tailored representation learning method, to learn a low-dimensional representation of RNA velocity on which cellular transitions can be robustly estimated. On various experimental datasets, we show that VeloAE can both accurately identify stimulation dynamics in time-series designs and effectively capture expected cellular differentiation in different biological systems. VeloAE, therefore, enhances the usefulness of RNA velocity for studying a wide range of biological processes.",34873054,PMC8670433,10.1073/pnas.2105859118,15
[Analysis of differential genes and metabolic pathway related to functional male sterility in eggplant],"Based on observing the cytological characteristics of the flower buds of the functional male sterile line (S13) and the fertile line (F142) in eggplant, it was found that the disintegration period of the annular cell clusters in S13 anther was 2 days later than that of F142, and the cells of stomiun tissue and tapetum in F142 disintegrated on the blooming day, while it did not happen in S13. The comparative transcriptomic analysis showed that there were 1 436 differential expression genes (DEGs) (651 up-regulated and 785 down-regulated) in anthers of F142 and S13 at 8, 5 days before flowering and flowering day. The significance analysis of GO enrichment indicated that there were more unigene clusters involved in single cell biological process, metabolism process and cell process, and more catalytic activity and binding function were involved in molecular functions. Through KEGG annotation we found that the common DEGs were mainly enriched in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, metabolic pathway, protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum, biosynthesis of amino acids, carbon metabolism and plant hormone signal transduction. The fifteen genes co-expression modules were identified from 16 465 selected genes by weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), three of which (Plum2, Royalblue and Bisque4 modules) were highly related to S13 during flower development. KEGG enrichment showed that the specific modules could be enriched in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, photosynthesis, porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism, α-linolenic acid metabolism, polysaccharide biosynthesis and metabolism, fatty acid degradation and the mutual transformation of pentose and glucuronic acid. These genes might play important roles during flower development of S13. It provided a reference for further study on the mechanism of anther dehiscence in eggplant.",33501806,,10.13345/j.cjb.200393,2
Correlated gene modules uncovered by high-precision single-cell transcriptomics,"Correlations in gene expression are used to infer functional and regulatory relationships between genes. However, correlations are often calculated across different cell types or perturbations, causing genes with unrelated functions to be correlated. Here, we demonstrate that correlated modules can be better captured by measuring correlations of steady-state gene expression fluctuations in single cells. We report a high-precision single-cell RNA-seq method called MALBAC-DT to measure the correlation between any pair of genes in a homogenous cell population. Using this method, we were able to identify numerous cell-type specific and functionally enriched correlated gene modules. We confirmed through knockdown that a module enriched for p53 signaling predicted p53 regulatory targets more accurately than a consensus of ChIP-seq studies and that steady-state correlations were predictive of transcriptome-wide response patterns to perturbations. This approach provides a powerful way to advance our functional understanding of the genome.",36508663,PMC9907105,10.1073/pnas.2206938119,5
Lymphoma Heterogeneity Unraveled by Single-Cell Transcriptomics,"High-definition transcriptomic studies through single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) have revealed the heterogeneity and functionality of the various microenvironments across numerous solid tumors. Those pioneer studies have highlighted different cellular signatures correlated with clinical response to immune checkpoint inhibitors. scRNA-Seq offers also a unique opportunity to unravel the intimate heterogeneity of the ecosystems across different lymphoma entities. In this review, we will first cover the basics and future developments of the technology, and we will discuss its input in the field of translational lymphoma research, from determination of cell-of-origin and functional diversity, to monitoring of anti-cancer targeted drugs response and toxicities, and how new improvements in both data collection and interpretation will further foster precision medicine in the upcoming years.",33732232,PMC7959738,10.3389/fimmu.2021.597651,5
Single-cell and spatial transcriptomics analysis of human adrenal aging,"Objective:The human adrenal cortex comprises three functionally and structurally distinct layers that produce layer-specific steroid hormones. With aging, the human adrenal cortex undergoes functional and structural alteration or ""adrenal aging"", leading to the unbalanced production of steroid hormones. Given the marked species differences in adrenal biology, the underlying mechanisms of human adrenal aging have not been sufficiently studied. This study was designed to elucidate the mechanisms linking the functional and structural alterations of the human adrenal cortex.Methods:We conducted single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics analysis of the aged human adrenal cortex.Results:The data of this study suggest that the layer-specific alterations of multiple signaling pathways underlie the abnormal layered structure and layer-specific changes in steroidogenic cells. We also highlighted that macrophages mediate age-related adrenocortical cell inflammation and senescence.Conclusions:This study is the first detailed analysis of the aged human adrenal cortex at single-cell resolution and helps to elucidate the mechanism of human adrenal aging, thereby leading to a better understanding of the pathophysiology of age-related disorders associated with adrenal aging.",38718896,PMC11101872,10.1016/j.molmet.2024.101954,0
HArmonized single-cell RNA-seq Cell type Assisted Deconvolution (HASCAD),"Background:Cell composition deconvolution (CCD) is a type of bioinformatic task to estimate the cell fractions from bulk gene expression profiles, such as RNA-seq. Many CCD models were developed to perform linear regression analysis using reference gene expression signatures of distinct cell types. Reference gene expression signatures could be generated from cell-specific gene expression profiles, such as scRNA-seq. However, the batch effects and dropout events frequently observed across scRNA-seq datasets have limited the performances of CCD methods.Methods:We developed a deep neural network (DNN) model, HASCAD, to predict the cell fractions of up to 15 immune cell types. HASCAD was trained using the bulk RNA-seq simulated from three scRNA-seq datasets that have been normalized by using a Harmony-Symphony based strategy. Mean square error and Pearson correlation coefficient were used to compare the performance of HASCAD with those of other widely used CCD methods. Two types of datasets, including a set of simulated bulk RNA-seq, and three human PBMC RNA-seq datasets, were arranged to conduct the benchmarks.Results:HASCAD is useful for the investigation of the impacts of immune cell heterogeneity on the therapeutic effects of immune checkpoint inhibitors, since the target cell types include the ones known to play a role in anti-tumor immunity, such as three subtypes of CD8 T cells and three subtypes of CD4 T cells. We found that the removal of batch effects in the reference scRNA-seq datasets could benefit the task of CCD. Our benchmarks showed that HASCAD is more suitable for analyzing bulk RNA-seq data, compared with the two widely used CCD methods, CIBERSORTx and quanTIseq. We applied HASCAD to analyze the liver cancer samples of TCGA-LIHC, and found that there were significant associations of the predicted abundance of Treg and effector CD8 T cell with patients' overall survival.Conclusion:HASCAD could predict the cell composition of the PBMC bulk RNA-seq and classify the cell type from pure bulk RNA-seq. The model of HASCAD is available at https://github.com/holiday01/HASCAD .",37907883,PMC10619225,10.1186/s12920-023-01674-w,0
Modelling capture efficiency of single-cell RNA-sequencing data improves inference of transcriptome-wide burst kinetics,"Motivation:Gene expression is characterized by stochastic bursts of transcription that occur at brief and random periods of promoter activity. The kinetics of gene expression burstiness differs across the genome and is dependent on the promoter sequence, among other factors. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has made it possible to quantify the cell-to-cell variability in transcription at a global genome-wide level. However, scRNA-seq data are prone to technical variability, including low and variable capture efficiency of transcripts from individual cells.Results:Here, we propose a novel mathematical theory for the observed variability in scRNA-seq data. Our method captures burst kinetics and variability in both the cell size and capture efficiency, which allows us to propose several likelihood-based and simulation-based methods for the inference of burst kinetics from scRNA-seq data. Using both synthetic and real data, we show that the simulation-based methods provide an accurate, robust and flexible tool for inferring burst kinetics from scRNA-seq data. In particular, in a supervised manner, a simulation-based inference method based on neural networks proves to be accurate and useful when applied to both allele and nonallele-specific scRNA-seq data.Availability and implementation:The code for Neural Network and Approximate Bayesian Computation inference is available at https://github.com/WT215/nnRNA and https://github.com/WT215/Julia_ABC, respectively.",37354494,PMC10318389,10.1093/bioinformatics/btad395,3
Multi-layered Spatial Transcriptomics Identify Secretory Factors Promoting Human Hematopoietic Stem Cell Development,"Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) first emerge in the embryonic aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region. Studies of model organisms defined intersecting signaling pathways that converge to promote HSC emergence predominantly in the ventral domain of the dorsal aorta. Much less is known about mechanisms driving HSC development in humans. Here, to identify secreted signals underlying human HSC development, we combined spatial transcriptomics analysis of dorsoventral polarized signaling in the aorta with gene expression profiling of sorted cell populations and single cells. Our analysis revealed a subset of aortic endothelial cells with a downregulated arterial signature and a predicted lineage relationship with the emerging HSC/progenitor population. Analysis of the ventrally polarized molecular landscape identified endothelin 1 as an important secreted regulator of human HSC development. The obtained gene expression datasets will inform future studies on mechanisms of HSC development in vivo and on generation of clinically relevant HSCs in vitro.",32946788,PMC7671940,10.1016/j.stem.2020.08.004,36
Sci-fate characterizes the dynamics of gene expression in single cells,"Gene expression programs change over time, differentiation and development, and in response to stimuli. However, nearly all techniques for profiling gene expression in single cells do not directly capture transcriptional dynamics. In the present study, we present a method for combined single-cell combinatorial indexing and messenger RNA labeling (sci-fate), which uses combinatorial cell indexing and 4-thiouridine labeling of newly synthesized mRNA to concurrently profile the whole and newly synthesized transcriptome in each of many single cells. We used sci-fate to study the cortisol response in >6,000 single cultured cells. From these data, we quantified the dynamics of the cell cycle and glucocorticoid receptor activation, and explored their intersection. Finally, we developed software to infer and analyze cell-state transitions. We anticipate that sci-fate will be broadly applicable to quantitatively characterize transcriptional dynamics in diverse systems.",32284584,PMC7416490,10.1038/s41587-020-0480-9,54
Spatial Genomic Analysis: A Multiplexed Transcriptional Profiling Method that Reveals Subpopulations of Cells Within Intact Tissues,"Here, we present Spatial Genomic Analysis (SGA), a quantitative single-cell transcriptional profiling method that takes advantage of single-molecule imaging of individual transcripts for up to a hundred genes. SGA relies on a machine learning-based image analysis pipeline that performs cell segmentation and transcript counting in a robust way. SGA is suitable for various in situ applications and was originally developed to address heterogeneity in the neural crest, which is a transient embryonic stem cell population important for formation of various vertebrate body structures. After being specified as multipotent neural crest stem cells in the dorsal neural tube, they go through an epithelial to mesenchymal transition in order to migrate to different destinations around the body, and gradually turn from stem cells to progenitors prior to final commitment. The molecular details of this process remain largely unknown, and upon their emergence, the neural crest cells have been considered as a single homogeneous population. Technical limitations have restricted the possibility to parse the neural crest cell pool into subgroups according to multiplex gene expression properties. By using SGA, we were able to identify subgroups inside the neural crest niche in the dorsal neural tube. The high sensitivity of the method allows detection of low expression levels and we were able to determine factors not previously shown to be present in neural crest stem cells, such as pluripotency or lineage markers. Finally, SGA analysis also provides prediction of gene relationships within individual cells, and thus has broad utility for powerful transcriptome analyses in original biological contexts.",30194538,PMC8014251,10.1007/7651_2018_188,4
Characterization of sheep spermatogenesis through single-cell RNA sequencing,"Spermatogenesis is an important biological process in male reproduction. The interaction between male germ cells and somatic cells during spermatogenesis, is necessary for male reproductive activities. This cellular heterogeneity has made it difficult to profile distinct cell types at different stages of development. Here, we present the first comprehensive, unbiased single-cell transcriptomic study of sheep spermatogenesis using 10× genomics single cell sequencing (scRNA-seq). We collected scRNA-seq data from 11 772 cells from the adult sheep testis and identified all known germ cells (including early primary spermatocytes, late primary spermatocytes, round spermatids, elongated spermatids, and sperm), and somatic cells (Sertoli cells and Leydig cells), as well as one somatic cell that unexpectedly contained leukocytes. The functional enrichment analysis indicated that several pathways of cell cycle, gamete generation, protein processing, and mRNA surveillance pathways were significantly enriched in testicular germ cell types, and ribosome pathway was significantly enriched in testicular somatic cell types. Further analysis identified several stage-specific marker genes of sheep germ cells, such as EZH2, SOX18, SCP2, PCNA, and PRKCD. Our research explored for the first time of the changes in the transcription level of various cell types during the process of sheep spermatogenesis, providing new insights for sheep spermatogenesis and spermatogenic cell development.",33197070,,10.1096/fj.202001035RRR,25
"Electrophysiological, transcriptomic and morphologic profiling of single neurons using Patch-seq","Despite the importance of the mammalian neocortex for complex cognitive processes, we still lack a comprehensive description of its cellular components. To improve the classification of neuronal cell types and the functional characterization of single neurons, we present Patch-seq, a method that combines whole-cell electrophysiological patch-clamp recordings, single-cell RNA-sequencing and morphological characterization. Following electrophysiological characterization, cell contents are aspirated through the patch-clamp pipette and prepared for RNA-sequencing. Using this approach, we generate electrophysiological and molecular profiles of 58 neocortical cells and show that gene expression patterns can be used to infer the morphological and physiological properties such as axonal arborization and action potential amplitude of individual neurons. Our results shed light on the molecular underpinnings of neuronal diversity and suggest that Patch-seq can facilitate the classification of cell types in the nervous system.",26689543,PMC4840019,10.1038/nbt.3445,255
The emerging landscape of spatial profiling technologies,"Improved scale, multiplexing and resolution are establishing spatial nucleic acid and protein profiling methods as a major pillar for cellular atlas building of complex samples, from tissues to full organisms. Emerging methods yield omics measurements at resolutions covering the nano- to microscale, enabling the charting of cellular heterogeneity, complex tissue architectures and dynamic changes during development and disease. We present an overview of the developing landscape of in situ spatial genome, transcriptome and proteome technologies, exemplify their impact on cell biology and translational research, and discuss current challenges for their community-wide adoption. Among many transformative applications, we envision that spatial methods will map entire organs and enable next-generation pathology.",35859028,,10.1038/s41576-022-00515-3,96
Cell cycle gene regulation dynamics revealed by RNA velocity and deep-learning,"Despite the fact that the cell cycle is a fundamental process of life, a detailed quantitative understanding of gene regulation dynamics throughout the cell cycle is far from complete. Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology gives access to these dynamics without externally perturbing the cell. Here, by generating scRNA-seq libraries in different cell systems, we observe cycling patterns in the unspliced-spliced RNA space of cell cycle-related genes. Since existing methods to analyze scRNA-seq are not efficient to measure cycling gene dynamics, we propose a deep learning approach (DeepCycle) to fit these patterns and build a high-resolution map of the entire cell cycle transcriptome. Characterizing the cell cycle in embryonic and somatic cells, we identify major waves of transcription during the G1 phase and systematically study the stages of the cell cycle. Our work will facilitate the study of the cell cycle in multiple cellular models and different biological contexts.",35606383,PMC9126911,10.1038/s41467-022-30545-8,12
Single cell transcriptome analysis of muscle satellite cells reveals widespread transcriptional heterogeneity,"Tissue specific stem cells are indispensable contributors to adult tissue maintenance, repair, and regeneration. In skeletal muscle, satellite cells (SCs) are the resident muscle stem cell population and are required to maintain skeletal muscle homeostasis throughout life. Increasing evidence suggests that SCs are a heterogeneous cell population with substantial biochemical and functional diversity. A major limitation in the field is an incomplete understanding of the nature and extent of this cellular heterogeneity. Single cell analyses are well suited to addressing this issue, especially when coupled to unbiased profiling paradigms such as high throughout RNA sequencing. We performed single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on freshly isolated muscle satellite cells and found a surprising degree of heterogeneity at multiple levels, from muscle-specific transcripts to the broader SC transcriptome. We leveraged several comparative bioinformatics techniques and found that individual SCs enrich for unique transcript clusters. We propose that these gene expression ""fingerprints"" may contribute to observed functional SC diversity. Overall, these studies underscore the importance of several established SC signaling pathways/processes on a single cell level, implicate novel regulators of SC heterogeneity, and lay the groundwork for further investigation into SC heterogeneity in health and disease.",28893664,PMC5659767,10.1016/j.gene.2017.09.014,25
Evolving Transcriptomic Profiles From Single-Cell RNA-Seq Data Using Nature-Inspired Multiobjective Optimization,"Transcriptomic profiling plays an important role in post-genomic analysis. Especially, the single-cell RNA-seq technology has advanced our understanding of gene expression from cell population level into individual cell level. Many computational methods have been proposed to decipher transcriptomic profiles from those RNA-seq data. However, most of the related algorithms suffer from realistic restrictions such as high dimensionality and premature convergence. In this paper, we propose and formulate an evolutionary multiobjective blind compressed sensing (EMOBCS) to address those problems for evolving transcriptomic profiles from single-cell RNA-seq data. In the proposed framework, to characterize various gene expression profile models, two objective functions including chi-squared kernel score and euclidean distance of different gene expression profiles are formulated. After that, multiobjective blind compressed sensing based on artificial bee colony is designed to optimize the two objective functions on single-cell RNA-seq data by proposing a rank probability model and two new search strategies into the cooperative convolution framework in an unbiased manner. To demonstrate its effectiveness, extensive experiments have been conducted, comparing the proposed algorithm with 14 algorithms including eight state-of-the-art algorithms and six different EMOBCS algorithms under different search strategies on 10 single-cell RNA-seq datasets and one case study. The experimental results reveal that the proposed algorithm is better than or comparable with those compared algorithms. Furthermore, we also conduct the time complexity analysis, convergence analysis, and parameter analysis to demonstrate various properties of EMOBCS.",32031947,,10.1109/TCBB.2020.2971993,1
A human adipose tissue cell-type transcriptome atlas,"The importance of defining cell-type-specific genes is well acknowledged. Technological advances facilitate high-resolution sequencing of single cells, but practical challenges remain. Adipose tissue is composed primarily of adipocytes, large buoyant cells requiring extensive, artefact-generating processing for separation and analysis. Thus, adipocyte data are frequently absent from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets, despite being the primary functional cell type. Here, we decipher cell-type-enriched transcriptomes from unfractionated human adipose tissue RNA-seq data. We profile all major constituent cell types, using 527 visceral adipose tissue (VAT) or 646 subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) samples, identifying over 2,300 cell-type-enriched transcripts. Sex-subset analysis uncovers a panel of male-only cell-type-enriched genes. By resolving expression profiles of genes differentially expressed between SAT and VAT, we identify mesothelial cells as the primary driver of this variation. This study provides an accessible method to profile cell-type-enriched transcriptomes using bulk RNA-seq, generating a roadmap for adipose tissue biology.",35830816,,10.1016/j.celrep.2022.111046,19
FIN-Seq: transcriptional profiling of specific cell types from frozen archived tissue of the human central nervous system,"Thousands of frozen, archived tissue samples from the human central nervous system (CNS) are currently available in brain banks. As recent developments in RNA sequencing technologies are beginning to elucidate the cellular diversity present within the human CNS, it is becoming clear that an understanding of this diversity would greatly benefit from deeper transcriptional analyses. Single cell and single nucleus RNA profiling provide one avenue to decipher this heterogeneity. An alternative, complementary approach is to profile isolated, pre-defined cell types and use methods that can be applied to many archived human tissue samples that have been stored long-term. Here, we developed FIN-Seq (Frozen Immunolabeled Nuclei Sequencing), a method that accomplishes these goals. FIN-Seq uses immunohistochemical isolation of nuclei of specific cell types from frozen human tissue, followed by bulk RNA-Sequencing. We applied this method to frozen postmortem samples of human cerebral cortex and retina and were able to identify transcripts, including low abundance transcripts, in specific cell types.",31728515,PMC7145626,10.1093/nar/gkz968,11
AbSeq Protocol Using the Nano-Well Cartridge-Based Rhapsody Platform to Generate Protein and Transcript Expression Data on the Single-Cell Level,"By including oligonucleotide-labeled antibodies into high-throughput single-cell RNA-sequencing protocols, combined transcript and protein expression data can be acquired on the single-cell level. Here, we describe a protocol for the combined analysis of over 40 proteins and 400 genes on over 104cells using the nano-well based Rhapsody platform. We also include a workflow for sample multiplexing, which uniquely identifies the initial source of cells (such as tissue type or donor) in the downstream analysis after upstream pooling. For complete information on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to Mair et al. (2020).",33000001,PMC7523635,10.1016/j.xpro.2020.100092,9
Early transcriptomic signatures and biomarkers of renal damage due to prolonged exposure to embedded metal,"Background:Prolonged exposure to toxic heavy metals leads to deleterious health outcomes including kidney injury. Metal exposure occurs through both environmental pathways including contamination of drinking water sources and from occupational hazards, including the military-unique risks from battlefield injuries resulting in retained metal fragments from bullets and blast debris. One of the key challenges to mitigate health effects in these scenarios is to detect early insult to target organs, such as the kidney, before irreversible damage occurs.Methods:High-throughput transcriptomics (HTT) has been recently demonstrated to have high sensitivity and specificity as a rapid and cost-effective assay for detecting tissue toxicity. To better understand the molecular signature of early kidney damage, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on renal tissue using a rat model of soft tissue-embedded metal exposure. We then performed small RNA-seq analysis on serum samples from the same animals to identify potential miRNA biomarkers of kidney damage.Results:We found that metals, especially lead and depleted uranium, induce oxidative damage that mainly cause dysregulated mitochondrial gene expression. Utilizing publicly available single-cell RNA-seq datasets, we demonstrate that deep learning-based cell type decomposition effectively identified cells within the kidney that were affected by metal exposure. By combining random forest feature selection and statistical methods, we further identify miRNA-423 as a promising early systemic marker of kidney injury.Conclusion:Our data suggest that combining HTT and deep learning is a promising approach for identifying cell injury in kidney tissue. We propose miRNA-423 as a potential serum biomarker for early detection of kidney injury.",37058270,,10.1007/s10565-023-09806-9,0
Reconstruction of the cell pseudo-space from single-cell RNA sequencing data with scSpace,"Tissues are highly complicated with spatial heterogeneity in gene expression. However, the cutting-edge single-cell RNA-seq technology eliminates the spatial information of individual cells, which contributes to the characterization of cell identities. Herein, we propose single-cell spatial position associated co-embeddings (scSpace), an integrative method to identify spatially variable cell subpopulations by reconstructing cells onto a pseudo-space with spatial transcriptome references (Visium, STARmap, Slide-seq, etc.). We benchmark scSpace with both simulated and biological datasets, and demonstrate that scSpace can accurately and robustly identify spatially variated cell subpopulations. When employed to reconstruct the spatial architectures of complex tissue such as the brain cortex, the small intestinal villus, the liver lobule, the kidney, the embryonic heart, and others, scSpace shows promising performance on revealing the pairwise cellular spatial association within single-cell data. The application of scSpace in melanoma and COVID-19 exhibits a broad prospect in the discovery of spatial therapeutic markers.",37120608,PMC10148590,10.1038/s41467-023-38121-4,4
Inferring neuron-neuron communications from single-cell transcriptomics through NeuronChat,"Neural communication networks form the fundamental basis for brain function. These communication networks are enabled by emitted ligands such as neurotransmitters, which activate receptor complexes to facilitate communication. Thus, neural communication is fundamentally dependent on the transcriptome. Here we develop NeuronChat, a method and package for the inference, visualization and analysis of neural-specific communication networks among pre-defined cell groups using single-cell expression data. We incorporate a manually curated molecular interaction database of neural signaling for both human and mouse, and benchmark NeuronChat on several published datasets to validate its ability in predicting neural connectivity. Then, we apply NeuronChat to three different neural tissue datasets to illustrate its functionalities in identifying interneural communication networks, revealing conserved or context-specific interactions across different biological contexts, and predicting communication pattern changes in diseased brains with autism spectrum disorder. Finally, we demonstrate NeuronChat can utilize spatial transcriptomics data to infer and visualize neural-specific cell-cell communication.",36854676,PMC9974942,10.1038/s41467-023-36800-w,10
Reference-based cell type matching of in situ image-based spatial transcriptomics data on primary visual cortex of mouse brain,"With the advent of multiplex fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and in situ RNA sequencing technologies, spatial transcriptomics analysis is advancing rapidly, providing spatial location and gene expression information about cells in tissue sections at single cell resolution. Cell type classification of these spatially-resolved cells can be inferred by matching the spatial transcriptomics data to reference atlases derived from single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) in which cell types are defined by differences in their gene expression profiles. However, robust cell type matching of the spatially-resolved cells to reference scRNA-seq atlases is challenging due to the intrinsic differences in resolution between the spatial and scRNA-seq data. In this study, we systematically evaluated six computational algorithms for cell type matching across four image-based spatial transcriptomics experimental protocols (MERFISH, smFISH, BaristaSeq, and ExSeq) conducted on the same mouse primary visual cortex (VISp) brain region. We find that many cells are assigned as the same type by multiple cell type matching algorithms and are present in spatial patterns previously reported from scRNA-seq studies in VISp. Furthermore, by combining the results of individual matching strategies into consensus cell type assignments, we see even greater alignment with biological expectations. We present two ensemble meta-analysis strategies used in this study and share the consensus cell type matching results in the Cytosplore Viewer ( https://viewer.cytosplore.org ) for interactive visualization and data exploration. The consensus matching can also guide spatial data analysis using SSAM, allowing segmentation-free cell type assignment.",37311768,PMC10264402,10.1038/s41598-023-36638-8,3
MuSiC2: cell-type deconvolution for multi-condition bulk RNA-seq data,"Cell-type composition of intact bulk tissues can vary across samples. Deciphering cell-type composition and its changes during disease progression is an important step toward understanding disease pathogenesis. To infer cell-type composition, existing cell-type deconvolution methods for bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data often require matched single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data, generated from samples with similar clinical conditions, as reference. However, due to the difficulty of obtaining scRNA-seq data in diseased samples, only limited scRNA-seq data in matched disease conditions are available. Using scRNA-seq reference to deconvolve bulk RNA-seq data from samples with different disease conditions may lead to a biased estimation of cell-type proportions. To overcome this limitation, we propose an iterative estimation procedure, MuSiC2, which is an extension of MuSiC, to perform deconvolution analysis of bulk RNA-seq data generated from samples with multiple clinical conditions where at least one condition is different from that of the scRNA-seq reference. Extensive benchmark evaluations indicated that MuSiC2 improved the accuracy of cell-type proportion estimates of bulk RNA-seq samples under different conditions as compared with the traditional MuSiC deconvolution. MuSiC2 was applied to two bulk RNA-seq datasets for deconvolution analysis, including one from human pancreatic islets and the other from human retina. We show that MuSiC2 improves current deconvolution methods and provides more accurate cell-type proportion estimates when the bulk and single-cell reference differ in clinical conditions. We believe the condition-specific cell-type composition estimates from MuSiC2 will facilitate the downstream analysis and help identify cellular targets of human diseases.",36208175,PMC9677503,10.1093/bib/bbac430,14
Depletion of Ribosomal RNA Sequences from Single-Cell RNA-Sequencing Library,"Recent advances in single-cell RNA sequencing technologies have revealed high heterogeneity of gene expression profiles in individual cells. However, most current single-cell RNA-seq methods use oligo-dT priming in the reverse transcription steps and detect only polyA-positive for more accuracy, since there are also polyA-positive non-coding RNAs transcripts, not other important RNA species, such as polyA-negative noncoding RNA. Reverse transcription using random oligos enables detection of not only the noncoding RNA species without polyA tails, but also ribosomal RNA (rRNA). rRNA comprises more than 90% of the total RNA and should be depleted from the RNA-seq library to ensure efficient usage of the sequencing capacity. Commonly used hybridization-based rRNA depletion methods can preserve noncoding RNA in the standard RNA-seq library. However, such rRNA depletion methods require high input amounts of total RNA and do not work at the single-cell level or with limited input DNA. This unit describes a novel procedure for RNA-seq library construction from single cells or a minimal amount of RNA. A thermostable duplex-specific nuclease is used in this method to effectively remove ribosomal RNA sequences following whole-transcriptome amplification and sequencing library construction. © 2016 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",27366895,,10.1002/cpmb.11,7
A Spatiotemporal Organ-Wide Gene Expression and Cell Atlas of the Developing Human Heart,"The process of cardiac morphogenesis in humans is incompletely understood. Its full characterization requires a deep exploration of the organ-wide orchestration of gene expression with a single-cell spatial resolution. Here, we present a molecular approach that reveals the comprehensive transcriptional landscape of cell types populating the embryonic heart at three developmental stages and that maps cell-type-specific gene expression to specific anatomical domains. Spatial transcriptomics identified unique gene profiles that correspond to distinct anatomical regions in each developmental stage. Human embryonic cardiac cell types identified by single-cell RNA sequencing confirmed and enriched the spatial annotation of embryonic cardiac gene expression. In situ sequencing was then used to refine these results and create a spatial subcellular map for the three developmental phases. Finally, we generated a publicly available web resource of the human developing heart to facilitate future studies on human cardiogenesis.",31835037,,10.1016/j.cell.2019.11.025,276
Applications of single-cell sequencing in cancer research: progress and perspectives,"Single-cell sequencing, including genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, proteomics and metabolomics sequencing, is a powerful tool to decipher the cellular and molecular landscape at a single-cell resolution, unlike bulk sequencing, which provides averaged data. The use of single-cell sequencing in cancer research has revolutionized our understanding of the biological characteristics and dynamics within cancer lesions. In this review, we summarize emerging single-cell sequencing technologies and recent cancer research progress obtained by single-cell sequencing, including information related to the landscapes of malignant cells and immune cells, tumor heterogeneity, circulating tumor cells and the underlying mechanisms of tumor biological behaviors. Overall, the prospects of single-cell sequencing in facilitating diagnosis, targeted therapy and prognostic prediction among a spectrum of tumors are bright. In the near future, advances in single-cell sequencing will undoubtedly improve our understanding of the biological characteristics of tumors and highlight potential precise therapeutic targets for patients.",34108022,PMC8190846,10.1186/s13045-021-01105-2,145
MAST: a flexible statistical framework for assessing transcriptional changes and characterizing heterogeneity in single-cell RNA sequencing data,"Single-cell transcriptomics reveals gene expression heterogeneity but suffers from stochastic dropout and characteristic bimodal expression distributions in which expression is either strongly non-zero or non-detectable. We propose a two-part, generalized linear model for such bimodal data that parameterizes both of these features. We argue that the cellular detection rate, the fraction of genes expressed in a cell, should be adjusted for as a source of nuisance variation. Our model provides gene set enrichment analysis tailored to single-cell data. It provides insights into how networks of co-expressed genes evolve across an experimental treatment. MAST is available at https://github.com/RGLab/MAST .",26653891,PMC4676162,10.1186/s13059-015-0844-5,1223
Analysis of Single-Cell Transcriptome Data in Drosophila,"The fly Drosophila is a versatile model organism that has led to fascinating biological discoveries. In the past few years, Drosophila researchers have used single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to gain insights into the cellular composition, and developmental processes of various tissues and organs. Given the success of single-cell technologies a variety of computational tools and software packages were developed to enable and facilitate the analysis of scRNA-seq data. In this book chapter we want to give guidance on analyzing droplet-based scRNA-seq data from Drosophila. We will initially describe the preprocessing commonly done for Drosophila, point out possible downstream analyses, and finally highlight computational methods developed using Drosophila scRNA-seq data.",35980574,,10.1007/978-1-0716-2541-5_4,0
Decoding cell-type contributions to the cfRNA transcriptomic landscape of liver cancer,"Background:Liquid biopsy, particularly cell-free RNA (cfRNA), has emerged as a promising non-invasive diagnostic tool for various diseases, including cancer, due to its accessibility and the wealth of information it provides. A key area of interest is the composition and cellular origin of cfRNA in the blood and the alterations in the cfRNA transcriptomic landscape during carcinogenesis. Investigating these changes can offer insights into the manifestations of tissue alterations in the blood, potentially leading to more effective diagnostic strategies. However, the consistency of these findings across different studies and their clinical utility remains to be fully elucidated, highlighting the need for further research in this area.Results:In this study, we analyzed over 350 blood samples from four distinct studies, investigating the cell type contributions to the cfRNA transcriptomic landscape in liver cancer. We found that an increase in hepatocyte proportions in the blood is a consistent feature across most studies and can be effectively utilized for classifying cancer and healthy samples. Moreover, our analysis revealed that in addition to hepatocytes, liver endothelial cell signatures are also prominent in the observed changes. By comparing the classification performance of cellular proportions to established markers, we demonstrated that cellular proportions could distinguish cancer from healthy samples as effectively as existing markers and can even enhance classification when used in combination with these markers.Conclusions:Our comprehensive analysis of liver cell-type composition changes in blood revealed robust effects that help classify cancer from healthy samples. This is especially noteworthy, considering the heterogeneous nature of datasets and the etiological distinctions of samples. Furthermore, the observed differences in results across studies underscore the importance of integrative and comparative approaches in the future research to determine the consistency and robustness of findings. This study contributes to the understanding of cfRNA composition in liver cancer and highlights the potential of cellular deconvolution in liquid biopsy.",37798661,PMC10552294,10.1186/s40246-023-00537-w,0
scNPF: an integrative framework assisted by network propagation and network fusion for preprocessing of single-cell RNA-seq data,"Background:Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) is fast becoming a powerful tool for profiling genome-scale transcriptomes of individual cells and capturing transcriptome-wide cell-to-cell variability. However, scRNA-seq technologies suffer from high levels of technical noise and variability, hindering reliable quantification of lowly and moderately expressed genes. Since most downstream analyses on scRNA-seq, such as cell type clustering and differential expression analysis, rely on the gene-cell expression matrix, preprocessing of scRNA-seq data is a critical preliminary step in the analysis of scRNA-seq data.Results:We presented scNPF, an integrative scRNA-seq preprocessing framework assisted by network propagation and network fusion, for recovering gene expression loss, correcting gene expression measurements, and learning similarities between cells. scNPF leverages the context-specific topology inherent in the given data and the priori knowledge derived from publicly available molecular gene-gene interaction networks to augment gene-gene relationships in a data driven manner. We have demonstrated the great potential of scNPF in scRNA-seq preprocessing for accurately recovering gene expression values and learning cell similarity networks. Comprehensive evaluation of scNPF across a wide spectrum of scRNA-seq data sets showed that scNPF achieved comparable or higher performance than the competing approaches according to various metrics of internal validation and clustering accuracy. We have made scNPF an easy-to-use R package, which can be used as a versatile preprocessing plug-in for most existing scRNA-seq analysis pipelines or tools.Conclusions:scNPF is a universal tool for preprocessing of scRNA-seq data, which jointly incorporates the global topology of priori interaction networks and the context-specific information encapsulated in the scRNA-seq data to capture both shared and complementary knowledge from diverse data sources. scNPF could be used to recover gene signatures and learn cell-to-cell similarities from emerging scRNA-seq data to facilitate downstream analyses such as dimension reduction, cell type clustering, and visualization.",31068142,PMC6505295,10.1186/s12864-019-5747-5,4

Comparison of optimized methodologies for isolating nuclei from esophageal tissue,"Single-nuclei RNA sequencing allows single cell-based analysis in frozen tissue, ameliorating cell recovery biases associated with enzymatic dissociation methods. The authors present two optimized methods for isolating and sequencing nuclei from esophageal tissue using a commercial EZ and citric acid (CA)-based method. Despite high endogenous RNase activity, these protocols produced libraries of expected fragment length (average length EZ: 745 bp; CA: 1232 bp) with comparable complexity (median Transcript/Gene number, EZ: 496/254; CA: 483/256). CA nuclei showed a higher proportion of ribosomal gene reads, potentially reflecting co-isolation of nuclei and adherent ribosomes. The authors identified 11 cell lineages in the combined datasets, with differences in cell type recovery between the two methods, providing utility dependent on experimental needs.",35152705,,10.2144/btn-2021-0036,1
Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Resolves Spatiotemporal Development of Pre-thymic Lymphoid Progenitors and Thymus Organogenesis in Human Embryos,"Generation of the first T lymphocytes in the human embryo involves the emergence, migration, and thymus seeding of lymphoid progenitors together with concomitant thymus organogenesis, which is the initial step to establish the entire adaptive immune system. However, the cellular and molecular programs regulating this process remain unclear. We constructed a single-cell transcriptional landscape of human early T lymphopoiesis by using cells from multiple hemogenic and hematopoietic sites spanning embryonic and fetal stages. Among heterogenous early thymic progenitors, one subtype shared common features with a subset of lymphoid progenitors in fetal liver that are known as thymus-seeding progenitors. Unbiased bioinformatics analysis identified a distinct type of pre-thymic lymphoid progenitors in the aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region. In parallel, we investigated thymic epithelial cell development and potential cell-cell interactions during thymus organogenesis. Together, our data provide insights into human early T lymphopoiesis that prospectively direct T lymphocyte regeneration, which might lead to development of clinical applications.",31604687,,10.1016/j.immuni.2019.09.008,63
"A Simple, Quick, and Partially Automated Protocol for the Isolation of Single Nuclei from Frozen Mammalian Tissues for Single Nucleus Sequencing","Single-cell and single-nucleus RNA sequencing have become common laboratory applications due to the wealth of transcriptomic information that they provide. Single nucleus RNA sequencing, particularly, is useful for investigating gene expression in difficult-to-dissociate tissues. Furthermore, this approach is also compatible with frozen (archival) material. Here, we describe a protocol to isolate high-quality single nuclei from frozen mammalian tissues for downstream single nucleus RNA sequencing in a partially-automated manner using commercially available instruments and reagents. Specifically, a robotic dissociator is used to automate and standardize tissue homogenization, followed by an optimized chemical gradient to filter the nuclei. Lastly, we accurately and automatically count the nuclei using an automated fluorescent cell counter. The performance of this protocol is demonstrated on mouse brain, rat kidney, and cynomolgus liver and spleen tissue. This protocol is straightforward, rapid, and readily adaptable to various mammalian tissues without requiring extensive optimization and provides good quality nuclei for downstream single nuclei RNA sequencing.",37578260,,10.3791/65611,1
Single-Cell Transcriptomics of Immune Cells: Cell Isolation and cDNA Library Generation for scRNA-Seq,"Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables a comprehensive analysis of the transcriptome of individual cells by next-generation sequencing. ScRNA-seq offers an unbiased approach to investigate the cellular heterogeneity and dynamics of diverse biological systems, including the immune system. Optimization of the technical procedures performed prior to RNA-seq analysis is imperative to the success of a scRNA-seq experiment.

Single-nucleus RNA sequencing of developing superior colliculus identifies neuronal diversity and candidate mediators of circuit assembly,"The superior colliculus (SC) is a sensorimotor structure in the midbrain that integrates input from multiple sensory modalities to initiate motor commands. It undergoes well-characterized steps of circuit assembly during development, rendering the mouse SC a popular model to study establishment of neural connectivity. Here we perform single-nucleus RNA-sequencing analysis of the mouse SC isolated at various developmental time points. Our study provides a transcriptomic landscape of the cell types that comprise the SC across murine development with particular emphasis on neuronal heterogeneity. We report a repertoire of genes differentially expressed across the different postnatal ages, many of which are known to regulate axon guidance and synapse formation. Using these data, we find that Pax7 expression is restricted to a subset of GABAergic neurons. Our data provide a valuable resource for interrogating the mechanisms of circuit development and identifying markers for manipulating specific SC neuronal populations and circuits.",37624694,PMC10592058,10.1016/j.celrep.2023.113037,1
A reference single-cell transcriptomic atlas of human skeletal muscle tissue reveals bifurcated muscle stem cell populations,"Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) facilitates the unbiased reconstruction of multicellular tissue systems in health and disease. Here, we present a curated scRNA-seq dataset of human muscle samples from 10 adult donors with diverse anatomical locations. We integrated ~ 22,000 single-cell transcriptomes using Scanorama to account for technical and biological variation and resolved 16 distinct populations of muscle-resident cells using unsupervised clustering of the data compendium. These cell populations included muscle stem/progenitor cells (MuSCs), which bifurcated into discrete ""quiescent"" and ""early-activated"" MuSC subpopulations. Differential expression analysis identified transcriptional profiles altered in the activated MuSCs including genes associated with aging, obesity, diabetes, and impaired muscle regeneration, as well as long non-coding RNAs previously undescribed in human myogenic cells. Further, we modeled ligand-receptor cell-communication interactions and observed enrichment of the TWEAK-FN14 pathway in activated MuSCs, a characteristic signature of muscle wasting diseases. In contrast, the quiescent MuSCs have enhanced expression of the EGFR receptor, a recognized human MuSC marker. This work provides a new benchmark reference resource to examine human muscle tissue heterogeneity and identify potential targets in MuSC diversity and dysregulation in disease contexts.",32624006,PMC7336639,10.1186/s13395-020-00236-3,76
In situ 10-cell RNA sequencing in tissue and tumor biopsy samples,"Single-cell transcriptomic methods classify new and existing cell types very effectively, but alternative approaches are needed to quantify the individual regulatory states of cells in their native tissue context. We combined the tissue preservation and single-cell resolution of laser capture with an improved preamplification procedure enabling RNA sequencing of 10 microdissected cells. This in situ 10-cell RNA sequencing (10cRNA-seq) can exploit fluorescent reporters of cell type in genetically engineered mice and is compatible with freshly cryoembedded clinical biopsies from patients. Through recombinant RNA spike-ins, we estimate dropout-free technical reliability as low as ~250 copies and a 50% detection sensitivity of ~45 copies per 10-cell reaction. By using small pools of microdissected cells, 10cRNA-seq improves technical per-cell reliability and sensitivity beyond existing approaches for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Detection of low-abundance transcripts by 10cRNA-seq is comparable to random 10-cell groups of scRNA-seq data, suggesting no loss of gene recovery when cells are isolated in situ. Combined with existing approaches to deconvolve small pools of cells, 10cRNA-seq offers a reliable, unbiased, and sensitive way to measure cell-state heterogeneity in tissues and tumors.",30894605,PMC6426952,10.1038/s41598-019-41235-9,16
Decoding hereditary spastic paraplegia pathogenicity through transcriptomic profiling,"Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) is a group of genetic motor neuron diseases resulting from length-dependent axonal degeneration of the corticospinal upper motor neurons. Due to the advancement of next-generation sequencing, more than 70 novel HSP disease-causing genes have been identified in the past decade. Despite this, our understanding of HSP physiopathology and the development of efficient management and treatment strategies remain poor. One major challenge in studying HSP pathogenicity is selective neuronal vulnerability, characterized by the manifestation of clinical symptoms that are restricted to specific neuronal populations, despite the presence of germline disease-causing variants in every cell of the patient. Furthermore, disease genes may exhibit ubiquitous expression patterns and involve a myriad of different pathways to cause motor neuron degeneration. In the current review, we explore the correlation between transcriptomic data and clinical manifestations, as well as the importance of interspecies models by comparing tissue-specific transcriptomic profiles of humans and mice, expression patterns of different genes in the brain during development, and single-cell transcriptomic data from related tissues. Furthermore, we discuss the potential of emerging single-cell RNA sequencing technologies to resolve unanswered questions related to HSP pathogenicity.",37161652,PMC10236304,10.24272/j.issn.2095-8137.2022.281,1
Harnessing Single-Cell RNA Sequencing to Better Understand How Diseased Cells Behave the Way They Do in Cardiovascular Disease,"The transition of healthy arteries and cardiac valves into dense, cell-rich, calcified, and fibrotic tissues is driven by a complex interplay of both cellular and molecular mechanisms. Specific cell types in these cardiovascular tissues become activated following the exposure to systemic stimuli including circulating lipoproteins or inflammatory mediators. This activation induces multiple cascades of events where changes in cell phenotypes and activation of certain receptors may trigger multiple pathways and specific alterations to the transcriptome. Modifications to the transcriptome and proteome can give rise to pathological cell phenotypes and trigger mechanisms that exacerbate inflammation, proliferation, calcification, and recruitment of resident or distant cells. Accumulating evidence suggests that each cell type involved in vascular and valvular diseases is heterogeneous. Single-cell RNA sequencing is a transforming medical research tool that enables the profiling of the unique fingerprints at single-cell levels. Its applications have allowed the construction of cell atlases including the mammalian heart and tissue vasculature and the discovery of new cell types implicated in cardiovascular disease. Recent advances in single-cell RNA sequencing have facilitated the identification of novel resident cell populations that become activated during disease and has allowed tracing the transition of healthy cells into pathological phenotypes.

Single-cell transcriptomics of the goldfish retina reveals genetic divergence in the asymmetrically evolved subgenomes after allotetraploidization,"The recent whole-genome duplication (WGD) in goldfish (Carassius auratus) approximately 14 million years ago makes it a valuable model for studying gene evolution during the early stages after WGD. We analyzed the transcriptome of the goldfish retina at the level of single-cell (scRNA-seq) and open chromatin regions (scATAC-seq). We identified a group of genes that have undergone dosage selection, accounting for 5% of the total 11,444 ohnolog pairs. We also identified 306 putative sub/neo-functionalized ohnolog pairs that are likely to be under cell-type-specific genetic variation at single-cell resolution. Diversification in the expression patterns of several ohnolog pairs was observed in the retinal cell subpopulations. The single-cell level transcriptome analysis in this study uncovered the early stages of evolution in retinal cell of goldfish after WGD. Our results provide clues for understanding the relationship between the early stages of gene evolution after WGD and the evolution of diverse vertebrate retinal functions.",36572749,PMC9792465,10.1038/s42003-022-04351-3,2

Multi-organ single-cell transcriptomics of immune cells uncovered organ-specific gene expression and functions,"Despite the wealth of publicly available single-cell datasets, our understanding of distinct resident immune cells and their unique features in diverse human organs remains limited. To address this, we compiled a meta-analysis dataset of 114,275 CD45+ immune cells sourced from 14 organs in healthy donors. While the transcriptome of immune cells remains relatively consistent across organs, our analysis has unveiled organ-specific gene expression differences (GTPX3 in kidney, DNTT and ACVR2B in thymus). These alterations are linked to different transcriptional factor activities and pathways including metabolism. TNF-α signaling through the NFkB pathway was found in several organs and immune compartments. The presence of distinct expression profiles for NFkB family genes and their target genes, including cytokines, underscores their pivotal role in cell positioning. Taken together, immune cells serve a dual role: safeguarding the organs and dynamically adjusting to the intricacies of the host organ environment, thereby actively contributing to its functionality and overall homeostasis.",38538617,PMC10973478,10.1038/s41597-024-03152-z,0
SHARP: hyperfast and accurate processing of single-cell RNA-seq data via ensemble random projection,"To process large-scale single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data effectively without excessive distortion during dimension reduction, we present SHARP, an ensemble random projection-based algorithm that is scalable to clustering 10 million cells. Comprehensive benchmarking tests on 17 public scRNA-seq data sets show that SHARP outperforms existing methods in terms of speed and accuracy. Particularly, for large-size data sets (more than 40,000 cells), SHARP runs faster than other competitors while maintaining high clustering accuracy and robustness. To the best of our knowledge, SHARP is the only R-based tool that is scalable to clustering scRNA-seq data with 10 million cells.",31992615,PMC7050522,10.1101/gr.254557.119,30
Multi-species single-cell transcriptomic analysis of ocular compartment regulons,"The retina is a widely profiled tissue in multiple species by single-cell RNA sequencing studies. However, integrative research of the retina across species is lacking. Here, we construct the first single-cell atlas of the human and porcine ocular compartments and study inter-species differences in the retina. In addition to that, we identify putative adult stem cells present in the iris tissue. We also create a disease map of genes involved in eye disorders across compartments of the eye. Furthermore, we probe the regulons of different cell populations, which include transcription factors and receptor-ligand interactions and reveal unique directional signalling between ocular cell types. In addition, we study conservation of regulons across vertebrates and zebrafish to identify common core factors. Here, we show perturbation of KLF7 gene expression during retinal ganglion cells differentiation and conclude that it plays a significant role in the maturation of retinal ganglion cells.",34584087,PMC8478974,10.1038/s41467-021-25968-8,38
Single-Cell Transcriptomics of a Human Kidney Allograft Biopsy Specimen Defines a Diverse Inflammatory Response,"BackgroundSingle-cell genomics techniques are revolutionizing our ability to characterize complex tissues. By contrast, the techniques used to analyze renal biopsy specimens have changed little over several decades. We tested the hypothesis that single-cell RNA-sequencing can comprehensively describe cell types and states in a human kidney biopsy specimen.MethodsWe generated 8746 single-cell transcriptomes from a healthy adult kidney and a single kidney transplant biopsy core by single-cell RNA-sequencing. Unsupervised clustering analysis of the biopsy specimen was performed to identify 16 distinct cell types, including all of the major immune cell types and most native kidney cell types, in this biopsy specimen, for which the histologic read was mixed rejection.ResultsMonocytes formed two subclusters representing a nonclassical CD16+ group and a classic CD16- group expressing dendritic cell maturation markers. The presence of both monocyte cell subtypes was validated by staining of independent transplant biopsy specimens. Comparison of healthy kidney epithelial transcriptomes with biopsy specimen counterparts identified novel segment-specific proinflammatory responses in rejection. Endothelial cells formed three distinct subclusters: resting cells and two activated endothelial cell groups. One activated endothelial cell group expressed Fc receptor pathway activation and Ig internalization genes, consistent with the pathologic diagnosis of antibody-mediated rejection. We mapped previously defined genes that associate with rejection outcomes to single cell types and generated a searchable online gene expression database.ConclusionsWe present the first step toward incorporation of single-cell transcriptomics into kidney biopsy specimen interpretation, describe a heterogeneous immune response in mixed rejection, and provide a searchable resource for the scientific community.",29980650,PMC6065085,10.1681/ASN.2018020125,183
Benchmarking mapping algorithms for cell-type annotating in mouse brain by integrating single-nucleus RNA-seq and Stereo-seq data,"Limited gene capture efficiency and spot size of spatial transcriptome (ST) data pose significant challenges in cell-type characterization. The heterogeneity and complexity of cell composition in the mammalian brain make it more challenging to accurately annotate ST data from brain. Many algorithms attempt to characterize subtypes of neuron by integrating ST data with single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) or single-cell RNA sequencing. However, assessing the accuracy of these algorithms on Stereo-seq ST data remains unresolved. Here, we benchmarked 9 mapping algorithms using 10 ST datasets from four mouse brain regions in two different resolutions and 24 pseudo-ST datasets from snRNA-seq. Both actual ST data and pseudo-ST data were mapped using snRNA-seq datasets from the corresponding brain regions as reference data. After comparing the performance across different areas and resolutions of the mouse brain, we have reached the conclusion that both robust cell-type decomposition and SpatialDWLS demonstrated superior robustness and accuracy in cell-type annotation. Testing with publicly available snRNA-seq data from another sequencing platform in the cortex region further validated our conclusions. Altogether, we developed a workflow for assessing suitability of mapping algorithm that fits for ST datasets, which can improve the efficiency and accuracy of spatial data annotation.",38796691,PMC11128029,10.1093/bib/bbae250,0
Ontogeny and Biology of Human Small Airway Epithelial Club Cells,"Rationale:Little is known about human club cells, dome-shaped cells with dense cytoplasmic granules and microvilli that represent the major secretory cells of the human small airways (at least sixth-generation bronchi).Objectives:To define the ontogeny and biology of the human small airway epithelium club cell.Methods:The small airway epithelium was sampled from the normal human lung by bronchoscopy and brushing. Single-cell transcriptome analysis and air-liquid interface culture were used to assess club cell ontogeny and biology.Measurements and main results:We identified the club cell population by unbiased clustering using single-cell transcriptome sequencing. Principal component gradient analysis uncovered an ontologic link between KRT5 (keratin 5)+basal cells and SCGB1A1 (secretoglobin family 1A member 1)+club cells, a hypothesis verified by demonstrating in vitro that a pure population of human KRT5+SCGB1A1-small airway epithelial basal cells differentiate into SCGB1A1+KRT5-club cells on air-liquid interface culture. Using SCGB1A1 as the marker of club cells, the single-cell analysis identified novel roles for these cells in host defense, xenobiotic metabolism, antiprotease, physical barrier function, monogenic lung disorders, and receptors for human viruses.Conclusions:These observations provide novel insights into the molecular phenotype and biologic functions of the human club cell population and identify basal cells as the human progenitor cells for club cells.",29874100,PMC6290945,10.1164/rccm.201710-2107OC,51
Negative regulation of angiogenesis and the MAPK pathway may be a shared biological pathway between IS and epilepsy,"Ischemia stroke and epilepsy are two neurological diseases that have significant patient and societal burden, with similar symptoms of neurological deficits. However, the underlying mechanism of their co-morbidity are still unclear. In this study, we performed a combined analysis of six gene expression profiles (GSE58294, GSE22255, GSE143272, GSE88723, GSE163654, and GSE174574) to reveal the common mechanisms of IS and epilepsy. In the mouse datasets, 74 genes were co-upregulated and 7 genes were co-downregulated in the stroke and epilepsy groups. Further analysis revealed that the co-expressed differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were involved in negative regulation of angiogenesis and the MAPK signaling pathway, and this was verified by Gene Set Enrichment Analysis of human datasets and single cell RNA sequence of middle cerebral artery occlusion mice. In addition, combining DEGs of human and mouse, PTGS2, TMCC3, KCNJ2, and GADD45B were identified as cross species conserved hub genes. Meanwhile, molecular docking results revealed that trichostatin A and valproic acid may be potential therapeutic drugs. In conclusion, to our best knowledge, this study conducted the first comorbidity analysis of epilepsy and ischemic stroke to identify the potential common pathogenic mechanisms and drugs. The findings may provide an important reference for the further studies on post-stroke epilepsy.",37792772,PMC10550183,10.1371/journal.pone.0286426,0
A single-cell transcriptome atlas profiles early organogenesis in human embryos,"The early window of human embryogenesis is largely a black box for developmental biologists. Here we probed the cellular diversity of 4-6 week human embryos when essentially all organs are just laid out. On the basis of over 180,000 single-cell transcriptomes, we generated a comprehensive atlas of 313 clusters in 18 developmental systems, which were annotated with a collection of ontology and markers from 157 publications. Together with spatial transcriptome on embryonic sections, we characterized the molecule and spatial architecture of previously unappreciated cell types. Combined with data from other vertebrates, the rich information shed light on spatial patterning of axes, systemic temporal regulation of developmental progression and potential human-specific regulation. Our study provides a compendium of early progenitor cells of human organs, which can serve as the root of lineage analysis in organogenesis.",36928764,,10.1038/s41556-023-01108-w,15
Deep sequencing reveals cell-type-specific patterns of single-cell transcriptome variation,"Background:Differentiation of metazoan cells requires execution of different gene expression programs but recent single-cell transcriptome profiling has revealed considerable variation within cells of seeming identical phenotype. This brings into question the relationship between transcriptome states and cell phenotypes. Additionally, single-cell transcriptomics presents unique analysis challenges that need to be addressed to answer this question.Results:We present high quality deep read-depth single-cell RNA sequencing for 91 cells from five mouse tissues and 18 cells from two rat tissues, along with 30 control samples of bulk RNA diluted to single-cell levels. We find that transcriptomes differ globally across tissues with regard to the number of genes expressed, the average expression patterns, and within-cell-type variation patterns. We develop methods to filter genes for reliable quantification and to calibrate biological variation. All cell types include genes with high variability in expression, in a tissue-specific manner. We also find evidence that single-cell variability of neuronal genes in mice is correlated with that in rats consistent with the hypothesis that levels of variation may be conserved.Conclusions:Single-cell RNA-sequencing data provide a unique view of transcriptome function; however, careful analysis is required in order to use single-cell RNA-sequencing measurements for this purpose. Technical variation must be considered in single-cell RNA-sequencing studies of expression variation. For a subset of genes, biological variability within each cell type appears to be regulated in order to perform dynamic functions, rather than solely molecular noise.",26056000,PMC4480509,10.1186/s13059-015-0683-4,49
Novel Approach for Pancreas Transcriptomics Reveals the Cellular Landscape in Homeostasis and Acute Pancreatitis,"Background & aims:Acinar cells produce digestive enzymes that impede transcriptomic characterization of the exocrine pancreas. Thus, single-cell RNA-sequencing studies of the pancreas underrepresent acinar cells relative to histological expectations, and a robust approach to capture pancreatic cell responses in disease states is needed. We sought to innovate a method that overcomes these challenges to accelerate study of the pancreas in health and disease.Methods:We leverage FixNCut, a single-cell RNA-sequencing approach in which tissue is reversibly fixed with dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) before dissociation and single-cell preparation. We apply FixNCut to an established mouse model of acute pancreatitis, validate findings using GeoMx whole transcriptome atlas profiling, and integrate our data with prior studies to compare our method in both mouse and human pancreas datasets.Results:FixNCut achieves unprecedented definition of challenging pancreatic cells, including acinar and immune populations in homeostasis and acute pancreatitis, and identifies changes in all major cell types during injury and recovery. We define the acinar transcriptome during homeostasis and acinar-to-ductal metaplasia and establish a unique gene set to measure deviation from normal acinar identity. We characterize pancreatic immune cells, and analysis of T-cell subsets reveals a polarization of the homeostatic pancreas toward type-2 immunity. We report immune responses during acute pancreatitis and recovery, including early neutrophil infiltration, expansion of dendritic cell subsets, and a substantial shift in the transcriptome of macrophages due to both resident macrophage activation and monocyte infiltration.Conclusions:FixNCut preserves pancreatic transcriptomes to uncover novel cell states during homeostasis and following pancreatitis, establishing a broadly applicable approach and reference atlas for study of pancreas biology and disease.",38325760,,10.1053/j.gastro.2024.01.043,0
Single-cell transcriptomics dissects the transcriptome alterations of hematopoietic stem cells in myelodysplastic neoplasms,"Background:Myelodysplastic neoplasms (MDS) are myeloid neoplasms characterized by disordered differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells and a predisposition to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The underline pathogenesis remains unclear.Methods:In this study, the trajectory of differentiation and mechanisms of leukemic transformation were explored through bioinformatics analysis of single-cell RNA-Seq data from hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) in MDS patients.Results:Among the HSPC clusters, the proportion of common myeloid progenitor (CMP) was the main cell cluster in the patients with excess blasts (EB)/ secondary AML. Cell cycle analysis indicated the CMP of MDS patients were in an active proliferative state. The genes involved in the cell proliferation, such as MAML3 and PLCB1, were up-regulated in MDS CMP. Further validation analysis indicated that the expression levels of MAML3 and PLCB1 in patients with MDS-EB were significantly higher than those without EB. Patients with high expression of PLCB1 had a higher risk of transformation to AML. PLCB1 inhibitor can suppress proliferation, induce cell cycle arrest, and activate apoptosis of leukemic cells in vitro.Conclusion:This study revealed the transcriptomic change of HSPCs in MDS patients along the pseudotime and indicated that PLCB1 plays a key role in the transformation of MDS into leukemia.",38632656,PMC11022353,10.1186/s12967-024-05165-z,0
Deciphering Brain Complexity Using Single-cell Sequencing,"The human brain contains billions of highly differentiated and interconnected cells that form intricate neural networks and collectively control the physical activities and high-level cognitive functions, such as memory, decision-making, and social behavior. Big data is required to decipher the complexity of cell types, as well as connectivity and functions of the brain. The newly developed single-cell sequencing technology, which provides a comprehensive landscape of brain cell type diversity by profiling the transcriptome, genome, and/or epigenome of individual cells, has contributed substantially to revealing the complexity and dynamics of the brain and providing new insights into brain development and brain-related disorders. In this review, we first introduce the progresses in both experimental and computational methods of single-cell sequencing technology. Applications of single-cell sequencing-based technologies in brain research, including cell type classification, brain development, and brain disease mechanisms, are then elucidated by representative studies. Lastly, we provided our perspectives into the challenges and future developments in the field of single-cell sequencing. In summary, this mini review aims to provide an overview of how big data generated from single-cell sequencing have empowered the advancements in neuroscience and shed light on the complex problems in understanding brain functions and diseases.",31586689,PMC6943771,10.1016/j.gpb.2018.07.007,34
Molecularly defined and spatially resolved cell atlas of the whole mouse brain,"In mammalian brains, millions to billions of cells form complex interaction networks to enable a wide range of functions. The enormous diversity and intricate organization of cells have impeded our understanding of the molecular and cellular basis of brain function. Recent advances in spatially resolved single-cell transcriptomics have enabled systematic mapping of the spatial organization of molecularly defined cell types in complex tissues1-3, including several brain regions (for example, refs.1-11). However, a comprehensive cell atlas of the whole brain is still missing. Here we imaged a panel of more than 1,100 genes in approximately 10 million cells across the entire adult mouse brains using multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization12and performed spatially resolved, single-cell expression profiling at the whole-transcriptome scale by integrating multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization and single-cell RNA sequencing data. Using this approach, we generated a comprehensive cell atlas of more than 5,000 transcriptionally distinct cell clusters, belonging to more than 300 major cell types, in the whole mouse brain with high molecular and spatial resolution. Registration of this atlas to the mouse brain common coordinate framework allowed systematic quantifications of the cell-type composition and organization in individual brain regions. We further identified spatial modules characterized by distinct cell-type compositions and spatial gradients featuring gradual changes of cells. Finally, this high-resolution spatial map of cells, each with a transcriptome-wide expression profile, allowed us to infer cell-type-specific interactions between hundreds of cell-type pairs and predict molecular (ligand-receptor) basis and functional implications of these cell-cell interactions. These results provide rich insights into the molecular and cellular architecture of the brain and a foundation for functional investigations of neural circuits and their dysfunction in health and disease.",38092912,PMC10719103,10.1038/s41586-023-06808-9,27
"Integrating single-cell transcriptomic data across different conditions, technologies, and species","Computational single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) methods have been successfully applied to experiments representing a single condition, technology, or species to discover and define cellular phenotypes. However, identifying subpopulations of cells that are present across multiple data sets remains challenging. Here, we introduce an analytical strategy for integrating scRNA-seq data sets based on common sources of variation, enabling the identification of shared populations across data sets and downstream comparative analysis. We apply this approach, implemented in our R toolkit Seurat (http://satijalab.org/seurat/), to align scRNA-seq data sets of peripheral blood mononuclear cells under resting and stimulated conditions, hematopoietic progenitors sequenced using two profiling technologies, and pancreatic cell 'atlases' generated from human and mouse islets. In each case, we learn distinct or transitional cell states jointly across data sets, while boosting statistical power through integrated analysis. Our approach facilitates general comparisons of scRNA-seq data sets, potentially deepening our understanding of how distinct cell states respond to perturbation, disease, and evolution.",29608179,PMC6700744,10.1038/nbt.4096,4927
Single-cell transcriptome analysis of embryonic and adult endothelial cells allows to rank the hemogenic potential of post-natal endothelium,"Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are crucial for the continuous production of blood cells during life. The transplantation of these cells is one of the most common treatments to cure patient suffering of blood diseases. However, the lack of suitable donors is a major limitation. One option to get HSCs matching perfectly a patient is cellular reprogramming. HSCs emerge from endothelial cells in blood vessels during embryogenesis through the endothelial to hematopoietic transition. Here, we used single-cell transcriptomics analysis to compare embryonic and post-natal endothelial cells to investigate the potential of adult vasculature to be reprogrammed in hematopoietic stem cells. Although transcriptional similarities have been found between embryonic and adult endothelial cells, we found some key differences in term of transcription factors expression. There is a deficit of expression of Runx1, Tal1, Lyl1 and Cbfb in adult endothelial cells compared to their embryonic counterparts. Using a combination of gene expression profiling and gene regulatory network analysis, we found that endothelial cells from the pancreas, brain, kidney and liver appear to be the most suitable targets for cellular reprogramming into HSCs. Overall, our work provides an important resource for the rational design of a reprogramming strategy for the generation of HSCs.",35842474,PMC9288434,10.1038/s41598-022-16127-0,2
Characterizing transcriptional heterogeneity through pathway and gene set overdispersion analysis,"The transcriptional state of a cell reflects a variety of biological factors, from cell-type-specific features to transient processes such as the cell cycle, all of which may be of interest. However, identifying such aspects from noisy single-cell RNA-seq data remains challenging. We developed pathway and gene set overdispersion analysis (PAGODA) to resolve multiple, potentially overlapping aspects of transcriptional heterogeneity by testing gene sets for coordinated variability among measured cells.",26780092,PMC4772672,10.1038/nmeth.3734,196
Single-cell sequencing techniques from individual to multiomics analyses,"Here, we review single-cell sequencing techniques for individual and multiomics profiling in single cells. We mainly describe single-cell genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic methods, and examples of their applications. For the integration of multilayered data sets, such as the transcriptome data derived from single-cell RNA sequencing and chromatin accessibility data derived from single-cell ATAC-seq, there are several computational integration methods.

Significant Evolutionary Constraints on Neuron Cells Revealed by Single-Cell Transcriptomics,"Recent advances in single-cell RNA-sequencing technology have enabled us to characterize a variety of different cell types in each brain region. However, the evolutionary differences among these cell types remain unclear. Here, we analyzed single-cell RNA-seq data of >280,000 cells and developmental transcriptomes of bulk brain tissues. At the single-cell level, we found that the evolutionary constraints on the cell types of different organs significantly overlap with each other and the transcriptome of neuron cells is one of the most restricted evolutionarily. In addition, mature neurons are under more constraints than neuron stem cells as well as nascent neurons and the order of the constraints of various cell types of the brain is largely conserved in different subregions. We also found that although functionally similar brain regions have comparable evolutionary constraints, the early fetal brain is the least constrained and this pattern is conserved in the mouse, macaque, and humans. These results demonstrate the importance of maintaining the plasticity of early brain development during evolution. The delineation of evolutionary differences between brain cell types has great potential for an improved understanding of the pathogenesis of neurological diseases and drug development efforts aimed at the manipulation of molecular activities at the single-cell level.",32176293,PMC7186789,10.1093/gbe/evaa054,7
Bulk and single-cell transcriptome datasets of the mouse fetal and adult rete ovarii and surrounding tissues,"The rete ovarii (RO) is an epithelial structure that arises during development in close proximity to the ovary and persists throughout adulthood. However, the functional significance of the RO remains elusive, and it is absent from recent discussions of female reproductive anatomy. The RO comprises three regions: the intraovarian rete within the ovary, the extraovarian rete in the periovarian tissue, and the connecting rete linking the two. We hypothesize that the RO plays a pivotal role in ovarian homeostasis and responses to physiological changes. To begin to uncover the nature and function of RO cells, we conducted transcriptomic profiling of the RO. This study presents three datasets, and reports our analysis and quality control approaches for bulk, single-cell, and nucleus-level transcriptomics of the fetal and adult RO tissues using the Pax8-rtTA; Tre-H2B-GFP mouse line, where all RO regions express nuclear GFP. The integration and rigorous validation of these datasets will advance our understanding of the RO's roles in ovarian development, female maturation, and adult female fertility.",38615064,PMC11016079,10.1038/s41597-024-03227-x,0
RNA Tomography for Spatially Resolved Transcriptomics (Tomo-Seq),"Embryonic development is heavily dependent on temporally and spatially restricted gene expression. Spatially resolved measurements of gene expression are therefore crucial for identifying novel regulators and the understanding of their function. However, in situ methods do not resolve global gene expression, and sequencing-based methods usually do not provide spatial information. Here, we describe tomo-seq, a method that combines classical histological sectioning of embryos or tissues with a highly sensitive RNA-sequencing technique. Application of tomo-seq to zebrafish embryos allows reconstructing the spatial gene expression of thousands of genes.",30737690,,10.1007/978-1-4939-9009-2_9,8
Single cell RNA sequencing techniques and applications in research of ovary development and related diseases,"The ovary is a highly organized composite of germ cells and various types of somatic cells, whose communications dictate ovary development to generate functional oocytes. The differences between individual cells might have profound effects on ovary functions. Single cell RNA sequencing techniques are promising approaches to explore the cell type composition of organisms, the dynamics of transcriptomes, the regulatory network between genes and the signaling pathways between cell types at the single cell resolution. In this review, we provide an overview of the currently available single cell RNA sequencing techniques including Smart-seq2 and Drop-seq, as well as their applications in biological and clinical research to provide a better understanding on the molecular mechanisms underlying ovary development and associated diseases.",34896591,,10.1016/j.reprotox.2021.12.003,2
Dimension Reduction and Clustering Models for Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Data: A Comparative Study,"With recent advances in single-cell RNA sequencing, enormous transcriptome datasets have been generated. These datasets have furthered our understanding of cellular heterogeneity and its underlying mechanisms in homogeneous populations. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data clustering can group cells belonging to the same cell type based on patterns embedded in gene expression. However, scRNA-seq data are high-dimensional, noisy, and sparse, owing to the limitation of existing scRNA-seq technologies. Traditional clustering methods are not effective and efficient for high-dimensional and sparse matrix computations. Therefore, several dimension reduction methods have been introduced. To validate a reliable and standard research routine, we conducted a comprehensive review and evaluation of four classical dimension reduction methods and five clustering models. Four experiments were progressively performed on two large scRNA-seq datasets using 20 models. Results showed that the feature selection method contributed positively to high-dimensional and sparse scRNA-seq data. Moreover, feature-extraction methods were able to promote clustering performance, although this was not eternally immutable. Independent component analysis (ICA) performed well in those small compressed feature spaces, whereas principal component analysis was steadier than all the other feature-extraction methods. In addition, ICA was not ideal for fuzzy C-means clustering in scRNA-seq data analysis. K-means clustering was combined with feature-extraction methods to achieve good results.",32235704,PMC7139673,10.3390/ijms21062181,16
Single-cell biclustering for cell-specific transcriptomic perturbation detection in AD progression,"The pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease (AD) involves complex gene regulatory changes across different cell types. To help decipher this complexity, we introduce single-cell Bayesian biclustering (scBC), a framework for identifying cell-specific gene network biomarkers in scRNA and snRNA-seq data. Through biclustering, scBC enables the analysis of perturbations in functional gene modules at the single-cell level. Applying the scBC framework to AD snRNA-seq data reveals the perturbations within gene modules across distinct cell groups and sheds light on gene-cell correlations during AD progression. Notably, our method helps to overcome common challenges in single-cell data analysis, including batch effects and dropout events. Incorporating prior knowledge further enables the framework to yield more biologically interpretable results. Comparative analyses on simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate the precision and robustness of our approach compared to other state-of-the-art biclustering methods. scBC holds potential for unraveling the mechanisms underlying polygenic diseases characterized by intricate gene coexpression patterns.",38554701,PMC11045878,10.1016/j.crmeth.2024.100742,0
Uncertainty-aware single-cell annotation with a hierarchical reject option,"Motivation:Automatic cell type annotation methods assign cell type labels to new datasets by extracting relationships from a reference RNA-seq dataset. However, due to the limited resolution of gene expression features, there is always uncertainty present in the label assignment. To enhance the reliability and robustness of annotation, most machine learning methods address this uncertainty by providing a full reject option, i.e. when the predicted confidence score of a cell type label falls below a user-defined threshold, no label is assigned and no prediction is made. As a better alternative, some methods deploy hierarchical models and consider a so-called partial rejection by returning internal nodes of the hierarchy as label assignment. However, because a detailed experimental analysis of various rejection approaches is missing in the literature, there is currently no consensus on best practices.Results:We evaluate three annotation approaches (i) full rejection, (ii) partial rejection, and (iii) no rejection for both flat and hierarchical probabilistic classifiers. Our findings indicate that hierarchical classifiers are superior when rejection is applied, with partial rejection being the preferred rejection approach, as it preserves a significant amount of label information. For optimal rejection implementation, the rejection threshold should be determined through careful examination of a method's rejection behavior. Without rejection, flat and hierarchical annotation perform equally well, as long as the cell type hierarchy accurately captures transcriptomic relationships.Availability and implementation:Code is freely available at https://github.com/Latheuni/Hierarchical_reject and https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10697468.",38441258,PMC10957513,10.1093/bioinformatics/btae128,0
SPASCER: spatial transcriptomics annotation at single-cell resolution,"In recent years, the explosive growth of spatial technologies has enabled the characterization of spatial heterogeneity of tissue architectures. Compared to traditional sequencing, spatial transcriptomics reserves the spatial information of each captured location and provides novel insights into diverse spatially related biological contexts. Even though two spatial transcriptomics databases exist, they provide limited analytical information. Information such as spatial heterogeneity of genes and cells, cell-cell communication activities in space, and the cell type compositions in the microenvironment are critical clues to unveil the mechanism of tumorigenesis and embryo differentiation. Therefore, we constructed a new spatial transcriptomics database, named SPASCER (https://ccsm.uth.edu/SPASCER), designed to help understand the heterogeneity of tissue organizations, region-specific microenvironment, and intercellular interactions across tissue architectures at multiple levels. SPASCER contains datasets from 43 studies, including 1082 sub-datasets from 16 organ types across four species. scRNA-seq was integrated to deconvolve/map spatial transcriptomics, and processed with spatial cell-cell interaction, gene pattern and pathway enrichment analysis. Cell-cell interactions and gene regulation network of scRNA-seq from matched spatial transcriptomics were performed as well. The application of SPASCER will provide new insights into tissue architecture and a solid foundation for the mechanistic understanding of many biological processes in healthy and diseased tissues.",36243975,PMC9825565,10.1093/nar/gkac889,8
Single-cell transcriptomic landscape of nucleated cells in umbilical cord blood,"Background:For both pediatric and adult patients, umbilical cord blood (UCB) transplant is a therapeutic option for a variety of hematologic diseases, such as blood cancers, myeloproliferative disorders, genetic diseases, and metabolic disorders. However, the level of cellular heterogeneity and diversity of nucleated cells in UCB has not yet been assessed in an unbiased and systemic fashion. In the present study, nucleated cells from UCB were subjected to single-cell RNA sequencing to simultaneously profile the gene expression signatures of thousands of cells, generating a rich resource for further functional studies. Here, we report the transcriptomes of 17,637 UCB cells, covering 12 major cell types, many of which can be further divided into distinct subpopulations.Results:Pseudotemporal ordering of nucleated red blood cells identifies wave-like activation and suppression of transcription regulators, leading to a polarized cellular state, which may reflect nucleated red blood cell maturation. Progenitor cells in UCB also comprise 2 subpopulations with activation of divergent transcription programs, leading to specific cell fate commitment. Detailed profiling of cytotoxic cell populations unveiled granzymes B and K signatures in natural killer and natural killer T-cell types in UCB.Conclusions:Taken together, our data form a comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic landscape that reveals previously unrecognized cell types, pathways, and mechanisms of gene expression regulation. These data may contribute to the efficacy and outcome of UCB transplant, broadening the scope of research and clinical innovations.",31049560,PMC6497034,10.1093/gigascience/giz047,15
Significant variations in alternative splicing patterns and expression profiles between human-mouse orthologs in early embryos,"Human and mouse orthologs are expected to have similar biological functions; however, many discrepancies have also been reported. We systematically compared human and mouse orthologs in terms of alternative splicing patterns and expression profiles. Human-mouse orthologs are divergent in alternative splicing, as human orthologs could generally encode more isoforms than their mouse orthologs. In early embryos, exon skipping is far more common with human orthologs, whereas constitutive exons are more prevalent with mouse orthologs. This may correlate with divergence in expression of splicing regulators. Orthologous expression similarities are different in distinct embryonic stages, with the highest in morula. Expression differences for orthologous transcription factor genes could play an important role in orthologous expression discordance. We further detected largely orthologous divergence in differential expression between distinct embryonic stages. Collectively, our study uncovers significant orthologous divergence from multiple aspects, which may result in functional differences and dynamics between human-mouse orthologs during embryonic development.",27378339,,10.1007/s11427-015-0348-5,7
A Quantitative Framework for Evaluating Single-Cell Data Structure Preservation by Dimensionality Reduction Techniques,"High-dimensional data, such as those generated by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), present challenges in interpretation and visualization. Numerical and computational methods for dimensionality reduction allow for low-dimensional representation of genome-scale expression data for downstream clustering, trajectory reconstruction, and biological interpretation. However, a comprehensive and quantitative evaluation of the performance of these techniques has not been established. We present an unbiased framework that defines metrics of global and local structure preservation in dimensionality reduction transformations. Using discrete and continuous real-world and synthetic scRNA-seq datasets, we show how input cell distribution and method parameters are largely determinant of global, local, and organizational data structure preservation by 11 common dimensionality reduction methods.",32375029,PMC7305633,10.1016/j.celrep.2020.107576,23
RNA-Seq following PCR-based sorting reveals rare cell transcriptional signatures,"Background:Rare cell subtypes can profoundly impact the course of human health and disease, yet their presence within a sample is often missed with bulk molecular analysis. Single-cell analysis tools such as FACS, FISH-FC and single-cell barcode-based sequencing can investigate cellular heterogeneity; however, they have significant limitations that impede their ability to identify and transcriptionally characterize many rare cell subpopulations.Results:PCR-activated cell sorting (PACS) is a novel cytometry method that uses single-cell TaqMan PCR reactions performed in microfluidic droplets to identify and isolate cell subtypes with high-throughput. Here, we extend this method and demonstrate that PACS enables high-dimensional molecular profiling on TaqMan-targeted cells. Using a random priming RNA-Seq strategy, we obtained high-fidelity transcriptome measurements following PACS sorting of prostate cancer cells from a heterogeneous population. The sequencing data revealed prostate cancer gene expression profiles that were obscured in the unsorted populations. Single-cell expression analysis with PACS was subsequently used to confirm a number of the differentially expressed genes identified with RNA sequencing.Conclusions:PACS requires minimal sample processing, uses readily available TaqMan assays and can isolate cell subtypes with high sensitivity. We have now validated a method for performing next-generation sequencing on mRNA obtained from PACS isolated cells. This capability makes PACS well suited for transcriptional profiling of rare cells from complex populations to obtain maximal biological insight into cell states and behaviors.",27189161,PMC4869385,10.1186/s12864-016-2694-2,14
"Multimodal profiling of single-cell morphology, electrophysiology, and gene expression using Patch-seq","Neurons exhibit a rich diversity of morphological phenotypes, electrophysiological properties, and gene-expression patterns. Understanding how these different characteristics are interrelated at the single-cell level has been difficult because of the lack of techniques for multimodal profiling of individual cells. We recently developed Patch-seq, a technique that combines whole-cell patch-clamp recording, immunohistochemistry, and single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to comprehensively profile single neurons from mouse brain slices. Here, we present a detailed step-by-step protocol, including modifications to the patching mechanics and recording procedure, reagents and recipes, procedures for immunohistochemistry, and other tips to assist researchers in obtaining high-quality morphological, electrophysiological, and transcriptomic data from single neurons. Successful implementation of Patch-seq allows researchers to explore the multidimensional phenotypic variability among neurons and to correlate gene expression with phenotype at the level of single cells. The entire procedure can be completed in ∼2 weeks through the combined efforts of a skilled electrophysiologist, molecular biologist, and biostatistician.",29189773,PMC6422019,10.1038/nprot.2017.120,70
Single-Molecule Spatial Transcriptomics of Human Thoracic Aortic Aneurysms Uncovers Calcification-RelatedCARTPT-Expressing Smooth Muscle Cells,"Background:Although single-cell RNA-sequencing is commonly applied to dissect the heterogeneity in human tissues, it involves the preparation of single-cell suspensions via cell dissociation, causing loss of spatial information. In this study, we employed high-resolution single-cell transcriptome imaging to reveal rare smooth muscle cell (SMC) types in human thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) tissue samples.Methods:Single-molecule spatial distribution of transcripts from 140 genes was analyzed in fresh-frozen human TAA samples with region and sex-matched controls. In vitro studies and tissue staining were performed to examine human CART prepropeptide (CARTPT) regulation and function.Results:We captured thousands of cells per sample including a spatially distinctCARTPT-expressing SMC subtype enriched in male TAA samples. Immunoassays confirmed human CART (cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript) protein enrichment in male TAA tissue and truncated CARTPT secretion into cell culture medium. Oxidized low-density lipoprotein, a cardiovascular risk factor, inducedCARTPTexpression, whereasCARTPToverexpression in human aortic SMCs increased the expression of key osteochondrogenic transcription factors and reduced contractile gene expression. Recombinant human CART treatment of human SMCs further confirmed this phenotype. Alizarin red staining revealed calcium deposition in male TAA samples showing similar localization with human CART staining.Conclusions:Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of single-molecule imaging in uncovering rare SMC subtypes in the diseased human aorta, a difficult tissue to dissociate. We identified a spatially distinctCARTPT-expressing SMC subtype enriched in male human TAA samples. Our functional studies suggest that human CART promotes osteochondrogenic switch of aortic SMCs, potentially leading to medial calcification of the thoracic aorta.",37823268,,10.1161/ATVBAHA.123.319329,4
High-throughput mechanical phenotyping and transcriptomics of single cells,"The molecular system regulating cellular mechanical properties remains unexplored at single-cell resolution mainly due to a limited ability to combine mechanophenotyping with unbiased transcriptional screening. Here, we describe an electroporation-based lipid-bilayer assay for cell surface tension and transcriptomics (ELASTomics), a method in which oligonucleotide-labelled macromolecules are imported into cells via nanopore electroporation to assess the mechanical state of the cell surface and are enumerated by sequencing. ELASTomics can be readily integrated with existing single-cell sequencing approaches and enables the joint study of cell surface mechanics and underlying transcriptional regulation at an unprecedented resolution. We validate ELASTomics via analysis of cancer cell lines from various malignancies and show that the method can accurately identify cell types and assess cell surface tension. ELASTomics enables exploration of the relationships between cell surface tension, surface proteins, and transcripts along cell lineages differentiating from the haematopoietic progenitor cells of mice. We study the surface mechanics of cellular senescence and demonstrate that RRAD regulates cell surface tension in senescent TIG-1 cells. ELASTomics provides a unique opportunity to profile the mechanical and molecular phenotypes of single cells and can dissect the interplay among these in a range of biological contexts.",38760380,PMC11101642,10.1038/s41467-024-48088-5,0
Discovering sparse transcription factor codes for cell states and state transitions during development,"Computational analysis of gene expression to determine both the sequence of lineage choices made by multipotent cells and to identify the genes influencing these decisions is challenging. Here we discover a pattern in the expression levels of a sparse subset of genes among cell types in B- and T-cell developmental lineages that correlates with developmental topologies. We develop a statistical framework using this pattern to simultaneously infer lineage transitions and the genes that determine these relationships. We use this technique to reconstruct the early hematopoietic and intestinal developmental trees. We extend this framework to analyze single-cell RNA-seq data from early human cortical development, inferring a neocortical-hindbrain split in early progenitor cells and the key genes that could control this lineage decision. Our work allows us to simultaneously infer both the identity and lineage of cell types as well as a small set of key genes whose expression patterns reflect these relationships.",28296636,PMC5352226,10.7554/eLife.20488,17
Genome-wide identification and expression analysis of heat shock protein gene family in cassava,"Heat shock proteins are important molecular chaperones that are involved in plant growth and stress responses. However, members of the Hsp family have been poorly studied in cassava. In this study, 225 MeHsp genes were identified in the cassava genome, and their genetic structures exhibited relatively conserved features within each subfamily. The 225 MeHsp genes showed random chromosomal distribution, and at least 74 pairs of segmentally duplicated MeHsp genes. Eleven tandemly duplicated MeHsp genes were identified. Cis-element analysis revealed the importance of MeHsps in plant adaptations to the environment. The prediction of protein interactions suggested that MeHsp70-20 may play a critical regulatory role in the interactive network. Furthermore, the expression profiles of MeHsps in different tissues and cell subsets were analyzed using bulk transcriptomics and single-cell transcriptomic data. Several subfamily genes exhibited unique expression patterns in the transcriptome and were selected for detailed analysis of the single-cell transcriptome. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) revealed the expression patterns of these genes under temperature stress, further supporting the prediction of cis-acting elements. This study provides valuable information for understanding the functional characteristics of MeHsp genes and the evolutionary relationships between MeHsps.",37899677,,10.1002/tpg2.20407,0
Revolutionizing immunology with single-cell RNA sequencing,"The immune system is composed of a complex hierarchy of cell types that protect the organism against disease and maintain homeostasis. Identifying heterogeneity of immune cells is the key to understanding the immune system. Advanced single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies are revolutionizing our ability to study immunology. By measuring transcriptomes at the single-cell level, scRNA-seq enables identification of cellular heterogeneity in far greater detail than conventional methods. In this review, we introduce the existing scRNA-seq technologies and present their strengths and weaknesses. We also discuss potential applications and future innovations of scRNA-seq in immunology.",30796351,PMC6460502,10.1038/s41423-019-0214-4,81
Topological identification and interpretation for single-cell gene regulation elucidation across multiple platforms using scMGCA,"Single-cell RNA sequencing provides high-throughput gene expression information to explore cellular heterogeneity at the individual cell level. A major challenge in characterizing high-throughput gene expression data arises from challenges related to dimensionality, and the prevalence of dropout events. To address these concerns, we develop a deep graph learning method, scMGCA, for single-cell data analysis. scMGCA is based on a graph-embedding autoencoder that simultaneously learns cell-cell topology representation and cluster assignments. We show that scMGCA is accurate and effective for cell segregation and batch effect correction, outperforming other state-of-the-art models across multiple platforms. In addition, we perform genomic interpretation on the key compressed transcriptomic space of the graph-embedding autoencoder to demonstrate the underlying gene regulation mechanism. We demonstrate that in a pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma dataset, scMGCA successfully provides annotations on the specific cell types and reveals differential gene expression levels across multiple tumor-associated and cell signalling pathways.",36697410,PMC9877026,10.1038/s41467-023-36134-7,5
Direct isolation of single cells from living brains of Drosophila melanogaster without dissociation for transcriptome analysis,"Here, we describe a protocol to remove single identified cells directly from Drosophila living brains and analyze their transcriptome. We detail the steps to harvest fluorescent cells using a capillary under epifluorescence and transmitted light to avoid contamination. We then outline the procedure to obtain the transcriptome by reverse transcription and amplification. The process from cell harvesting to the initiation of reverse transcription only takes 2 min, thus avoiding transcriptional activation of cell damage response or cell death genes. For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to Barros and Bossing (2021), Bossing et al. (2012), Gil-Ranedo et al. (2019), and Liu and Bossing (2016).",36181682,PMC9529598,10.1016/j.xpro.2022.101735,1
Molecular mechanism analyses of post-traumatic epilepsy and hereditary epilepsy based on 10× single-cell transcriptome sequencing technology,"Background:Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis has been usually conducted on post-traumatic epilepsy (PET) and hereditary epilepsy (HE) patients; however, the transcriptome of patients with traumatic temporal lobe epilepsy has rarely been studied.Materials and methods:Hippocampus tissues isolated from one patient with PTE and one patient with HE were used in the present study. Single cell isolates were prepared and captured using a 10× Genomics Chromium Single-Cell 3' kit (V3) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencing system. Raw data were processed, and the cells were filtered and classified using the Seurat R package. Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection was used for visualization. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified based on a p-value ≤0.01 and log fold change (FC) ≥0.25. Gene Ontology (GO, http://geneontology.org/) and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, www.genome.jp/kegg) analyses were performed on the DEGs for enrichment analysis.Results:The reads obtained from the 10× genomic platform for PTE and HE were 39.56 M and 30.08 M, respectively. The Q30 score of the RNA reads was >91.6%. After filtering, 7479 PTE cells and 9357 HE cells remained for further study. More than 96.4% of the reads were mapped to GRCh38/GRCm38. The cells were differentially distributed in two groups, with higher numbers of oligodendrocytes (6522 vs. 2532) and astrocytes (133 vs. 52), and lower numbers of microglial cells (2242 vs. 3811), and neurons (3 vs. 203) present in the HE group than in the PTE group. The DEGs in four cell clusters were identified, with 25 being in oligodendrocytes (13 upregulated and 12 downregulated), 87 in microglia cells (42 upregulated and 45 downregulated), 222 in astrocytes (115 upregulated and 107 downregulated), and 393 in neurons (305 upregulated and 88 downregulated). The genes MTND1P23 (downregulated), XIST (downregulated), and RPS4Y1 (upregulated) were commonly expressed in all four cell clusters. The DEGs in microglial cells and astrocytes were enriched in the IL-17 signaling pathway.Conclusion:Our study explored differences in cells found in a patient with PE compared to a patient with HE, and the transcriptome in the different cells was analyzed for the first time. Studying inflammatory and immune functions might be the best approach for investigating traumatic temporal lobe epilepsy in neurons.",38572804,PMC10993349,10.1111/cns.14702,0
Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Analysis: A Step-by-Step Overview,"Thanks to innovative sample-preparation and sequencing technologies, gene expression in individual cells can now be measured for thousands of cells in a single experiment. Since its introduction, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) approaches have revolutionized the genomics field as they created unprecedented opportunities for resolving cell heterogeneity by exploring gene expression profiles at a single-cell resolution. However, the rapidly evolving field of scRNA-seq invoked the emergence of various analytics approaches aimed to maximize the full potential of this novel strategy. Unlike population-based RNA sequencing approaches, scRNA seq necessitates comprehensive computational tools to address high data complexity and keep up with the emerging single-cell associated challenges. Despite the vast number of analytical methods, a universal standardization is lacking. While this reflects the fields' immaturity, it may also encumber a newcomer to blend in.In this review, we aim to bridge over the abovementioned hurdle and propose four ready-to-use pipelines for scRNA-seq analysis easily accessible by a newcomer, that could fit various biological data types. Here we provide an overview of the currently available single-cell technologies for cell isolation and library preparation and a step by step guide that covers the entire canonical analytic workflow to analyse scRNA-seq data including read mapping, quality controls, gene expression quantification, normalization, feature selection, dimensionality reduction, and cell clustering useful for trajectory inference and differential expression. Such workflow guidelines will escort novices as well as expert users in the analysis of complex scRNA-seq datasets, thus further expanding the research potential of single-cell approaches in basic science, and envisaging its future implementation as best practice in the field.",33835452,,10.1007/978-1-0716-1307-8_19,50
Transcriptomic evidence for Brachyury expression in the caudal tip region of adult Ptychodera flava (Hemichordata),"Most metazoans have a single copy of the T-box transcription factor gene Brachyury. This gene is expressed in cells of the blastopore of late blastulae and the archenteron invagination region of gastrulae. It appears to be crucial for gastrulation and mesoderm differentiation of embryos. Although this expression pattern is shared by most deuterostomes, Brachyury expression has not been reported in adult stages. Here we show that Brachyury of an indirect developer, the hemichordate acorn worm Ptychodera flava, is expressed not only in embryonic cells, but also in cells of the caudal tip (anus) region of adults. This spatially restricted expression, shown by whole-mount in situ hybridization, was confirmed by Iso-Seq RNA sequencing and single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) analysis. Iso-Seq analysis showed that gene expression occurs only in the caudal region of adults, but not in anterior regions, including the stomochord. scRNA-seq analysis showed a cluster that contained Brachyury-expressing cells comprising epidermis- and mesoderm-related cells, but which is unlikely to be associated with the nervous system or muscle. Although further investigation is required to examine the roles of Brachyury in adults, this study provides important clues for extending studies on Brachyury expression involved in development of the most posterior region of deuterostomes.",37483093,,10.1111/dgd.12882,0
Deciphering human macrophage development at single-cell resolution,"Macrophages are the first cells of the nascent immune system to emerge during embryonic development. In mice, embryonic macrophages infiltrate developing organs, where they differentiate symbiotically into tissue-resident macrophages (TRMs)1. However, our understanding of the origins and specialization of macrophages in human embryos is limited. Here we isolated CD45+haematopoietic cells from human embryos at Carnegie stages 11 to 23 and subjected them to transcriptomic profiling by single-cell RNA sequencing, followed by functional characterization of a population of CD45+CD34+CD44+yolk sac-derived myeloid-biased progenitors (YSMPs) by single-cell culture. We also mapped macrophage heterogeneity across multiple anatomical sites and identified diverse subsets, including various types of embryonic TRM (in the head, liver, lung and skin). We further traced the specification trajectories of TRMs from either yolk sac-derived primitive macrophages or YSMP-derived embryonic liver monocytes using both transcriptomic and developmental staging information, with a focus on microglia. Finally, we evaluated the molecular similarities between embryonic TRMs and their adult counterparts. Our data represent a comprehensive characterization of the spatiotemporal dynamics of early macrophage development during human embryogenesis, providing a reference for future studies of the development and function of human TRMs.",32499656,,10.1038/s41586-020-2316-7,179
Cellsnake: a user-friendly tool for single-cell RNA sequencing analysis,"Background:Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides high-resolution transcriptome data to understand the heterogeneity of cell populations at the single-cell level. The analysis of scRNA-seq data requires the utilization of numerous computational tools. However, nonexpert users usually experience installation issues, a lack of critical functionality or batch analysis modes, and the steep learning curves of existing pipelines.Results:We have developed cellsnake, a comprehensive, reproducible, and accessible single-cell data analysis workflow, to overcome these problems. Cellsnake offers advanced features for standard users and facilitates downstream analyses in both R and Python environments. It is also designed for easy integration into existing workflows, allowing for rapid analyses of multiple samples.Conclusion:As an open-source tool, cellsnake is accessible through Bioconda, PyPi, Docker, and GitHub, making it a cost-effective and user-friendly option for researchers. By using cellsnake, researchers can streamline the analysis of scRNA-seq data and gain insights into the complex biology of single cells.",37889009,PMC10603768,10.1093/gigascience/giad091,3
Transcriptomic intratumor heterogeneity of breast cancer patient-derived organoids may reflect the unique biological features of the tumor of origin,"Background:The intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) of cancer cells plays an important role in breast cancer resistance and recurrence. To develop better therapeutic strategies, it is necessary to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying ITH and their functional significance. Patient-derived organoids (PDOs) have recently been utilized in cancer research. They can also be used to study ITH as cancer cell diversity is thought to be maintained within the organoid line. However, no reports investigated intratumor transcriptomic heterogeneity in organoids derived from patients with breast cancer. This study aimed to investigate transcriptomic ITH in breast cancer PDOs.Methods:We established PDO lines from ten patients with breast cancer and performed single-cell transcriptomic analysis. First, we clustered cancer cells for each PDO using the Seurat package. Then, we defined and compared the cluster-specific gene signature (ClustGS) corresponding to each cell cluster in each PDO.Results:Cancer cells were clustered into 3-6 cell populations with distinct cellular states in each PDO line. We identified 38 clusters with ClustGS in 10 PDO lines and used Jaccard similarity index to compare the similarity of these signatures. We found that 29 signatures could be categorized into 7 shared meta-ClustGSs, such as those related to the cell cycle or epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and 9 signatures were unique to single PDO lines. These unique cell populations appeared to represent the characteristics of the original tumors derived from patients.Conclusions:We confirmed the existence of transcriptomic ITH in breast cancer PDOs. Some cellular states were commonly observed in multiple PDOs, whereas others were specific to single PDO lines. The combination of these shared and unique cellular states formed the ITH of each PDO.",36810117,PMC9942352,10.1186/s13058-023-01617-4,4
Hubness reduction improves clustering and trajectory inference in single-cell transcriptomic data,"Motivation:Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNAseq) datasets are characterized by large ambient dimensionality, and their analyses can be affected by various manifestations of the dimensionality curse. One of these manifestations is the hubness phenomenon, i.e. existence of data points with surprisingly large incoming connectivity degree in the datapoint neighbourhood graph. Conventional approach to dampen the unwanted effects of high dimension consists in applying drastic dimensionality reduction. It remains unexplored if this step can be avoided thus retaining more information than contained in the low-dimensional projections, by correcting directly hubness.Results:We investigated hubness in scRNAseq data. We show that hub cells do not represent any visible technical or biological bias. The effect of various hubness reduction methods is investigated with respect to the clustering, trajectory inference and visualization tasks in scRNAseq datasets. We show that hubness reduction generates neighbourhood graphs with properties more suitable for applying machine learning methods; and that it outperforms other state-of-the-art methods for improving neighbourhood graphs. As a consequence, clustering, trajectory inference and visualization perform better, especially for datasets characterized by large intrinsic dimensionality. Hubness is an important phenomenon characterizing data point neighbourhood graphs computed for various types of sequencing datasets. Reducing hubness can be beneficial for the analysis of scRNAseq data with large intrinsic dimensionality in which case it can be an alternative to drastic dimensionality reduction.Availability and implementation:The code used to analyze the datasets and produce the figures of this article is available from https://github.com/sysbio-curie/schubness.Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",34871374,,10.1093/bioinformatics/btab795,1
EPIC: A Tool to Estimate the Proportions of Different Cell Types from Bulk Gene Expression Data,"Gene expression profiling is nowadays routinely performed on clinically relevant samples (e.g., from tumor specimens). Such measurements are often obtained from bulk samples containing a mixture of cell types. Knowledge of the proportions of these cell types is crucial as they are key determinants of the disease evolution and response to treatment. Moreover, heterogeneity in cell type proportions across samples is an important confounding factor in downstream analyses.Many tools have been developed to estimate the proportion of the different cell types from bulk gene expression data. Here, we provide guidelines and examples on how to use these tools, with a special focus on our recent computational method EPIC (Estimating the Proportions of Immune and Cancer cells). EPIC includes RNA-seq-based gene expression reference profiles from immune cells and other nonmalignant cell types found in tumors. EPIC can additionally manage user-defined gene expression reference profiles. Some unique features of EPIC include the ability to account for an uncharacterized cell type, the introduction of a renormalization step to account for different mRNA content in each cell type, and the use of single-cell RNA-seq data to derive biologically relevant reference gene expression profiles. EPIC is available as a web application ( http://epic.gfellerlab.org ) and as an R-package ( https://github.com/GfellerLab/EPIC ).",32124324,,10.1007/978-1-0716-0327-7_17,206
redPATH: Reconstructing the Pseudo Development Time of Cell Lineages in Single-cell RNA-seq Data and Applications in Cancer,"The recent advancement of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies facilitates the study of cell lineages in developmental processes and cancer. In this study, we developed a computational method, called redPATH, to reconstruct the pseudo developmental time of cell lineages using a consensus asymmetric Hamiltonian path algorithm. Besides, we developed a novel approach to visualize the trajectory development and implemented visualization methods to provide biological insights. We validated the performance of redPATH by segmenting different stages of cell development on multiple neural stem cell and cancer datasets, as well as other single-cell transcriptome data. In particular, we identified a stem cell-like subpopulation in malignant glioma cells. These cells express known proliferative markers, such as GFAP, ATP1A2, IGFBPL1, and ALDOC, and remain silenced for quiescent markers such as ID3. Furthermore, we identified MCL1 as a significant gene that regulates cell apoptosis and CSF1R for reprogramming macrophages to control tumor growth. In conclusion, redPATH is a comprehensive tool for analyzing scRNA-seq datasets along the pseudo developmental time. redPATH is available at https://github.com/tinglabs/redPATH.",33607293,PMC8602773,10.1016/j.gpb.2020.06.014,2
Identification of hub genes based on integrated analysis of single-cell and microarray transcriptome in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension,"Background:Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a devastating chronic cardiopulmonary disease without an effective therapeutic approach. The underlying molecular mechanism of PAH remains largely unexplored at single-cell resolution.Methods:Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (GSE210248) was included and analyzed comprehensively. Additionally, microarray transcriptome data including 15 lung tissue from PAH patients and 11 normal samples (GSE113439) was also obtained. Seurat R package was applied to process scRNA-seq data. Uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) was utilized for dimensionality reduction and cluster identification, and the SingleR package was performed for cell annotation. FindAllMarkers analysis and ClusterProfiler package were applied to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) for each cluster in GSE210248 and GSE113439, respectively. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome (KEGG) were used for functional enrichment analysis of DEGs. Microenvironment Cell Populations counter (MCP counter) was applied to evaluate the immune cell infiltration. STRING was used to construct a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of DEGs, followed by hub genes selection through Cytoscape software and Veen Diagram.Results:Nineteen thousand five hundred seventy-six cells from 3 donors and 21,896 cells from 3 PAH patients remained for subsequent analysis after filtration. A total of 42 cell clusters were identified through UMAP and annotated by the SingleR package. 10 cell clusters with the top 10 cell amounts were selected for consequent analysis. Compared with the control group, the proportion of adipocytes and fibroblasts was significantly reduced, while CD8+ T cells and macrophages were notably increased in the PAH group. MCP counter revealed decreased distribution of CD8+ T cells, cytotoxic lymphocytes, and NK cells, as well as increased infiltration of monocytic lineage in PAH lung samples. Among 997 DEGs in GSE113439, module 1 with 68 critical genes was screened out through the MCODE plug-in in Cytoscape software. The top 20 DEGs in each cluster of GSE210248 were filtered out by the Cytohubba plug-in using the MCC method. Eventually, WDR43 and GNL2 were found significantly increased in PAH and identified as the hub genes after overlapping these DEGs from GSE210248 and GSE113439.Conclusion:WDR43 and GNL2 might provide novel insight into revealing the new molecular mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets for PAH.",38110868,PMC10729354,10.1186/s12864-023-09892-3,2
Revealing Genetic Dynamics: scRNA-seq Unravels Modifications in Human PDL Cells across In Vivo and In Vitro Environments,"The periodontal ligament (PDL) is a highly specialized fibrous tissue comprising heterogeneous cell populations of an intricate nature. These complexities, along with challenges due to cell culture, impede a comprehensive understanding of periodontal pathophysiology. This study aims to address this gap, employing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology to analyze the genetic intricacies of PDL both in vivo and in vitro. Primary human PDL samples (n= 7) were split for direct in vivo analysis and cell culture under serum-containing and serum-free conditions. Cell hashing and sorting, scRNA-seq library preparation using the 10x Genomics protocol, and Illumina sequencing were conducted. Primary analysis was performed using Cellranger, with downstream analysis via the R packages Seurat and SCORPIUS. Seven distinct PDL cell clusters were identified comprising different cellular subsets, each characterized by unique genetic profiles, with some showing donor-specific patterns in representation and distribution. Formation of these cellular clusters was influenced by culture conditions, particularly serum presence. Furthermore, certain cell populations were found to be inherent to the PDL tissue, while others exhibited variability across donors. This study elucidates specific genes and cell clusters within the PDL, revealing both inherent and context-driven subpopulations. The impact of culture conditions-notably the presence of serum-on cell cluster formation highlights the critical need for refining culture protocols, as comprehending these influences can drive the creation of superior culture systems vital for advancing research in PDL biology and regenerative therapies. These discoveries not only deepen our comprehension of PDL biology but also open avenues for future investigations into uncovering underlying mechanisms.",38731950,PMC11083143,10.3390/ijms25094731,0
PertOrg 1.0: a comprehensive resource of multilevel alterations induced in model organisms by in vivo genetic perturbation,"Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) can be generated to model human genetic disease or plant disease resistance, and they have contributed to the exploration and understanding of gene function, physiology, disease onset and drug target discovery. Here, PertOrg (http://www.inbirg.com/pertorg/) was introduced to provide multilevel alterations in GMOs. Raw data of 58 707 transcriptome profiles and associated information, such as phenotypic alterations, were collected and curated from studies involving in vivo genetic perturbation (e.g. knockdown, knockout and overexpression) in eight model organisms, including mouse, rat and zebrafish. The transcriptome profiles from before and after perturbation were organized into 10 116 comparison datasets, including 122 single-cell RNA-seq datasets. The raw data were checked and analysed using widely accepted and standardized pipelines to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in perturbed organisms. As a result, 8 644 148 DEGs were identified and deposited as signatures of gene perturbations. Downstream functional enrichment analysis, cell type analysis and phenotypic alterations were also provided when available. Multiple search methods and analytical tools were created and implemented. Furthermore, case studies were presented to demonstrate how users can utilize the database. PertOrg 1.0 will be a valuable resource aiding in the exploration of gene functions, biological processes and disease models.",36243973,PMC9825601,10.1093/nar/gkac872,1
Single-Cell RNA-Seq Mapping of Human Thymopoiesis Reveals Lineage Specification Trajectories and a Commitment Spectrum in T Cell Development,"The challenges in recapitulating in vivo human T cell development in laboratory models have posed a barrier to understanding human thymopoiesis. Here, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (sRNA-seq) to interrogate the rare CD34+progenitor and the more differentiated CD34-fractions in the human postnatal thymus. CD34+thymic progenitors were comprised of a spectrum of specification and commitment states characterized by multilineage priming followed by gradual T cell commitment. The earliest progenitors in the differentiation trajectory were CD7-and expressed a stem-cell-like transcriptional profile, but had also initiated T cell priming. Clustering analysis identified a CD34+subpopulation primed for the plasmacytoid dendritic lineage, suggesting an intrathymic dendritic specification pathway. CD2 expression defined T cell commitment stages where loss of B cell potential preceded that of myeloid potential. These datasets delineate gene expression profiles spanning key differentiation events in human thymopoiesis and provide a resource for the further study of human T cell development.",32553173,PMC7388724,10.1016/j.immuni.2020.05.010,38
Robotic data acquisition with deep learning enables cell image-based prediction of transcriptomic phenotypes,"Single-cell whole-transcriptome analysis is the gold standard approach to identifying molecularly defined cell phenotypes. However, this approach cannot be used for dynamics measurements such as live-cell imaging. Here, we developed a multifunctional robot, the automated live imaging and cell picking system (ALPS) and used it to perform single-cell RNA sequencing for microscopically observed cells with multiple imaging modes. Using robotically obtained data that linked cell images and the whole transcriptome, we successfully predicted transcriptome-defined cell phenotypes in a noninvasive manner using cell image-based deep learning. This noninvasive approach opens a window to determine the live-cell whole transcriptome in real time. Moreover, this work, which is based on a data-driven approach, is a proof of concept for determining the transcriptome-defined phenotypes (i.e., not relying on specific genes) of any cell from cell images using a model trained on linked datasets.",36577074,PMC9910600,10.1073/pnas.2210283120,2
Single-Cell Transcriptomic Analyses of Cell Fate Transitions during Human Cardiac Reprogramming,"Direct cellular reprogramming provides a powerful platform to study cell plasticity and dissect mechanisms underlying cell fate determination. Here, we report a single-cell transcriptomic study of human cardiac (hiCM) reprogramming that utilizes an analysis pipeline incorporating current data normalization methods, multiple trajectory prediction algorithms, and a cell fate index calculation we developed to measure reprogramming progression. These analyses revealed hiCM reprogramming-specific features and a decision point at which cells either embark on reprogramming or regress toward their original fibroblast state. In combination with functional screening, we found that immune-response-associated DNA methylation is required for hiCM induction and validated several downstream targets of reprogramming factors as necessary for productive hiCM reprograming. Collectively, this single-cell transcriptomics study provides detailed datasets that reveal molecular features underlying hiCM determination and rigorous analytical pipelines for predicting cell fate conversion.",31230860,PMC6684137,10.1016/j.stem.2019.05.020,66
Molecular Architecture of the Mouse Nervous System,"The mammalian nervous system executes complex behaviors controlled by specialized, precisely positioned, and interacting cell types. Here, we used RNA sequencing of half a million single cells to create a detailed census of cell types in the mouse nervous system. We mapped cell types spatially and derived a hierarchical, data-driven taxonomy. Neurons were the most diverse and were grouped by developmental anatomical units and by the expression of neurotransmitters and neuropeptides. Neuronal diversity was driven by genes encoding cell identity, synaptic connectivity, neurotransmission, and membrane conductance. We discovered seven distinct, regionally restricted astrocyte types that obeyed developmental boundaries and correlated with the spatial distribution of key glutamate and glycine neurotransmitters. In contrast, oligodendrocytes showed a loss of regional identity followed by a secondary diversification. The resource presented here lays a solid foundation for understanding the molecular architecture of the mammalian nervous system and enables genetic manipulation of specific cell types.",30096314,PMC6086934,10.1016/j.cell.2018.06.021,1129
Large-scale integration of single-cell transcriptomic data captures transitional progenitor states in mouse skeletal muscle regeneration,"Skeletal muscle repair is driven by the coordinated self-renewal and fusion of myogenic stem and progenitor cells. Single-cell gene expression analyses of myogenesis have been hampered by the poor sampling of rare and transient cell states that are critical for muscle repair, and do not inform the spatial context that is important for myogenic differentiation. Here, we demonstrate how large-scale integration of single-cell and spatial transcriptomic data can overcome these limitations. We created a single-cell transcriptomic dataset of mouse skeletal muscle by integration, consensus annotation, and analysis of 23 newly collected scRNAseq datasets and 88 publicly available single-cell (scRNAseq) and single-nucleus (snRNAseq) RNA-sequencing datasets. The resulting dataset includes more than 365,000 cells and spans a wide range of ages, injury, and repair conditions. Together, these data enabled identification of the predominant cell types in skeletal muscle, and resolved cell subtypes, including endothelial subtypes distinguished by vessel-type of origin, fibro-adipogenic progenitors defined by functional roles, and many distinct immune populations. The representation of different experimental conditions and the depth of transcriptome coverage enabled robust profiling of sparsely expressed genes. We built a densely sampled transcriptomic model of myogenesis, from stem cell quiescence to myofiber maturation, and identified rare, transitional states of progenitor commitment and fusion that are poorly represented in individual datasets. We performed spatial RNA sequencing of mouse muscle at three time points after injury and used the integrated dataset as a reference to achieve a high-resolution, local deconvolution of cell subtypes. We also used the integrated dataset to explore ligand-receptor co-expression patterns and identify dynamic cell-cell interactions in muscle injury response. We provide a public web tool to enable interactive exploration and visualization of the data. Our work supports the utility of large-scale integration of single-cell transcriptomic data as a tool for biological discovery.",34773081,PMC8589952,10.1038/s42003-021-02810-x,60
Missing data and technical variability in single-cell RNA-sequencing experiments,"Until recently, high-throughput gene expression technology, such as RNA-Sequencing (RNA-seq) required hundreds of thousands of cells to produce reliable measurements. Recent technical advances permit genome-wide gene expression measurement at the single-cell level. Single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-seq) is the most widely used and numerous publications are based on data produced with this technology. However, RNA-seq and scRNA-seq data are markedly different. In particular, unlike RNA-seq, the majority of reported expression levels in scRNA-seq are zeros, which could be either biologically-driven, genes not expressing RNA at the time of measurement, or technically-driven, genes expressing RNA, but not at a sufficient level to be detected by sequencing technology. Another difference is that the proportion of genes reporting the expression level to be zero varies substantially across single cells compared to RNA-seq samples. However, it remains unclear to what extent this cell-to-cell variation is being driven by technical rather than biological variation. Furthermore, while systematic errors, including batch effects, have been widely reported as a major challenge in high-throughput technologies, these issues have received minimal attention in published studies based on scRNA-seq technology. Here, we use an assessment experiment to examine data from published studies and demonstrate that systematic errors can explain a substantial percentage of observed cell-to-cell expression variability. Specifically, we present evidence that some of these reported zeros are driven by technical variation by demonstrating that scRNA-seq produces more zeros than expected and that this bias is greater for lower expressed genes. In addition, this missing data problem is exacerbated by the fact that this technical variation varies cell-to-cell. Then, we show how this technical cell-to-cell variability can be confused with novel biological results. Finally, we demonstrate and discuss how batch-effects and confounded experiments can intensify the problem.",29121214,PMC6215955,10.1093/biostatistics/kxx053,209
Cell population characterization and discovery using single-cell technologies in endocrine systems,"In the last 15 years, single-cell technologies have become robust and indispensable tools to investigate cell heterogeneity. Beyond transcriptomic, genomic and epigenome analyses, technologies are constantly evolving, in particular toward multi-omics, where analyses of different source materials from a single cell are combined, and spatial transcriptomics, where resolution of cellular heterogeneity can be detected in situ. While some of these techniques are still being optimized, single-cell RNAseq has commonly been used because the examination of transcriptomes allows characterization of cell identity and, therefore, unravel previously uncharacterized diversity within cell populations. Most endocrine organs have now been investigated using this technique, and this has given new insights into organ embryonic development, characterization of rare cell types, and disease mechanisms. Here, we highlight recent studies, particularly on the hypothalamus and pituitary, and examine recent findings on the pancreas and reproductive organs where many single-cell experiments have been performed.",32485670,,10.1530/JME-19-0276,4
TISCH2: expanded datasets and new tools for single-cell transcriptome analyses of the tumor microenvironment,"The Tumor Immune Single Cell Hub 2 (TISCH2) is a resource of single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data from human and mouse tumors, which enables comprehensive characterization of gene expression in the tumor microenvironment (TME) across multiple cancer types. As an increasing number of datasets are generated in the public domain, in this update, TISCH2 has included 190 tumor scRNA-seq datasets covering 6 million cells in 50 cancer types, with 110 newly collected datasets and almost tripling the number of cells compared with the previous release. Furthermore, TISCH2 includes several new functions that allow users to better utilize the large-scale scRNA-seq datasets. First, in the Dataset module, TISCH2 provides the cell-cell communication results in each dataset, facilitating the analyses of interacted cell types and the discovery of significant ligand-receptor pairs between cell types. TISCH2 also includes the transcription factor analyses for each dataset and visualization of the top enriched transcription factors of each cell type. Second, in the Gene module, TISCH2 adds functions for identifying correlated genes and providing survival information for the input genes. In summary, TISCH2 is a user-friendly, up-to-date and well-maintained data resource for gene expression analyses in the TME.

Single-nucleus transcriptomic analysis of human dorsal root ganglion neurons,"Somatosensory neurons with cell bodies in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) project to the skin, muscles, bones, and viscera to detect touch and temperature as well as to mediate proprioception and many types of interoception. In addition, the somatosensory system conveys the clinically relevant noxious sensations of pain and itch. Here, we used single nuclear transcriptomics to characterize transcriptomic classes of human DRG neurons that detect these diverse types of stimuli. Notably, multiple types of human DRG neurons have transcriptomic features that resemble their mouse counterparts although expression of genes considered important for sensory function often differed between species. More unexpectedly, we identified several transcriptomic classes with no clear equivalent in the other species. This dataset should serve as a valuable resource for the community, for example as means of focusing translational efforts on molecules with conserved expression across species.",34825887,PMC8626086,10.7554/eLife.71752,65
Single-cell RNA-seq describes the transcriptome landscape and identifies critical transcription factors in the leaf blade of the allotetraploid peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.),"Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) has been highlighted as a powerful tool for the description of human cell transcriptome, but the technology has not been broadly applied in plant cells. Herein, we describe the successful development of a robust protoplast cell isolation system in the peanut leaf. A total of 6,815 single cells were divided into eight cell clusters based on reported marker genes by applying scRNA-seq. Further, a pseudo-time analysis was used to describe the developmental trajectory and interaction network of transcription factors (TFs) of distinct cell types during leaf growth. The trajectory enabled re-investigation of the primordium-driven development processes of the mesophyll and epidermis. These results suggest that palisade cells likely differentiate into spongy cells, while the epidermal cells originated earlier than the primordium. Subsequently, the developed method integrated multiple technologies to efficiently validate the scRNA-seq result in a homogenous cell population. The expression levels of several TFs were strongly correlated with epidermal ontogeny in accordance with obtained scRNA-seq values. Additionally, peanut AHL23 (AT-HOOK MOTIF NUCLEAR LOCALIZED PROTEIN 23), which is localized in nucleus, promoted leaf growth when ectopically expressed in Arabidopsis by modulating the phytohormone pathway. Together, our study displays that application of scRNA-seq can provide new hypotheses regarding cell differentiation in the leaf blade of Arachis hypogaea. We believe that this approach will enable significant advances in the functional study of leaf blade cells in the allotetraploid peanut and other plant species.",34174007,PMC8541777,10.1111/pbi.13656,23
AGImpute: imputation of scRNA-seq data based on a hybrid GAN with dropouts identification,"Motivation:Dropout events bring challenges in analyzing single-cell RNA sequencing data as they introduce noise and distort the true distributions of gene expression profiles. Recent studies focus on estimating dropout probability and imputing dropout events by leveraging information from similar cells or genes. However, the number of dropout events differs in different cells, due to the complex factors, such as different sequencing protocols, cell types, and batch effects. The dropout event differences are not fully considered in assessing the similarities between cells and genes, which compromises the reliability of downstream analysis.Results:This work proposes a hybrid Generative Adversarial Network with dropouts identification to impute single-cell RNA sequencing data, named AGImpute. First, the numbers of dropout events in different cells in scRNA-seq data are differentially estimated by using a dynamic threshold estimation strategy. Next, the identified dropout events are imputed by a hybrid deep learning model, combining Autoencoder with a Generative Adversarial Network. To validate the efficiency of the AGImpute, it is compared with seven state-of-the-art dropout imputation methods on two simulated datasets and seven real single-cell RNA sequencing datasets. The results show that AGImpute imputes the least number of dropout events than other methods. Moreover, AGImpute enhances the performance of downstream analysis, including clustering performance, identifying cell-specific marker genes, and inferring trajectory in the time-course dataset.Availability and implementation:The source code can be obtained from https://github.com/xszhu-lab/AGImpute.",38317025,PMC10877090,10.1093/bioinformatics/btae068,0
Transcriptomic Heterogeneity of Skin Across Different Anatomic Sites,"Multiomic studies, including RNA sequencing, single-cell RNA sequencing, and epigenomics, can provide insight into the connection between anatomically heterogeneous gene expression profile of the skin and dermatoses-predisposed sites, in which RNA sequencing is essential. Therefore, in this study, 159 skin samples collected mainly from discarded normal skin tissue during surgical treatment for benign skin tumors were used for RNA sequencing. On the basis of cluster analysis, the skin was divided into four regions, with each region showing specific physiological characteristics through differentially expressed gene analysis. The results showed that the head and neck region, perineum, and palmoplantar area were closely associated with lipid metabolism, hormone metabolism, blood circulation, and related neural regulation, respectively. Transcription factor enrichment indicated that different regions were associated with the development of adjacent tissues. Specifically, the head and neck region, trunk and extremities, perineum, and palmoplantar area were associated with the central nervous, axial, urogenital, and vascular systems, respectively. The results were imported into an open website (https://dermvis.github.io/) for retrieval. Our transcriptomic data elucidated that human skin exhibits transcriptomic heterogeneity reflecting physiological and developmental variation at different anatomic sites and provided guidance for further studies on skin development and dermatoses predisposed sites.",36122800,,10.1016/j.jid.2022.08.053,0
Prokaryotic single-cell RNA sequencing by in situ combinatorial indexing,"Despite longstanding appreciation of gene expression heterogeneity in isogenic bacterial populations, affordable and scalable technologies for studying single bacterial cells have been limited. Although single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revolutionized studies of transcriptional heterogeneity in diverse eukaryotic systems1-13, the application of scRNA-seq to prokaryotes has been hindered by their extremely low mRNA abundance14-16, lack of mRNA polyadenylation and thick cell walls17. Here, we present prokaryotic expression profiling by tagging RNA in situ and sequencing (PETRI-seq)-a low-cost, high-throughput prokaryotic scRNA-seq pipeline that overcomes these technical obstacles. PETRI-seq uses in situ combinatorial indexing11,12,18to barcode transcripts from tens of thousands of cells in a single experiment. PETRI-seq captures single-cell transcriptomes of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria with high purity and low bias, with median capture rates of more than 200 mRNAs per cell for exponentially growing Escherichia coli. These characteristics enable robust discrimination of cell states corresponding to different phases of growth. When applied to wild-type Staphylococcus aureus, PETRI-seq revealed a rare subpopulation of cells undergoing prophage induction. We anticipate that PETRI-seq will have broad utility in defining single-cell states and their dynamics in complex microbial communities.",32451472,PMC8330242,10.1038/s41564-020-0729-6,65
Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of oligodendrocyte lineage cells,"Oligodendrocytes (OLs) are glial cells in the central nervous system (CNS), which produce myelin, a lipid-rich membrane that insulates neuronal axons. The main function ascribed to OLs is to regulate the speed of electric pulse transmission, and as such OLs have been widely considered as a single and discrete population. Nevertheless, OLs and their precursor cells (OPCs) throughout the CNS have different morphologies and regional functional differences have been observed. Moreover, OLs have recently been involved in other functional processes such as metabolic coupling with axons. In this review, we focus on recent advances in single-cell transcriptomics suggesting that OLs are more heterogeneous than previously thought, with defined subpopulations and cell states that are associated with different stages of lineage progression and might also represent distinct functional states.",29126015,,10.1016/j.conb.2017.10.005,18
Single-nucleus resolution mapping of the adult C. elegans and its application to elucidate inter- and trans-generational response to alcohol,"Single-cell transcriptomic platforms provide an opportunity to map an organism's response to environmental cues with high resolution. Here, we applied single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) to establish the tissue and cell type-resolved transcriptome of the adult C. elegans and characterize the inter- and trans-generational transcriptional impact of ethanol. We profiled the transcriptome of 41,749 nuclei resolving into 31 clusters, representing a diverse array of adult cell types including syncytial tissues. Following exposure to human-relevant doses of alcohol, several germline, striated muscle, and neuronal clusters were identified as being the most transcriptionally impacted at the F1 and F3 generations. The effect on germline clusters was confirmed by phenotypic enrichment analysis as well as by functional validation, which revealed a remarkable inter- and trans-generational increase in germline apoptosis, aneuploidy, and embryonic lethality. Together, snRNA-seq represents a valuable approach for the detailed examination of an adult organism's response to environmental exposures.",37227821,PMC10592506,10.1016/j.celrep.2023.112535,2
Imputation of Human Primary Osteoblast Single Cell RNA-Seq Data Identified Three Novel Osteoblastic Subtypes,"Background:Recently, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology was increasingly used to study transcriptomics at a single-cell resolution, scRNA-seq analysis was complicated by the ""dropout"", where the data only captures a small fraction of the transcriptome. This phenomenon can lead to the fact that the actual expressed transcript may not be detected. We previously performed osteoblast subtypes classification and dissection on freshly isolated human osteoblasts.Materials and methods:Here, we used the scImpute method to impute the missing values of dropout genes from a scRNA-seq dataset generated on freshly isolated human osteoblasts.Results:Based on the imputed gene expression patterns, we discovered three new osteoblast subtypes. Specifically, these newfound osteoblast subtypes are osteoblast progenitors, and two undetermined osteoblasts. Osteoblast progenitors showed significantly high expression of proliferation related genes (FOS, JUN, JUNBandJUND). Analysis of each subtype showed that in addition to bone formation, these undetermined osteoblasts may involve osteoclast and adipocyte differentiation and have the potential function of regulate immune activation.Conclusions:Our findings provided a new perspective for studying the osteoblast heterogeneity and potential biological functions of these freshly isolated human osteoblasts at the single-cell level, which provides further insight into osteoblasts subtypes under various (pathological) physiological conditions.",36336853,PMC11097352,10.31083/j.fbl2710295,1
Single-Cell RNA Sequencing of Glioblastoma Cells,"Single-cell RNA sequencing (sc-RNASeq) is a recently developed technique used to evaluate the transcriptome of individual cells. As opposed to conventional RNASeq in which entire populations are sequenced in bulk, sc-RNASeq can be beneficial when trying to better understand gene expression patterns in markedly heterogeneous populations of cells or when trying to identify transcriptional signatures of rare cells that may be underrepresented when using conventional bulk RNASeq. In this method, we describe the generation and analysis of cDNA libraries from single patient-derived glioblastoma cells using the C1 Fluidigm system. The protocol details the use of the C1 integrated fluidics circuit (IFC) for capturing, imaging and lysing cells; performing reverse transcription; and generating cDNA libraries that are ready for sequencing and analysis.",29392698,,10.1007/978-1-4939-7659-1_12,8
Single-cell transcriptomics reveals specific RNA editing signatures in the human brain,"While RNA editing by A-to-I deamination is a requisite for neuronal function in humans, it is under-investigated in single cells.

We show that RNA editing levels per cell are bimodally distributed and distinguish between major brain cell types, thus providing new insights into neuronal dynamics.",28258159,PMC5435858,10.1261/rna.058271.116,35
Single-cell analysis of progenitor cell dynamics and lineage specification in the human fetal kidney,"The mammalian kidney develops through reciprocal interactions between the ureteric bud and the metanephric mesenchyme to give rise to the entire collecting system and the nephrons. Most of our knowledge of the developmental regulators driving this process arises from the study of gene expression and functional genetics in mice and other animal models. In order to shed light on human kidney development, we have used single-cell transcriptomics to characterize gene expression in different cell populations, and to study individual cell dynamics and lineage trajectories during development. Single-cell transcriptome analyses of 6414 cells from five individual specimens identified 11 initial clusters of specific renal cell types as defined by their gene expression profile. Further subclustering identifies progenitors, and mature and intermediate stages of differentiation for several renal lineages. Other lineages identified include mesangium, stroma, endothelial and immune cells. Novel markers for these cell types were revealed in the analysis, as were components of key signaling pathways driving renal development in animal models. Altogether, we provide a comprehensive and dynamic gene expression profile of the developing human kidney at the single-cell level.",30166318,PMC6124540,10.1242/dev.164038,83
Single-cell transcriptomes reveal characteristic features of cell types within the human adrenal microenvironment,"Various cells within the adrenal microenvironment are important in maintaining the body homeostasis. However, our understanding of adrenal disease pathogenesis is limited by an incomplete molecular characterization of the cell types responsible for the organ's multiple homeostatic functions. We report a cellular landscape of the human adrenal gland using single-cell RNA sequencing. We reveal characteristic features of cell types within the human adrenal microenvironment and found immune activation of nonimmune cells in the adrenal endothelial cells. We also reveal that abundant immune cells occupied a lot of space in adrenal gland. Additionally, Sex-related diversity in the adrenocortical cells and different gene expression profiles between the left and right adrenal gland are also observed at single-cell resolution. Together, at single-cell resolution, the transcriptomic map presents a comprehensive view of the human adrenal gland, which serves as a fundamental baseline description of this organ and paves a way for the further studies of adrenal diseases.",33934358,,10.1002/jcp.30398,7
SCMarker: Ab initio marker selection for single cell transcriptome profiling,"Single-cell RNA-sequencing data generated by a variety of technologies, such as Drop-seq and SMART-seq, can reveal simultaneously the mRNA transcript levels of thousands of genes in thousands of cells. It is often important to identify informative genes or cell-type-discriminative markers to reduce dimensionality and achieve informative cell typing results. We present an ab initio method that performs unsupervised marker selection by identifying genes that have subpopulation-discriminative expression levels and are co- or mutually-exclusively expressed with other genes. Consistent improvements in cell-type classification and biologically meaningful marker selection are achieved by applying SCMarker on various datasets in multiple tissue types, followed by a variety of clustering algorithms.

"Transcriptomic Dissection of Hepatocyte Heterogeneity: Linking Ploidy, Zonation, and Stem/Progenitor Cell Characteristics","Background & aims:There is a long-standing debate regarding the biological significance of polyploidy in hepatocytes. Recent studies have provided increasing evidence that hepatocytes with different ploidy statuses behave differently in a context-dependent manner (eg, susceptibility to oncogenesis, regenerative ability after injury, and in vitro proliferative capacity). However, their overall transcriptomic differences in a physiological context is not known.Methods:By using microarray transcriptome analysis, we investigated the heterogeneity of hepatocyte populations with different ploidy statuses. Moreover, by using single-cell quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (scPCR) analysis, we investigated the intrapopulational transcriptome heterogeneity of 2c and 4c hepatocytes.Results:Microarray analysis showed that cell cycle-related genes were enriched in 8c hepatocytes, which is in line with the established notion that polyploidy is formed via cell division failure. Surprisingly, in contrast to the general consensus that 2c hepatocytes reside in the periportal region, in our bulk transcriptome and scPCR analyses, the 2c hepatocytes consistently showed pericentral hepatocyte-enriched characteristics. In addition, scPCR analysis identified a subpopulation within the 2c hepatocytes that co-express the liver progenitor cell markers Axin2, Prom1, and Lgr5, implying the potential biological relevance of this subpopulation.Conclusions:This study provides new insights into hepatocyte heterogeneity, namely 2c hepatocytes are preferentially localized to the pericentral region, and a subpopulation of 2c hepatocytes show liver progenitor cell-like features in terms of liver progenitor cell marker expression (Axin2, Prom1, and Lgr5).",31493546,PMC6909008,10.1016/j.jcmgh.2019.08.011,17
A geometric approach to characterize the functional identity of single cells,"Single-cell transcriptomic data has the potential to radically redefine our view of cell-type identity. Cells that were previously believed to be homogeneous are now clearly distinguishable in terms of their expression phenotype. Methods for automatically characterizing the functional identity of cells, and their associated properties, can be used to uncover processes involved in lineage differentiation as well as sub-typing cancer cells. They can also be used to suggest personalized therapies based on molecular signatures associated with pathology. We develop a new method, called ACTION, to infer the functional identity of cells from their transcriptional profile, classify them based on their dominant function, and reconstruct regulatory networks that are responsible for mediating their identity. Using ACTION, we identify novel Melanoma subtypes with differential survival rates and therapeutic responses, for which we provide biomarkers along with their underlying regulatory networks.",29666373,PMC5904143,10.1038/s41467-018-03933-2,24
Mutational and transcriptomic landscapes of a rare human prostate basal cell carcinoma,"Background:As a rare subtype of prostate carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma (BCC) has not been studied extensively and thus lacks systematic molecular characterization.Methods:Here, we applied single-cell genomic amplification and RNA-Seq to a specimen of human prostate BCC (CK34βE12+/P63+/PAP-/PSA-). The mutational landscape was obtained via whole exome sequencing of the amplification mixture of 49 single cells, and the transcriptomes of 69 single cells were also obtained.Results:The five putative driver genes mutated in BCC are CASC5, NUTM1, PTPRC, KMT2C, and TBX3, and the top three nucleotide substitutions are C>T, T>C, and C>A, similar to common prostate cancer. The distribution of the variant allele frequency values indicated that these single cells are from the same tumor clone. The 69 single cells were clustered into tumor, stromal, and immune cells based on their global transcriptomic profiles. The tumor cells specifically express basal cell markers like KRT5, KRT14, and KRT23 and epithelial markers EPCAM, CDH1, and CD24. The transcription factor covariance network analysis showed that the BCC tumor cells have distinct regulatory networks. By comparison with current prostate cancer datasets, we found that some of the bulk samples exhibit basal cell signatures. Interestingly, at single-cell resolution the gene expression patterns of prostate BCC tumor cells show uniqueness compared with that of common prostate cancer-derived circulating tumor cells.Conclusions:This study, for the first time, discloses the comprehensive mutational and transcriptomic landscapes of prostate BCC, which lays a foundation for the understanding of its tumorigenesis mechanism and provides new insights into prostate cancers in general.",32119131,,10.1002/pros.23965,9
scHumanNet: a single-cell network analysis platform for the study of cell-type specificity of disease genes,"A major challenge in single-cell biology is identifying cell-type-specific gene functions, which may substantially improve precision medicine. Differential expression analysis of genes is a popular, yet insufficient approach, and complementary methods that associate function with cell type are required. Here, we describe scHumanNet (https://github.com/netbiolab/scHumanNet), a single-cell network analysis platform for resolving cellular heterogeneity across gene functions in humans. Based on cell-type-specific gene networks (CGNs) constructed under the guidance of the HumanNet reference interactome, scHumanNet displayed higher functional relevance to the cellular context than CGNs built by other methods on single-cell transcriptome data. Cellular deconvolution of gene signatures based on network compactness across cell types revealed breast cancer prognostic markers associated with T cells. scHumanNet could also prioritize genes associated with particular cell types using CGN centrality and identified the differential hubness of CGNs between disease and healthy conditions. We demonstrated the usefulness of scHumanNet by uncovering T-cell-specific functional effects of GITR, a prognostic gene for breast cancer, and functional defects in autism spectrum disorder genes specific for inhibitory neurons. These results suggest that scHumanNet will advance our understanding of cell-type specificity across human disease genes.",36350625,PMC9881140,10.1093/nar/gkac1042,2
Integrated single-cell transcriptomics of cerebrospinal fluid cells in treatment-naïve multiple sclerosis,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic and often disabling autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) surrounds and protects the CNS. Analysis of CSF can aid the diagnosis of CNS diseases, help to identify the prognosis, and underlying mechanisms of diseases. Several recent studies have leveraged single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to identify MS-associated changes in CSF cells that are considerably more altered than blood cells in MS. However, not all alterations were replicated across all studies. We therefore integrated multiple available scRNA-seq datasets of CSF cells from MS patients with early relapsing-remitting (RRMS) disease. We provide a searchable and interactive resource of this integrated analysis ( https://CSFinMS.bxgenomics.com ) facilitating diverse visualization and analysis methods without requiring computational skills. In the present joint analysis, we replicated the known expansion of B lineage and the recently described expansion of natural killer (NK) cells and some cytotoxic T cells and decrease of monocytes in the CSF in MS. The previous observation of the abundance of Th1-like Th17 effector memory cells in the CSF was not replicated. Expanded CSF B lineage cells resembled class-switched plasmablasts/-cells (e.g., SDC1/CD138, MZB1) as expected. Our integrative analysis thus validates increased cell type diversity and B cell maturation in the CSF in MS and improves accessibility of available data.",36536441,PMC9764586,10.1186/s12974-022-02667-9,1
Simultaneous profiling of transcriptome and DNA methylome from a single cell,"Background:Single-cell transcriptome and single-cell methylome technologies have become powerful tools to study RNA and DNA methylation profiles of single cells at a genome-wide scale. A major challenge has been to understand the direct correlation of DNA methylation and gene expression within single-cells. Due to large cell-to-cell variability and the lack of direct measurements of transcriptome and methylome of the same cell, the association is still unclear.Results:Here, we describe a novel method (scMT-seq) that simultaneously profiles both DNA methylome and transcriptome from the same cell. In sensory neurons, we consistently identify transcriptome and methylome heterogeneity among single cells but the majority of the expression variance is not explained by proximal promoter methylation, with the exception of genes that do not contain CpG islands. By contrast, gene body methylation is positively associated with gene expression for only those genes that contain a CpG island promoter. Furthermore, using single nucleotide polymorphism patterns from our hybrid mouse model, we also find positive correlation of allelic gene body methylation with allelic expression.Conclusions:Our method can be used to detect transcriptome, methylome, and single nucleotide polymorphism information within single cells to dissect the mechanisms of epigenetic gene regulation.",27150361,PMC4858893,10.1186/s13059-016-0950-z,130
Wake-up alarm: virtual time-lapse gene expression landscape illuminates mechanisms underlying dormancy breaking of germinating spores,"Dormancy breaking is a common physiological phenomenon that is shared by eukaryotes. Germination of spores in fungi is one of the most representative cases of dormancy breaking. Understanding the mechanisms of spore germination is therefore fundamental to basic studies on the control of cell proliferation and differentiation, as well as agricultural applications and medical investigation of fungal pathogenesis. In fission yeast, spores are generated as a consequence of sexual differentiation under nutrient starvation, remaining dormant until further nourishment, but little is known about how dormant spores germinate in response to environmental change. In a breakthrough, methods for single-cell-based gene expression profiling have recently been introduced. Several mRNA expression profiles were assembled from single spore cells during dormancy or germination. Single-cell RNA-seq profiles were aligned sequentially according to their similarities. The alignment of transcriptomes visualised how gene expression varies over time upon dormancy breaking. In this review, we revisit knowledge from previous studies on germination, select candidate genes that may be involved in germination, and query their expression from the temporal transcriptomic dataset so that studies on S. pombe germination can be extended further.",33782714,,10.1007/s00294-021-01177-0,2
Quantitative single-cell interactomes in normal and virus-infected mouse lungs,"Mammalian organs consist of diverse, intermixed cell types that signal to each other via ligand-receptor interactions - an interactome - to ensure development, homeostasis and injury-repair. Dissecting such intercellular interactions is facilitated by rapidly growing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data; however, existing computational methods are often not readily adaptable by bench scientists without advanced programming skills. Here, we describe a quantitative intuitive algorithm, coupled with an optimized experimental protocol, to construct and compare interactomes in control and Sendai virus-infected mouse lungs. A minimum of 90 cells per cell type compensates for the known gene dropout issue in scRNA-seq and achieves comparable sensitivity to bulk RNA sequencing. Cell lineage normalization after cell sorting allows cost-efficient representation of cell types of interest. A numeric representation of ligand-receptor interactions identifies, as outliers, known and potentially new interactions as well as changes upon viral infection. Our experimental and computational approaches can be generalized to other organs and human samples.",32461220,PMC7328136,10.1242/dmm.044404,11
Single-cell transcriptome profiling reveals intra-tumoral heterogeneity in human chordomas,"Chordoma is a rare and aggressive bone tumor. An accurate investigation of tumor heterogeneity is necessary for the development of effective therapeutic strategies. This study aims to assess the poorly understood tumor heterogeneity of chordomas and identify potential therapeutic targets. Single-cell RNA sequencing was performed to delineate the transcriptomic landscape of chordomas. Six tumor samples of chordomas were obtained, and 33,737 cells passed the quality control test and were analyzed. The main cellular populations identified with specific markers were as follows: chordoma cells (16,052 [47.6%]), fibroblasts (6945 [20.6%]), mononuclear phagocytes (4734 [14.0%]), and T/natural killer (NK) cells (3944 [11.7%]). Downstream analysis of each cell type was performed. Six subclusters of chordomas exhibited properties of an epithelial-like extracellular matrix, stem cells, and immunosuppressive activity. Although few immune checkpoints were detected on cytotoxic immune cells such as T and NK cells, a strong immunosuppressive effect was exerted on the Tregs and M2 macrophages. In addition, the cellular interactions were indicative of enhancement of the TGF-β signaling pathway being the main mechanism for tumor progression, invasion, and immunosuppression. These findings, especially from the analysis of molecular targeted therapy and tumor immune microenvironment, may help in the identification of therapeutic targets in chordomas.",35084549,PMC10992276,10.1007/s00262-022-03152-1,14
COL5A2 is a prognostic-related biomarker and correlated with immune infiltrates in gastric cancer based on transcriptomics and single-cell RNA sequencing,"Background:There is still a therapeutic challenge in treating gastric cancer (GC) due to its high incidence and poor prognosis. Collagen type V alpha 2 (COL5A2) is increased in various cancers, yet it remains unclear how it contributes to the prognosis and immunity of GC.Methods:The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets were used to download transcriptome profiling (TCGA-STAD; GSE84437), single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data (GSE167297) and clinical information. COL5A2 expression and its relationship with clinicopathological factors were analyzed. We conducted survival analysis and Cox regression analysis to evaluate the prognosis and independent factors of GC. Co-expressed analysis was also performed. To identify the underlying mechanism, we conducted analyses of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and functional enrichment. The correlations between COL5A2 expression and immune cell infiltration levels and immune infiltrate gene marker sets were further explored. Additionally, we analyzed the association of COL5A2 expression with immunological checkpoint molecules. Furthermore, the relationship between COL5A2 expression and immunotherapy sensitivity was also investigated.Results:COL5A2 expression was elevated in GC. More than this, the scRNA-seq analysis revealed that COL5A2 expression had a spatial gradient. The upregulated COL5A2 was associated with worse overall survival. A significant correlation was found between COL5A2 overexpression and age, T classification and clinical stage in GC. COL5A2 was found to be an independent factor for the unfortunate outcome in Cox regression analysis. The co-expressed genes of COL5A2 were associated with tumor stage or poor survival. Enrichment analysis revealed that the DEGs were mainly associated with extracellular matrix (ECM)-related processes, PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, and focal adhesion. GSEA analyses revealed that COL5A2 was associated with tumor progression-related pathways. Meanwhile, COL5A2 expression was correlated with tumor-infiltrating immune cells. Moreover, immunophenoscore (IPS) analysis and PRJEB25780 cohorts showed that patients with low COL5A2 expression were highly sensitive to immunotherapy.Conclusions:COL5A2 might act as a prognostic biomarker of GC prognosis and immune infiltration and may provide a therapeutic intervention strategy.",37723519,PMC10506210,10.1186/s12920-023-01659-9,1
PlanMine 3.0-improvements to a mineable resource of flatworm biology and biodiversity,"Flatworms (Platyhelminthes) are a basally branching phylum that harbours a wealth of fascinating biology, including planarians with their astonishing regenerative abilities and the parasitic tape worms and blood flukes that exert a massive impact on human health. PlanMine (http://planmine.mpi-cbg.de/) has the mission objective of providing both a mineable sequence repository for planarians and also a resource for the comparative analysis of flatworm biology. While the original PlanMine release was entirely based on transcriptomes, the current release transitions to a more genomic perspective. Building on the recent availability of a high quality genome assembly of the planarian model species Schmidtea mediterranea, we provide a gene prediction set that now assign existing transcripts to defined genomic coordinates. The addition of recent single cell and bulk RNA-seq datasets greatly expands the available gene expression information. Further, we add transcriptomes from a broad range of other flatworms and provide a phylogeny-aware interface that makes evolutionary species comparisons accessible to non-experts. At its core, PlanMine continues to utilize the powerful InterMine framework and consistent data annotations to enable meaningful inter-species comparisons. Overall, PlanMine 3.0 thus provides a host of new features that makes the fascinating biology of flatworms accessible to the wider research community.",30496475,PMC6324014,10.1093/nar/gky1070,68
Neurogenic Radial Glia-like Cells in Meninges Migrate and Differentiate into Functionally Integrated Neurons in the Neonatal Cortex,"Whether new neurons are added in the postnatal cerebral cortex is still debated. Here, we report that the meninges of perinatal mice contain a population of neurogenic progenitors formed during embryonic development that migrate to the caudal cortex and differentiate into Satb2+neurons in cortical layers II-IV. The resulting neurons are electrically functional and integrated into local microcircuits. Single-cell RNA sequencing identified meningeal cells with distinct transcriptome signatures characteristic of (1) neurogenic radial glia-like cells (resembling neural stem cells in the SVZ), (2) neuronal cells, and (3) a cell type with an intermediate phenotype, possibly representing radial glia-like meningeal cells differentiating to neuronal cells. Thus, we have identified a pool of embryonically derived radial glia-like cells present in the meninges that migrate and differentiate into functional neurons in the neonatal cerebral cortex.",27889318,,10.1016/j.stem.2016.10.020,34
Analysis of Single-Cell/Nucleus Transcriptome Data in Adipose Tissue,"Adipose tissue is highly heterogeneous and plastic. Recent advances in single-cell/nucleus RNA sequencing technology have helped to study the cellular composition and dynamics of adipose tissue. In this protocol, I outline a typical workflow of analyzing single-cell/nucleus transcriptome data. Specifically, I show an example of how cellular populations are estimated and characterized from a single-nucleus RNAseq data set of frozen archived human adipose tissue.",35167105,,10.1007/978-1-0716-2087-8_19,2
Deep learning tackles single-cell analysis-a survey of deep learning for scRNA-seq analysis,"Since its selection as the method of the year in 2013, single-cell technologies have become mature enough to provide answers to complex research questions. With the growth of single-cell profiling technologies, there has also been a significant increase in data collected from single-cell profilings, resulting in computational challenges to process these massive and complicated datasets. To address these challenges, deep learning (DL) is positioned as a competitive alternative for single-cell analyses besides the traditional machine learning approaches. Here, we survey a total of 25 DL algorithms and their applicability for a specific step in the single cell RNA-seq processing pipeline. Specifically, we establish a unified mathematical representation of variational autoencoder, autoencoder, generative adversarial network and supervised DL models, compare the training strategies and loss functions for these models, and relate the loss functions of these models to specific objectives of the data processing step. Such a presentation will allow readers to choose suitable algorithms for their particular objective at each step in the pipeline. We envision that this survey will serve as an important information portal for learning the application of DL for scRNA-seq analysis and inspire innovative uses of DL to address a broader range of new challenges in emerging multi-omics and spatial single-cell sequencing.",34929734,PMC8769926,10.1093/bib/bbab531,17
NKX2-2 based nuclei sorting on frozen human archival pancreas enables the enrichment of islet endocrine populations for single-nucleus RNA sequencing,"Background:Current approaches to profile the single-cell transcriptomics of human pancreatic endocrine cells almost exclusively rely on freshly isolated islets. However, human islets are limited in availability. Furthermore, the extensive processing steps during islet isolation and subsequent single cell dissolution might alter gene expressions. In this work, we report the development of a single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) approach with targeted islet cell enrichment for endocrine-population focused transcriptomic profiling using frozen archival pancreatic tissues without islet isolation.Results:We cross-compared five nuclei isolation protocols and selected the citric acid method as the best strategy to isolate nuclei with high RNA integrity and low cytoplasmic contamination from frozen archival human pancreata. We innovated fluorescence-activated nuclei sorting based on the positive signal of NKX2-2 antibody to enrich nuclei of the endocrine population from the entire nuclei pool of the pancreas. Our sample preparation procedure generated high-quality single-nucleus gene-expression libraries while preserving the endocrine population diversity. In comparison with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) library generated with live cells from freshly isolated human islets, the snRNA-seq library displayed comparable endocrine cellular composition and cell type signature gene expression. However, between these two types of libraries, differential enrichments of transcripts belonging to different functional classes could be observed.Conclusions:Our work fills a technological gap and helps to unleash frozen archival pancreatic tissues for molecular profiling targeting the endocrine population. This study opens doors to retrospective mappings of endocrine cell dynamics in pancreatic tissues of complex histopathology. We expect that our protocol is applicable to enrich nuclei for transcriptomics studies from various populations in different types of frozen archival tissues.",38689254,PMC11059690,10.1186/s12864-024-10335-w,0
Integration of single-cell and bulk transcriptomics reveals immune-related signatures in keloid,"Background:Keloid is a pathological dermatological condition that manifests as an overgrowth scar secondary to skin trauma. This study endeavored to excavate immune-related signatures of keloid based on single-cell RNA (scRNA) sequencing data and bulk RNA sequencing data.Method:The keloid-relevant scRNA sequencing dataset GSE163973 and bulk RNA sequencing dataset GSE113619 were mined from the GEO database. The ""Seurat"" R package was utilized for data quality control, cell clustering, and investigation of marker genes of each cell cluster. The ""SingleR"" package helped match the marker genes of the corresponding cluster to specific cell types. Moreover, the R package ""Monocle"" was deployed for pseudotemporal ordering analysis, and the ""clusterProfiler"" was applied for functional and pathway enrichment analysis. The immune-related signatures were then identified, and potential targeted drugs were predicted via the DGIdb database. Verification of the immune-related signatures in clinical validation samples was implemented by RT-qPCR.Results:Totally 23 cell clusters were screened and classified into 10 cell types based on the scRNA sequencing data. The keloid group had a significantly higher endothelial cell proportion than the control group. As enrichment analysis was applied in both differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of scRNA and bulk RNA sequencing data, we found they were enriched in multiple common immune-related pathways and biological processes. Meanwhile, we acquired three immune-related signatures (VCAM1, CALCRL, and HLA-DPB1) by intersecting the above DEGs with immune-related genes (IRGs). Then, we predicted 16 drugs potentially targeting the biomarkers through the DGIdb database. Finally, the outcome of RT-qPCR of clinical validation samples further verified the results.Conclusion:In conclusion, we analyzed the cell types and functional differences in the keloid through scRNA and bulk RNA sequencing data. We identified three immune-related signatures (VCAM1, CALCRL, and HLA-DPB1) in keloid, providing a basis for further in-depth investigation of the molecular mechanisms of keloid and exploration of therapeutic targets.",36701151,,10.1111/jocd.15649,1
The promise of single-cell RNA sequencing for kidney disease investigation,"Recent techniques for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) at high throughput are leading to profound new discoveries in biology. The ability to generate vast amounts of transcriptomic data at cellular resolution represents a transformative advance, allowing the identification of novel cell types, states, and dynamics. In this review, we summarize the development of scRNA-seq methodologies and highlight their advantages and drawbacks. We discuss available software tools for analyzing scRNA-Seq data and summarize current computational challenges. Finally, we outline ways in which this powerful technology might be applied to discovery research in kidney development and disease.",28893418,PMC5696024,10.1016/j.kint.2017.06.033,38
Updated skin transcriptomic atlas depicted by reciprocal contribution of single-nucleus RNA sequencing and single-cell RNA sequencing,"Background:Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has advanced our understanding of skin biology, but its utility is restricted by the requirement of fresh samples, inadequate dissociation-induced cell loss or death, and activation during tissue digestion. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) can use frozen, hard-to-dissociate materials, which might be a promising method to circumvent the limitations of scRNA-seq for the skin tissue.Objective:To profile skin cells using snRNA-seq in parallel with scRNA-seq.Methods:We performed snRNA-seq in parallel with scRNA-seq for the bisected skin sample of one person and integrated previously published scRNA-seq data for analysis. We comparatively analyzed the differences in cell proportions and gene expression between the two methods. The differentiation trajectories of keratinocytes and fibroblasts were analyzed by Slingshot analysis.Results:snRNA-seq was less susceptible to contamination from mitochondrial and ribosomal RNA, and exhibited a greater capacity to detect transcription factors. snRNA-seq identified more spatially and functionally relevant keratinocyte clusters that constitute cell trajectories with expected differentiation dynamics. Novel markers, e.g., LYPD3, EMP2, and CSTB, were revealed for different differentiation stages of keratinocytes, and NFIB and GRHL1 were identified as transcription factors involving in the proliferation and functional differentiation of keratinocytes. Fibroblasts were found in a state of activation in scRNA-seq. And scRNA-seq detected a greater number of immune cells.Conclusions:We generated an updated atlas of the skin transcriptome based on the reciprocal contribution of scRNA-seq and snRNA-seq.",37407342,,10.1016/j.jdermsci.2023.06.005,0
Embryo-scale reverse genetics at single-cell resolution,"The maturation of single-cell transcriptomic technologies has facilitated the generation of comprehensive cellular atlases from whole embryos1-4. A majority of these data, however, has been collected from wild-type embryos without an appreciation for the latent variation that is present in development. Here we present the 'zebrafish single-cell atlas of perturbed embryos': single-cell transcriptomic data from 1,812 individually resolved developing zebrafish embryos, encompassing 19 timepoints, 23 genetic perturbations and a total of 3.2 million cells. The high degree of replication in our study (eight or more embryos per condition) enables us to estimate the variance in cell type abundance organism-wide and to detect perturbation-dependent deviance in cell type composition relative to wild-type embryos. Our approach is sensitive to rare cell types, resolving developmental trajectories and genetic dependencies in the cranial ganglia neurons, a cell population that comprises less than 1% of the embryo. Additionally, time-series profiling of individual mutants identified a group of brachyury-independent cells with strikingly similar transcriptomes to notochord sheath cells, leading to new hypotheses about early origins of the skull. We anticipate that standardized collection of high-resolution, organism-scale single-cell data from large numbers of individual embryos will enable mapping of the genetic dependencies of zebrafish cell types, while also addressing longstanding challenges in developmental genetics, including the cellular and transcriptional plasticity underlying phenotypic diversity across individuals.",37968389,PMC10665197,10.1038/s41586-023-06720-2,2
Recurrent pregnancy loss is associated with a pro-senescent decidual response during the peri-implantation window,"During the implantation window, the endometrium becomes poised to transition to a pregnant state, a process driven by differentiation of stromal cells into decidual cells (DC). Perturbations in this process, termed decidualization, leads to breakdown of the feto-maternal interface and miscarriage, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we reconstructed the decidual pathway at single-cell level in vitro and demonstrate that stromal cells first mount an acute stress response before emerging as DC or senescent DC (snDC). In the absence of immune cell-mediated clearance of snDC, secondary senescence transforms DC into progesterone-resistant cells that abundantly express extracellular matrix remodelling factors. Additional single-cell analysis of midluteal endometrium identified DIO2 and SCARA5 as marker genes of a diverging decidual response in vivo. Finally, we report a conspicuous link between a pro-senescent decidual response in peri-implantation endometrium and recurrent pregnancy loss, suggesting that pre-pregnancy screening and intervention may reduce the burden of miscarriage.",31965050,PMC6972755,10.1038/s42003-020-0763-1,88
Cell population analysis of the adult murine subependymal neurogenic lineage by flow cytometry,"This protocol provides a flow-cytometry-based procedure to classify and isolate all cells of the adult rodent subependymal zone (SEZ) neurogenic lineage, without the need for reporter mice, into different cell populations, including three neural stem cell (NSC) fractions with molecular signatures that are coherent with single-cell transcriptomics. Additionally, their cycling behavior can be assessed by means of 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation. Our method allows the isolation of different NSC fractions and the functional assay of their cycling heterogeneity and quiescence-activation transitions. For complete details on the use, execution, and outcomes of this protocol, please refer to Belenguer et al. (2021).",33899012,PMC8056273,10.1016/j.xpro.2021.100425,4
Model-based prediction of spatial gene expression via generative linear mapping,"Decoding spatial transcriptomes from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data has become a fundamental technique for understanding multicellular systems; however, existing computational methods lack both accuracy and biological interpretability due to their model-free frameworks. Here, we introduce Perler, a model-based method to integrate scRNA-seq data with reference in situ hybridization (ISH) data. To calibrate differences between these datasets, we develop a biologically interpretable model that uses generative linear mapping based on a Gaussian mixture model using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm. Perler accurately predicts the spatial gene expression of Drosophila embryos, zebrafish embryos, mammalian liver, and mouse visual cortex from scRNA-seq data. Furthermore, the reconstructed transcriptomes do not over-fit the ISH data and preserved the timing information of the scRNA-seq data. These results demonstrate the generalizability of Perler for dataset integration, thereby providing a biologically interpretable framework for accurate reconstruction of spatial transcriptomes in any multicellular system.",34140477,PMC8211835,10.1038/s41467-021-24014-x,7
"RNA imaging. Spatially resolved, highly multiplexed RNA profiling in single cells","Knowledge of the expression profile and spatial landscape of the transcriptome in individual cells is essential for understanding the rich repertoire of cellular behaviors. Here, we report multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH), a single-molecule imaging approach that allows the copy numbers and spatial localizations of thousands of RNA species to be determined in single cells. Using error-robust encoding schemes to combat single-molecule labeling and detection errors, we demonstrated the imaging of 100 to 1000 distinct RNA species in hundreds of individual cells. Correlation analysis of the ~10(4) to 10(6) pairs of genes allowed us to constrain gene regulatory networks, predict novel functions for many unannotated genes, and identify distinct spatial distribution patterns of RNAs that correlate with properties of the encoded proteins.",25858977,PMC4662681,10.1126/science.aaa6090,931
Transcriptome analysis reveals high tumor heterogeneity with respect to re-activation of stemness and proliferation programs,"Significant alterations in signaling pathways and transcriptional regulatory programs together represent major hallmarks of many cancers. These, among all, include the reactivation of stemness, which is registered by the expression of pathways that are active in the embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Here, we assembled gene sets that reflect the stemness and proliferation signatures and used them to analyze a large panel of RNA-seq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Consortium in order to specifically assess the expression of stemness-related and proliferation-related genes across a collection of different tumor types. We introduced a metric that captures the collective similarity of the expression profile of a tumor to that of ESCs, which showed that stemness and proliferation signatures vary greatly between different tumor types. We also observed a high degree of intertumoral heterogeneity in the expression of stemness- and proliferation-related genes, which was associated with increased hazard ratios in a fraction of tumors and mirrored by high intratumoral heterogeneity and a remarkable stemness capacity in metastatic lesions across cancer cells in single cell RNA-seq datasets. Taken together, these results indicate that the expression of stemness signatures is highly heterogeneous and cannot be used as a universal determinant of cancer. This calls into question the universal validity of diagnostic tests that are based on stem cell markers.",35587924,PMC9119523,10.1371/journal.pone.0268626,0
Single-cell transcriptomic architecture and cellular communication circuits of parametrial adipose tissue in pregnant mice,"Aims:The activity and interactions of cellular subpopulations in the adipose tissue microenvironment are critical for the coordination of local and systemic adaptation during pregnancy. With a particular interest in parametrial adipose tissue (PmAT), single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) was utilized to unveil the gestative cellular composition and functional shift.Materials and methods:To identify cell-type-enriched transcriptome profiles, a total of 18,074 cells in adipose tissue were studied. The cell populations were cataloged, and signaling crosstalk between adipocytes and other composition factions via soluble and membrane-bound factors were evaluated.Key findings:A marked decline of pregnancy adipocytes and relative elevation of non-adipocyte fractions were observed. A subpopulation of adipocytes, Adipo_5, with unique properties in the response to estrogen and the embryonic processes involved in pregnancy, was defined. Interactome analysis revealed the potential contribution of PmAT to the establishment of maternal-fetal immune tolerance. During gestation, adipocytes shut down outgoing signaling, resulting in deterioration of the resistin-related incoming signaling network in B cells, which would therefore benefit tissue-specific maternal-fetal tolerance. Furthermore, a subpopulation of adipocytes, Aipo_2, was also considered to take part in a paradigm shift in the process of pregnancy-induced chemical stiffness-triggered vesicular remodeling via the THBS signaling pathway network.Significance:These data-derived findings will encourage investigation into the role of pregnant PmTA in pregnancy-related immunological, hypertensive and metabolic disorders, with the ultimate goal of establishing preventive strategies to mitigate these pregnancy-related health challenges. This translational aspect of our work holds significant promise for improving maternal and fetal well-being.",37907153,,10.1016/j.lfs.2023.122214,0
Deconvolving the contributions of cell-type heterogeneity on cortical gene expression,"Complexity of cell-type composition has created much skepticism surrounding the interpretation of bulk tissue transcriptomic studies. Recent studies have shown that deconvolution algorithms can be applied to computationally estimate cell-type proportions from gene expression data of bulk blood samples, but their performance when applied to brain tissue is unclear. Here, we have generated an immunohistochemistry (IHC) dataset for five major cell-types from brain tissue of 70 individuals, who also have bulk cortical gene expression data. With the IHC data as the benchmark, this resource enables quantitative assessment of deconvolution algorithms for brain tissue. We apply existing deconvolution algorithms to brain tissue by using marker sets derived from human brain single cell and cell-sorted RNA-seq data. We show that these algorithms can indeed produce informative estimates of constituent cell-type proportions. In fact, neuronal subpopulations can also be estimated from bulk brain tissue samples. Further, we show that including the cell-type proportion estimates as confounding factors is important for reducing false associations between Alzheimer's disease phenotypes and gene expression. Lastly, we demonstrate that using more accurate marker sets can substantially improve statistical power in detecting cell-type specific expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs).",32804935,PMC7451979,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008120,56
Decoding Expression Dynamics of Protein and Transcriptome at the Single-Cell Level in Paired Picoliter Chambers,"Simultaneous analysis of mRNAs and proteins at the single-cell level provides information about the dynamics and correlations of gene and protein expressions in individual cells, enabling a comprehensive study of cellular heterogeneity and expression patterns. Here, we present a platform for about 1000 cellular indexing of mRNAs and membrane proteins, named multi-Paired-seq, with high cell utilization, accurate molecular measurement, and low cost. Based on hydrodynamic differential flow resistance, multi-Paired-seq largely improves cell utilization in the percentage of cells measured in population (>95%). Combined with the pump/valve structure, cell-free antibodies and mRNAs can be removed completely for highly accurate detection (R= 0.96) of protein copies. The picoliter reaction chambers allow high detection sensitivity for both mRNA transcripts and protein copies and low sequencing cost. Using multi-Paired-seq, three clusters of known breast cancer cell types are identified according to multimodal measurements, and the expression correlations between mRNAs and proteins under altered conditions are quantified. Multi-Paired-seq provides multimodal measurements at the single-cell level, which offers a new tool for cell biology, developmental biology, drug discovery, and precision medicine.",35650660,,10.1021/acs.analchem.1c05312,3
Temporal transcriptomic dynamics in developing macaque neocortex,"Despite intense research on mice, the transcriptional regulation of neocortical neurogenesis remains limited in humans and non-human primates. Cortical development in rhesus macaque is known to recapitulate multiple facets of cortical development in humans, including the complex composition of neural stem cells and the thicker supragranular layer. To characterize temporal shifts in transcriptomic programming responsible for differentiation from stem cells to neurons, we sampled parietal lobes of rhesus macaque at E40, E50, E70, E80, and E90, spanning the full period of prenatal neurogenesis. Single-cell RNA sequencing produced a transcriptomic atlas of developing parietal lobe in rhesus macaque neocortex. Identification of distinct cell types and neural stem cells emerging in different developmental stages revealed a terminally bifurcating trajectory from stem cells to neurons. Notably, deep-layer neurons appear in the early stages of neurogenesis, while upper-layer neurons appear later. While these different lineages show overlap in their differentiation program, cell fates are determined post-mitotically. Trajectories analysis from ventricular radial glia (vRGs) to outer radial glia (oRGs) revealed dynamic gene expression profiles and identified differential activation ofBMP,FGF, andWNTsignaling pathways between vRGs and oRGs. These results provide a comprehensive overview of the temporal patterns of gene expression leading to different fates of radial glial progenitors during neocortex layer formation.",38415809,PMC10911584,10.7554/eLife.90325,0
Benchmarking spatial clustering methods with spatially resolved transcriptomics data,"Spatial clustering, which shares an analogy with single-cell clustering, has expanded the scope of tissue physiology studies from cell-centroid to structure-centroid with spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) data. Computational methods have undergone remarkable development in recent years, but a comprehensive benchmark study is still lacking. Here we present a benchmark study of 13 computational methods on 34 SRT data (7 datasets). The performance was evaluated on the basis of accuracy, spatial continuity, marker genes detection, scalability, and robustness. We found existing methods were complementary in terms of their performance and functionality, and we provide guidance for selecting appropriate methods for given scenarios. On testing additional 22 challenging datasets, we identified challenges in identifying noncontinuous spatial domains and limitations of existing methods, highlighting their inadequacies in handling recent large-scale tasks. Furthermore, with 145 simulated data, we examined the robustness of these methods against four different factors, and assessed the impact of pre- and postprocessing approaches. Our study offers a comprehensive evaluation of existing spatial clustering methods with SRT data, paving the way for future advancements in this rapidly evolving field.",38491270,,10.1038/s41592-024-02215-8,0
The use of single-cell RNA-seq to study heterogeneity at varying levels of virus-host interactions,"The outcome of viral infection depends on the diversity of the infecting viral population and the heterogeneity of the cell population that is infected. Until almost a decade ago, the study of these dynamic processes during viral infection was challenging and limited to certain targeted measurements. Presently, with the use of single-cell sequencing technology, the complex interface defined by the interactions of cells with infecting virus can now be studied across the breadth of the transcriptome in thousands of individual cells simultaneously. In this review, we will describe the use of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to study the heterogeneity of viral infections, ranging from individual virions to the immune response between infected individuals. In addition, we highlight certain key experimental limitations and methodological decisions that are critical to analyzing scRNA-seq data at each scale.",38236826,PMC10796064,10.1371/journal.ppat.1011898,1
Spatial-ID: a cell typing method for spatially resolved transcriptomics via transfer learning and spatial embedding,"Spatially resolved transcriptomics provides the opportunity to investigate the gene expression profiles and the spatial context of cells in naive state, but at low transcript detection sensitivity or with limited gene throughput. Comprehensive annotating of cell types in spatially resolved transcriptomics to understand biological processes at the single cell level remains challenging. Here we propose Spatial-ID, a supervision-based cell typing method, that combines the existing knowledge of reference single-cell RNA-seq data and the spatial information of spatially resolved transcriptomics data. We present a series of benchmarking analyses on publicly available spatially resolved transcriptomics datasets, that demonstrate the superiority of Spatial-ID compared with state-of-the-art methods. Besides, we apply Spatial-ID on a self-collected mouse brain hemisphere dataset measured by Stereo-seq, that shows the scalability of Spatial-ID to three-dimensional large field tissues with subcellular spatial resolution.",36496406,PMC9741613,10.1038/s41467-022-35288-0,13
High resolution spatial profiling of kidney injury and repair using RNA hybridization-based in situ sequencing,"Emerging spatially resolved transcriptomics technologies allow for the measurement of gene expression in situ at cellular resolution. We apply direct RNA hybridization-based in situ sequencing (dRNA HybISS, Cartana part of 10xGenomics) to compare male and female healthy mouse kidneys and the male kidney injury and repair timecourse. A pre-selected panel of 200 genes is used to identify cell state dynamics patterns during injury and repair. We develop a new computational pipeline, CellScopes, for the rapid analysis, multi-omic integration and visualization of spatially resolved transcriptomic datasets. The resulting dataset allows us to resolve 13 kidney cell types within distinct kidney niches, dynamic alterations in cell state over the course of injury and repair and cell-cell interactions between leukocytes and kidney parenchyma. At late timepoints after injury, C3+ leukocytes are enriched near pro-inflammatory, failed-repair proximal tubule cells. Integration of snRNA-seq dataset from the same injury and repair samples also allows us to impute the spatial localization of genes not directly measured by dRNA HybISS.",38360882,PMC10869771,10.1038/s41467-024-45752-8,1
scDAC: deep adaptive clustering of single-cell transcriptomic data with coupled autoencoder and Dirichlet process mixture model,"Motivation:Clustering analysis for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data is an important step in revealing cellular heterogeneity. Many clustering methods have been proposed to discover heterogenous cell types from scRNA-seq data. However, adaptive clustering with accurate cluster number reflecting intrinsic biology nature from large-scale scRNA-seq data remains quite challenging.Results:Here, we propose a single-cell Deep Adaptive Clustering (scDAC) model by coupling the Autoencoder (AE) and the Dirichlet Process Mixture Model (DPMM). By jointly optimizing the model parameters of AE and DPMM, scDAC achieves adaptive clustering with accurate cluster numbers on scRNA-seq data. We verify the performance of scDAC on five subsampled datasets with different numbers of cell types and compare it with 15 widely used clustering methods across nine scRNA-seq datasets. Our results demonstrate that scDAC can adaptively find accurate numbers of cell types or subtypes and outperforms other methods. Moreover, the performance of scDAC is robust to hyperparameter changes.Availability and implementation:The scDAC is implemented in Python.

A universal tool for predicting differentially active features in single-cell and spatial genomics data,"With the growing complexity of single-cell and spatial genomics data, there is an increasing importance of unbiased and efficient exploratory data analysis tools. One common exploratory data analysis step is the prediction of genes with different levels of activity in a subset of cells or locations inside a tissue. We previously developed singleCellHaystack, a method for predicting differentially expressed genes from single-cell transcriptome data, without relying on comparisons between clusters of cells. Here we present an update to singleCellHaystack, which is now a universally applicable method for predicting differentially active features: (1) singleCellHaystack now accepts continuous features that can be RNA or protein expression, chromatin accessibility or module scores from single-cell, spatial and even bulk genomics data, and (2) it can handle 1D trajectories, 2-3D spatial coordinates, as well as higher-dimensional latent spaces as input coordinates. Performance has been drastically improved, with up to ten times reduction in computational time and scalability to millions of cells, making singleCellHaystack a suitable tool for exploratory analysis of atlas level datasets. singleCellHaystack is available as packages in both R and Python.",37481581,PMC10363154,10.1038/s41598-023-38965-2,1
ProtoCell4P: an explainable prototype-based neural network for patient classification using single-cell RNA-seq,"Motivation:The rapid advance in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology over the past decade has provided a rich resource of gene expression profiles of single cells measured on patients, facilitating the study of many biological questions at the single-cell level. One intriguing research is to study the single cells which play critical roles in the phenotypes of patients, which has the potential to identify those cells and genes driving the disease phenotypes. To this end, deep learning models are expected to well encode the single-cell information and achieve precise prediction of patients' phenotypes using scRNA-seq data. However, we are facing critical challenges in designing deep learning models for classifying patient samples due to (i) the samples collected in the same dataset contain a variable number of cells-some samples might only have hundreds of cells sequenced while others could have thousands of cells, and (ii) the number of samples available is typically small and the expression profile of each cell is noisy and extremely high-dimensional. Moreover, the black-box nature of existing deep learning models makes it difficult for the researchers to interpret the models and extract useful knowledge from them.Results:We propose a prototype-based and cell-informed model for patient phenotype classification, termed ProtoCell4P, that can alleviate problems of the sample scarcity and the diverse number of cells by leveraging the cell knowledge with representatives of cells (called prototypes), and precisely classify the patients by adaptively incorporating information from different cells. Moreover, this classification process can be explicitly interpreted by identifying the key cells for decision making and by further summarizing the knowledge of cell types to unravel the biological nature of the classification. Our approach is explainable at the single-cell resolution which can identify the key cells in each patient's classification. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method can effectively deal with patient classifications using single-cell data and outperforms the existing approaches. Furthermore, our approach is able to uncover the association between cell types and biological classes of interest from a data-driven perspective.Availability and implementation:https://github.com/Teddy-XiongGZ/ProtoCell4P.",37540223,PMC10444962,10.1093/bioinformatics/btad493,0
scSemiAAE: a semi-supervised clustering model for single-cell RNA-seq data,"Background:Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) strives to capture cellular diversity with higher resolution than bulk RNA sequencing. Clustering analysis is critical to transcriptome research as it allows for further identification and discovery of new cell types. Unsupervised clustering cannot integrate prior knowledge where relevant information is widely available. Purely unsupervised clustering algorithms may not yield biologically interpretable clusters when confronted with the high dimensionality of scRNA-seq data and frequent dropout events, which makes identification of cell types more challenging.Results:We propose scSemiAAE, a semi-supervised clustering model for scRNA sequence analysis using deep generative neural networks. Specifically, scSemiAAE carefully designs a ZINB adversarial autoencoder-based architecture that inherently integrates adversarial training and semi-supervised modules in the latent space. In a series of experiments on scRNA-seq datasets spanning thousands to tens of thousands of cells, scSemiAAE can significantly improve clustering performance compared to dozens of unsupervised and semi-supervised algorithms, promoting clustering and interpretability of downstream analyses.Conclusion:scSemiAAE is a Python-based algorithm implemented on the VSCode platform that provides efficient visualization, clustering, and cell type assignment for scRNA-seq data. The tool is available from https://github.com/WHang98/scSemiAAE .",37237310,PMC10214737,10.1186/s12859-023-05339-4,1
An individualized causal framework for learning intercellular communication networks that define microenvironments of individual tumors,"Cells within a tumor microenvironment (TME) dynamically communicate and influence each other's cellular states through an intercellular communication network (ICN). In cancers, intercellular communications underlie immune evasion mechanisms of individual tumors. We developed an individualized causal analysis framework for discovering tumor specific ICNs. Using head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) tumors as a testbed, we first mined single-cell RNA-sequencing data to discover gene expression modules (GEMs) that reflect the states of transcriptomic processes within tumor and stromal single cells. By deconvoluting bulk transcriptomes of HNSCC tumors profiled by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we estimated the activation states of these transcriptomic processes in individual tumors. Finally, we applied individualized causal network learning to discover an ICN within each tumor. Our results show that cellular states of cells in TMEs are coordinated through ICNs that enable multi-way communications among epithelial, fibroblast, endothelial, and immune cells. Further analyses of individual ICNs revealed structural patterns that were shared across subsets of tumors, leading to the discovery of 4 different subtypes of networks that underlie disparate TMEs of HNSCC. Patients with distinct TMEs exhibited significantly different clinical outcomes. Our results show that the capability of estimating individual ICNs reveals heterogeneity of ICNs and sheds light on the importance of intercellular communication in impacting disease development and progression.",36548438,PMC9822106,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010761,1
Analysis of synthetic cellular barcodes in the genome and transcriptome with BARtab and bartools,"Cellular barcoding is a lineage-tracing methodology that couples heritable synthetic barcodes to high-throughput sequencing, enabling the accurate tracing of cell lineages across a range of biological contexts. Recent studies have extended these methods by incorporating lineage information into single-cell or spatial transcriptomics readouts. Leveraging the rich biological information within these datasets requires dedicated computational tools for dataset pre-processing and analysis. Here, we present BARtab, a portable and scalable Nextflow pipeline, and bartools, an open-source R package, designed to provide an integrated end-to-end cellular barcoding analysis toolkit. BARtab and bartools contain methods to simplify the extraction, quality control, analysis, and visualization of lineage barcodes from population-level, single-cell, and spatial transcriptomics experiments. We showcase the utility of our integrated BARtab and bartools workflow via the analysis of exemplar bulk, single-cell, and spatial transcriptomics experiments containing cellular barcoding information.",38670101,PMC11133760,10.1016/j.crmeth.2024.100763,1
Structure-preserved dimension reduction using joint triplets sampling for multi-batch integration of single-cell transcriptomic data,"Dimension reduction (DR) plays an important role in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), such as data interpretation, visualization and other downstream analysis. A desired DR method should be applicable to various application scenarios, including identifying cell types, preserving the inherent structure of data and handling with batch effects. However, most of the existing DR methods fail to accommodate these requirements simultaneously, especially removing batch effects. In this paper, we develop a novel structure-preserved dimension reduction (SPDR) method using intra- and inter-batch triplets sampling. The constructed triplets jointly consider each anchor's mutual nearest neighbors from inter-batch, k-nearest neighbors from intra-batch and randomly selected cells from the whole data, which capture higher order structure information and meanwhile account for batch information of the data. Then we minimize a robust loss function for the chosen triplets to obtain a structure-preserved and batch-corrected low-dimensional representation. Comprehensive evaluations show that SPDR outperforms other competing DR methods, such as INSCT, IVIS, Trimap, Scanorama, scVI and UMAP, in removing batch effects, preserving biological variation, facilitating visualization and improving clustering accuracy. Besides, the two-dimensional (2D) embedding of SPDR presents a clear and authentic expression pattern, and can guide researchers to determine how many cell types should be identified. Furthermore, SPDR is robust to complex data characteristics (such as down-sampling, duplicates and outliers) and varying hyperparameter settings. We believe that SPDR will be a valuable tool for characterizing complex cellular heterogeneity.",36627114,,10.1093/bib/bbac608,0
Predictive and robust gene selection for spatial transcriptomics,"A prominent trend in single-cell transcriptomics is providing spatial context alongside a characterization of each cell's molecular state. This typically requires targeting an a priori selection of genes, often covering less than 1% of the genome, and a key question is how to optimally determine the small gene panel. We address this challenge by introducing a flexible deep learning framework, PERSIST, to identify informative gene targets for spatial transcriptomics studies by leveraging reference scRNA-seq data. Using datasets spanning different brain regions, species, and scRNA-seq technologies, we show that PERSIST reliably identifies panels that provide more accurate prediction of the genome-wide expression profile, thereby capturing more information with fewer genes. PERSIST can be adapted to specific biological goals, and we demonstrate that PERSIST's binarization of gene expression levels enables models trained on scRNA-seq data to generalize with to spatial transcriptomics data, despite the complex shift between these technologies.",37045821,PMC10097645,10.1038/s41467-023-37392-1,4
Identifying Subpopulations of Cells in Single-Cell Transcriptomic Data: A Bayesian Mixture Modeling Approach to Zero Inflation of Counts,"In the study of single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-Seq) data, a key component of the analysis is to identify subpopulations of cells in the data. A variety of approaches to this have been considered, and although many machine learning-based methods have been developed, these rarely give an estimate of uncertainty in the cluster assignment. To allow for this, probabilistic models have been developed, but scRNA-Seq data exhibit a phenomenon known as dropout, whereby a large proportion of the observed read counts are zero. This poses challenges in developing probabilistic models that appropriately model the data. We develop a novel Dirichlet process mixture model that employs both a mixture at the cell level to model multiple populations of cells and a zero-inflated negative binomial mixture of counts at the transcript level. By taking a Bayesian approach, we are able to model the expression of genes within clusters, and to quantify uncertainty in cluster assignments. It is shown that this approach outperforms previous approaches that applied multinomial distributions to model scRNA-Seq counts and negative binomial models that do not take into account zero inflation. Applied to a publicly available data set of scRNA-Seq counts of multiple cell types from the mouse cortex and hippocampus, we demonstrate how our approach can be used to distinguish subpopulations of cells as clusters in the data, and to identify gene sets that are indicative of membership of a subpopulation.",37871291,,10.1089/cmb.2022.0273,0
Isolation of Cardiac Endothelial Cells for Transcriptomic Analysis of the Zebrafish and Mouse Heart,Isolation of high quality cardiac endothelial cells is a prerequisite for successful bulk and single cell sequencing for RNA (scRNA-seq). We describe a protocol using both enzymatic and mechanical dissociation and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to isolate endothelial cells from larval and adult zebrafish hearts and from healthy and ischemic adult mouse hearts. Endothelial cells with high viability and purity can be obtained using this method for downstream transcriptional analyses applications.,35099746,,10.1007/978-1-0716-2059-5_23,1
Accurate and interpretable gene expression imputation on scRNA-seq data using IGSimpute,"Single-cell ribonucleic acid sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables the quantification of gene expression at the transcriptomic level with single-cell resolution, enhancing our understanding of cellular heterogeneity. However, the excessive missing values present in scRNA-seq data hinder downstream analysis. While numerous imputation methods have been proposed to recover scRNA-seq data, high imputation performance often comes with low or no interpretability. Here, we present IGSimpute, an accurate and interpretable imputation method for recovering missing values in scRNA-seq data with an interpretable instance-wise gene selection layer (GSL). IGSimpute outperforms 12 other state-of-the-art imputation methods on 13 out of 17 datasets from different scRNA-seq technologies with the lowest mean squared error as the chosen benchmark metric. We demonstrate that IGSimpute can give unbiased estimates of the missing values compared to other methods, regardless of whether the average gene expression values are small or large. Clustering results of imputed profiles show that IGSimpute offers statistically significant improvement over other imputation methods. By taking the heart-and-aorta and the limb muscle tissues as examples, we show that IGSimpute can also denoise gene expression profiles by removing outlier entries with unexpectedly high expression values via the instance-wise GSL. We also show that genes selected by the instance-wise GSL could indicate the age of B cells from bladder fat tissue of the Tabula Muris Senis atlas. IGSimpute can impute one million cells using 64 min, and thus applicable to large datasets.",37039664,,10.1093/bib/bbad124,1
Comparative Methods for Demystifying Spatial Transcriptomics,"Spatial Transcriptomics (ST), coined as the term for parallel RNA-Seq on cell populations ordered spatially on a histological tissue section, has recently become increasingly popular, especially in experiments where microfluidics-based single-cell sequencing fails, such as assays on neurons. ST platforms, like the 10x Visium technology investigated herein, therefore produce in a single experiment simultaneously thousands of RNA readouts, captured by an array of micrometer scale spots under the histological section. Therefore, a central challenge of analyzing ST experiments consists of analyzing the gene expression morphology of all spots to delineate clusters of similar cell mixtures, which are then compared to each other to identify up- or down-regulated marker genes. Moreover, another level of complexity in ST experiments, compared to traditional RNA-Seq, is imposed by staining the tissue section with protein markers of cells or cell components to identify spots providing relevant information afterward. The corresponding microscopy images need to be analyzed in addition to the RNA-Seq read mappings on the reference genome and transcriptome sequences. Focusing on the software suite provided by the Visium platform manufacturer, we break down the ST analysis pipeline into its four essential steps-the image analysis, the read alignment, the gene quantification, and the spot clustering-and compare results obtained when using reads from different subsets of spots and/or when employing alternative genome or transcriptome references. Our comparative analyses demonstrate the impact of spot selection and the choice of genome/transcriptome references on the analysis results when employing the manufacturer's pipeline.",38819570,,10.1007/978-1-0716-3838-5_17,0
Tissue-specific deconvolution of immune cell composition by integrating bulk and single-cell transcriptomes,"Motivation:Many methods have been developed to estimate immune cell composition from tissue transcriptomes. One common characteristic of these methods is that they are trained using a set of general immune cell transcriptomes that ignores tissue specificities. However, as immune cells are localized in different tissues, they may have distinct expression profiles. Hence, calculations that use general signature matrices may hinder the deconvolution accuracy.Results:This study used single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-Seq) data from different mouse tissues instead of general signature expression values to generate tissue-specific signature gene matrices that are used as the input of the deconvolution model. First, the transcriptome of immune cells in each tissue was extracted from scRNA-Seq data and used to construct the entire expression matrix of tissue immune cells. Then, after comparing different gene selection strategies, the expressions of 162 seq-ImmuCC derived signature genes in tissue immune cell scRNA-Seq data were regarded as the tissue specific signature matrices. Finally, a modest improvement in performance was observed in multiple tissues that refer to a traditional general signature matrix in the deconvolution model. With the fast accumulation of scRNA-Seq data, the introduction of these data into an estimation of immune cell compositions for different tissues will open a new window for avoiding tissue bias for immune cell expression.Availability and implementation:The signature matrices were available at https://github.com/wuaipinglab/ImmuCC/tree/master/tissue_immucc/SignatureMatrix).Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",31504185,,10.1093/bioinformatics/btz672,5
Single-cell transcriptomics of small microbial eukaryotes: limitations and potential,"Single-cell transcriptomics is an emerging research tool that has huge untapped potential in the study of microbial eukaryotes. Its application has been tested in microbial eukaryotes 50 μm or larger, and it generated transcriptomes similar to those obtained from culture-based RNA-seq. However, microbial eukaryotes have a wide range of sizes and can be as small as 1 μm. Single-cell RNA-seq was tested in two smaller protists (8 and 15 μm). Transcript recovery rate was much lower and randomness in observed gene expression levels was much higher in single-cell transcriptomes than those derived from bulk cultures of cells. We found that the reason of such observation is that the smaller organisms had much lower mRNA copy numbers. We discuss the application of single-cell RNA-seq in studying smaller microbial eukaryotes in the context of these limitations.",28060364,PMC5437924,10.1038/ismej.2016.190,13
A single-cell RNA labeling strategy for measuring stress response upon tissue dissociation,"Tissue dissociation, a crucial step in single-cell sample preparation, can alter the transcriptional state of a sample through the intrinsic cellular stress response. Here we demonstrate a general approach for measuring transcriptional response during sample preparation. In our method, transcripts made during dissociation are labeled for later identification upon sequencing. We found general as well as cell-type-specific dissociation response programs in zebrafish larvae, and we observed sample-to-sample variation in the dissociation response of mouse cardiomyocytes despite well-controlled experimental conditions. Finally, we showed that dissociation of the mouse hippocampus can lead to the artificial activation of microglia. In summary, our approach facilitates experimental optimization of dissociation procedures as well as computational removal of transcriptional perturbation response.",36573354,PMC9912023,10.15252/msb.202211147,2
stPlus: a reference-based method for the accurate enhancement of spatial transcriptomics,"Motivation:Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) techniques have revolutionized the investigation of transcriptomic landscape in individual cells. Recent advancements in spatial transcriptomic technologies further enable gene expression profiling and spatial organization mapping of cells simultaneously. Among the technologies, imaging-based methods can offer higher spatial resolutions, while they are limited by either the small number of genes imaged or the low gene detection sensitivity. Although several methods have been proposed for enhancing spatially resolved transcriptomics, inadequate accuracy of gene expression prediction and insufficient ability of cell-population identification still impede the applications of these methods.Results:We propose stPlus, a reference-based method that leverages information in scRNA-seq data to enhance spatial transcriptomics. Based on an auto-encoder with a carefully tailored loss function, stPlus performs joint embedding and predicts spatial gene expression via a weighted k-nearest-neighbor. stPlus outperforms baseline methods with higher gene-wise and cell-wise Spearman correlation coefficients. We also introduce a clustering-based approach to assess the enhancement performance systematically. Using the data enhanced by stPlus, cell populations can be better identified than using the measured data. The predicted expression of genes unique to scRNA-seq data can also well characterize spatial cell heterogeneity. Besides, stPlus is robust and scalable to datasets of diverse gene detection sensitivity levels, sample sizes and number of spatially measured genes. We anticipate stPlus will facilitate the analysis of spatial transcriptomics.Availability and implementation:stPlus with detailed documents is freely accessible at http://health.tsinghua.edu.cn/software/stPlus/ and the source code is openly available on https://github.com/xy-chen16/stPlus.",34252941,PMC8336594,10.1093/bioinformatics/btab298,28
CROST: a comprehensive repository of spatial transcriptomics,"The development of spatial transcriptome sequencing technology has revolutionized our comprehension of complex tissues and propelled life and health sciences into an era of spatial omics. However, the current availability of databases for accessing and analyzing spatial transcriptomic data is limited. In response, we have established CROST (https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/crost), a comprehensive repository of spatial transcriptomics.

Spatial Transcriptomics: A Powerful Tool in Disease Understanding and Drug Discovery,"Recent advancements in modern science have provided robust tools for drug discovery. The rapid development of transcriptome sequencing technologies has given rise to single-cell transcriptomics and single-nucleus transcriptomics, increasing the accuracy of sequencing and accelerating the drug discovery process. With the evolution of single-cell transcriptomics, spatial transcriptomics (ST) technology has emerged as a derivative approach. Spatial transcriptomics has emerged as a hot topic in the field of omics research in recent years; it not only provides information on gene expression levels but also offers spatial information on gene expression. This technology has shown tremendous potential in research on disease understanding and drug discovery. In this article, we introduce the analytical strategies of spatial transcriptomics and review its applications in novel target discovery and drug mechanism unravelling.

Modeling expression ranks for noise-tolerant differential expression analysis of scRNA-seq data,"Systematic delineation of complex biological systems is an ever-challenging and resource-intensive process. Single-cell transcriptomics allows us to study cell-to-cell variability in complex tissues at an unprecedented resolution. Accurate modeling of gene expression plays a critical role in the statistical determination of tissue-specific gene expression patterns. In the past few years, considerable efforts have been made to identify appropriate parametric models for single-cell expression data. The zero-inflated version of Poisson/negative binomial and log-normal distributions have emerged as the most popular alternatives owing to their ability to accommodate high dropout rates, as commonly observed in single-cell data. Although the majority of the parametric approaches directly model expression estimates, we explore the potential of modeling expression ranks, as robust surrogates for transcript abundance. Here we examined the performance of the discrete generalized beta distribution (DGBD) on real data and devised a Wald-type test for comparing gene expression across two phenotypically divergent groups of single cells. We performed a comprehensive assessment of the proposed method to understand its advantages compared with some of the existing best-practice approaches. We concluded that besides striking a reasonable balance between Type I and Type II errors, ROSeq, the proposed differential expression test, is exceptionally robust to expression noise and scales rapidly with increasing sample size. For wider dissemination and adoption of the method, we created an R package called ROSeq and made it available on the Bioconductor platform.",33674351,PMC8015842,10.1101/gr.267070.120,4
Benchmarking of cell type deconvolution pipelines for transcriptomics data,"Many computational methods have been developed to infer cell type proportions from bulk transcriptomics data. However, an evaluation of the impact of data transformation, pre-processing, marker selection, cell type composition and choice of methodology on the deconvolution results is still lacking. Using five single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets, we generate pseudo-bulk mixtures to evaluate the combined impact of these factors. Both bulk deconvolution methodologies and those that use scRNA-seq data as reference perform best when applied to data in linear scale and the choice of normalization has a dramatic impact on some, but not all methods. Overall, methods that use scRNA-seq data have comparable performance to the best performing bulk methods whereas semi-supervised approaches show higher error values. Moreover, failure to include cell types in the reference that are present in a mixture leads to substantially worse results, regardless of the previous choices.

Comparative transcriptomics analysis pipeline for the meta-analysis of phylogenetically divergent datasets (CoRMAP),"Background:Transcriptional regulation is a fundamental mechanism underlying biological functions. In recent years, a broad array of RNA-Seq tools have been used to measure transcription levels in biological experiments, in whole organisms, tissues, and at the single cell level. Collectively, this is a vast comparative dataset on transcriptional processes across organisms. Yet, due to technical differences between the studies (sequencing, experimental design, and analysis) extracting usable comparative information and conducting meta-analyses remains challenging.Results:We introduce Comparative RNA-Seq Metadata Analysis Pipeline (CoRMAP), a meta-analysis tool to retrieve comparative gene expression data from any RNA-Seq dataset using de novo assembly, standardized gene expression tools and the implementation of OrthoMCL, a gene orthology search algorithm. It employs the use of orthogroup assignments to ensure the accurate comparison of gene expression levels between experiments and species. Here we demonstrate the use of CoRMAP on two mouse brain transcriptomes with similar scope, that were collected several years from each other using different sequencing technologies and analysis methods. We also compare the performance of CoRMAP with a functional mapping tool, previously published.Conclusion:CoRMAP provides a framework for the meta-analysis of RNA-Seq data from divergent taxonomic groups. This method facilitates the retrieval and comparison of gene expression levels from published data sets using standardized assembly and analysis. CoRMAP does not rely on reference genomes and consequently facilitates direct comparison between diverse studies on a range of organisms.",36207678,PMC9547434,10.1186/s12859-022-04972-9,0
scTSSR2: Imputing Dropout Events for Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Using Fast Two-Side Self-Representation,"The single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technique begins a new era by revealing gene expression patterns at single-cell resolution, enabling studies of heterogeneity and transcriptome dynamics of complex tissues at single-cell resolution. However, existing large proportion of dropout events may hinder downstream analyses. Thus imputation of dropout events is an important step in analyzing scRNA-seq data. We develop scTSSR2, a new imputation method that combines matrix decomposition with the previously developed two-side sparse self-representation, leading to fast two-side sparse self-representation to impute dropout events in scRNA-seq data. The comparisons of computational speed and memory usage among different imputation methods show that scTSSR2 has distinct advantages in terms of computational speed and memory usage. Comprehensive downstream experiments show that scTSSR2 outperforms the state-of-the-art imputation methods. A user-friendly R package scTSSR2 is developed to denoise the scRNA-seq data to improve the data quality.",35476574,,10.1109/TCBB.2022.3170587,0
stVAE deconvolves cell-type composition in large-scale cellular resolution spatial transcriptomics,"Motivation:Recent rapid developments in spatial transcriptomic techniques at cellular resolution have gained increasing attention. However, the unique characteristics of large-scale cellular resolution spatial transcriptomic datasets, such as the limited number of transcripts captured per spot and the vast number of spots, pose significant challenges to current cell-type deconvolution methods.Results:In this study, we introduce stVAE, a method based on the variational autoencoder framework to deconvolve the cell-type composition of cellular resolution spatial transcriptomic datasets. To assess the performance of stVAE, we apply it to five datasets across three different biological tissues. In the Stereo-seq and Slide-seqV2 datasets of the mouse brain, stVAE accurately reconstructs the laminar structure of the pyramidal cell layers in the cortex, which are mainly organized by the subtypes of telencephalon projecting excitatory neurons. In the Stereo-seq dataset of the E12.5 mouse embryo, stVAE resolves the complex spatial patterns of osteoblast subtypes, which are supported by their marker genes. In Stereo-seq and Pixel-seq datasets of the mouse olfactory bulb, stVAE accurately delineates the spatial distributions of known cell types. In summary, stVAE can accurately identify spatial patterns of cell types and their relative proportions across spots for cellular resolution spatial transcriptomic data. It is instrumental in understanding the heterogeneity of cell populations and their interactions within tissues.Availability and implementation:stVAE is available in GitHub (https://github.com/lichen2018/stVAE) and Figshare (https://figshare.com/articles/software/stVAE/23254538).",37862237,PMC10612402,10.1093/bioinformatics/btad642,0
Identifying Spatial Co-occurrence in Healthy and InflAmed tissues (ISCHIA),"Sequencing-based spatial transcriptomics (ST) methods allow unbiased capturing of RNA molecules at barcoded spots, charting the distribution and localization of cell types and transcripts across a tissue. While the coarse resolution of these techniques is considered a disadvantage, we argue that the inherent proximity of transcriptomes captured on spots can be leveraged to reconstruct cellular networks. To this end, we developed ISCHIA (Identifying Spatial Co-occurrence in Healthy and InflAmed tissues), a computational framework to analyze the spatial co-occurrence of cell types and transcript species within spots. Co-occurrence analysis is complementary to differential gene expression, as it does not depend on the abundance of a given cell type or on the transcript expression levels, but rather on their spatial association in the tissue. We applied ISCHIA to analyze co-occurrence of cell types, ligands and receptors in a Visium dataset of human ulcerative colitis patients, and validated our findings at single-cell resolution on matched hybridization-based data. We uncover inflammation-induced cellular networks involving M cell and fibroblasts, as well as ligand-receptor interactions enriched in the inflamed human colon, and their associated gene signatures. Our results highlight the hypothesis-generating power and broad applicability of co-occurrence analysis on spatial transcriptomics data.",38225383,PMC10897385,10.1038/s44320-023-00006-5,2
A clustering-independent method for finding differentially expressed genes in single-cell transcriptome data,"A common analysis of single-cell sequencing data includes clustering of cells and identifying differentially expressed genes (DEGs). How cell clusters are defined has important consequences for downstream analyses and the interpretation of results, but is often not straightforward. To address this difficulty, we present singleCellHaystack, a method that enables the prediction of DEGs without relying on explicit clustering of cells. Our method uses Kullback-Leibler divergence to find genes that are expressed in subsets of cells that are non-randomly positioned in a multidimensional space. Comparisons with existing DEG prediction approaches on artificial datasets show that singleCellHaystack has higher accuracy. We illustrate the usage of singleCellHaystack through applications on 136 real transcriptome datasets and a spatial transcriptomics dataset. We demonstrate that our method is a fast and accurate approach for DEG prediction in single-cell data. singleCellHaystack is implemented as an R package and is available from CRAN and GitHub.",32859930,PMC7455704,10.1038/s41467-020-17900-3,32
Lineage specification and pluripotency revealed by transcriptome analysis from oocyte to blastocyst in pig,"The inner cell mass (ICM) in blastocyst is the origin of all somatic and germ cells in mammals and pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) in vitro. As the conserved principles between pig and human, here we performed comprehensive single-cell RNA-seq for porcine early embryos from oocyte to early blastocyst (EB). We show the specification of the ICM and trophectoderm in morula and the molecular signature of the precursors. We demonstrate the existence of naïve pluripotency signature in morula and ICM of EB, and the specific pluripotent genes and the activity of signalling pathways highlight the characteristics of the naïve pluripotency. We observe the absence of dosage compensation with respect to X-chromosome (XC) in morula, and incomplete dosage compensation in the EB. However, the dynamics of dosage compensation may be independent of the expression of XIST induced XC inactivation. Our study describes molecular landmarks of embryogenesis in pig that will provide a better strategy for derivation of porcine PSCs and improve research in regenerative medicine.",31914626,,10.1096/fj.201901818RR,25

"Probabilistic embedding, clustering, and alignment for integrating spatial transcriptomics data with PRECAST","Spatially resolved transcriptomics involves a set of emerging technologies that enable the transcriptomic profiling of tissues with the physical location of expressions. Although a variety of methods have been developed for data integration, most of them are for single-cell RNA-seq datasets without consideration of spatial information. Thus, methods that can integrate spatial transcriptomics data from multiple tissue slides, possibly from multiple individuals, are needed. Here, we present PRECAST, a data integration method for multiple spatial transcriptomics datasets with complex batch effects and/or biological effects between slides. PRECAST unifies spatial factor analysis simultaneously with spatial clustering and embedding alignment, while requiring only partially shared cell/domain clusters across datasets. Using both simulated and four real datasets, we show improved cell/domain detection with outstanding visualization, and the estimated aligned embeddings and cell/domain labels facilitate many downstream analyses. We demonstrate that PRECAST is computationally scalable and applicable to spatial transcriptomics datasets from different platforms.",36653349,PMC9849443,10.1038/s41467-023-35947-w,15
Imputation of spatially-resolved transcriptomes by graph-regularized tensor completion,"High-throughput spatial-transcriptomics RNA sequencing (sptRNA-seq) based on in-situ capturing technologies has recently been developed to spatially resolve transcriptome-wide mRNA expressions mapped to the captured locations in a tissue sample. Due to the low RNA capture efficiency by in-situ capturing and the complication of tissue section preparation, sptRNA-seq data often only provides an incomplete profiling of the gene expressions over the spatial regions of the tissue. In this paper, we introduce a graph-regularized tensor completion model for imputing the missing mRNA expressions in sptRNA-seq data, namely FIST, Fast Imputation of Spatially-resolved transcriptomes by graph-regularized Tensor completion. We first model sptRNA-seq data as a 3-way sparse tensor in genes (p-mode) and the (x, y) spatial coordinates (x-mode and y-mode) of the observed gene expressions, and then consider the imputation of the unobserved entries or fibers as a tensor completion problem in Canonical Polyadic Decomposition (CPD) form. To improve the imputation of highly sparse sptRNA-seq data, we also introduce a protein-protein interaction network to add prior knowledge of gene functions, and a spatial graph to capture the the spatial relations among the capture spots. The tensor completion model is then regularized by a Cartesian product graph of protein-protein interaction network and the spatial graph to capture the high-order relations in the tensor. In the experiments, FIST was tested on ten 10x Genomics Visium spatial transcriptomic datasets of different tissue sections with cross-validation among the known entries in the imputation. FIST significantly outperformed the state-of-the-art methods for single-cell RNAseq data imputation. We also demonstrate that both the spatial graph and PPI network play an important role in improving the imputation. In a case study, we further analyzed the gene clusters obtained from the imputed gene expressions to show that the imputations by FIST indeed capture the spatial characteristics in the gene expressions and reveal functions that are highly relevant to three different kinds of tissues in mouse kidney.",33826608,PMC8055040,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008218,10
Global preamplification simplifies targeted mRNA quantification,"The need to perform gene expression profiling using next generation sequencing and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) on small sample sizes and single cells is rapidly expanding. However, to analyse few molecules, preamplification is required. Here, we studied global and target-specific preamplification using 96 optimised qPCR assays. To evaluate the preamplification strategies, we monitored the reactions in real-time using SYBR Green I detection chemistry followed by melting curve analysis. Next, we compared yield and reproducibility of global preamplification to that of target-specific preamplification by qPCR using the same amount of total RNA. Global preamplification generated 9.3-fold lower yield and 1.6-fold lower reproducibility than target-specific preamplification. However, the performance of global preamplification is sufficient for most downstream applications and offers several advantages over target-specific preamplification. To demonstrate the potential of global preamplification we analysed the expression of 15 genes in 60 single cells. In conclusion, we show that global preamplification simplifies targeted gene expression profiling of small sample sizes by a flexible workflow. We outline the pros and cons for global preamplification compared to target-specific preamplification.",28332609,PMC5362892,10.1038/srep45219,15
Reconstructing complex lineage trees from scRNA-seq data using MERLoT,"Advances in single-cell transcriptomics techniques are revolutionizing studies of cellular differentiation and heterogeneity. It has become possible to track the trajectory of thousands of genes across the cellular lineage trees that represent the temporal emergence of cell types during dynamic processes. However, reconstruction of cellular lineage trees with more than a few cell fates has proved challenging. We present MERLoT (https://github.com/soedinglab/merlot), a flexible and user-friendly tool to reconstruct complex lineage trees from single-cell transcriptomics data. It can impute temporal gene expression profiles along the reconstructed tree.

Approximate estimation of cell-type resolution transcriptome in bulk tissue through matrix completion,"Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has emerged as a powerful tool for uncovering cellular heterogeneity. However, the high costs associated with this technique have rendered it impractical for studying large patient cohorts. We introduce ENIGMA (Deconvolution based on Regularized Matrix Completion), a method that addresses this limitation through accurately deconvoluting bulk tissue RNA-seq data into a readout with cell-type resolution by leveraging information from scRNA-seq data. By employing a matrix completion strategy, ENIGMA minimizes the distance between the mixture transcriptome obtained with bulk sequencing and a weighted combination of cell-type-specific expression. This allows the quantification of cell-type proportions and reconstruction of cell-type-specific transcriptomes. To validate its performance, ENIGMA was tested on both simulated and real datasets, including disease-related tissues, demonstrating its ability in uncovering novel biological insights.",37529921,,10.1093/bib/bbad273,0
STGRNS: an interpretable transformer-based method for inferring gene regulatory networks from single-cell transcriptomic data,"Motivation:Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies provide an opportunity to infer cell-specific gene regulatory networks (GRNs), which is an important challenge in systems biology. Although numerous methods have been developed for inferring GRNs from scRNA-seq data, it is still a challenge to deal with cellular heterogeneity.Results:To address this challenge, we developed an interpretable transformer-based method namely STGRNS for inferring GRNs from scRNA-seq data. In this algorithm, gene expression motif technique was proposed to convert gene pairs into contiguous sub-vectors, which can be used as input for the transformer encoder. By avoiding missing phase-specific regulations in a network, gene expression motif can improve the accuracy of GRN inference for different types of scRNA-seq data. To assess the performance of STGRNS, we implemented the comparative experiments with some popular methods on extensive benchmark datasets including 21 static and 27 time-series scRNA-seq dataset. All the results show that STGRNS is superior to other comparative methods. In addition, STGRNS was also proved to be more interpretable than ""black box"" deep learning methods, which are well-known for the difficulty to explain the predictions clearly.Availability and implementation:The source code and data are available at https://github.com/zhanglab-wbgcas/STGRNS.",37004161,PMC10085635,10.1093/bioinformatics/btad165,8
scSNV-seq: high-throughput phenotyping of single nucleotide variants by coupled single-cell genotyping and transcriptomics,"CRISPR screens with single-cell transcriptomic readouts are a valuable tool to understand the effect of genetic perturbations including single nucleotide variants (SNVs) associated with diseases. Interpretation of these data is currently limited as genotypes cannot be accurately inferred from guide RNA identity alone. scSNV-seq overcomes this limitation by coupling single-cell genotyping and transcriptomics of the same cells enabling accurate and high-throughput screening of SNVs. Analysis of variants across the JAK1 gene with scSNV-seq demonstrates the importance of determining the precise genetic perturbation and accurately classifies clinically observed missense variants into three functional categories: benign, loss of function, and separation of function.",38225637,PMC10789043,10.1186/s13059-024-03169-y,2
DIRECT: Digital Microfluidics for Isolation-Free Shared Library Construction of Single-Cell DNA Methylome and Transcriptome,"Simultaneous profiling of DNA methylation and gene expression within single cells is a powerful technology to dissect complex gene regulatory network of cells. However, existing methods are based on picking a single-cell in a tube and split single-cell lysate into two parts for transcriptome and methylome library construction, respectively, which is costly and cumbersome. Here, DIRECT is proposed, a digital microfluidics-based method for high-efficiency single-cell isolation and simultaneous analysis of the methylome and transcriptome in a single library construction. The accuracy of DIRECT is demonstrated in comparison with bulk and single-omics data, and the high CpG site coverage of DIRECT allows for precise analysis of copy number variation information, enabling expansion of single cell analysis from two- to three-omics. By applying DIRECT to monitor the dynamics of mouse embryonic stem cell differentiation, the relationship between DNA methylation and changes in gene expression during differentiation is revealed. DIRECT enables accurate, robust, and reproducible single-cell DNA methylation and gene expression co-analysis in a more cost-effective, simpler library preparation and automated manner, broadening the application scenarios of single-cell multi-omics analysis and revealing a more comprehensive and fine-grained map of cellular regulatory landscapes.",37772685,,10.1002/smtd.202301075,0
Probabilistic cell/domain-type assignment of spatial transcriptomics data with SpatialAnno,"In the analysis of both single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) data, classifying cells/spots into cell/domain types is an essential analytic step for many secondary analyses. Most of the existing annotation methods have been developed for scRNA-seq datasets without any consideration of spatial information. Here, we present SpatialAnno, an efficient and accurate annotation method for spatial transcriptomics datasets, with the capability to effectively leverage a large number of non-marker genes as well as 'qualitative' information about marker genes without using a reference dataset. Uniquely, SpatialAnno estimates low-dimensional embeddings for a large number of non-marker genes via a factor model while promoting spatial smoothness among neighboring spots via a Potts model. Using both simulated and four real spatial transcriptomics datasets from the 10x Visium, ST, Slide-seqV1/2, and seqFISH platforms, we showcase the method's improved spatial annotation accuracy, including its robustness to the inclusion of marker genes for irrelevant cell/domain types and to various degrees of marker gene misspecification.

Single-cell RNA-Seq reveals the earliest lineage specification and X chromosome dosage compensation in bovine preimplantation embryos,"Lineage specification and X chromosome dosage compensation are two crucial biological processes that occur during preimplantation embryonic development. Although extensively studied in mice, the timing and regulation of these processes remain elusive in other species, including humans. Previous studies have suggested conserved principles of human and bovine early development. This study aims to provide fundamental insights into these programs and the regulation using a bovine embryo model by employing single-cell transcriptomics and genome editing approaches. The study analyzes the transcriptomes of 286 individual cells and reveals that bovine trophectoderm/inner cell mass transcriptomes diverge at the early blastocyst stage, after cavitation but before blastocyst expansion. The study also identifies transcriptomic markers and provides the timing of lineage specification events in the bovine embryo. Importantly, we find that SOX2 is required for the first cell decision program in bovine embryos. Moreover, the study shows the occurrence of X chromosome dosage compensation from morula to late blastocyst and reveals that this compensation results from downregulation of X-linked genes in female embryonic cells. The transcriptional atlas generated by this study is expected to be widely useful in improving our understanding of mammalian early embryo development.",38363564,,10.1096/fj.202302035RR,0

"A joint deep learning model enables simultaneous batch effect correction, denoising, and clustering in single-cell transcriptomics","Recent developments of single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) technologies have led to enormous biological discoveries. As the scale of scRNA-seq studies increases, a major challenge in analysis is batch effects, which are inevitable in studies involving human tissues. Most existing methods remove batch effects in a low-dimensional embedding space. Although useful for clustering, batch effects are still present in the gene expression space, leaving downstream gene-level analysis susceptible to batch effects. Recent studies have shown that batch effect correction in the gene expression space is much harder than in the embedding space. Methods such as Seurat 3.0 rely on the mutual nearest neighbor (MNN) approach to remove batch effects in gene expression, but MNN can only analyze two batches at a time, and it becomes computationally infeasible when the number of batches is large. Here, we present CarDEC, a joint deep learning model that simultaneously clusters and denoises scRNA-seq data while correcting batch effects both in the embedding and the gene expression space. Comprehensive evaluations spanning different species and tissues showed that CarDEC outperforms Scanorama, DCA + Combat, scVI, and MNN. With CarDEC denoising, non-highly variable genes offer as much signal for clustering as the highly variable genes (HVGs), suggesting that CarDEC substantially boosted information content in scRNA-seq. We also showed that trajectory analysis using CarDEC's denoised and batch-corrected expression as input revealed marker genes and transcription factors that are otherwise obscured in the presence of batch effects. CarDEC is computationally fast, making it a desirable tool for large-scale scRNA-seq studies.",34035047,PMC8494213,10.1101/gr.271874.120,21
eSPRESSO: topological clustering of single-cell transcriptomics data to reveal informative genes for spatio-temporal architectures of cells,"Background:Bioinformatics capability to analyze spatio-temporal dynamics of gene expression is essential in understanding animal development. Animal cells are spatially organized as functional tissues where cellular gene expression data contain information that governs morphogenesis during the developmental process. Although several computational tissue reconstruction methods using transcriptomics data have been proposed, those methods have been ineffective in arranging cells in their correct positions in tissues or organs unless spatial information is explicitly provided.Results:This study demonstrates stochastic self-organizing map clustering with Markov chain Monte Carlo calculations for optimizing informative genes effectively reconstruct any spatio-temporal topology of cells from their transcriptome profiles with only a coarse topological guideline. The method, eSPRESSO (enhanced SPatial REconstruction by Stochastic Self-Organizing Map), provides a powerful in silico spatio-temporal tissue reconstruction capability, as confirmed by using human embryonic heart and mouse embryo, brain, embryonic heart, and liver lobule with generally high reproducibility (average max. accuracy = 92.0%), while revealing topologically informative genes, or spatial discriminator genes. Furthermore, eSPRESSO was used for temporal analysis of human pancreatic organoids to infer rational developmental trajectories with several candidate 'temporal' discriminator genes responsible for various cell type differentiations.Conclusions:eSPRESSO provides a novel strategy for analyzing mechanisms underlying the spatio-temporal formation of cellular organizations.",37322439,PMC10268514,10.1186/s12859-023-05355-4,0
Improved in situ sequencing for high-resolution targeted spatial transcriptomic analysis in tissue sections,"Spatial transcriptomics enables the study of localization-indexed gene expression activity in tissues, providing the transcriptional landscape that in turn indicates the potential regulatory networks of gene expression.

Here, we present improved in situ sequencing (IISS) that exploits a new probing and barcoding approach, combined with advanced image analysis pipelines for high-resolution targeted spatial gene expression profiling. We develop an improved combinatorial probe anchor ligation chemistry using a 2-base encoding strategy for barcode interrogation. The new encoding strategy results in higher signal intensity as well as improved specificity for in situ sequencing, while maintaining a streamlined analysis pipeline for targeted spatial transcriptomics. We show that IISS can be applied to both fresh frozen tissue and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections for single-cell level spatial gene expression analysis, based on which the developmental trajectory and cell-cell communication networks can also be constructed.",36796537,,10.1016/j.jgg.2023.02.004,4
Feature-weight based measurement of cancerous transcriptome using cohort-wide and sample-specific information,"Identifying cancerous samples or cells using transcriptomic data is critical for cancer related basic research, early diagnosis, and targeted therapy. However, the high transcriptional heterogeneity of cancers still hinders people from accurately recognizing cancerous transcriptome using bulk, single-cell, or spatial RNA-seq data. Here, we present a novel method named FWP (Feature Weight Pro) that helps measure cancerous transcriptome using transcriptomic data. The workflow of FWP is, first, to calculate feature weights using the training dataset, and then, for each sample in the testing dataset, calculate the feature-weight based final score by combining the cohort-wide and sample-specific information. Those two types of information are utilized through conducting weighted principal component analysis and calculating correlation perturbations. The effectiveness and superiority of FWP over other methods are shown by using bulk, single-cell, and spatial RNA-seq data of multiple cancer types. In addition, the high robustness and efficiency of FWP are also demonstrated by using different numbers of features and cells, respectively.

CPPLS-MLP: a method for constructing cell-cell communication networks and identifying related highly variable genes based on single-cell sequencing and spatial transcriptomics data,"In the growth and development of multicellular organisms, the immune processes of the immune system and the maintenance of the organism's internal environment, cell communication plays a crucial role. It exerts a significant influence on regulating internal cellular states such as gene expression and cell functionality. Currently, the mainstream methods for studying intercellular communication are focused on exploring the ligand-receptor-transcription factor and ligand-receptor-subunit scales. However, there is relatively limited research on the association between intercellular communication and highly variable genes (HVGs). As some HVGs are closely related to cell communication, accurately identifying these HVGs can enhance the accuracy of constructing cell communication networks. The rapid development of single-cell sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics technologies provides a data foundation for exploring the relationship between intercellular communication and HVGs. Therefore, we propose CPPLS-MLP, which can identify HVGs closely related to intercellular communication and further analyze the impact of Multiple Input Multiple Output cellular communication on the differential expression of these HVGs. By comparing with the commonly used method CCPLS for constructing intercellular communication networks, we validated the superior performance of our method in identifying cell-type-specific HVGs and effectively analyzing the influence of neighboring cell types on HVG expression regulation. Source codes for the CPPLS_MLP R, python packages and the related scripts are available at 'CPPLS_MLP Github [https://github.com/wuzhenao/CPPLS-MLP]'.",38678387,PMC11056015,10.1093/bib/bbae198,0
Biologically informed variational autoencoders allow predictive modeling of genetic and drug-induced perturbations,"Motivation:Variational autoencoders (VAEs) have rapidly increased in popularity in biological applications and have already successfully been used on many omic datasets. Their latent space provides a low-dimensional representation of input data, and VAEs have been applied, e.g. for clustering of single-cell transcriptomic data. However, due to their non-linear nature, the patterns that VAEs learn in the latent space remain obscure. Hence, the lower-dimensional data embedding cannot directly be related to input features.Results:To shed light on the inner workings of VAE and enable direct interpretability of the model through its structure, we designed a novel VAE, OntoVAE (Ontology guided VAE) that can incorporate any ontology in its latent space and decoder part and, thus, provide pathway or phenotype activities for the ontology terms. In this work, we demonstrate that OntoVAE can be applied in the context of predictive modeling and show its ability to predict the effects of genetic or drug-induced perturbations using different ontologies and both, bulk and single-cell transcriptomic datasets. Finally, we provide a flexible framework, which can be easily adapted to any ontology and dataset.Availability and implementation:OntoVAE is available as a python package under https://github.com/hdsu-bioquant/onto-vae.",37326971,PMC10301695,10.1093/bioinformatics/btad387,3
Visualizing the structure of RNA-seq expression data using grade of membership models,"Grade of membership models, also known as ""admixture models"", ""topic models"" or ""Latent Dirichlet Allocation"", are a generalization of cluster models that allow each sample to have membership in multiple clusters. These models are widely used in population genetics to model admixed individuals who have ancestry from multiple ""populations"", and in natural language processing to model documents having words from multiple ""topics"". Here we illustrate the potential for these models to cluster samples of RNA-seq gene expression data, measured on either bulk samples or single cells. We also provide methods to help interpret the clusters, by identifying genes that are distinctively expressed in each cluster. By applying these methods to several example RNA-seq applications we demonstrate their utility in identifying and summarizing structure and heterogeneity. Applied to data from the GTEx project on 53 human tissues, the approach highlights similarities among biologically-related tissues and identifies distinctively-expressed genes that recapitulate known biology. Applied to single-cell expression data from mouse preimplantation embryos, the approach highlights both discrete and continuous variation through early embryonic development stages, and highlights genes involved in a variety of relevant processes-from germ cell development, through compaction and morula formation, to the formation of inner cell mass and trophoblast at the blastocyst stage. The methods are implemented in the Bioconductor package CountClust.",28333934,PMC5363805,10.1371/journal.pgen.1006599,75
scPlantDB: a comprehensive database for exploring cell types and markers of plant cell atlases,"Recent advancements in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology have enabled the comprehensive profiling of gene expression patterns at the single-cell level, offering unprecedented insights into cellular diversity and heterogeneity within plant tissues. In this study, we present a systematic approach to construct a plant single-cell database, scPlantDB, which is publicly available at https://biobigdata.nju.edu.cn/scplantdb. We integrated single-cell transcriptomic profiles from 67 high-quality datasets across 17 plant species, comprising approximately 2.5 million cells. The data underwent rigorous collection, manual curation, strict quality control and standardized processing from public databases. scPlantDB offers interactive visualization of gene expression at the single-cell level, facilitating the exploration of both single-dataset and multiple-dataset analyses. It enables systematic comparison and functional annotation of markers across diverse cell types and species while providing tools to identify and compare cell types based on these markers. In summary, scPlantDB serves as a comprehensive database for investigating cell types and markers within plant cell atlases. It is a valuable resource for the plant research community.",37638765,PMC10767885,10.1093/nar/gkad706,5
ENGEP: advancing spatial transcriptomics with accurate unmeasured gene expression prediction,"Imaging-based spatial transcriptomics techniques provide valuable spatial and gene expression information at single-cell resolution. However, their current capability is restricted to profiling a limited number of genes per sample, resulting in most of the transcriptome remaining unmeasured. To overcome this challenge, we develop ENGEP, an ensemble learning-based tool that predicts unmeasured gene expression in spatial transcriptomics data by using multiple single-cell RNA sequencing datasets as references. ENGEP outperforms current state-of-the-art tools and brings biological insight by accurately predicting unmeasured genes. ENGEP has exceptional efficiency in terms of runtime and memory usage, making it scalable for analyzing large datasets.",38129866,PMC10734203,10.1186/s13059-023-03139-w,0
"Exploratory bioinformatics investigation reveals importance of ""junk"" DNA in early embryo development","Background:Instead of testing predefined hypotheses, the goal of exploratory data analysis (EDA) is to find what data can tell us. Following this strategy, we re-analyzed a large body of genomic data to study the complex gene regulation in mouse pre-implantation development (PD).Results:Starting with a single-cell RNA-seq dataset consisting of 259 mouse embryonic cells derived from zygote to blastocyst stages, we reconstructed the temporal and spatial gene expression pattern during PD. The dynamics of gene expression can be partially explained by the enrichment of transposable elements in gene promoters and the similarity of expression profiles with those of corresponding transposons. Long Terminal Repeats (LTRs) are associated with transient, strong induction of many nearby genes at the 2-4 cell stages, probably by providing binding sites for Obox and other homeobox factors. B1 and B2 SINEs (Short Interspersed Nuclear Elements) are correlated with the upregulation of thousands of nearby genes during zygotic genome activation. Such enhancer-like effects are also found for human Alu and bovine tRNA SINEs. SINEs also seem to be predictive of gene expression in embryonic stem cells (ESCs), raising the possibility that they may also be involved in regulating pluripotency. We also identified many potential transcription factors underlying PD and discussed the evolutionary necessity of transposons in enhancing genetic diversity, especially for species with longer generation time.Conclusions:Together with other recent studies, our results provide further evidence that many transposable elements may play a role in establishing the expression landscape in early embryos. It also demonstrates that exploratory bioinformatics investigation can pinpoint developmental pathways for further study, and serve as a strategy to generate novel insights from big genomic data.",28231763,PMC5324221,10.1186/s12864-017-3566-0,25
Machine learning predicts putative hematopoietic stem cells within large single-cell transcriptomics data sets,"Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are an essential source and reservoir for normal hematopoiesis, and their function is compromised in many blood disorders. HSC research has benefitted from the recent development of single-cell molecular profiling technologies, where single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) in particular has rapidly become an established method to profile HSCs and related hematopoietic populations. The classic definition of HSCs relies on transplantation assays, which have been used to validate HSC function for cell populations defined by flow cytometry. Flow cytometry information for single cells, however, is not available for many new high-throughput scRNA-seq methods, thus highlighting an urgent need for the establishment of alternative ways to pinpoint the likely HSCs within large scRNA-seq data sets. To address this, we tested a range of machine learning approaches and developed a tool, hscScore, to score single-cell transcriptomes from murine bone marrow based on their similarity to gene expression profiles of validated HSCs. We evaluated hscScore across scRNA-seq data from different laboratories, which allowed us to establish a robust method that functions across different technologies. To facilitate broad adoption of hscScore by the wider hematopoiesis community, we have made the trained model and example code freely available online. In summary, our method hscScore provides fast identification of mouse bone marrow HSCs from scRNA-seq measurements and represents a broadly useful tool for analysis of single-cell gene expression data.",31513832,PMC6900257,10.1016/j.exphem.2019.08.009,18
EnDecon: cell type deconvolution of spatially resolved transcriptomics data via ensemble learning,"Motivation:Spatially resolved gene expression profiles are the key to exploring the cell type spatial distributions and understanding the architecture of tissues. Many spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) techniques do not provide single-cell resolutions, but they measure gene expression profiles on captured locations (spots) instead, which are mixtures of potentially heterogeneous cell types. Currently, several cell-type deconvolution methods have been proposed to deconvolute SRT data. Due to the different model strategies of these methods, their deconvolution results also vary.Results:Leveraging the strengths of multiple deconvolution methods, we introduce a new weighted ensemble learning deconvolution method, EnDecon, to predict cell-type compositions on SRT data in this work. EnDecon integrates multiple base deconvolution results using a weighted optimization model to generate a more accurate result. Simulation studies demonstrate that EnDecon outperforms the competing methods and the learned weights assigned to base deconvolution methods have high positive correlations with the performances of these base methods. Applied to real datasets from different spatial techniques, EnDecon identifies multiple cell types on spots, localizes these cell types to specific spatial regions and distinguishes distinct spatial colocalization and enrichment patterns, providing valuable insights into spatial heterogeneity and regionalization of tissues.Availability and implementation:The source code is available at https://github.com/Zhangxf-ccnu/EnDecon.Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",36610709,PMC9825263,10.1093/bioinformatics/btac825,5
Reconstructing developmental trajectories using latent dynamical systems and time-resolved transcriptomics,"The snapshot nature of single-cell transcriptomics presents a challenge for studying the dynamics of cell fate decisions. Metabolic labeling and splicing can provide temporal information at single-cell level, but current methods have limitations. Here, we present a framework that overcomes these limitations: experimentally, we developed sci-FATE2, an optimized method for metabolic labeling with increased data quality, which we used to profile 45,000 embryonic stem (ES) cells differentiating into neural tube identities. Computationally, we developed a two-stage framework for dynamical modeling: VelvetVAE, a variational autoencoder (VAE) for velocity inference that outperforms all other tools tested, and VelvetSDE, a neural stochastic differential equation (nSDE) framework for simulating trajectory distributions. These recapitulate underlying dataset distributions and capture features such as decision boundaries between alternative fates and fate-specific gene expression. These methods recast single-cell analyses from descriptions of observed data to models of the dynamics that generated them, providing a framework for investigating developmental fate decisions.",38754365,,10.1016/j.cels.2024.04.004,0
Tissue RNA Integrity in Visium Spatial Protocol (Fresh Frozen Samples),"The transcriptome of a tissue can be acquired both by single-cell RNAseq (scRNA-seq) and by spatial transcriptomics (ST). The dissociation step, which is mandatory in scRNA-seq methods, might lead to the loss of fragile cells and of spatial information, thus limiting the acquisition of the tissue cellular organization. Spatial transcriptomics methods moderate the above-mentioned issues and provide single-cell transcripts detection over an intact fresh frozen tissue section. Visium platform, commercialized from 10× Genomics, provides a whole transcriptome spatial transcriptomics platform, which does not require dedicated instruments, other than those available in any pathology laboratory. In spatial transcriptomics, proper tissue handling is mandatory to preserve the morphological quality of the tissue sections and the integrity of mRNA transcripts. Proper tissue handling is critical for downstream library preparation and sequencing performance. In this chapter, we describe the most critical steps of Visium protocol on fresh frozen tissues and we provide indications on how to interpret the data obtained from the quality control analysis recommended during the workflow.",36495450,,10.1007/978-1-0716-2756-3_8,0
SURGE: uncovering context-specific genetic-regulation of gene expression from single-cell RNA sequencing using latent-factor models,"Genetic regulation of gene expression is a complex process, with genetic effects known to vary across cellular contexts such as cell types and environmental conditions. We developed SURGE, a method for unsupervised discovery of context-specific expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) from single-cell transcriptomic data. This allows discovery of the contexts or cell types modulating genetic regulation without prior knowledge. Applied to peripheral blood single-cell eQTL data, SURGE contexts capture continuous representations of distinct cell types and groupings of biologically related cell types. We demonstrate the disease-relevance of SURGE context-specific eQTLs using colocalization analysis and stratified LD-score regression.",38254214,PMC10801966,10.1186/s13059-023-03152-z,1
MTD: a unique pipeline for host and meta-transcriptome joint and integrative analyses of RNA-seq data,"Ribonucleic acid (RNA)-seq data contain not only host transcriptomes but also nonhost information that comprises transcripts from active microbiota in the host cells. Therefore, joint and integrative analyses of both host and meta-transcriptome can reveal gene expression of the microbial community in a given sample as well as the correlative and interactive dynamics of the host response to the microbiome. However, there are no convenient tools that can systemically analyze host-microbiota interactions through simultaneously quantifying the host and meta-transcriptome in the same sample at the tissue and the single-cell level. This poses a challenge for interested researchers with limited expertise in bioinformatics. Here, we developed a software pipeline that can comprehensively and synergistically analyze and correlate the host and meta-transcriptome in a single sample using bulk and single-cell RNA-seq data. This pipeline, named meta-transcriptome detector (MTD), can extensively identify and quantify microbiome, including viruses, bacteria, protozoa, fungi, plasmids and vectors, in the host cells and correlate the microbiome with the host transcriptome. MTD is easy to install and run, involving only a few lines of simple commands. It offers researchers with unique genomics insights into host responses to microorganisms.",35380623,PMC9116375,10.1093/bib/bbac111,0
Joint Bayesian estimation of cell dependence and gene associations in spatially resolved transcriptomic data,"Recent technologies such as spatial transcriptomics, enable the measurement of gene expressions at the single-cell level along with the spatial locations of these cells in the tissue. Spatial clustering of the cells provides valuable insights into the understanding of the functional organization of the tissue. However, most such clustering methods involve some dimension reduction that leads to a loss of the inherent dependency structure among genes at any spatial location in the tissue. This destroys valuable insights of gene co-expression patterns apart from possibly impacting spatial clustering performance. In spatial transcriptomics, the matrix-variate gene expression data, along with spatial coordinates of the single cells, provides information on both gene expression dependencies and cell spatial dependencies through its row and column covariances. In this work, we propose a joint Bayesian approach to simultaneously estimate these gene and spatial cell correlations. These estimates provide data summaries for downstream analyses. We illustrate our method with simulations and analysis of several real spatial transcriptomic datasets. Our work elucidates gene co-expression networks as well as clear spatial clustering patterns of the cells. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that downstream spatial-differential analysis may aid in the discovery of unknown cell types from known marker genes.",38664448,PMC11045727,10.1038/s41598-024-60002-z,0
QuickRNASeq: Guide for Pipeline Implementation and for Interactive Results Visualization,"Sequencing of transcribed RNA molecules (RNA-Seq) has been used wildly for studying cell transcriptomes in bulk or at the single-cell level (Wang et al., Nat Rev Genet, 10:57-63, 2009; Ozsolak and Milos, Nat Rev Genet, 12:87-98, 2011; Sandberg, Nat Methods, 11:22-24, 2014) and is becoming the de facto technology for investigating gene expression level changes in various biological conditions, on the time course, and under drug treatments. Furthermore, RNA-Seq data helped identify fusion genes that are related to certain cancers (Maher et al., Nature, 458:97-101, 2009). Differential gene expression before and after drug treatments provides insights to mechanism of action, pharmacodynamics of the drugs, and safety concerns (Dixit et al., Genomics, 107:178-188, 2016). Because each RNA-Seq run generates tens to hundreds of millions of short reads with size ranging from 50 to 200 bp, a tool that deciphers these short reads to an integrated and digestible analysis report is in high demand. QuickRNASeq (Zhao et al., BMC Genomics, 17:39-53, 2016) is an application for large-scale RNA-Seq data analysis and real-time interactive visualization of complex data sets. This application automates the use of several of the best open-source tools to efficiently generate user friendly, easy to share, and ready to publish report. Figures in this protocol illustrate some of the interactive plots produced by QuickRNASeq. The visualization features of the application have been further improved since its first publication in early 2016. The original QuickRNASeq publication (Zhao et al., BMC Genomics, 17:39-53, 2016) provided details of background, software selection, and implementation. Here, we outline the steps required to implement QuickRNASeq in user's own environment, as well as demonstrate some basic yet powerful utilities of the advanced interactive visualization modules in the report.",29508289,,10.1007/978-1-4939-7710-9_4,3
Differential gene expression analysis of spatial transcriptomic experiments using spatial mixed models,"Spatial transcriptomics (ST) assays represent a revolution in how the architecture of tissues is studied by allowing for the exploration of cells in their spatial context. A common element in the analysis is delineating tissue domains or ""niches"" followed by detecting differentially expressed genes to infer the biological identity of the tissue domains or cell types. However, many studies approach differential expression analysis by using statistical approaches often applied in the analysis of non-spatial scRNA data (e.g., two-sample t-tests, Wilcoxon's rank sum test), hence neglecting the spatial dependency observed in ST data. In this study, we show that applying linear mixed models with spatial correlation structures using spatial random effects effectively accounts for the spatial autocorrelation and reduces inflation of type-I error rate observed in non-spatial based differential expression testing. We also show that spatial linear models with an exponential correlation structure provide a better fit to the ST data as compared to non-spatial models, particularly for spatially resolved technologies that quantify expression at finer scales (i.e., single-cell resolution).",38744956,PMC11094014,10.1038/s41598-024-61758-0,0
"Profiling Transcriptional Heterogeneity with Seq-Well S3: A Low-Cost, Portable, High-Fidelity Platform for Massively Parallel Single-Cell RNA-Seq","Seq-Well is a high-throughput, picowell-based single-cell RNA-seq technology that can be used to simultaneously profile the transcriptomes of thousands of cells (Gierahn et al. Nat Methods 14(4):395-398, 2017). Relative to its reverse-emulsion-droplet-based counterparts, Seq-Well addresses key cost, portability, and scalability limitations. Recently, we introduced an improved molecular biology for Seq-Well to enhance the information content that can be captured from individual cells using the platform. This update, which we call Seq-Well S3(S3: Second-Strand Synthesis), incorporates a second-strand-synthesis step after reverse transcription to boost the detection of cellular transcripts normally missed when running the original Seq-Well protocol (Hughes et al. Immunity 53(4):878-894.e7, 2020). This chapter provides details and tips on how to perform Seq-Well S3, along with general pointers on how to subsequently analyze the resultant single-cell RNA-seq data.",36495445,,10.1007/978-1-0716-2756-3_3,2
Gene-expression memory-based prediction of cell lineages from scRNA-seq datasets,"Assigning single cell transcriptomes to cellular lineage trees by lineage tracing has transformed our understanding of differentiation during development, regeneration, and disease. However, lineage tracing is technically demanding, often restricted in time-resolution, and most scRNA-seq datasets are devoid of lineage information. Here we introduce Gene Expression Memory-based Lineage Inference (GEMLI), a computational tool allowing to robustly identify small to medium-sized cell lineages solely from scRNA-seq datasets. GEMLI allows to study heritable gene expression, to discriminate symmetric and asymmetric cell fate decisions and to reconstruct individual multicellular structures from pooled scRNA-seq datasets. In human breast cancer biopsies, GEMLI reveals previously unknown gene expression changes at the onset of cancer invasiveness. The universal applicability of GEMLI allows studying the role of small cell lineages in a wide range of physiological and pathological contexts, notably in vivo. GEMLI is available as an R package on GitHub ( https://github.com/UPSUTER/GEMLI ).",38553478,PMC10980719,10.1038/s41467-024-47158-y,0
Transcriptional profiling of single fiber cells in a transgenic paradigm of an inherited childhood cataract reveals absence of molecular heterogeneity,"Our recent single-cell transcriptomic analysis has demonstrated that heterogeneous transcriptional activity attends molecular transition from the nascent to terminally differentiated fiber cells in the developing mouse lens. To understand the role of transcriptional heterogeneity in terminal differentiation and the functional phenotype (transparency) of this tissue, here we present a single-cell analysis of the developing lens, in a transgenic paradigm of an inherited pathology, known as the lamellar cataract. Cataracts hinder transmission of light into the eye. Lamellar cataract is the most prevalent bilateral childhood cataract. In this disease of early infancy, initially, the opacities remain confined to a few fiber cells, thus presenting an opportunity to investigate early molecular events that lead to cataractogenesis. We used a previously established paradigm that faithfully recapitulates this disease in transgenic mice. About 500 single fiber cells, manually isolated from a 2-day-old transgenic lens were interrogated individually for the expression of all known 17 crystallins and 78 other relevant genes using a Biomark HD (Fluidigm). We find that fiber cells from spatially and developmentally discrete regions of the transgenic (cataract) lens show remarkable absence of the heterogeneity of gene expression. Importantly, the molecular variability of cortical fiber cells, the hallmark of the WT lens, is absent in the transgenic cataract, suggesting absence of specific cell-type(s). Interestingly, we find a repetitive pattern of gene activity in progressive states of differentiation in the transgenic lens. This molecular dysfunction portends pathology much before the physical manifestations of the disease.",31243103,PMC6746439,10.1074/jbc.RA119.008853,4
Differentiation is accompanied by a progressive loss in transcriptional memory,"Background:Cell differentiation requires the integration of two opposite processes, a stabilizing cellular memory, especially at the transcriptional scale, and a burst of gene expression variability which follows the differentiation induction. Therefore, the actual capacity of a cell to undergo phenotypic change during a differentiation process relies upon a modification in this balance which favors change-inducing gene expression variability. However, there are no experimental data providing insight on how fast the transcriptomes of identical cells would diverge on the scale of the very first two cell divisions during the differentiation process.Results:In order to quantitatively address this question, we developed different experimental methods to recover the transcriptomes of related cells, after one and two divisions, while preserving the information about their lineage at the scale of a single cell division. We analyzed the transcriptomes of related cells from two differentiation biological systems (human CD34+ cells and T2EC chicken primary erythrocytic progenitors) using two different single-cell transcriptomics technologies (scRT-qPCR and scRNA-seq).Conclusions:We identified that the gene transcription profiles of differentiating sister cells are more similar to each other than to those of non-related cells of the same type, sharing the same environment and undergoing similar biological processes. More importantly, we observed greater discrepancies between differentiating sister cells than between self-renewing sister cells. Furthermore, a progressive increase in this divergence from first generation to second generation was observed when comparing differentiating cousin cells to self renewing cousin cells. Our results are in favor of a gradual erasure of transcriptional memory during the differentiation process.",38468285,PMC10929117,10.1186/s12915-024-01846-9,0
GTADC: A Graph-Based Method for Inferring Cell Spatial Distribution in Cancer Tissues,"The heterogeneity of tumors poses a challenge for understanding cell interactions and constructing complex ecosystems within cancer tissues. Current research strategies integrate spatial transcriptomics (ST) and single-cell sequencing (scRNA-seq) data to thoroughly analyze this intricate system. However, traditional deep learning methods using scRNA-seq data tend to filter differentially expressed genes through statistical methods. In the context of cancer tissues, where cancer cells exhibit significant differences in gene expression compared to normal cells, this heterogeneity renders traditional analysis methods incapable of accurately capturing differences between cell types. Therefore, we propose a graph-based deep learning method, GTADC, which utilizes Silhouette scores to precisely capture genes with significant expression differences within each cell type, enhancing the accuracy of gene selection. Compared to traditional methods, GTADC not only considers the expression similarity of genes within their respective clusters but also comprehensively leverages information from the overall clustering structure. The introduction of graph structure effectively captures spatial relationships and topological structures between the two types of data, enabling GTADC to more accurately and comprehensively resolve the spatial composition of different cell types within tissues. This refinement allows GTADC to intricately reconstruct the cellular spatial composition, offering a precise solution for inferring cell spatial composition. This method allows for early detection of potential cancer cell regions within tissues, assessing their quantity and spatial information in cell populations. We aim to achieve a preliminary estimation of cancer occurrence and development, contributing to a deeper understanding of early-stage cancer and providing potential support for early cancer diagnosis.",38672453,PMC11048052,10.3390/biom14040436,0
stAPAminer: Mining Spatial Patterns of Alternative Polyadenylation for Spatially Resolved Transcriptomic Studies,"Alternative polyadenylation (APA) contributes to transcriptome complexity and gene expression regulation and has been implicated in various cellular processes and diseases. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has enabled the profiling of APA at the single-cell level; however, the spatial information of cells is not preserved in scRNA-seq. Alternatively, spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies provide opportunities to decipher the spatial context of the transcriptomic landscape. Pioneering studies have revealed potential spatially variable genes and/or splice isoforms; however, the pattern of APA usage in spatial contexts remains unappreciated. In this study, we developed a toolkit called stAPAminer for mining spatial patterns of APA from spatially barcoded ST data. APA sites were identified and quantified from the ST data. In particular, an imputation model based on the k-nearest neighbors algorithm was designed to recover APA signals, and then APA genes with spatial patterns of APA usage variation were identified. By analyzing well-established ST data of the mouse olfactory bulb (MOB), we presented a detailed view of spatial APA usage across morphological layers of the MOB. We compiled a comprehensive list of genes with spatial APA dynamics and obtained several major spatial expression patterns that represent spatial APA dynamics in different morphological layers. By extending this analysis to two additional replicates of the MOB ST data, we observed that the spatial APA patterns of several genes were reproducible among replicates. stAPAminer employs the power of ST to explore the transcriptional atlas of spatial APA patterns with spatial resolution. This toolkit is available at https://github.com/BMILAB/stAPAminer and https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/biocode/tools/BT007320.",36669641,PMC10787175,10.1016/j.gpb.2023.01.003,0
SPCS: a spatial and pattern combined smoothing method for spatial transcriptomic expression,"High-dimensional, localized ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing is now possible owing to recent developments in spatial transcriptomics (ST). ST is based on highly multiplexed sequence analysis and uses barcodes to match the sequenced reads to their respective tissue locations. ST expression data suffer from high noise and dropout events; however, smoothing techniques have the promise to improve the data interpretability prior to performing downstream analyses. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data similarly suffer from these limitations, and smoothing methods developed for scRNA-seq can only utilize associations in transcriptome space (also known as one-factor smoothing methods). Since they do not account for spatial relationships, these one-factor smoothing methods cannot take full advantage of ST data. In this study, we present a novel two-factor smoothing technique, spatial and pattern combined smoothing (SPCS), that employs the k-nearest neighbor (kNN) technique to utilize information from transcriptome and spatial relationships. By performing SPCS on multiple ST slides from pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and simulated high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) datasets, smoothed ST slides have better separability, partition accuracy and biological interpretability than the ones smoothed by preexisting one-factor methods.

Spatial patterns of gene expression are unveiled in the chick primitive streak by ordering single-cell transcriptomes,"During vertebrate development, progenitor cells give rise to tissues and organs through a complex choreography that commences at gastrulation. A hallmark event of gastrulation is the formation of the primitive streak, a linear assembly of cells along the anterior-posterior (AP) axis of the developing organism. To examine the primitive streak at a single-cell resolution, we measured the transcriptomes of individual chick cells from the streak or the surrounding tissue (the rest of the area pellucida) in Hamburger-Hamilton stage 4 embryos. The single-cell transcriptomes were then ordered by the statistical method Wave-Crest to deduce both the relative position along the AP axis and the prospective lineage of single cells. The ordered transcriptomes reveal intricate patterns of gene expression along the primitive streak.",29678445,,10.1016/j.ydbio.2018.04.007,4
Co-staining with Fluorescent Antibodies and Antibody-Derived Tags for Cell Sorting Prior to CITE-Seq,"The paired detection of the transcriptome and proteome at single-cell resolution provides exquisite insight to immune mechanisms in health and disease.

Our protocol provides step-by-step guidance on co-staining cells with both fluorescent antibodies and ADTs simultaneously, instructions on cell sorting and an overview of the single-cell capture workflow using the BD Rhapsody™ system.

scAWMV: an adaptively weighted multi-view learning framework for the integrative analysis of parallel scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data,"Motivation:Technological advances have enabled us to profile single-cell multi-omics data from the same cells, providing us with an unprecedented opportunity to understand the cellular phenotype and links to its genotype. The available protocols and multi-omics datasets [including parallel single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single-cell ATAC sequencing (scATAC-seq) data profiled from the same cell] are growing increasingly. However, such data are highly sparse and tend to have high level of noise, making data analysis challenging. The methods that integrate the multi-omics data can potentially improve the capacity of revealing the cellular heterogeneity.Results:We propose an adaptively weighted multi-view learning (scAWMV) method for the integrative analysis of parallel scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data profiled from the same cell. scAWMV considers both the difference in importance across different modalities in multi-omics data and the biological connection of the features in the scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data. It generates biologically meaningful low-dimensional representations for the transcriptomic and epigenomic profiles via unsupervised learning. Application to four real datasets demonstrates that our framework scAWMV is an efficient method to dissect cellular heterogeneity for single-cell multi-omics data.Availability and implementation:The software and datasets are available at https://github.com/pengchengzeng/scAWMV.Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",36383176,PMC9805575,10.1093/bioinformatics/btac739,1
Codependency and mutual exclusivity for gene community detection from sparse single-cell transcriptome data,"Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) can be used to characterize cellular heterogeneity in thousands of cells. The reconstruction of a gene network based on coexpression patterns is a fundamental task in scRNA-seq analyses, and the mutual exclusivity of gene expression can be critical for understanding such heterogeneity. Here, we propose an approach for detecting communities from a genetic network constructed on the basis of coexpression properties. The community-based comparison of multiple coexpression networks enables the identification of functionally related gene clusters that cannot be fully captured through differential gene expression-based analysis. We also developed a novel metric referred to as the exclusively expressed index (EEI) that identifies mutually exclusive gene pairs from sparse scRNA-seq data. EEI quantifies and ranks the exclusive expression levels of all gene pairs from binary expression patterns while maintaining robustness against a low sequencing depth. We applied our methods to glioblastoma scRNA-seq data and found that gene communities were partially conserved after serum stimulation despite a considerable number of differentially expressed genes. We also demonstrate that the identification of mutually exclusive gene sets with EEI can improve the sensitivity of capturing cellular heterogeneity. Our methods complement existing approaches and provide new biological insights, even for a large, sparse dataset, in the single-cell analysis field.",34291282,PMC8501962,10.1093/nar/gkab601,4
Integrating imaging-based classification and transcriptomics for quality assessment of human oocytes according to their reproductive efficiency,"Purpose:Utilising non-invasive imaging parameters to assess human oocyte fertilisation, development and implantation; and their influence on transcriptomic profiles.Methods:A ranking tool was designed using imaging data from 957 metaphase II stage oocytes retrieved from 102 patients undergoing ART. Hoffman modulation contrast microscopy was conducted with an Olympus IX53 microscope. Images were acquired prior to ICSI and processed using ImageJ for optical density and grey-level co-occurrence matrices texture analysis. Single-cell RNA sequencing of twenty-three mature oocytes classified according to their competence was performed.Result(s):Overall fertilisation, blastulation and implantation rates were 73.0%, 62.6% and 50.8%, respectively. Three different algorithms were produced using binary logistic regression methods based on ""optimal"" quartiles, resulting in an accuracy of prediction of 76.6%, 67% and 80.7% for fertilisation, blastulation and implantation. Optical density, gradient, inverse difference moment (homogeneity) and entropy (structural complexity) were the parameters with highest predictive properties. The ranking tool showed high sensitivity (68.9-90.8%) but with limited specificity (26.5-62.5%) for outcome prediction. Furthermore, five differentially expressed genes were identified when comparing ""good"" versus ""poor"" competent oocytes.Conclusion(s):Imaging properties can be used as a tool to assess differences in the ooplasm and predict laboratory and clinical outcomes. Transcriptomic analysis suggested that oocytes with lower competence may have compromised cell cycle either by non-reparable DNA damage or insufficient ooplasmic maturation. Further development of algorithms based on image parameters is encouraged, with an increased balanced cohort and validated prospectively in multicentric studies.",37610606,PMC10643756,10.1007/s10815-023-02911-y,0
Plant PhysioSpace: a robust tool to compare stress response across plant species,"Generalization of transcriptomics results can be achieved by comparison across experiments. This generalization is based on integration of interrelated transcriptomics studies into a compendium. Such a focus on the bigger picture enables both characterizations of the fate of an organism and distinction between generic and specific responses. Numerous methods for analyzing transcriptomics datasets exist. Yet, most of these methods focus on gene-wise dimension reduction to obtain marker genes and gene sets for, for example, pathway analysis. Relying only on isolated biological modules might result in missing important confounders and relevant contexts. We developed a method called Plant PhysioSpace, which enables researchers to compute experimental conditions across species and platforms without a priori reducing the reference information to specific gene sets. Plant PhysioSpace extracts physiologically relevant signatures from a reference dataset (i.e. a collection of public datasets) by integrating and transforming heterogeneous reference gene expression data into a set of physiology-specific patterns. New experimental data can be mapped to these patterns, resulting in similarity scores between the acquired data and the extracted compendium. Because of its robustness against platform bias and noise, Plant PhysioSpace can function as an inter-species or cross-platform similarity measure. We have demonstrated its success in translating stress responses between different species and platforms, including single-cell technologies. We have also implemented two R packages, one software and one data package, and a Shiny web application to facilitate access to our method and precomputed models.",34734276,PMC8566309,10.1093/plphys/kiab325,3
Deciphering the Immune Microenvironment at the Forefront of Tumor Aggressiveness by Constructing a Regulatory Network with Single-Cell and Spatial Transcriptomic Data,"The heterogeneity and intricate cellular architecture of complex cellular ecosystems play a crucial role in the progression and therapeutic response of cancer. Understanding the regulatory relationships of malignant cells at the invasive front of the tumor microenvironment (TME) is important to explore the heterogeneity of the TME and its role in disease progression. In this study, we inferred malignant cells at the invasion front by analyzing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics (ST) data of ER-positive (ER+) breast cancer patients. In addition, we developed a software pipeline for constructing intercellular gene regulatory networks (IGRNs), which help to reduce errors generated by single-cell communication analysis and increase the confidence of selected cell communication signals. Based on the constructed IGRN between malignant cells at the invasive front of the TME and the immune cells of ER+ breast cancer patients, we found that a high expression of the transcription factors FOXA1 and EZH2 played a key role in driving tumor progression. Meanwhile, elevated levels of their downstream target genes (ESR1 and CDKN1A) were associated with poor prognosis of breast cancer patients. This study demonstrates a bioinformatics workflow of combining scRNA-seq and ST data; in addition, the study provides the software pipelines for constructing IGRNs automatically (cIGRN). This strategy will help decipher cancer progression by revealing bidirectional signaling between invasive frontline malignant tumor cells and immune cells, and the selected signaling molecules in the regulatory network may serve as biomarkers for mechanism studies or therapeutic targets.",38254989,PMC10815467,10.3390/genes15010100,0
On the use of QDE-SVM for gene feature selection and cell type classification from scRNA-seq data,"Cell type identification is one of the fundamental tasks in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) studies. It is a key step to facilitate downstream interpretations such as differential expression, trajectory inference, etc. scRNA-seq data contains technical variations that could affect the interpretation of the cell types. Therefore, gene selection, also known as feature selection in data science, plays an important role in selecting informative genes for scRNA-seq cell type identification. Generally speaking, feature selection methods are categorized into filter-, wrapper-, and embedded-based approaches. From the existing literature, methods from filter- and embedded-based approaches are widely applied in scRNA-seq gene selection tasks. The wrapper-based method that gives promising results in other fields has yet been extensively utilized for selecting gene features from scRNA-seq data; in addition, most of the existing wrapper methods used in this field are clustering instead of classification-based. With a large number of annotated data available today, this study applied a classification-based approach as an alternative to the clustering-based wrapper method. In our work, a quantum-inspired differential evolution (QDE) wrapped with a classification method was introduced to select a subset of genes from twelve well-known scRNA-seq transcriptomic datasets to identify cell types. In particular, the QDE was combined with different machine-learning (ML) classifiers namely logistic regression, decision tree, support vector machine (SVM) with linear and radial basis function kernels, as well as extreme learning machine. The linear SVM wrapped with QDE, namely QDE-SVM, was chosen by referring to the feature selection results from the experiment. QDE-SVM showed a superior cell type classification performance among QDE wrapping with other ML classifiers as well as the recent wrapper methods (i.e., FSCAM, SSD-LAHC, MA-HS, and BSF). QDE-SVM achieved an average accuracy of 0.9559, while the other wrapper methods achieved average accuracies in the range of 0.8292 to 0.8872.",37856458,PMC10586655,10.1371/journal.pone.0292961,0
ddSeeker: a tool for processing Bio-Rad ddSEQ single cell RNA-seq data,"Background:New single-cell isolation technologies are facilitating studies on the transcriptomics of individual cells.

Accurate single-molecule spot detection for image-based spatial transcriptomics with weakly supervised deep learning,"Image-based spatial transcriptomics methods enable transcriptome-scale gene expression measurements with spatial information but require complex, manually tuned analysis pipelines.

Inferring gene regulatory networks from single-cell transcriptomics based on graph embedding,"Motivation:Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) encode gene regulation in living organisms, and have become a critical tool to understand complex biological processes. However, due to the dynamic and complex nature of gene regulation, inferring GRNs from scRNA-seq data is still a challenging task. Existing computational methods usually focus on the close connections between genes, and ignore the global structure and distal regulatory relationships.Results:In this study, we develop a supervised deep learning framework, IGEGRNS, to infer GRNs from scRNA-seq data based on graph embedding. In the framework, contextual information of genes is captured by GraphSAGE, which aggregates gene features and neighborhood structures to generate low-dimensional embedding for genes. Then, the k most influential nodes in the whole graph are filtered through Top-k pooling. Finally, potential regulatory relationships between genes are predicted by stacking CNNs. Compared with nine competing supervised and unsupervised methods, our method achieves better performance on six time-series scRNA-seq datasets.Availability and implementation:Our method IGEGRNS is implemented in Python using the Pytorch machine learning library, and it is freely available at https://github.com/DHUDBlab/IGEGRNS.",38810116,PMC11142726,10.1093/bioinformatics/btae291,0
A Sensitive and Integrated Approach to Profile Messenger RNA from Samples with Low Cell Numbers,"Transcriptomic profiling by RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) represents the preferred approach to measure genome-wide gene expression for understanding cellular function, tissue development, disease pathogenesis, as well as to identify potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets. For samples with small cell numbers, multiple methods have been described to increase the efficiency of library preparation and to reduce hands-on time and costs. This chapter reviews our approach, which combines flow cytometry and the most recent high-resolution techniques to perform RNA-Seq for samples with low cell numbers as well as for single-cell samples. Our approach reduces technical variability while increasing sensitivity and efficiency.

Protocol for Single-Nucleus Transcriptomics of Diploid and Tetraploid Cardiomyocytes in Murine Hearts,"Murine cardiomyocytes undergo proliferation, multinucleation, and polyploidization during the first 3 weeks of postnatal life, resulting in a mixture of diploid and tetraploid cardiomyocytes in the heart. Understanding the molecular differences between diploid and tetraploid cardiomyocytes from these processes has been limited due to lack of unique markers and their heterogenous origins.

Lineage and ecology define liver tumor evolution in response to treatment,"A tumor ecosystem constantly evolves over time in the face of immune predation or therapeutic intervention, resulting in treatment failure and tumor progression. Here, we present a single-cell transcriptome-based strategy to determine the evolution of longitudinal tumor biopsies from liver cancer patients by measuring cellular lineage and ecology. We construct a lineage and ecological score as joint dynamics of tumor cells and their microenvironments. Tumors may be classified into four main states in the lineage-ecological space, which are associated with clinical outcomes. Analysis of longitudinal samples reveals the evolutionary trajectory of tumors in response to treatment.

"A Primer on Preprocessing, Visualization, Clustering, and Phenotyping of Barcode-Based Spatial Transcriptomics Data","Recent developments in spatially resolved transcriptomics (ST) have resulted in a large number of studies characterizing the architecture of tissues, the spatial distribution of cell types, and their interactions. Furthermore, ST promises to enable the discovery of more accurate drug targets while also providing a better understanding of the etiology and evolution of complex diseases. The analysis of ST brings similar challenges as seen in other gene expression assays such as scRNA-seq; however, there is the additional spatial information that warrants the development of suitable algorithms for the quality control, preprocessing, visualization, and other discovery-enabling approaches (e.g., clustering, cell phenotyping). In this chapter, we review some of the existing algorithms to perform these analytical tasks and highlight some of the unmet analytical challenges in the analysis of ST data.

A Hands-On Guide to Generate Spatial Gene Expression Profiles by Integrating scRNA-seq and 3D-Reconstructed Microscope-Based Plant Structures,"Transcriptome profiles of individual cells in the plant are strongly dependent on their relative position. Cell differentiation is associated with tissue-specific transcriptomic changes. For that reason, it is important to study gene expression changes in a spatial context, and therefore to link those to potential morphological changes over developmental time. Even though great experimental advances have been made in recording spatial gene expression profiles, those attempts are limited in the plant field. New computational approaches attempt to solve this problem by integrating spatial expression profiles of few marker genes with single-cell/single-nuclei RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) methodologies. In this chapter, we provide a practical guide on how to predict gene expression patterns in a 3D plant structure by combining scRNA-seq data and 3D microscope-based reconstructed expression profiles of a small set of reference genes. We also show how to visualize these results.",37540378,,10.1007/978-1-0716-3299-4_27,0
Opto-combinatorial indexing enables high-content transcriptomics by linking cell images and transcriptomes,"We introduce a simple integrated analysis method that links cellular phenotypic behaviour with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) by utilizing a combination of optical indices from cells and hydrogel beads. With our method, the combinations, referred to as joint colour codes, enable the linkviamatching the optical combinations measured by conventional epi-fluorescence microscopy with the concatenated DNA molecular barcodes created by cell-hydrogel bead pairs and sequenced by next-generation sequencing. We validated our approach by demonstrating an accurate link between the cell image and scRNA-seq with mixed species experiments, longitudinal cell tagging by electroporation and lipofection, and gene expression analysis. Furthermore, we extended our approach to multiplexed chemical transcriptomics, which enabled us to identify distinct phenotypic behaviours in HeLa cells treated with various concentrations of paclitaxel, and determine the corresponding gene regulation associated with the formation of a multipolar spindle.",38506394,,10.1039/d3lc00866e,0
Parameter tuning is a key part of dimensionality reduction via deep variational autoencoders for single cell RNA transcriptomics,"Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a powerful tool to profile the transcriptomes of a large number of individual cells at a high resolution. These data usually contain measurements of gene expression for many genes in thousands or tens of thousands of cells, though some datasets now reach the million-cell mark. Projecting high-dimensional scRNA-seq data into a low dimensional space aids downstream analysis and data visualization. Many recent preprints accomplish this using variational autoencoders (VAE), generative models that learn underlying structure of data by compress it into a constrained, low dimensional space. The low dimensional spaces generated by VAEs have revealed complex patterns and novel biological signals from large-scale gene expression data and drug response predictions. Here, we evaluate a simple VAE approach for gene expression data, Tybalt, by training and measuring its performance on sets of simulated scRNA-seq data. We find a number of counter-intuitive performance features: i.e., deeper neural networks can struggle when datasets contain more observations under some parameter configurations. We show that these methods are highly sensitive to parameter tuning: when tuned, the performance of the Tybalt model, which was not optimized for scRNA-seq data, outperforms other popular dimension reduction approaches - PCA, ZIFA, UMAP and t-SNE. On the other hand, without tuning performance can also be remarkably poor on the same data. Our results should discourage authors and reviewers from relying on self-reported performance comparisons to evaluate the relative value of contributions in this area at this time. Instead, we recommend that attempts to compare or benchmark autoencoder methods for scRNA-seq data be performed by disinterested third parties or by methods developers only on unseen benchmark data that are provided to all participants simultaneously because the potential for performance differences due to unequal parameter tuning is so high.",30963075,PMC6417816,,25
stDiff: a diffusion model for imputing spatial transcriptomics through single-cell transcriptomics,"Spatial transcriptomics (ST) has become a powerful tool for exploring the spatial organization of gene expression in tissues. Imaging-based methods, though offering superior spatial resolutions at the single-cell level, are limited in either the number of imaged genes or the sensitivity of gene detection. Existing approaches for enhancing ST rely on the similarity between ST cells and reference single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) cells. In contrast, we introduce stDiff, which leverages relationships between gene expression abundance in scRNA-seq data to enhance ST. stDiff employs a conditional diffusion model, capturing gene expression abundance relationships in scRNA-seq data through two Markov processes: one introducing noise to transcriptomics data and the other denoising to recover them. The missing portion of ST is predicted by incorporating the original ST data into the denoising process. In our comprehensive performance evaluation across 16 datasets, utilizing multiple clustering and similarity metrics, stDiff stands out for its exceptional ability to preserve topological structures among cells, positioning itself as a robust solution for cell population identification. Moreover, stDiff's enhancement outcomes closely mirror the actual ST data within the batch space. Across diverse spatial expression patterns, our model accurately reconstructs them, delineating distinct spatial boundaries. This highlights stDiff's capability to unify the observed and predicted segments of ST data for subsequent analysis. We anticipate that stDiff, with its innovative approach, will contribute to advancing ST imputation methodologies.",38628114,PMC11021815,10.1093/bib/bbae171,0

Unravelling spatial gene associations with SEAGAL: a Python package for spatial transcriptomics data analysis and visualization,"Summary:In the era where transcriptome profiling moves toward single-cell and spatial resolutions, the traditional co-expression analysis lacks the power to fully utilize such rich information to unravel spatial gene associations.

New generative methods for single-cell transcriptome data in bulk RNA sequence deconvolution,"Numerous methods for bulk RNA sequence deconvolution have been developed to identify cellular targets of diseases by understanding the composition of cell types in disease-related tissues. However, issues of heterogeneity in gene expression between subjects and the shortage of reference single-cell RNA sequence data remain to achieve accurate bulk deconvolution. In our study, we investigated whether a new data generative method named sc-CMGAN and benchmarking generative methods (Copula, CTGAN and TVAE) could solve these issues and improve the bulk deconvolutions. We also evaluated the robustness of sc-CMGAN using three deconvolution methods and four public datasets. In almost all conditions, the generative methods contributed to improved deconvolution. Notably, sc-CMGAN outperformed the benchmarking methods and demonstrated higher robustness. This study is the first to examine the impact of data augmentation on bulk deconvolution.

The reduction of gene expression variability from single cells to populations follows simple statistical laws,"Recent studies on single cells and population transcriptomics have revealed striking differences in global gene expression distributions. Single cells display highly variable expressions between cells, while cell populations present deterministic global patterns. The mechanisms governing the reduction of transcriptome-wide variability over cell ensemble size, however, remain largely unknown. To investigate transcriptome-wide variability of single cells to different sizes of cell populations, we examined RNA-Seq datasets of 6 mammalian cell types. Our statistical analyses show, for each cell type, increasing cell ensemble size reduces scatter in transcriptome-wide expressions and noise (variance over square mean) values, with corresponding increases in Pearson and Spearman correlations. Next, accounting for technical variability by the removal of lowly expressed transcripts, we demonstrate that transcriptome-wide variability reduces, approximating the law of large numbers. Subsequent analyses reveal that the entire gene expressions of cell populations and only the highly expressed portion of single cells are Gaussian distributed, following the central limit theorem.",25554103,,10.1016/j.ygeno.2014.12.007,17
"STOmicsDB: a comprehensive database for spatial transcriptomics data sharing, analysis and visualization","Recent technological developments in spatial transcriptomics allow researchers to measure gene expression of cells and their spatial locations at the single-cell level, generating detailed biological insight into biological processes.

A Personalized Low-Rank Subspace Clustering Method Based on Locality and Similarity Constraints for scRNA-seq Data Analysis,"Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology can provide expression profile of single cells, which propels biological research into a new chapter. Clustering individual cells based on their transcriptome is a critical objective of scRNA-seq data analysis. However, the high-dimensional, sparse and noisy nature of scRNA-seq data pose a challenge to single-cell clustering. Therefore, it is urgent to develop a clustering method targeting scRNA-seq data characteristics. Due to its powerful subspace learning capability and robustness to noise, the subspace segmentation method based on low-rank representation (LRR) is broadly used in clustering researches and achieves satisfactory results. In view of this, we propose a personalized low-rank subspace clustering method, namely PLRLS, to learn more accurate subspace structures from both global and local perspectives. Specifically, we first introduce the local structure constraint to capture the local structure information of the data, while helping our method to obtain better inter-cluster separability and intra-cluster compactness. Then, in order to retain the important similarity information that is ignored by the LRR model, we utilize the fractional function to extract similarity information between cells, and introduce this information as the similarity constraint into the LRR framework. The fractional function is an efficient similarity measure designed for scRNA-seq data, which has theoretical and practical implications. In the end, based on the LRR matrix learned from PLRLS, we perform downstream analyses on real scRNA-seq datasets, including spectral clustering, visualization and marker gene identification. Comparative experiments show that the proposed method achieves superior clustering accuracy and robustness.",37027680,,10.1109/JBHI.2023.3247723,1
INSIDER: Interpretable sparse matrix decomposition for RNA expression data analysis,"RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) is widely used to capture transcriptome dynamics across tissues, biological entities, and conditions. Currently, few or no methods can handle multiple biological variables (e.g., tissues/ phenotypes) and their interactions simultaneously, while also achieving dimension reduction (DR). We propose INSIDER, a general and flexible statistical framework based on matrix factorization, which is freely available at https://github.com/kai0511/insider. INSIDER decomposes variation from different biological variables and their interactions into a shared low-rank latent space. Particularly, it introduces the elastic net penalty to induce sparsity while considering the grouping effects of genes. It can achieve DR of high-dimensional data (of > = 3 dimensions), as opposed to conventional methods (e.g., PCA/NMF) which generally only handle 2D data (e.g., sample × expression). Besides, it enables computing 'adjusted' expression profiles for specific biological variables while controlling variation from other variables. INSIDER is computationally efficient and accommodates missing data. INSIDER also performed similarly or outperformed a close competing method, SDA, as shown in simulations and can handle complex missing data in RNA-Seq data. Moreover, unlike SDA, it can be used when the data cannot be structured into a tensor. Lastly, we demonstrate its usefulness via real data analysis, including clustering donors for disease subtyping, revealing neuro-development trajectory using the BrainSpan data, and uncovering biological processes contributing to variables of interest (e.g., disease status and tissue) and their interactions.",38484017,PMC10965063,10.1371/journal.pgen.1011189,0
SpatialPrompt: spatially aware scalable and accurate tool for spot deconvolution and domain identification in spatial transcriptomics,"Efficiently mapping of cell types in situ remains a major challenge in spatial transcriptomics. Most spot deconvolution tools ignore spatial coordinate information and perform extremely slow on large datasets. Here, we introduce SpatialPrompt, a spatially aware and scalable tool for spot deconvolution and domain identification. SpatialPrompt integrates gene expression, spatial location, and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) dataset as reference to accurately infer cell-type proportions of spatial spots. SpatialPrompt uses non-negative ridge regression and graph neural network to efficiently capture local microenvironment information. Our extensive benchmarking analysis on Visium, Slide-seq, and MERFISH datasets demonstrated superior performance of SpatialPrompt over 15 existing tools. On mouse hippocampus dataset, SpatialPrompt achieves spot deconvolution and domain identification within 2 minutes for 50,000 spots. Overall, domain identification using SpatialPrompt was 44 to 150 times faster than existing methods.

Transcriptome meta-analysis of three follicular compartments and its correlation with ovarian follicle maturity and oocyte developmental competence in cows,"Oocyte developmental competence in superstimulated cows is dependent in part on the duration of the FSH coasting. FSH coasting refers to superstimulation with FSH (2 days of endogenous FSH following follicle ablation and 3 days of FSH injections) followed by no FSH for a specific duration. The optimal duration varies among individuals. FSH coasting appears to modulate the transcriptome of different follicular compartments, which cooperate as a single functional unit. However, the integrative effects of FSH coasting on different follicular compartments remain ambiguous. Meta-analysis of three independent transcriptome studies, each focused on a single cell type (granulosa, cumulus, and oocyte) during FSH coasting, allowed the identification of 12 gene clusters with similar time-course expression patterns in all three compartments. Network analysis identified HNF4A (involved in metabolic functions) and ELAVL1 (an RNA-binding protein) as hub genes regulated respectively upward and downward in the clusters enriched at the optimal coasting time, and APP (involved in mitochondrial functions) and COPS5 (a member of the COP9 signalosome) as hub genes regulated respectively upwards and downwards in the clusters enriched progressively throughout the coasting period. We confirmed the effects on HNF4A downstream targets (TTR, PPL) and other hub genes (ELAVL1, APP, MYC, and PGR) in 30 cows with RT-quantitative PCR. The correlation of hub gene expression levels with FSH coasting indicated that a combination of these genes could predict oocyte competence with 83% sensitivity, suggesting that they are potential biomarkers of follicle differentiation. These findings could be used to optimize FSH coasting on an individual basis.",27401219,PMC5005457,10.1152/physiolgenomics.00050.2016,12

Determining cell type abundance and expression from bulk tissues with digital cytometry,"Single-cell RNA-sequencing has emerged as a powerful technique for characterizing cellular heterogeneity, but it is currently impractical on large sample cohorts and cannot be applied to fixed specimens collected as part of routine clinical care. We previously developed an approach for digital cytometry, called CIBERSORT, that enables estimation of cell type abundances from bulk tissue transcriptomes. We now introduce CIBERSORTx, a machine learning method that extends this framework to infer cell-type-specific gene expression profiles without physical cell isolation. By minimizing platform-specific variation, CIBERSORTx also allows the use of single-cell RNA-sequencing data for large-scale tissue dissection. We evaluated the utility of CIBERSORTx in multiple tumor types, including melanoma, where single-cell reference profiles were used to dissect bulk clinical specimens, revealing cell-type-specific phenotypic states linked to distinct driver mutations and response to immune checkpoint blockade. We anticipate that digital cytometry will augment single-cell profiling efforts, enabling cost-effective, high-throughput tissue characterization without the need for antibodies, disaggregation or viable cells.",31061481,PMC6610714,10.1038/s41587-019-0114-2,1721
A developmental landscape of 3D-cultured human pre-gastrulation embryos,"Our understanding of how human embryos develop before gastrulation, including spatial self-organization and cell type ontogeny, remains limited by available two-dimensional technological platforms1,2that do not recapitulate the in vivo conditions3-5. Here we report a three-dimensional (3D) blastocyst-culture system that enables human blastocyst development up to the primitive streak anlage stage. These 3D embryos mimic developmental landmarks and 3D architectures in vivo, including the embryonic disc, amnion, basement membrane, primary and primate unique secondary yolk sac, formation of anterior-posterior polarity and primitive streak anlage. Using single-cell transcriptome profiling, we delineate ontology and regulatory networks that underlie the segregation of epiblast, primitive endoderm and trophoblast. Compared with epiblasts, the amniotic epithelium shows unique and characteristic phenotypes. After implantation, specific pathways and transcription factors trigger the differentiation of cytotrophoblasts, extravillous cytotrophoblasts and syncytiotrophoblasts. Epiblasts undergo a transition to pluripotency upon implantation, and the transcriptome of these cells is maintained until the generation of the primitive streak anlage. These developmental processes are driven by different pluripotency factors. Together, findings from our 3D-culture approach help to determine the molecular and morphogenetic developmental landscape that occurs during human embryogenesis.",31830756,,10.1038/s41586-019-1875-y,157
"Multiplexed, targeted profiling of single-cell proteomes and transcriptomes in a single reaction","We present a scalable, integrated strategy for coupled protein and RNA detection from single cells. Our approach leverages the DNA polymerase activity of reverse transcriptase to simultaneously perform proximity extension assays and complementary DNA synthesis in the same reaction. Using the Fluidigm C1™ system, we profile the transcriptomic and proteomic response of a human breast adenocarcinoma cell line to a chemical perturbation, benchmarking against in situ hybridizations and immunofluorescence staining, as well as recombinant proteins, ERCC Spike-Ins, and population lysate dilutions. Through supervised and unsupervised analyses, we demonstrate synergies enabled by simultaneous measurement of single-cell protein and RNA abundances. Collectively, our generalizable approach highlights the potential for molecular metadata to inform highly-multiplexed single-cell analyses.",27640647,PMC5027636,10.1186/s13059-016-1045-6,70
SPICEMIX enables integrative single-cell spatial modeling of cell identity,"Spatial transcriptomics can reveal spatially resolved gene expression of diverse cells in complex tissues. However, the development of computational methods that can use the unique properties of spatial transcriptome data to unveil cell identities remains a challenge. Here we introduce SPICEMIX, an interpretable method based on probabilistic, latent variable modeling for joint analysis of spatial information and gene expression from spatial transcriptome data. Both simulation and real data evaluations demonstrate that SPICEMIX markedly improves on the inference of cell types and their spatial patterns compared with existing approaches. By applying to spatial transcriptome data of brain regions in human and mouse acquired by seqFISH+, STARmap and Visium, we show that SPICEMIX can enhance the inference of complex cell identities, reveal interpretable spatial metagenes and uncover differentiation trajectories. SPICEMIX is a generalizable analysis framework for spatial transcriptome data to investigate cell-type composition and spatial organization of cells in complex tissues.",36624346,PMC9840703,10.1038/s41588-022-01256-z,19
Single-cell transcriptomics in cancer: computational challenges and opportunities,"Intratumor heterogeneity is a common characteristic across diverse cancer types and presents challenges to current standards of treatment. Advancements in high-throughput sequencing and imaging technologies provide opportunities to identify and characterize these aspects of heterogeneity. Notably, transcriptomic profiling at a single-cell resolution enables quantitative measurements of the molecular activity that underlies the phenotypic diversity of cells within a tumor. Such high-dimensional data require computational analysis to extract relevant biological insights about the cell types and states that drive cancer development, pathogenesis, and clinical outcomes. In this review, we highlight emerging themes in the computational analysis of single-cell transcriptomics data and their applications to cancer research. We focus on downstream analytical challenges relevant to cancer research, including how to computationally perform unified analysis across many patients and disease states, distinguish neoplastic from nonneoplastic cells, infer communication with the tumor microenvironment, and delineate tumoral and microenvironmental evolution with trajectory and RNA velocity analysis. We include discussions of challenges and opportunities for future computational methodological advancements necessary to realize the translational potential of single-cell transcriptomic profiling in cancer.",32929226,PMC8080633,10.1038/s12276-020-0422-0,67
Early X chromosome inactivation during human preimplantation development revealed by single-cell RNA-sequencing,"In female mammals, one X chromosome is transcriptionally inactivated (XCI), leading to dosage compensation between sexes, fundamental for embryo viability. A previous study using single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data proposed that female human preimplantation embryos achieve dosage compensation by downregulating both Xs, a phenomenon named dampening of X expression. Using a novel pipeline on those data, we identified a decrease in the proportion of biallelically expressed X-linked genes during development, consistent with XCI. Moreover, we show that while the expression sum of biallelically expressed X-linked genes decreases with embryonic development, their median expression remains constant, rejecting the hypothesis of X dampening. In addition, analyses of a different dataset of scRNA-seq suggest the appearance of X-linked monoallelic expression by the late blastocyst stage in females, another hallmark of initiation of XCI. Finally, we addressed the issue of dosage compensation between the single active X and autosomes in males and females for the first time during human preimplantation development, showing emergence of X to autosome dosage compensation by the upregulation of the active X chromosome in both male and female embryonic stem cells. Our results show compelling evidence of an early process of X chromosome inactivation during human preimplantation development.",28883481,PMC5589911,10.1038/s41598-017-11044-z,41
"scMHNN: a novel hypergraph neural network for integrative analysis of single-cell epigenomic, transcriptomic and proteomic data","Technological advances have now made it possible to simultaneously profile the changes of epigenomic, transcriptomic and proteomic at the single cell level, allowing a more unified view of cellular phenotypes and heterogeneities. However, current computational tools for single-cell multi-omics data integration are mainly tailored for bi-modality data, so new tools are urgently needed to integrate tri-modality data with complex associations. To this end, we develop scMHNN to integrate single-cell multi-omics data based on hypergraph neural network. After modeling the complex data associations among various modalities, scMHNN performs message passing process on the multi-omics hypergraph, which can capture the high-order data relationships and integrate the multiple heterogeneous features. Followingly, scMHNN learns discriminative cell representation via a dual-contrastive loss in self-supervised manner. Based on the pretrained hypergraph encoder, we further introduce the pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm, which allows more accurate cell-type annotation with only a small number of labeled cells as reference. Benchmarking results on real and simulated single-cell tri-modality datasets indicate that scMHNN outperforms other competing methods on both cell clustering and cell-type annotation tasks. In addition, we also demonstrate scMHNN facilitates various downstream tasks, such as cell marker detection and enrichment analysis.",37930028,,10.1093/bib/bbad391,0
A comparative strategy for single-nucleus and single-cell transcriptomes confirms accuracy in predicted cell-type expression from nuclear RNA,"Significant heterogeneities in gene expression among individual cells are typically interrogated using single whole cell approaches. However, tissues that have highly interconnected processes, such as in the brain, present unique challenges. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (SNS) has emerged as an alternative method of assessing a cell's transcriptome through the use of isolated nuclei. However, studies directly comparing expression data between nuclei and whole cells are lacking. Here, we have characterized nuclear and whole cell transcriptomes in mouse single neurons and provided a normalization strategy to reduce method-specific differences related to the length of genic regions. We confirmed a high concordance between nuclear and whole cell transcriptomes in the expression of cell type and metabolic modeling markers, but less so for a subset of genes associated with mitochondrial respiration. Therefore, our results indicate that single-nucleus transcriptome sequencing provides an effective means to profile cell type expression dynamics in previously inaccessible tissues.",28729663,PMC5519641,10.1038/s41598-017-04426-w,124
Tutorial: guidelines for annotating single-cell transcriptomic maps using automated and manual methods,"Single-cell transcriptomics can profile thousands of cells in a single experiment and identify novel cell types, states and dynamics in a wide variety of tissues and organisms. Standard experimental protocols and analysis workflows have been developed to create single-cell transcriptomic maps from tissues. This tutorial focuses on how to interpret these data to identify cell types, states and other biologically relevant patterns with the objective of creating an annotated map of cells. We recommend a three-step workflow including automatic cell annotation (wherever possible), manual cell annotation and verification. Frequently encountered challenges are discussed, as well as strategies to address them. Guiding principles and specific recommendations for software tools and resources that can be used for each step are covered, and an R notebook is included to help run the recommended workflow. Basic familiarity with computer software is assumed, and basic knowledge of programming (e.g., in the R language) is recommended.",34031612,,10.1038/s41596-021-00534-0,64
The diversification of methods for studying cell-cell interactions and communication,"No cell lives in a vacuum, and the molecular interactions between cells define most phenotypes. Transcriptomics provides rich information to infer cell-cell interactions and communication, thus accelerating the discovery of the roles of cells within their communities. Such research relies heavily on algorithms that infer which cells are interacting and the ligands and receptors involved. Specific pressures on different research niches are driving the evolution of next-generation computational tools, enabling new conceptual opportunities and technological advances. More sophisticated algorithms now account for the heterogeneity and spatial organization of cells, multiple ligand types and intracellular signalling events, and enable the use of larger and more complex datasets, including single-cell and spatial transcriptomics. Similarly, new high-throughput experimental methods are increasing the number and resolution of interactions that can be analysed simultaneously. Here, we explore recent progress in cell-cell interaction research and highlight the diversification of the next generation of tools, which have yielded a rich ecosystem of tools for different applications and are enabling invaluable discoveries.",38238518,,10.1038/s41576-023-00685-8,7
Single-cell transcriptomics uncovers cellular architecture and developmental trajectories in hepatoblastoma,"Background and aims:Hepatoblastoma (HB) is the predominant type of childhood liver cancer. Treatment options for the clinically advanced HB remain limited. We aimed to dissect the cellular and molecular basis underlying HB oncogenesis and heterogeneity at the single-cell level, which could facilitate a better understanding of HB at both the biological and clinical levels.Approach and results:Single-cell transcriptome profiling of tumor and paired distal liver tissue samples from five patients with HB was performed. Deconvolution analysis was used for integrating the single-cell transcriptomic profiles with the bulk transcriptomes of our HB cohort of post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy tumor samples. A single-cell transcriptomic landscape of early human liver parenchymal development was established for exploring the cellular root and hierarchy of HB oncogenesis. As a result, seven distinct tumor cell subpopulations were annotated, and an effective HB subtyping method was established based on their compositions. A HB tumor cell hierarchy was further revealed to not only fit with the classical cancer stem cell (CSC) model but also mirror the early human liver parenchymal development. Moreover, FACT inhibition, which could disrupt the oncogenic positive feedback loop between MYC and SSRP1 in HB, was identified as a promising epigenetic-targeted therapeutic strategy against the CSC-like HB1-Pro-like1 subpopulation and its related high-risk ""Pro-like1"" subtype of HB.Conclusions:Our findings illustrate the cellular architecture and developmental trajectories of HB via integrative bulk and single-cell transcriptome analyses, thus establishing a resourceful framework for the development of targeted diagnostics and therapeutics in the future.",36059151,,10.1002/hep.32775,7
Dissecting lung development and fibrosis at single-cell resolution,"Single-cell transcriptome profiling has enabled high-resolution analysis of cellular populations in tissues during development, health, and disease.

PUREE: accurate pan-cancer tumor purity estimation from gene expression data,"Tumors are complex masses composed of malignant and non-malignant cells. Variation in tumor purity (proportion of cancer cells in a sample) can both confound integrative analysis and enable studies of tumor heterogeneity. Here we developed PUREE, which uses a weakly supervised learning approach to infer tumor purity from a tumor gene expression profile. PUREE was trained on gene expression data and genomic consensus purity estimates from 7864 solid tumor samples. PUREE predicted purity with high accuracy across distinct solid tumor types and generalized to tumor samples from unseen tumor types and cohorts. Gene features of PUREE were further validated using single-cell RNA-seq data from distinct tumor types. In a comprehensive benchmark, PUREE outperformed existing transcriptome-based purity estimation approaches. Overall, PUREE is a highly accurate and versatile method for estimating tumor purity and interrogating tumor heterogeneity from bulk tumor gene expression data, which can complement genomics-based approaches or be used in settings where genomic data is unavailable.",37041233,PMC10090153,10.1038/s42003-023-04764-8,3
TISSUE: uncertainty-calibrated prediction of single-cell spatial transcriptomics improves downstream analyses,"Whole-transcriptome spatial profiling of genes at single-cell resolution remains a challenge. To address this limitation, spatial gene expression prediction methods have been developed to infer the spatial expression of unmeasured transcripts, but the quality of these predictions can vary greatly. Here we present Transcript Imputation with Spatial Single-cell Uncertainty Estimation (TISSUE) as a general framework for estimating uncertainty for spatial gene expression predictions and providing uncertainty-aware methods for downstream inference. Leveraging conformal inference, TISSUE provides well-calibrated prediction intervals for predicted expression values across 11 benchmark datasets. Moreover, it consistently reduces the false discovery rate for differential gene expression analysis, improves clustering and visualization of predicted spatial transcriptomics and improves the performance of supervised learning models trained on predicted gene expression profiles. Applying TISSUE to a MERFISH spatial transcriptomics dataset of the adult mouse subventricular zone, we identified subtypes within the neural stem cell lineage and developed subtype-specific regional classifiers.",38347138,,10.1038/s41592-024-02184-y,0
Isolating salient variations of interest in single-cell data with contrastiveVI,"Single-cell datasets are routinely collected to investigate changes in cellular state between control cells and the corresponding cells in a treatment condition, such as exposure to a drug or infection by a pathogen. To better understand heterogeneity in treatment response, it is desirable to deconvolve variations enriched in treated cells from those shared with controls. However, standard computational models of single-cell data are not designed to explicitly separate these variations. Here, we introduce contrastive variational inference (contrastiveVI; https://github.com/suinleelab/contrastiveVI ), a framework for deconvolving variations in treatment-control single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets into shared and treatment-specific latent variables. Using three treatment-control scRNA-seq datasets, we apply contrastiveVI to perform a variety of analysis tasks, including visualization, clustering and differential expression testing. We find that contrastiveVI consistently achieves results that agree with known ground truths and often highlights subtle phenomena that may be difficult to ascertain with standard workflows. We conclude by generalizing contrastiveVI to accommodate joint transcriptome and surface protein measurements.",37550579,,10.1038/s41592-023-01955-3,6
An ultra high-throughput method for single-cell joint analysis of open chromatin and transcriptome,"Simultaneous profiling of transcriptome and chromatin accessibility within single cells is a powerful approach to dissect gene regulatory programs in complex tissues. However, current tools are limited by modest throughput. We now describe an ultra high-throughput method, Paired-seq, for parallel analysis of transcriptome and accessible chromatin in millions of single cells. We demonstrate the utility of Paired-seq for analyzing the dynamic and cell-type-specific gene regulatory programs in complex tissues by applying it to mouse adult cerebral cortex and fetal forebrain. The joint profiles of a large number of single cells allowed us to deconvolute the transcriptome and open chromatin landscapes in the major cell types within these brain tissues, infer putative target genes of candidate enhancers, and reconstruct the trajectory of cellular lineages within the developing forebrain.",31695190,PMC7231560,10.1038/s41594-019-0323-x,135
Single-cell transcriptomics of a dynamic cell behavior in murine airways,"Despite advances in high-dimensional cellular analysis, the molecular profiling of dynamic behaviors of cells in their native environment remains a major challenge. We present a method that allows us to couple the physiological behaviors of cells in an intact murine tissue to deep molecular profiling of individual cells. This method enabled us to establish a novel molecular signature for a striking migratory cellular behavior following injury in murine airways.",37083555,PMC10174686,10.7554/eLife.76645,2
Spatially resolved transcriptomic profiling of placental development in dairy cow,"The placenta plays a crucial role in successful mammalian reproduction. Ruminant animals possess a semi-invasive placenta characterized by a highly vascularized structure formed by maternal endometrial caruncles and fetal placental cotyledons, essential for full-term fetal development. The cow placenta harbors at least two trophoblast cell populations: uninucleate (UNC) and binucleate (BNC) cells. However, the limited capacity to elucidate the transcriptomic dynamics of the placental natural environment has resulted in a poor understanding of both the molecular and cellular interactions between trophoblast cells and niches, and the molecular mechanisms governing trophoblast differentiation and functionalization. To fill this knowledge gap, we employed Stereo-seq to map spatial gene expression patterns at near single-cell resolution in the cow placenta at 90 and 130 days of gestation, attaining high-resolution, spatially resolved gene expression profiles. Based on clustering and cell marker gene expression analyses, key transcription factors, including YBX1 and NPAS2, were shown to regulate the heterogeneity of trophoblast cell subpopulations. Cell communication and trajectory analysis provided a framework for understanding cell-cell interactions and the differentiation of trophoblasts into BNCs in the placental microenvironment. Differential analysis of cell trajectories identified a set of genes involved in regulation of trophoblast differentiation. Additionally, spatial modules and co-variant genes that help shape specific tissue structures were identified. Together, these findings provide foundational insights into important biological pathways critical to the placental development and function in cows.",38766743,,10.24272/j.issn.2095-8137.2023.205,0
Deep learning applications in single-cell genomics and transcriptomics data analysis,"Traditional bulk sequencing methods are limited to measuring the average signal in a group of cells, potentially masking heterogeneity, and rare populations. The single-cell resolution, however, enhances our understanding of complex biological systems and diseases, such as cancer, the immune system, and chronic diseases. However, the single-cell technologies generate massive amounts of data that are often high-dimensional, sparse, and complex, thus making analysis with traditional computational approaches difficult and unfeasible. To tackle these challenges, many are turning to deep learning (DL) methods as potential alternatives to the conventional machine learning (ML) algorithms for single-cell studies. DL is a branch of ML capable of extracting high-level features from raw inputs in multiple stages. Compared to traditional ML, DL models have provided significant improvements across many domains and applications. In this work, we examine DL applications in genomics, transcriptomics, spatial transcriptomics, and multi-omics integration, and address whether DL techniques will prove to be advantageous or if the single-cell omics domain poses unique challenges. Through a systematic literature review, we have found that DL has not yet revolutionized the most pressing challenges of the single-cell omics field. However, using DL models for single-cell omics has shown promising results (in many cases outperforming the previous state-of-the-art models) in data preprocessing and downstream analysis. Although developments of DL algorithms for single-cell omics have generally been gradual, recent advances reveal that DL can offer valuable resources in fast-tracking and advancing research in single-cell.",37393865,,10.1016/j.biopha.2023.115077,12
ImmCluster: an ensemble resource for immunology cell type clustering and annotations in normal and cancerous tissues,"Single-cell transcriptome has enabled the transcriptional profiling of thousands of immune cells in complex tissues and cancers. However, subtle transcriptomic differences in immune cell subpopulations and the high dimensionality of transcriptomic data make the clustering and annotation of immune cells challenging. Herein, we introduce ImmCluster (http://bio-bigdata.hrbmu.edu.cn/ImmCluster) for immunology cell type clustering and annotation. We manually curated 346 well-known marker genes from 1163 studies. ImmCluster integrates over 420 000 immune cells from nine healthy tissues and over 648 000 cells from different tumour samples of 17 cancer types to generate stable marker-gene sets and develop context-specific immunology references. In addition, ImmCluster provides cell clustering using seven reference-based and four marker gene-based computational methods, and the ensemble method was developed to provide consistent cell clustering than individual methods. Five major analytic modules were provided for interactively exploring the annotations of immune cells, including clustering and annotating immune cell clusters, gene expression of markers, functional assignment in cancer hallmarks, cell states and immune pathways, cell-cell communications and the corresponding ligand-receptor interactions, as well as online tools. ImmCluster generates diverse plots and tables, enabling users to identify significant associations in immune cell clusters simultaneously.

Spatial multi-omics sequencing for fixed tissue via DBiT-seq,"This protocol describes the use of the deterministic barcoding in tissue for spatial omics sequencing platform to construct a multi-omics atlas on fixed frozen tissue samples. This approach uses a microfluidic-based method to introduce combinatorial DNA oligo barcodes directly to the cells in a tissue section fixed on a glass slide.

Single-cell transcriptomes identify human islet cell signatures and reveal cell-type-specific expression changes in type 2 diabetes,"Blood glucose levels are tightly controlled by the coordinated action of at least four cell types constituting pancreatic islets. Changes in the proportion and/or function of these cells are associated with genetic and molecular pathophysiology of monogenic, type 1, and type 2 (T2D) diabetes. Cellular heterogeneity impedes precise understanding of the molecular components of each islet cell type that govern islet (dys)function, particularly the less abundant delta and gamma/pancreatic polypeptide (PP) cells. Here, we report single-cell transcriptomes for 638 cells from nondiabetic (ND) and T2D human islet samples. Analyses of ND single-cell transcriptomes identified distinct alpha, beta, delta, and PP/gamma cell-type signatures. Genes linked to rare and common forms of islet dysfunction and diabetes were expressed in the delta and PP/gamma cell types. Moreover, this study revealed that delta cells specifically express receptors that receive and coordinate systemic cues from the leptin, ghrelin, and dopamine signaling pathways implicating them as integrators of central and peripheral metabolic signals into the pancreatic islet. Finally, single-cell transcriptome profiling revealed genes differentially regulated between T2D and ND alpha, beta, and delta cells that were undetectable in paired whole islet analyses. This study thus identifies fundamental cell-type-specific features of pancreatic islet (dys)function and provides a critical resource for comprehensive understanding of islet biology and diabetes pathogenesis.",27864352,PMC5287227,10.1101/gr.212720.116,251
Deep feature extraction of single-cell transcriptomes by generative adversarial network,"Motivation:Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) offers the opportunity to dissect heterogeneous cellular compositions and interrogate the cell-type-specific gene expression patterns across diverse conditions. However, batch effects such as laboratory conditions and individual-variability hinder their usage in cross-condition designs.Results:Here, we present a single-cell Generative Adversarial Network (scGAN) to simultaneously acquire patterns from raw data while minimizing the confounding effect driven by technical artifacts or other factors inherent to the data. Specifically, scGAN models the data likelihood of the raw scRNA-seq counts by projecting each cell onto a latent embedding. Meanwhile, scGAN attempts to minimize the correlation between the latent embeddings and the batch labels across all cells. We demonstrate scGAN on three public scRNA-seq datasets and show that our method confers superior performance over the state-of-the-art methods in forming clusters of known cell types and identifying known psychiatric genes that are associated with major depressive disorder.Availabilityand implementation:The scGAN code and the information for the public scRNA-seq datasets are available at https://github.com/li-lab-mcgill/singlecell-deepfeature.Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",33226074,,10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa976,6
cellsig plug-in enhances CIBERSORTx signature selection for multidataset transcriptomes with sparse multilevel modelling,"Motivation:The precise characterization of cell-type transcriptomes is pivotal to understanding cellular lineages, deconvolution of bulk transcriptomes, and clinical applications. Single-cell RNA sequencing resources like the Human Cell Atlas have revolutionised cell-type profiling. However, challenges persist due to data heterogeneity and discrepancies across different studies. One limitation of prevailing tools such as CIBERSORTx is their inability to address hierarchical data structures and handle nonoverlapping gene sets across samples, relying on filtering or imputation.Results:Here, we present cellsig, a Bayesian sparse multilevel model designed to improve signature estimation by adjusting data for multilevel effects and modelling for gene-set sparsity. Our model is tailored to large-scale, heterogeneous pseudobulk and bulk RNA sequencing data collections with nonoverlapping gene sets. We tested the performances of cellsig on a novel curated Human Bulk Cell-type Catalogue, which harmonizes 1435 samples across 58 datasets. We show that cellsig significantly enhances cell-type marker gene ranking performance. This approach is valuable for cell-type signature selection, with implications for marker gene validation, single-cell annotation, and deconvolution benchmarks.Availability and implementation:Codes and the interactive app are available at https://github.com/stemangiola/cellsig; and the database is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7582421.",37952182,PMC10692870,10.1093/bioinformatics/btad685,0
Efficient integration of heterogeneous single-cell transcriptomes using Scanorama,"Integration of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from multiple experiments, laboratories and technologies can uncover biological insights, but current methods for scRNA-seq data integration are limited by a requirement for datasets to derive from functionally similar cells. We present Scanorama, an algorithm that identifies and merges the shared cell types among all pairs of datasets and accurately integrates heterogeneous collections of scRNA-seq data. We applied Scanorama to integrate and remove batch effects across 105,476 cells from 26 diverse scRNA-seq experiments representing 9 different technologies. Scanorama is sensitive to subtle temporal changes within the same cell lineage, successfully integrating functionally similar cells across time series data of CD14+monocytes at different stages of differentiation into macrophages. Finally, we show that Scanorama is orders of magnitude faster than existing techniques and can integrate a collection of 1,095,538 cells in just ~9 h.",31061482,PMC6551256,10.1038/s41587-019-0113-3,302
Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Reveals Molecular Features of Heterogeneity in the Murine Retinal Pigment Epithelium,"Transcriptomic analysis of the mammalian retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) aims to identify cellular networks that influence ocular development, maintenance, function, and disease. However, available evidence points to RPE cell heterogeneity within native tissue, which adds complexity to global transcriptomic analysis. Here, to assess cell heterogeneity, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of RPE cells from two young adult male C57BL/6J mice. Following quality control to ensure robust transcript identification limited to cell singlets, we detected 13,858 transcripts among 2667 and 2846 RPE cells. Dimensional reduction by principal component analysis and uniform manifold approximation and projection revealed six distinct cell populations. All clusters expressed transcripts typical of RPE cells; the smallest (C1, containing 1-2% of total cells) exhibited the hallmarks of stem and/or progenitor (SP) cells. Placing C1-6 along a pseudotime axis suggested a relative decrease in melanogenesis and SP gene expression and a corresponding increase in visual cycle gene expression upon RPE maturation. K-means clustering of all detected transcripts identified additional expression patterns that may advance the understanding of RPE SP cell maintenance and the evolution of cellular metabolic networks during development. This work provides new insights into the transcriptome of the mouse RPE and a baseline for identifying experimentally induced transcriptional changes in future studies of this tissue.",36142331,PMC9499471,10.3390/ijms231810419,3
Single-cell RNA sequencing: A new opportunity for retinal research,"Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a technology for single-cell transcriptome analysis that can be used to characterize complex dynamics of various retinal cell types. It provides deep scrutiny into the gene expression character of diverse cell types, lending insight into all the biological processes being carried out. The scRNA-seq is an alternative to regular RNA-seq, which does not achieve cellular heterogeneity. The retina, is a part of the central nervous system (CNS) and consists of six types of neurons and several types of glial cells. Studying retinal cell heterogeneity is important for understanding retinal diseases. Currently, scRNA-seq is employed to assess retina development and retinal disease pathogenesis and has improved our understanding of the relationship between the retina, its visual pathways, and the brain. Moreover, this technology provides new ideas on the sensitivity and molecular mechanisms of cell subtypes involved in retinal-related diseases. The application of scRNA-seq technology has given us a deeper understanding of the latest advancements and challenges in retinal development and diseases. We advocate scRNA-seq as one of the important tools for developing novel therapies for retinal diseases.

The development of sequencing technology and improved sequencing throughput have brought about a revolution in single-cell transcriptome study, bringing great benefits to the fields of medicine and biomedical science. From our perspective, certain issues in forensic medicine may potentially be addressed using single-cell transcriptome studies; however, this powerful technique has not yet attracted sufficient attention in forensic medicine-associated research.

Sensitive and Low-Bias Transcriptome Sequencing Using Agarose PCR,"Transcriptome sequencing has emerged as an important research tool for exploring the mysteries of life at the single-cell level. However, its wide application is limited by the bias associated with the amplification reactions which is essential for library building of trace RNA. In this study, low-melting-point agarose was added to the amplification reactions to take advantage of its molecular crowding effect and polymer cross-linked structure to improve the sensitivity of the reactions and reduce bias. To further evaluate the performance of the method, it was applied to transcriptome sequencing of microregion samples from brain tissue sections of mice with Parkinson's disease at the single cell level. The results showed that agarose PCR had better performance than in-tube PCR. Further application of agarose PCR to transcriptome library sequencing could obtain data closer to that of unamplified. With the addition of low melting point agarose, the sensitivity of the amplification reaction was significantly increased, while homogeneity was increased by approximately 2-fold. Not only that, but this work also provides 11% sensitivity improvement for spatial transcriptomic study on Parkinson's disease-associated gene detection. The agarose PCR provides a new tool for efficient and homogeneous amplification of trace samples and can be widely used for spatial transcriptome library sequencing and studies.",35446027,,10.1021/acsami.2c02133,0
Navigating the Depths and Avoiding the Shallows of Pancreatic Islet Cell Transcriptomes,"Islet gene expression has been widely studied to better understand the transcriptional features that define a healthy β-cell. Transcriptomes of FACS-purified α-, β-, and δ-cells using bulk RNA-sequencing have facilitated our understanding of the complex network of cross talk between islet cells and its effects on β-cell function. However, these approaches were by design not intended to resolve heterogeneity between individual cells. Several recent studies used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) to report considerable heterogeneity within mouse and human β-cells. In this Perspective, we assess how this newfound ability to assess gene expression at single-cell resolution has enhanced our understanding of β-cell heterogeneity. We conduct a comprehensive assessment of several single human β-cell transcriptome data sets and ask if the heterogeneity reported by these studies showed overlap and concurred with previously known examples of β-cell heterogeneity. We also illustrate the impact of the inevitable limitations of working at or below the limit of detection of gene expression at single cell resolution and their consequences for the quality of single-islet cell transcriptome data. Finally, we offer some guidance on when to opt for scRNA-Seq and when bulk sequencing approaches may be better suited.",31221802,PMC6609986,10.2337/dbi18-0019,58
Spatial transcriptome profiling by MERFISH reveals subcellular RNA compartmentalization and cell cycle-dependent gene expression,"The expression profiles and spatial distributions of RNAs regulate many cellular functions. Image-based transcriptomic approaches provide powerful means to measure both expression and spatial information of RNAs in individual cells within their native environment. Among these approaches, multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH) has achieved spatially resolved RNA quantification at transcriptome scale by massively multiplexing single-molecule FISH measurements. Here, we increased the gene throughput of MERFISH and demonstrated simultaneous measurements of RNA transcripts from ∼10,000 genes in individual cells with ∼80% detection efficiency and ∼4% misidentification rate. We combined MERFISH with cellular structure imaging to determine subcellular compartmentalization of RNAs. We validated this approach by showing enrichment of secretome transcripts at the endoplasmic reticulum, and further revealed enrichment of long noncoding RNAs, RNAs with retained introns, and a subgroup of protein-coding mRNAs in the cell nucleus. Leveraging spatially resolved RNA profiling, we developed an approach to determine RNA velocity in situ using the balance of nuclear versus cytoplasmic RNA counts. We applied this approach to infer pseudotime ordering of cells and identified cells at different cell-cycle states, revealing ∼1,600 genes with putative cell cycle-dependent expression and a gradual transcription profile change as cells progress through cell-cycle stages. Our analysis further revealed cell cycle-dependent and cell cycle-independent spatial heterogeneity of transcriptionally distinct cells. We envision that the ability to perform spatially resolved, genome-wide RNA profiling with high detection efficiency and accuracy by MERFISH could help address a wide array of questions ranging from the regulation of gene expression in cells to the development of cell fate and organization in tissues.",31501331,PMC6765259,10.1073/pnas.1912459116,264
Recovery and analysis of transcriptome subsets from pooled single-cell RNA-seq libraries,"Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) methods generate sparse gene expression profiles for thousands of single cells in a single experiment. The information in these profiles is sufficient to classify cell types by distinct expression patterns but the high complexity of scRNA-seq libraries often prevents full characterization of transcriptomes from individual cells. To extract more focused gene expression information from scRNA-seq libraries, we developed a strategy to physically recover the DNA molecules comprising transcriptome subsets, enabling deeper interrogation of the isolated molecules by another round of DNA sequencing. We applied the method in cell-centric and gene-centric modes to isolate cDNA fragments from scRNA-seq libraries. First, we resampled the transcriptomes of rare, single megakaryocytes from a complex mixture of lymphocytes and analyzed them in a second round of DNA sequencing, yielding up to 20-fold greater sequencing depth per cell and increasing the number of genes detected per cell from a median of 1313 to 2002. We similarly isolated mRNAs from targeted T cells to improve the reconstruction of their VDJ-rearranged immune receptor mRNAs. Second, we isolated CD3D mRNA fragments expressed across cells in a scRNA-seq library prepared from a clonal T cell line, increasing the number of cells with detected CD3D expression from 59.7% to 100%. Transcriptome resampling is a general approach to recover targeted gene expression information from single-cell RNA sequencing libraries that enhances the utility of these costly experiments, and may be applicable to the targeted recovery of molecules from other single-cell assays.",30496484,PMC6393243,10.1093/nar/gky1204,8
Marine Invertebrates One Cell at A Time: Insights from Single-Cell Analysis,"Over the past decade, single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) has made it possible to study the cellular diversity of a broad range of organisms. Technological advances in single-cell isolation and sequencing have expanded rapidly, allowing the transcriptomic profile of individual cells to be captured. As a result, there has been an explosion of cell type atlases created for many different marine invertebrate species from across the tree of life. Our focus in this review is to synthesize current literature on marine invertebrate scRNA-seq. Specifically, we provide perspectives on key insights from scRNA-seq studies, including descriptive studies of cell type composition, how cells respond in dynamic processes such as development and regeneration, and the evolution of new cell types. Despite these tremendous advances, there also lie several challenges ahead. We discuss the important considerations that are essential when making comparisons between experiments, or between datasets from different species. Finally, we address the future of single-cell analyses in marine invertebrates, including combining scRNA-seq data with other 'omics methods to get a fuller understanding of cellular complexities. The full diversity of cell types across marine invertebrates remains unknown and understanding this diversity and evolution will provide rich areas for future study.",37188638,PMC10714908,10.1093/icb/icad034,0
Stomach encyclopedia: Combined single-cell and spatial transcriptomics reveal cell diversity and homeostatic regulation of human stomach,"The stomach is an important digestive organ with various biological functions. However, because of the complexity of its cellular and glandular composition, its precise cellular biology has yet to be elucidated. In this study, we conducted single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and subcellular-level spatial transcriptomics analysis of the human stomach and constructed the largest dataset to date: a stomach encyclopedia. This dataset consists of approximately 380,000 cells from scRNA-seq and the spatial transcriptome, enabling integrated analyses of transcriptional and spatial information of gastric and metaplastic cells. This analysis identified LEFTY1 as an uncharacterized stem cell marker, which was confirmed through lineage tracing analysis. A wide variety of cell-cell interactions between epithelial and stromal cells, including PDGFRA+BMP4+WNT5A+fibroblasts, was highlighted in the developmental switch of intestinal metaplasia. Our extensive dataset will function as a fundamental resource in investigations of the stomach, including studies of development, aging, and carcinogenesis.",37819756,,10.1016/j.celrep.2023.113236,2
Deconvolution analysis of cell-type expression from bulk tissues by integrating with single-cell expression reference,"To understand phenotypic variations and key factors which affect disease susceptibility of complex traits, it is important to decipher cell-type tissue compositions. To study cellular compositions of bulk tissue samples, one can evaluate cellular abundances and cell-type-specific gene expression patterns from the tissue transcriptome profiles. We develop both fixed and mixed models to reconstruct cellular expression fractions for bulk-profiled samples by using reference single-cell (sc) RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) reference data. In benchmark evaluations of estimating cellular expression fractions, the mixed-effect models provide similar results as an elegant machine learning algorithm named cell-type identification by estimating relative subsets of RNA transcripts (CIBERSORTx), which is a well-known and reliable procedure to reconstruct cell-type abundances and cell-type-specific gene expression profiles. In real data analysis, the mixed-effect models outperform or perform similarly as CIBERSORTx. The mixed models perform better than the fixed models in both benchmark evaluations and data analysis. In simulation studies, we show that if the heterogeneity exists in scRNA-seq data, it is better to use mixed models with heterogeneous mean and variance-covariance. As a byproduct, the mixed models provide fractions of covariance between subject-specific gene expression and cell types to measure their correlations. The proposed mixed models provide a complementary tool to dissect bulk tissues using scRNA-seq data.",35788983,PMC9669104,10.1002/gepi.22494,1
Imputation method for single-cell RNA-seq data using neural topic model,"Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology studies transcriptome and cell-to-cell differences from higher single-cell resolution and different perspectives. Despite the advantage of high capture efficiency, downstream functional analysis of scRNA-seq data is made difficult by the excess of zero values (i.e., the dropout phenomenon). To effectively address this problem, we introduced scNTImpute, an imputation framework based on a neural topic model. A neural network encoder is used to extract underlying topic features of single-cell transcriptome data to infer high-quality cell similarity. At the same time, we determine which transcriptome data are affected by the dropout phenomenon according to the learning of the mixture model by the neural network. On the basis of stable cell similarity, the same gene information in other similar cells is borrowed to impute only the missing expression values. By evaluating the performance of real data, scNTImpute can accurately and efficiently identify the dropout values and imputes them accurately. In the meantime, the clustering of cell subsets is improved and the original biological information in cell clustering is solved, which is covered by technical noise. The source code for the scNTImpute module is available as open source at https://github.com/qiyueyang-7/scNTImpute.git.",38000911,PMC10673642,10.1093/gigascience/giad098,0
Pooled CRISPR screening with single-cell transcriptome readout,"CRISPR-based genetic screens are accelerating biological discovery, but current methods have inherent limitations. Widely used pooled screens are restricted to simple readouts including cell proliferation and sortable marker proteins. Arrayed screens allow for comprehensive molecular readouts such as transcriptome profiling, but at much lower throughput. Here we combine pooled CRISPR screening with single-cell RNA sequencing into a broadly applicable workflow, directly linking guide RNA expression to transcriptome responses in thousands of individual cells. Our method for CRISPR droplet sequencing (CROP-seq) enables pooled CRISPR screens with single-cell transcriptome resolution, which will facilitate high-throughput functional dissection of complex regulatory mechanisms and heterogeneous cell populations.",28099430,PMC5334791,10.1038/nmeth.4177,406
Untangling the effects of cellular composition on coexpression analysis,"Coexpression analysis is widely used for inferring regulatory networks, predicting gene function, and interpretation of transcriptome profiling studies, based on methods such as clustering. The majority of such studies use data collected from bulk tissue, where the effects of cellular composition present a potential confound. However, the impact of composition on coexpression analysis has not been studied in detail. Here, we examine this issue for the case of human RNA analysis. Focusing on brain tissue, we found that, for most genes, differences in expression levels across cell types account for a large fraction of the variance of their measured RNA levels (medianR2= 0.68). We then show that genes that have similar expression patterns across cell types will have correlated RNA levels in bulk tissue, due to the effect of variation in cellular composition. We demonstrate that much of the coexpression and the formation of coexpression clusters can be attributed to this effect for both brain and blood transcriptomes. For brain, we further show how this composition-induced coexpression masks underlying intra-cell-type coexpression observed in single-cell data. An attempt to correct for composition yielded mixed results. Our conclusion is that the dominant coexpression signal in brain, blood, and, likely, other complex tissues can be attributed to cellular compositional effects, rather than intra-cell-type regulatory relationships. These results have implications for the relevance and interpretation of coexpression analysis.",32580998,PMC7370889,10.1101/gr.256735.119,21
Spatial transcriptomics: recent developments and insights in respiratory research,"The respiratory system's complex cellular heterogeneity presents unique challenges to researchers in this field. Although bulk RNA sequencing and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) have provided insights into cell types and heterogeneity in the respiratory system, the relevant specific spatial localization and cellular interactions have not been clearly elucidated. Spatial transcriptomics (ST) has filled this gap and has been widely used in respiratory studies. This review focuses on the latest iterative technology of ST in recent years, summarizing how ST can be applied to the physiological and pathological processes of the respiratory system, with emphasis on the lungs. Finally, the current challenges and potential development directions are proposed, including high-throughput full-length transcriptome, integration of multi-omics, temporal and spatial omics, bioinformatics analysis, etc. These viewpoints are expected to advance the study of systematic mechanisms, including respiratory studies.",37592342,PMC10433685,10.1186/s40779-023-00471-x,4
An interpretable single-cell RNA sequencing data clustering method based on latent Dirichlet allocation,"Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) detects whole transcriptome signals for large amounts of individual cells and is powerful for determining cell-to-cell differences and investigating the functional characteristics of various cell types. scRNA-seq datasets are usually sparse and highly noisy. Many steps in the scRNA-seq analysis workflow, including reasonable gene selection, cell clustering and annotation, as well as discovering the underlying biological mechanisms from such datasets, are difficult. In this study, we proposed an scRNA-seq analysis method based on the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model. The LDA model estimates a series of latent variables, i.e. putative functions (PFs), from the input raw cell-gene data. Thus, we incorporated the 'cell-function-gene' three-layer framework into scRNA-seq analysis, as this framework is capable of discovering latent and complex gene expression patterns via a built-in model approach and obtaining biologically meaningful results through a data-driven functional interpretation process. We compared our method with four classic methods on seven benchmark scRNA-seq datasets. The LDA-based method performed best in the cell clustering test in terms of both accuracy and purity. By analysing three complex public datasets, we demonstrated that our method could distinguish cell types with multiple levels of functional specialization, and precisely reconstruct cell development trajectories. Moreover, the LDA-based method accurately identified the representative PFs and the representative genes for the cell types/cell stages, enabling data-driven cell cluster annotation and functional interpretation. According to the literature, most of the previously reported marker/functionally relevant genes were recognized.",37225419,PMC10359080,10.1093/bib/bbad199,3
"An accessible, interactive GenePattern Notebook for analysis and exploration of single-cell transcriptomic data","Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has emerged as a popular method to profile gene expression at the resolution of individual cells. While there have been methods and software specifically developed to analyze scRNA-seq data, they are most accessible to users who program. We have created a scRNA-seq clustering analysis GenePattern Notebook that provides an interactive, easy-to-use interface for data analysis and exploration of scRNA-Seq data, without the need to write or view any code. The notebook provides a standard scRNA-seq analysis workflow for pre-processing data, identification of sub-populations of cells by clustering, and exploration of biomarkers to characterize heterogeneous cell populations and delineate cell types.",31316748,PMC6611141,10.12688/f1000research.15830.2,2
Proteomic/transcriptomic analysis of erythropoiesis,"Purpose of review:Erythropoiesis is a hierarchical process by which hematopoietic stem cells give rise to red blood cells through gradual cell fate restriction and maturation. Deciphering this process requires the establishment of dynamic gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that predict the response of hematopoietic cells to signals from the environment. Although GRNs have historically been derived from transcriptomic data, recent proteomic studies have revealed a major role for posttranscriptional mechanisms in regulating gene expression during erythropoiesis. These new findings highlight the need to integrate proteomic data into GRNs for a refined understanding of erythropoiesis.Recent findings:Here, we review recent proteomic studies that have furthered our understanding of erythropoiesis with a focus on quantitative mass spectrometry approaches to measure the abundance of transcription factors and cofactors during differentiation. Furthermore, we highlight challenges that remain in integrating transcriptomic, proteomic, and other omics data into a predictive model of erythropoiesis, and discuss the future prospect of single-cell proteomics.Summary:Recent proteomic studies have considerably expanded our knowledge of erythropoiesis beyond the traditional transcriptomic-centric perspective. These findings have both opened up new avenues of research to increase our understanding of erythroid differentiation, while at the same time presenting new challenges in integrating multiple layers of information into a comprehensive gene regulatory model.",33714970,PMC8284871,10.1097/MOH.0000000000000647,4
XCVATR: detection and characterization of variant impact on the Embeddings of single -cell and bulk RNA-sequencing samples,"Background:RNA-sequencing has become a standard tool for analyzing gene activity in bulk samples and at the single-cell level. By increasing sample sizes and cell counts, this technique can uncover substantial information about cellular transcriptional states. Beyond quantification of gene expression, RNA-seq can be used for detecting variants, including single nucleotide polymorphisms, small insertions/deletions, and larger variants, such as copy number variants. Notably, joint analysis of variants with cellular transcriptional states may provide insights into the impact of mutations, especially for complex and heterogeneous samples. However, this analysis is often challenging due to a prohibitively high number of variants and cells, which are difficult to summarize and visualize. Further, there is a dearth of methods that assess and summarize the association between detected variants and cellular transcriptional states.Results:Here, we introduce XCVATR (eXpressed Clusters of Variant Alleles in Transcriptome pRofiles), a method that identifies variants and detects local enrichment of expressed variants within embedding of samples and cells in single-cell and bulk RNA-seq datasets. XCVATR visualizes local ""clumps"" of small and large-scale variants and searches for patterns of association between each variant and cellular states, as described by the coordinates of cell embedding, which can be computed independently using any type of distance metrics, such as principal component analysis or t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding. Through simulations and analysis of real datasets, we demonstrate that XCVATR can detect enrichment of expressed variants and provide insight into the transcriptional states of cells and samples. We next sequenced 2 new single cell RNA-seq tumor samples and applied XCVATR. XCVATR revealed subtle differences in CNV impact on tumors.Conclusions:XCVATR is publicly available to download from https://github.com/harmancilab/XCVATR .",36539717,PMC9764736,10.1186/s12864-022-09004-7,1
scmFormer Integrates Large-Scale Single-Cell Proteomics and Transcriptomics Data by Multi-Task Transformer,"Transformer-based models have revolutionized single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data analysis. However, their applicability is challenged by the complexity and scale of single-cell multi-omics data. Here a novel single-cell multi-modal/multi-task transformer (scmFormer) is proposed to fill up the existing blank of integrating single-cell proteomics with other omics data. Through systematic benchmarking, it is demonstrated that scmFormer excels in integrating large-scale single-cell multimodal data and heterogeneous multi-batch paired multi-omics data, while preserving shared information across batchs and distinct biological information. scmFormer achieves 54.5% higher average F1 score compared to the second method in transferring cell-type labels from single-cell transcriptomics to proteomics data. Using COVID-19 datasets, it is presented that scmFormer successfully integrates over 1.48 million cells on a personal computer. Moreover, it is also proved that scmFormer performs better than existing methods on generating the unmeasured modality and is well-suited for spatial multi-omic data. Thus, scmFormer is a powerful and comprehensive tool for analyzing single-cell multi-omics data.",38483032,PMC11109621,10.1002/advs.202307835,1
Screening cell-cell communication in spatial transcriptomics via collective optimal transport,"Spatial transcriptomic technologies and spatially annotated single-cell RNA sequencing datasets provide unprecedented opportunities to dissect cell-cell communication (CCC). However, incorporation of the spatial information and complex biochemical processes required in the reconstruction of CCC remains a major challenge. Here, we present COMMOT (COMMunication analysis by Optimal Transport) to infer CCC in spatial transcriptomics, which accounts for the competition between different ligand and receptor species as well as spatial distances between cells. A collective optimal transport method is developed to handle complex molecular interactions and spatial constraints. Furthermore, we introduce downstream analysis tools to infer spatial signaling directionality and genes regulated by signaling using machine learning models. We apply COMMOT to simulation data and eight spatial datasets acquired with five different technologies to show its effectiveness and robustness in identifying spatial CCC in data with varying spatial resolutions and gene coverages. Finally, COMMOT identifies new CCCs during skin morphogenesis in a case study of human epidermal development.",36690742,PMC9911355,10.1038/s41592-022-01728-4,35
The single-cell stereo-seq reveals region-specific cell subtypes and transcriptome profiling in Arabidopsis leaves,"Understanding the complex functions of plant leaves requires a thorough characterization of discrete cell features. Although single-cell gene expression profiling technologies have been developed, their application in characterizing cell subtypes has not been achieved yet. Here, we present scStereo-seq (single-cell spatial enhanced resolution omics sequencing) that enabled us to show the bona fide single-cell spatial transcriptome profiles of Arabidopsis leaves. Subtle but significant transcriptomic differences between upper and lower epidermal cells have been successfully distinguished. Furthermore, we discovered cell-type-specific gene expression gradients from the main vein to the leaf edge, which led to the finding of distinct spatial developmental trajectories of vascular cells and guard cells. Our study showcases the importance of physical locations of individual cells for exerting complex biological functions in plants and demonstrates that scStereo-seq is a powerful tool to integrate single-cell location and transcriptome information for plant biology study.",35512702,,10.1016/j.devcel.2022.04.011,44
Single cell sequencing reveals gene expression signatures associated with bone marrow stromal cell subpopulations and time in culture,"Background:Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) are a heterogeneous population that participates in wound healing, immune modulation and tissue regeneration. Next generation sequencing was used to analyze transcripts from single BMSCs in order to better characterize BMSC subpopulations.Methods:Cryopreserved passage 2 BMSCs from one healthy subject were cultured through passage 10. The transcriptomes of bulk BMSCs from designated passages were analyzed with microarrays and RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq). For some passages, single BMSCs were separated using microfluidics and their transcriptomes were analyzed by RNA-Seq.Results:Transcriptome analysis by microarray and RNA-Seq of unseparated BMSCs from passages 2, 4, 6, 8, 9 and 10 yielded similar results; both data sets grouped passages 4 and 6 and passages 9 and 10 together and genes differentially expressed among these early and late passage BMSCs were similar. 3D Diffusion map visualization of single BMSCs from passages 3, 4, 6, 8 and 9 clustered passages 3 and 9 into two distinct groups, but there was considerable overlap for passages 4, 6 and 8 cells. Markers for early passage, FGFR2, and late passage BMSCs, PLAT, were able to identify three subpopulations within passage 3 BMSCs; one that expressed high levels of FGFR2 and low levels of PLAT; one that expressed low levels of FGFR2 and high levels of PLAT and one that expressed intermediate levels of FGFR2 and low levels of PLAT.Conclusions:Single BMSCs can be separated by microfluidics and their transcriptome analyzed by next generation sequencing. Single cell analysis of early passage BMSCs identified a subpopulation of cells expressing high levels of FGFR2 that might include skeletal stem cells.",30635013,PMC6330466,10.1186/s12967-018-1766-2,16
Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of mouse neocortical development,"The development of the mammalian cerebral cortex depends on careful orchestration of proliferation, maturation, and migration events, ultimately giving rise to a wide variety of neuronal and non-neuronal cell types. To better understand cellular and molecular processes that unfold during late corticogenesis, we perform single-cell RNA-seq on the mouse cerebral cortex at a progenitor driven phase (embryonic day 14.5) and at birth-after neurons from all six cortical layers are born. We identify numerous classes of neurons, progenitors, and glia, their proliferative, migratory, and activation states, and their relatedness within and across age. Using the cell-type-specific expression patterns of genes mutated in neurological and psychiatric diseases, we identify putative disease subtypes that associate with clinical phenotypes. Our study reveals the cellular template of a complex neurodevelopmental process, and provides a window into the cellular origins of brain diseases.",30635555,PMC6329831,10.1038/s41467-018-08079-9,116
New insights into human primordial germ cells and early embryonic development from single-cell analysis,"Human preimplantation developmental studies are difficult to accomplish due to associated ethical and moral issues. Preimplantation cells are rare and exist only in transient cell states. From a single cell, it is very challenging to analyse the origination of the heterogeneity and complexity inherent to the human body. However, recent advances in single-cell technology and data analysis have provided new insights into the process of early human development and germ cell specification. In this Review, we examine the latest single-cell datasets of human preimplantation embryos and germ cell development, compare them to bulk cell analyses, and interpret their biological implications.",28627120,,10.1002/1873-3468.12716,4

High-Resolution Transcriptomic Landscape of the Human Submandibular Gland,"Saliva-secreting and transporting cells are part of the complex cellular milieu of the human salivary gland, where they play important roles in normal glandular physiology and diseased states. However, comprehensive molecular characterization, particularly at single-cell resolution, is still incomplete, in part due to difficulty in procuring normal human tissues. Here, we perform an in-depth analysis of male and female adult human submandibular gland (SMG) samples by bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and examine the molecular underpinnings of the heterogeneous cell populations by single-cell (sc) RNA-seq. Our results from scRNA-seq highlight the remarkable diversity of clusters of epithelial and nonepithelial cells that reside in the SMG that is also faithfully recapitulated by deconvolution of the bulk-RNA data sets. Our analyses reveal complex transcriptomic heterogeneity within both the ductal and acinar subpopulations and identify atypical SMG cell types, such as mucoacinar cells that are unique to humans and ionocytes that have been recently described in the mouse. We use CellChat to explore ligand-receptor interactome predictions that likely mediate crucial cell-cell communications between the various cell clusters. Finally, we apply a trajectory inference method to investigate specific cellular branching points and topology that offers insights into the dynamic and complex differentiation process of the adult SMG. The data sets and the analyses herein comprise an extensive wealth of high-resolution information and a valuable resource for a deeper mechanistic understanding of human SMG biology and pathophysiology.",36726292,PMC10249006,10.1177/00220345221147908,5
The promising application of cell-cell interaction analysis in cancer from single-cell and spatial transcriptomics,"Cell-cell interactions instruct cell fate and function. These interactions are hijacked to promote cancer development. Single-cell transcriptomics and spatial transcriptomics have become powerful new tools for researchers to profile the transcriptional landscape of cancer at unparalleled genetic depth. In this review, we discuss the rapidly growing array of computational tools to infer cell-cell interactions from non-spatial single-cell RNA-sequencing and the limited but growing number of methods for spatial transcriptomics data. Downstream analyses of these computational tools and applications to cancer studies are highlighted. We finish by suggesting several directions for further extensions that anticipate the increasing availability of multi-omics cancer data.",37454878,PMC10627116,10.1016/j.semcancer.2023.07.001,7
Single-nucleus and single-cell transcriptomes compared in matched cortical cell types,"Transcriptomic profiling of complex tissues by single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) affords some advantages over single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq). snRNA-seq provides less biased cellular coverage, does not appear to suffer cell isolation-based transcriptional artifacts, and can be applied to archived frozen specimens. We used well-matched snRNA-seq and scRNA-seq datasets from mouse visual cortex to compare cell type detection. Although more transcripts are detected in individual whole cells (~11,000 genes) than nuclei (~7,000 genes), we demonstrate that closely related neuronal cell types can be similarly discriminated with both methods if intronic sequences are included in snRNA-seq analysis. We estimate that the nuclear proportion of total cellular mRNA varies from 20% to over 50% for large and small pyramidal neurons, respectively. Together, these results illustrate the high information content of nuclear RNA for characterization of cellular diversity in brain tissues.",30586455,PMC6306246,10.1371/journal.pone.0209648,226
DNER and GNL2 are differentially m6A methylated in periodontitis in comparison with periodontal health revealed by m6A microarray of human gingival tissue and transcriptomic analysis,"Objective:This study aims to investigate the differences in the epigenomic patterns of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methylation in gingival tissues between patients with periodontitis (PD) and healthy controls, identifying potential biomarkers.Background:As a multifactorial disease, PD involves multiple genetic and environmental effects. The m6A modification is the most prevalent internal mRNA modification and linked to various inflammatory diseases. However, the m6A modification pattern and m6A-related signatures in PD remain unclear.Materials and methods:An m6A microarray of human gingival tissues was conducted in eight subjects: four diagnosed with PD and four healthy controls. Microarray analysis was performed to identify the differentially m6A methylated mRNAs (DMGs) and the differentially expressed mRNAs (DEGs). The differentially methylated and expressed mRNAs (DMEGs) were subjected to functional enrichment analysis by Metascape. The weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) algorithm, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression, and univariate logistic regression were performed to identify potential biomarkers. The cell type localization of the target genes was determined using single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) analysis. The m6A methylation level and gene expression of hub genes were subsequently verified by m6A methylated RNA immunoprecipitation (MeRIP) and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR).Results:In total, 458 DMGs, 750 DEGs, and 279 DMEGs were identified based on our microarray. Pathway analyses conducted for the DMEGs revealed that biological functions were mainly involved in the regulation of stem cell differentiation, ossification, circadian rhythm, and insulin secretion pathways. Besides, the genes involved in crucial biological processes were mainly expressed in fibroblast and epithelial cells. Furthermore, the m6A methylation and expression levels of two hub biomarkers (DNER and GNL2) were validated.Conclusion:The current study exhibited a distinct m6A epitranscriptome, identified and verified two PD-related biomarkers (DNER and GNL2), which may provide novel insights into revealing the new molecular mechanisms and latent targets of PD.",36941720,,10.1111/jre.13117,3
Fine-grained cell-type specific association studies with human bulk brain data using a large single-nucleus RNA sequencing based reference panel,"Brain disorders are leading causes of disability worldwide. Gene expression studies provide promising opportunities to better understand their etiology but it is critical that expression is studied on a cell-type level. Cell-type specific association studies can be performed with bulk expression data using statistical methods that capitalize on cell-type proportions estimated with the help of a reference panel. To create a fine-grained reference panel for the human prefrontal cortex, we performed an integrated analysis of the seven largest single nucleus RNA-seq studies. Our panel included 17 cell-types that were robustly detected across all studies, subregions of the prefrontal cortex, and sex and age groups. To estimate the cell-type proportions, we used an empirical Bayes estimator that substantially outperformed three estimators recommended previously after a comprehensive evaluation of methods to estimate cell-type proportions from brain transcriptome data. This is important as being able to precisely estimate the cell-type proportions may avoid unreliable results in downstream analyses particularly for the multiple cell-types that had low abundances. Transcriptome-wide association studies performed with permuted bulk expression data showed that it is possible to perform transcriptome-wide association studies for even the rarest cell-types without an increased risk of false positives.",37563216,PMC10415334,10.1038/s41598-023-39864-2,2
Computational Methods for Single-cell DNA Methylome Analysis,"Dissecting intercellular epigenetic differences is key to understanding tissue heterogeneity. Recent advances in single-cell DNA methylome profiling have presented opportunities to resolve this heterogeneity at the maximum resolution. While these advances enable us to explore frontiers of chromatin biology and better understand cell lineage relationships, they pose new challenges in data processing and interpretation. This review surveys the current state of computational tools developed for single-cell DNA methylome data analysis. We discuss critical components of single-cell DNA methylome data analysis, including data preprocessing, quality control, imputation, dimensionality reduction, cell clustering, supervised cell annotation, cell lineage reconstruction, gene activity scoring, and integration with transcriptome data. We also highlight unique aspects of single-cell DNA methylome data analysis and discuss how techniques common to other single-cell omics data analyses can be adapted to analyze DNA methylomes. Finally, we discuss existing challenges and opportunities for future development.",35718270,PMC10372927,10.1016/j.gpb.2022.05.007,3
Single cell transcriptomics reveals unique metabolic profiles of ependymoma subgroups,"Objective:Ependymomas are biologically diverse tumors with five major genomic subgroups. However, intratumor heterogeneity continues to be poorly understood. The present study characterized the metabolic landscapes of ependymoma subgroups at the single-cell level.Methods:Expression profiles from 11,200 ependymoma single cells derived from the five major subgroups and 7,200 ependymoma-derived non-neoplastic cells were computationally analyzed using a robust workflow to elucidate relative differences in metabolic pathway activities.Results:Dimensionality reduction using metabolic expression profiles exhibited clustering corresponding to each tumor subgroup, but non-neoplastic cells exhibited no discernable differences between subgroups. From the 80 metabolic pathways examined, over 75 pathways had significantly different activity scores between ependymoma subgroups. Further analysis of metabolic heterogeneity suggests that mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation accounts for considerable metabolic variation within tumor subgroups and non-neoplastic cells of the same cell type. Drug metabolism pathways, specifically those involving cytochromes P450, were also found to be major contributors to heterogeneity.Conclusions:Ependymoma subgroups display distinct metabolic differences as evaluated through gene expression profiles with certain pathways contributing greatly to intra-subgroup variation. These results may account for variation in tumor metabolism, treatment response, and potential targeting approaches that disrupt metabolic signalling.",35143938,,10.1016/j.gene.2022.146278,0
Single-cell transcriptomics identifies Col1a1 and Col1a2 as hub genes in obesity-induced cardiac fibrosis,"Obesity is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, leading to ventricular dysfunction and cardiac fibrosis, in which non-cardiomyocytes (nonCMs) play an important role. Early detection and treatment of heart illness may help to limit its progression. We screened for key markers of obesity-induced cardiac fibrosis using single-cell transcriptomics techniques. To begin, an obese mouse model was constructed using a high-fat diet. From a pathogenic perspective, pathological alterations in the obesity-induced heart were found. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified and functional enrichment analysis was performed. Then, to look for hub genes, key modules of DEGs were built. Finally, the cellular location of the hub genes was investigated. In mice, a high-fat diet raised body weight, messed up myocardial shape, and increased cardiac collagen content. NonCMs transcriptome data revealed 15 different cell types, including fibroblasts, immunological cells, and endothelial cells. There were a total of 33 DEGs found, with 22 up-regulated genes and 11 down-regulated genes. DEGs have a high connection with collagen and extracellular matrix (ECM), according to functional enrichment analysis. Col1a1 and Col1a2 scored well in module analysis and hub gene screening, and were chosen as hub genes. Col1a1 and Col1a2 were shown to be mostly expressed by fibroblasts after localization study. As a result, we believe Col1a1 and Col1a2 may be important markers of obesity-induced cardiac fibrosis, in which fibroblasts play a critical role.",35714568,,10.1016/j.bbrc.2022.06.018,5
RNA-Seq methods for transcriptome analysis,"Deep sequencing has been revolutionizing biology and medicine in recent years, providing single base-level precision for our understanding of nucleic acid sequences in high throughput fashion. Sequencing of RNA, or RNA-Seq, is now a common method to analyze gene expression and to uncover novel RNA species. Aspects of RNA biogenesis and metabolism can be interrogated with specialized methods for cDNA library preparation. In this study, we review current RNA-Seq methods for general analysis of gene expression and several specific applications, including isoform and gene fusion detection, digital gene expression profiling, targeted sequencing and single-cell analysis. In addition, we discuss approaches to examine aspects of RNA in the cell, technical challenges of existing RNA-Seq methods, and future directions.

"Single-cell spatial transcriptomic and translatomic profiling of dopaminergic neurons in health, aging, and disease","The brain is spatially organized and contains unique cell types, each performing diverse functions and exhibiting differential susceptibility to neurodegeneration. This is exemplified in Parkinson's disease with the preferential loss of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta. Using a Parkinson's transgenic model, we conducted a single-cell spatial transcriptomic and dopaminergic neuron translatomic analysis of young and old mouse brains. Through the high resolving capacity of single-cell spatial transcriptomics, we provide a deep characterization of the expression features of dopaminergic neurons and 27 other cell types within their spatial context, identifying markers of healthy and aging cells, spanning Parkinson's relevant pathways. We integrate gene enrichment and genome-wide association study data to prioritize putative causative genes for disease investigation, identifying CASR as a regulator of dopaminergic calcium handling.

Integrative analysis of single-cell embryo data reveals transcriptome signatures for the human pre-implantation inner cell mass,"As the source of embryonic stem cells (ESCs), inner cell mass (ICM) can form all tissues of the embryo proper, however, its role in early human lineage specification remains controversial. Although a stepwise differentiation model has been proposed suggesting the existence of ICM as a distinct developmental stage, the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear. In the present study, we perform an integrated analysis on the public human preimplantation embryonic single-cell transcriptomic data and apply a trajectory inference algorithm to measure the cell plasticity. In our results, ICM population can be clearly discriminated on the dimension-reduced graph and confirmed by compelling evidences, thus validating the two-step hypothesis of lineage commitment. According to the branch probabilities and differentiation potential, we determine the precise time points for two lineage segregations. Further analysis on gene expression dynamics and regulatory network indicates that transcription factors including GSC, PRDM1, and SPIC may underlie the decisions of ICM fate. In addition, new human ICM marker genes, such as EPHA4 and CCR8 are discovered and validated by immunofluorescence. Given the potential clinical applications of ESCs, our analysis provides a further understanding of human ICM cells and facilitates the exploration of more unique characteristics in early human development.",37437860,,10.1016/j.ydbio.2023.07.004,0
Integrative transcriptomic analysis of developing hematopoietic stem cells in human and mouse at single-cell resolution,"Current understanding of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) development comes from mouse models is considered to be evolutionarily conserved in human. However, the cross-species comparison of the transcriptomic profiles of developmental HSCs at single-cell level is still lacking. Here, we performed integrative transcriptomic analysis of a series of key cell populations during HSC development in human and mouse, including HSC-primed hemogenic endothelial cells and pre-HSCs in mid-gestational aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region, and mature HSCs in fetal liver and adult bone marrow. We demonstrated the general similarity of transcriptomic characteristics between corresponding cell populations of the two species. Of note, one of the previously transcriptomically defined hematopoietic stem progenitor cell (HSPC) populations with certain arterial characteristics in AGM region of human embryos showed close transcriptomic similarity to pre-HSCs in mouse embryos. On the other hand, the other two HSPC populations in human AGM region displayed molecular similarity with fetal liver HSPCs, suggesting the maturation in AGM before HSCs colonizing the fetal liver in human, which was different to that in mouse. Finally, we re-clustered cells based on the integrated dataset and illustrated the evolutionarily conserved molecular signatures of major cell populations. Our results revealed transcriptomic conservation of critical cell populations and molecular characteristics during HSC development between human and mouse, providing a resource and theoretic basis for future studies on mammalian HSC development and regeneration by using mouse models.",33930817,,10.1016/j.bbrc.2021.04.058,4
HTCA: a database with an in-depth characterization of the single-cell human transcriptome,"Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) is one of the most used single-cell omics in recent decades. The exponential growth of single-cell data has immense potential for large-scale integration and in-depth explorations that are more representative of the study population. Efforts have been made to consolidate published data, yet extensive characterization is still lacking. Many focused on raw-data database constructions while others concentrate mainly on gene expression queries. Hereby, we present HTCA (www.htcatlas.org), an interactive database constructed based on ∼2.3 million high-quality cells from ∼3000 scRNA-seq samples and comprised in-depth phenotype profiles of 19 healthy adult and matching fetal tissues. HTCA provides a one-stop interactive query to gene signatures, transcription factor (TF) activities, TF motifs, receptor-ligand interactions, enriched gene ontology (GO) terms, etc. across cell types in adult and fetal tissues. At the same time, HTCA encompasses single-cell splicing variant profiles of 16 adult and fetal tissues, spatial transcriptomics profiles of 11 adult and fetal tissues, and single-cell ATAC-sequencing (scATAC-seq) profiles of 27 adult and fetal tissues. Besides, HTCA provides online analysis tools to perform major steps in a typical scRNA-seq analysis. Altogether, HTCA allows real-time explorations of multi-omics adult and fetal phenotypic profiles and provides tools for a flexible scRNA-seq analysis.",36130266,PMC9825435,10.1093/nar/gkac791,10
SuperCT: a supervised-learning framework for enhanced characterization of single-cell transcriptomic profiles,"Characterization of individual cell types is fundamental to the study of multicellular samples. Single-cell RNAseq techniques, which allow high-throughput expression profiling of individual cells, have significantly advanced our ability of this task. Currently, most of the scRNA-seq data analyses are commenced with unsupervised clustering. Clusters are often assigned to different cell types based on the enriched canonical markers. However, this process is inefficient and arbitrary. In this study, we present a technical framework of training the expandable supervised-classifier in order to reveal the single-cell identities as soon as the single-cell expression profile is input. Using multiple scRNA-seq datasets we demonstrate the superior accuracy, robustness, compatibility and expandability of this new solution compared to the traditional methods. We use two examples of the model upgrade to demonstrate how the projected evolution of the cell-type classifier is realized.",30799483,PMC6486558,10.1093/nar/gkz116,23
Microanatomy of the metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) by single-cell transcriptomics,"Background:Metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) is a major cause of liver disease worldwide and comprises non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Due to the high prevalence and poor prognosis of NASH, it is critical to identify and treat patients at risk. However, the aetiology and mechanisms remain largely unknown, warranting further analysis.Methods:We first identified differential genes in NASH by single-cell analysis of the GSE129516 dataset and conducted expression profiling data analysis of the GSE184019 dataset from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Then single-cell trajectory reconstruction and analysis, immune gene score, cellular communication, key gene screening, functional enrichment analysis, and immune microenvironment analysis were carried out. Finally, cell experiments were performed to verify the role of key genes in NASH.Results:We conducted transcriptome profiling of 30,038 single cells, including hepatocytes and non-hepatocytes from normal and steatosis adult mouse livers. Comparative analysis of hepatocytes and non-hepatocytes revealed pronounced heterogeneity as non-hepatocytes acted as major cell-communication hubs. The results showed that Hspa1b, Tfrc, Hmox1 and Map4k4 could effectively distinguish NASH tissues from normal samples. The results of scRNA-seq and qPCR indicated that the expression levels of hub genes in NASH were significantly higher than in normal cells or tissues. Further immune infiltration analysis showed significant differences in M2 macrophage distribution between healthy and metabolic-associated fatty liver samples.Conclusions:Our results suggest that Hspa1b, Tfrc, Hmox1 and Map4k4 have huge prospects as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for NASH and may be potential therapeutic targets for NASH.",36847649,,10.1080/1061186X.2023.2185626,1
Single-Cell RNA Sequencing with Spatial Transcriptomics of Cancer Tissues,"Single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) techniques can perform analysis of transcriptome at the single-cell level and possess an unprecedented potential for exploring signatures involved in tumor development and progression. These techniques can perform sequence analysis of transcripts with a better resolution that could increase understanding of the cellular diversity found in the tumor microenvironment and how the cells interact with each other in complex heterogeneous cancerous tissues. Identifying the changes occurring in the genome and transcriptome in the spatial context is considered to increase knowledge of molecular factors fueling cancers. It may help develop better monitoring strategies and innovative approaches for cancer treatment. Recently, there has been a growing trend in the integration of RNA-seq techniques with contemporary omics technologies to study the tumor microenvironment. There has been a realization that this area of research has a huge scope of application in translational research. This review article presents an overview of various types of single-cell RNA-seq techniques used currently for analysis of cancer tissues, their pros and cons in bulk profiling of transcriptome, and recent advances in the techniques in exploring heterogeneity of various types of cancer tissues.

The high spatial resolution of these approaches further allows determination of the spatial organizations of the genome and transcriptome inside cells, both of which are key regulatory mechanisms for gene expression.",33408406,PMC9805800,10.1038/s41592-020-01037-8,80
High-Throughput Single-Cell Transcriptome Profiling of Plant Cell Types,"Single-cell transcriptome profiling of heterogeneous tissues can provide high-resolution windows into developmental dynamics and environmental responses, but its application to plants has been limited. Here, we used the high-throughput Drop-seq approach to profile >12,000 cells from Arabidopsis roots. This identified numerous distinct cell types, covering all major root tissues and developmental stages, and illuminated specific marker genes for these populations. In addition, we demonstrate the utility of this approach to study the impact of environmental conditions on developmental processes. Analysis of roots grown with or without sucrose supplementation uncovers changes in the relative frequencies of cell types in response to sucrose. Finally, we characterize the transcriptome changes that occur across endodermis development and identify nearly 800 genes with dynamic expression as this tissue differentiates. Collectively, we demonstrate that single-cell RNA-seq can be used to profile developmental processes in plants and show how they can be altered by external stimuli.",31091459,PMC6758921,10.1016/j.celrep.2019.04.054,137
Comprehensive Integration of Single-Cell Data,"Single-cell transcriptomics has transformed our ability to characterize cell states, but deep biological understanding requires more than a taxonomic listing of clusters. As new methods arise to measure distinct cellular modalities, a key analytical challenge is to integrate these datasets to better understand cellular identity and function. Here, we develop a strategy to ""anchor"" diverse datasets together, enabling us to integrate single-cell measurements not only across scRNA-seq technologies, but also across different modalities. After demonstrating improvement over existing methods for integrating scRNA-seq data, we anchor scRNA-seq experiments with scATAC-seq to explore chromatin differences in closely related interneuron subsets and project protein expression measurements onto a bone marrow atlas to characterize lymphocyte populations. Lastly, we harmonize in situ gene expression and scRNA-seq datasets, allowing transcriptome-wide imputation of spatial gene expression patterns. Our work presents a strategy for the assembly of harmonized references and transfer of information across datasets.",31178118,PMC6687398,10.1016/j.cell.2019.05.031,5862
SD2: spatially resolved transcriptomics deconvolution through integration of dropout and spatial information,"Motivation:Unveiling the heterogeneity in the tissues is crucial to explore cell-cell interactions and cellular targets of human diseases. Spatial transcriptomics (ST) supplies spatial gene expression profile which has revolutionized our biological understanding, but variations in cell-type proportions of each spot with dozens of cells would confound downstream analysis. Therefore, deconvolution of ST has been an indispensable step and a technical challenge toward the higher-resolution panorama of tissues.Results:Here, we propose a novel ST deconvolution method called SD2 integrating spatial information of ST data and embracing an important characteristic, dropout, which is traditionally considered as an obstruction in single-cell RNA sequencing data (scRNA-seq) analysis. First, we extract the dropout-based genes as informative features from ST and scRNA-seq data by fitting a Michaelis-Menten function. After synthesizing pseudo-ST spots by randomly composing cells from scRNA-seq data, auto-encoder is applied to discover low-dimensional and non-linear representation of the real- and pseudo-ST spots. Next, we create a graph containing embedded profiles as nodes, and edges determined by transcriptional similarity and spatial relationship. Given the graph, a graph convolutional neural network is used to predict the cell-type compositions for real-ST spots. We benchmark the performance of SD2 on the simulated seqFISH+ dataset with different resolutions and measurements which show superior performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods. SD2 is further validated on three real-world datasets with different ST technologies and demonstrates the capability to localize cell-type composition accurately with quantitative evidence. Finally, ablation study is conducted to verify the contribution of different modules proposed in SD2.Availability and implementation:The SD2 is freely available in github (https://github.com/leihouyeung/SD2) and Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7024684).Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",36063455,PMC9789790,10.1093/bioinformatics/btac605,4
SLICE: determining cell differentiation and lineage based on single cell entropy,"A complex organ contains a variety of cell types, each with its own distinct lineage and function. Understanding the lineage and differentiation state of each cell is fundamentally important for the ultimate delineation of organ formation and function. We developed SLICE, a novel algorithm that utilizes single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) to quantitatively measure cellular differentiation states based on single cell entropy and predict cell differentiation lineages via the construction of entropy directed cell trajectories. We validated our approach using three independent data sets with known lineage and developmental time information from both Homo sapiens and Mus musculus. SLICE successfully measured the differentiation states of single cells and reconstructed cell differentiation trajectories that have been previously experimentally validated. We then applied SLICE to scRNA-seq of embryonic mouse lung at E16.5 to identify lung mesenchymal cell lineage relationships that currently remain poorly defined. A two-branched differentiation pathway of five fibroblastic subtypes was predicted using SLICE. The present study demonstrated the general applicability and high predictive accuracy of SLICE in determining cellular differentiation states and reconstructing cell differentiation lineages in scRNA-seq analysis.",27998929,PMC5397210,10.1093/nar/gkw1278,75

Integrating spatial and single-cell transcriptomics data using deep generative models with SpatialScope,"The rapid emergence of spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies is revolutionizing our understanding of tissue spatial architecture and biology. Although current ST methods, whether based on next-generation sequencing (seq-based approaches) or fluorescence in situ hybridization (image-based approaches), offer valuable insights, they face limitations either in cellular resolution or transcriptome-wide profiling. To address these limitations, we present SpatialScope, a unified approach integrating scRNA-seq reference data and ST data using deep generative models. With innovation in model and algorithm designs, SpatialScope not only enhances seq-based ST data to achieve single-cell resolution, but also accurately infers transcriptome-wide expression levels for image-based ST data. We demonstrate SpatialScope's utility through simulation studies and real data analysis from both seq-based and image-based ST approaches. SpatialScope provides spatial characterization of tissue structures at transcriptome-wide single-cell resolution, facilitating downstream analysis, including detecting cellular communication through ligand-receptor interactions, localizing cellular subtypes, and identifying spatially differentially expressed genes.",38030617,PMC10687049,10.1038/s41467-023-43629-w,1
Unravelling fibrosis using single-cell transcriptomics,"Fibrosis, the excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix, is a major global healthcare burden.

However, recent developments in the rapidly evolving field of single-cell transcriptomics are enabling the interrogation of individual pathogenic cell populations in the context of fibrosis at unprecedented resolution. In this review, we will discuss how single-cell transcriptomics is driving this step change in our understanding of fibrotic disease pathogenesis, and how these cutting-edge approaches should accelerate the precise identification of novel, relevant and potentially druggable therapeutic targets to treat patients with fibrosis.",31670054,,10.1016/j.coph.2019.09.004,4
SoupX removes ambient RNA contamination from droplet-based single-cell RNA sequencing data,"Background:Droplet-based single-cell RNA sequence analyses assume that all acquired RNAs are endogenous to cells. However, any cell-free RNAs contained within the input solution are also captured by these assays. This sequencing of cell-free RNA constitutes a background contamination that confounds the biological interpretation of single-cell transcriptomic data.Results:We demonstrate that contamination from this ""soup"" of cell-free RNAs is ubiquitous, with experiment-specific variations in composition and magnitude. We present a method, SoupX, for quantifying the extent of the contamination and estimating ""background-corrected"" cell expression profiles that seamlessly integrate with existing downstream analysis tools. Applying this method to several datasets using multiple droplet sequencing technologies, we demonstrate that its application improves biological interpretation of otherwise misleading data, as well as improving quality control metrics.Conclusions:We present SoupX, a tool for removing ambient RNA contamination from droplet-based single-cell RNA sequencing experiments. This tool has broad applicability, and its application can improve the biological utility of existing and future datasets.",33367645,PMC7763177,10.1093/gigascience/giaa151,397
Comparative developmental genomics of sex-biased gene expression in early embryogenesis across mammals,"Background:Mammalian gonadal sex is determined by the presence or absence of a Y chromosome and the subsequent production of sex hormones contributes to secondary sexual differentiation. However, sex chromosome-linked genes encoding dosage-sensitive transcription and epigenetic factors are expressed well before gonad formation and have the potential to establish sex-biased expression that persists beyond the appearance of gonadal hormones. Here, we apply a comparative bioinformatics analysis on a pair of published single-cell datasets from mouse and human during very early embryogenesis-from two-cell to pre-implantation stages-to characterize sex-specific signals and to assess the degree of conservation among early acting sex-specific genes and pathways.Results:Clustering and regression analyses of gene expression across samples reveal that sex initially plays a significant role in overall gene expression patterns at the earliest stages of embryogenesis which potentially may be the byproduct of signals from male and female gametes during fertilization. Although these transcriptional sex effects rapidly diminish, sex-biased genes appear to form sex-specific protein-protein interaction networks across pre-implantation stages in both mammals providing evidence that sex-biased expression of epigenetic enzymes may establish sex-specific patterns that persist beyond pre-implantation. Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) on male and female transcriptomes generated clusters of genes with similar expression patterns across sex and developmental stages, including post-fertilization, epigenetic, and pre-implantation ontologies conserved between mouse and human. While the fraction of sex-differentially expressed genes (sexDEGs) in early embryonic stages is similar and functional ontologies are conserved, the genes involved are generally different in mouse and human.Conclusions:This comparative study uncovers much earlier than expected sex-specific signals in mouse and human embryos that pre-date hormonal signaling from the gonads. These early signals are diverged with respect to orthologs yet conserved in terms of function with important implications in the use of genetic models for sex-specific disease.",37208698,PMC10199522,10.1186/s13293-023-00520-z,0
Transcriptomic and epigenetic dissection of spinal ependymoma (SP-EPN) identifies clinically relevant subtypes enriched for tumors with and without NF2 mutation,"Ependymomas encompass multiple clinically relevant tumor types based on localization and molecular profiles. Tumors of the methylation class ""spinal ependymoma"" (SP-EPN) represent the most common intramedullary neoplasms in children and adults. However, their developmental origin is ill-defined, molecular data are scarce, and the potential heterogeneity within SP-EPN remains unexplored. The only known recurrent genetic events in SP-EPN are loss of chromosome 22q and NF2 mutations, but neither types and frequency of these alterations nor their clinical relevance have been described in a large, epigenetically defined series. Transcriptomic (n = 72), epigenetic (n = 225), genetic (n = 134), and clinical data (n = 112) were integrated for a detailed molecular overview on SP-EPN. Additionally, we mapped SP-EPN transcriptomes to developmental atlases of the developing and adult spinal cord to uncover potential developmental origins of these tumors. The integration of transcriptomic ependymoma data with single-cell atlases of the spinal cord revealed that SP-EPN display the highest similarities to mature adult ependymal cells. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of transcriptomic data together with integrated analysis of methylation profiles identified two molecular SP-EPN subtypes. Subtype A tumors primarily carried previously known germline or sporadic NF2 mutations together with 22q loss (bi-allelic NF2 loss), resulting in decreased NF2 expression. Furthermore, they more often presented as multilocular disease and demonstrated a significantly reduced progression-free survival as compared to SP-EP subtype B. In contrast, subtype B predominantly contained samples without NF2 mutation detected in sequencing together with 22q loss (monoallelic NF2 loss). These tumors showed regular NF2 expression but more extensive global copy number alterations. Based on integrated molecular profiling of a large multi-center cohort, we identified two distinct SP-EPN subtypes with important implications for genetic counseling, patient surveillance, and drug development priorities.",38265489,PMC10808175,10.1007/s00401-023-02668-9,1
"Single-cell triple omics sequencing reveals genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptomic heterogeneity in hepatocellular carcinomas","Single-cell genome, DNA methylome, and transcriptome sequencing methods have been separately developed. However, to accurately analyze the mechanism by which transcriptome, genome and DNA methylome regulate each other, these omic methods need to be performed in the same single cell. Here we demonstrate a single-cell triple omics sequencing technique, scTrio-seq, that can be used to simultaneously analyze the genomic copy-number variations (CNVs), DNA methylome, and transcriptome of an individual mammalian cell. We show that large-scale CNVs cause proportional changes in RNA expression of genes within the gained or lost genomic regions, whereas these CNVs generally do not affect DNA methylation in these regions. Furthermore, we applied scTrio-seq to 25 single cancer cells derived from a human hepatocellular carcinoma tissue sample. We identified two subpopulations within these cells based on CNVs, DNA methylome, or transcriptome of individual cells. Our work offers a new avenue of dissecting the complex contribution of genomic and epigenomic heterogeneities to the transcriptomic heterogeneity within a population of cells.",26902283,PMC4783472,10.1038/cr.2016.23,288
Cilo-seq: highly sensitive cell-in-library-out single-cell transcriptome sequencing with digital microfluidics,"Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) plays a critical role in revealing genetic expression patterns at the single-cell level for cell type identification and rare transcript detection. Although there have been great advances in scRNA-seq methodologies, existing technologies still suffer from complexity and high cost, and an integrated platform for complete library construction is still lacking. Herein we describe Cilo-seq for high-performance scRNA-seq library construction in a single device with programmed and addressable droplet handling based on digital microfluidics. The platform is simultaneously accessible for convenient single-cell isolation, efficient nucleic acid amplification, low-loss nucleic acid purification and high-quality library preparation by leveraging specific interface design, tiny reaction volume, auxiliary magnetic field control and accurate droplet control. With a closed hydrophobic interface, the platform further reduces nucleic acid loss and exogenous background interference. Cilo-seq provides excellent detection sensitivity (1.4-fold improvement over tube-based methods), accuracy (R= 0.98) and cost efficiency (10-fold decrease in cost compared to tube-based methods), and holds great promise for studies of single-cell RNA biology.",35439800,,10.1039/d2lc00167e,5
Current Status and Prospects of the Single-Cell Sequencing Technologies for Revealing the Pathogenesis of Pregnancy-Associated Disorders,"Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a method that focuses on the analysis of gene expression profile in individual cells. This method has been successfully applied to answer the challenging questions of the pathogenesis of multifactorial diseases and open up new possibilities in the prognosis and prevention of reproductive diseases. In this article, we have reviewed the application of scRNA-seq to the analysis of the various cell types and their gene expression changes in normal pregnancy and pregnancy complications. The main principle, advantages, and limitations of single-cell technologies and data analysis methods are described. We discuss the possibilities of using the scRNA-seq method for solving the fundamental and applied tasks related to various pregnancy-associated disorders. Finally, we provide an overview of the scRNA-seq findings for the common pregnancy-associated conditions, such as hyperglycemia in pregnancy, recurrent pregnancy loss, preterm labor, polycystic ovary syndrome, and pre-eclampsia.",36981026,PMC10048492,10.3390/genes14030756,0
Comprehensive Integration of Multiple Single-Cell Transcriptomic Data Sets Defines Distinct Cell Populations and Their Phenotypic Changes in Murine Atherosclerosis,"Background:The application of single-cell transcriptomic (single-cell RNA sequencing) analysis to the study of atherosclerosis has provided unique insights into the molecular and genetic mechanisms that mediate disease risk and pathophysiology. However, nonstandardized methodologies and relatively high costs associated with the technique have limited the size and replication of existing data sets and created disparate or contradictory findings that have fostered misunderstanding and controversy.Methods:To address these uncertainties, we have performed a conservative integration of multiple published single-cell RNA sequencing data sets into a single meta-analysis, performed extended analysis of native resident vascular cells, and used in situ hybridization to map the disease anatomic location of the identified cluster cells. To investigate the transdifferentiation of smooth muscle cells to macrophage phenotype, we have developed a classifying algorithm based on the quantification of reporter transgene expression.Results:The reporter gene expression tool indicates that within the experimental limits of the examined studies, transdifferentiation of smooth muscle cell to the macrophage lineage is extremely rare. Validated transition smooth muscle cell phenotypes were defined by clustering, and the location of these cells was mapped to lesion anatomy with in situ hybridization. We have also characterized 5 endothelial cell phenotypes and linked these cellular species to different vascular structures and functions. Finally, we have identified a transcriptomically unique cellular phenotype that constitutes the aortic valve.Conclusions:Taken together, these analyses resolve a number of outstanding issues related to differing results reported with vascular disease single-cell RNA sequencing studies, and significantly extend our understanding of the role of resident vascular cells in anatomy and disease.",38152886,,10.1161/ATVBAHA.123.320030,0
Single Cell Self-Paced Clustering with Transcriptome Sequencing Data,"Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) allows researchers to explore tissue heterogeneity, distinguish unusual cell identities, and find novel cellular subtypes by providing transcriptome profiling for individual cells. Clustering analysis is usually used to predict cell class assignments and infer cell identities. However, the performance of existing single-cell clustering methods is extremely sensitive to the presence of noise data and outliers. Existing clustering algorithms can easily fall into local optimal solutions. There is still no consensus on the best performing method. To address this issue, we introduce a single cell self-paced clustering (scSPaC) method with F-norm based nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) for scRNA-seq data and a sparse single cell self-paced clustering (sscSPaC) method with l21-norm based nonnegative matrix factorization for scRNA-seq data. We gradually add single cells from simple to complex to our model until all cells are selected. In this way, the influences of noisy data and outliers can be significantly reduced. The proposed method achieved the best performance on both simulation data and real scRNA-seq data. A case study about human clara cells and ependymal cells scRNA-seq data clustering shows that scSPaC is more advantageous near the clustering dividing line.",35409258,PMC8999118,10.3390/ijms23073900,0
Protocol for Patch-Seq of Small Interneurons,"Obtaining electrophysiological recordings and gene expression information from the same neuron (Patch-seq) brings forward a unique opportunity to study the transcriptional correlates of functional properties and vice versa. Here, we provide a detailed Patch-seq protocol tailored to the specialized demands of studying small interneurons. Focusing on the technically demanding process of transitioning between patch recordings and cell extraction, our protocol describes and troubleshoots steps for successfully collecting small interneurons, allowing for multi-modal Patch-seq interrogation of this crucial cell type.",33377040,PMC7757288,10.1016/j.xpro.2020.100146,5
[Application prospects of single-cell transcriptome sequencing in traditional Chinese medicine research],"Single-cell transcriptome sequencing(scRNA-seq) can be used to analyze the expression characteristics of the transcriptome at the level of individual cell, and discover the heterogeneity of gene expression in individual cell that is &quot;diluted&quot; or averaged in study of group organization. The scRNA-seq, with the characteristics of standardization, high-throughput, and high integration, can greatly simplify the experimental operation and significantly reduce the consumption of reagents. At the same time, a variety of cells are screened and the gene expression patterns are analyzed at the single-cell level to provide a more efficient detection technique and more rich and accurate information for drug research. In the field of traditional Chinese medicine(TCM), the scRNA-seq is still a new technology, but the individual and precision concepts embodied by scRNA-seq and the theory of TCM syndrome differentiation and treatment have reached the same effect between the micro and macro aspects. This study tried to broaden the thinking for the modernization of TCM by introducing the development of scRNA-seq technology and its application in modern drug research and discussing the application prospects of scRNA-seq in TCM research.",34047090,,10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20210218.601,1
Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals the transcriptomic characteristics of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in hepatitis B vaccine non-responders,"The emergence of a vaccine against hepatitis B has proven to be an important milestone in the prevention of this disease; however, 5%-10% of vaccinated individuals do not generate an immune response to the vaccine, and its molecular mechanism has not been clarified. In this study, single-cell RNA sequencing was performed on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from three volunteers with a high immune response (HR) and three with no immune response (NR) to the hepatitis B vaccine. We found that the antigen-presenting activity scores of various antigen-presenting cells, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway activity scores of naive B cells, and the cell activity scores of three types of effector T cells were significantly decreased, whereas the cytotoxicity scores of CD3highCD16lowKLRG1highnatural killer T (NKT) cells were significantly increased in the NR group compared with those in the HR group. Additionally, the expression levels of some classical molecules associated with distinct signaling pathways-includingHLA-B,HLA-DRB5,BLNK,BLK,IL4R,SCIMP,JUN,CEBPB,NDFIP1, andTXNIP-were significantly reduced in corresponding subsets of PBMCs from the NR group relative to those of the HR group. Furthermore, the expression of several cytotoxicity-related effector molecules, such asGNLY,NKG7,GZMB,GZMM,KLRC1,KLRD1,PRF1,CST7, andCTSW, was significantly higher in CD3highCD16lowKLRG1highNKT cells derived from non-responders. Our study provides a molecular basis for the lack of response to the hepatitis B vaccine, including defective antigen presentation, decreased T cell activity, and reduced IL-4 secretion, as well as novel insight into the role of NKT cells in the immune response to the hepatitis B vaccine.",37593735,PMC10431960,10.3389/fimmu.2023.1091237,1
Bacterial Single Cell Whole Transcriptome Amplification in Microfluidic Platform Shows Putative Gene Expression Heterogeneity,"Single cell RNA sequencing is a technology that provides the capability of analyzing the transcriptome of a single cell from a population. So far, single cell RNA sequencing has been focused mostly on human cells due to the larger starting amount of RNA template for subsequent amplification. One of the major challenges of applying single cell RNA sequencing to microbial cells is to amplify the femtograms of the RNA template to obtain sufficient material for downstream sequencing with minimal contamination. To achieve this goal, efforts have been focused on multiround RNA amplification, but would introduce additional contamination and bias. In this work, we for the first time coupled a microfluidic platform with multiple displacement amplification technology to perform single cell whole transcriptome amplification and sequencing of Porphyromonas somerae, a microbe of interest in endometrial cancer, as a proof-of-concept demonstration of using single cell RNA sequencing tool to unveil gene expression heterogeneity in single microbial cells. Our results show that the bacterial single-cell gene expression regulation is distinct across different cells, supporting widespread heterogeneity.",31188565,PMC8422856,10.1021/acs.analchem.8b04773,15
dropEst: pipeline for accurate estimation of molecular counts in droplet-based single-cell RNA-seq experiments,"Recent single-cell RNA-seq protocols based on droplet microfluidics use massively multiplexed barcoding to enable simultaneous measurements of transcriptomes for thousands of individual cells. The increasing complexity of such data creates challenges for subsequent computational processing and troubleshooting of these experiments, with few software options currently available. Here, we describe a flexible pipeline for processing droplet-based transcriptome data that implements barcode corrections, classification of cell quality, and diagnostic information about the droplet libraries. We introduce advanced methods for correcting composition bias and sequencing errors affecting cellular and molecular barcodes to provide more accurate estimates of molecular counts in individual cells.",29921301,PMC6010209,10.1186/s13059-018-1449-6,86
Collection of cells for single-cell RNA sequencing using high-resolution fluorescence microscopy,"FACS sorting followed by single-cell RNA-sequencing (SORT-Seq) is a popular procedure to select cells of interest for single-cell transcriptomics. However, FACS is not suitable for measurement of subcellular distribution of fluorescence or for small samples (<1,000 cells). The VYCAP puncher system overcomes these limitations. Here, we describe a workflow to capture, image, and collect fluorescent human retina pigment epithelium cells for SORT-Seq using this system. The workflow can be used for any cell type with a diameter of ∼5-50 μm. For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to Segeren et al.

LAST-seq: single-cell RNA sequencing by direct amplification of single-stranded RNA without prior reverse transcription and second-strand synthesis,"Existing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) methods rely on reverse transcription (RT) and second-strand synthesis (SSS) to convert single-stranded RNA into double-stranded DNA prior to amplification, with the limited RT/SSS efficiency compromising RNA detectability. Here, we develop a new scRNA-seq method, Linearly Amplified Single-stranded-RNA-derived Transcriptome sequencing (LAST-seq), which directly amplifies the original single-stranded RNA molecules without prior RT/SSS. LAST-seq offers a high single-molecule capture efficiency and a low level of technical noise for single-cell transcriptome analyses. Using LAST-seq, we characterize transcriptional bursting kinetics in human cells, revealing a role of topologically associating domains in transcription regulation.",37559123,PMC10413806,10.1186/s13059-023-03025-5,0
Spatial transcriptomics and single-nucleus RNA sequencing reveal a transcriptomic atlas of adult human spinal cord,"Despite the recognized importance of the spinal cord in sensory processing, motor behaviors, and neural diseases, the underlying organization of neuronal clusters and their spatial location remain elusive. Recently, several studies have attempted to define the neuronal types and functional heterogeneity in the spinal cord using single-cell or single-nucleus RNA sequencing in animal models or developing humans. However, molecular evidence of cellular heterogeneity in the adult human spinal cord is limited. Here, we classified spinal cord neurons into 21 subclusters and determined their distribution from nine human donors using single-nucleus RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics. Moreover, we compared the human findings with previously published single-nucleus data of the adult mouse spinal cord, which revealed an overall similarity in the neuronal composition of the spinal cord between the two species while simultaneously highlighting some degree of heterogeneity. Additionally, we examined the sex differences in the spinal neuronal subclusters. Several genes, such asSCN10AandHCN1, showed sex differences in motor neurons. Finally, we classified human dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons using spatial transcriptomics and explored the putative interactions between DRG and spinal cord neuronal subclusters. In summary, these results illustrate the complexity and diversity of spinal neurons in humans and provide an important resource for future research to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying spinal cord physiology and diseases.",38289829,PMC10945563,10.7554/eLife.92046,0
Resolving plant development in space and time with single-cell genomics,"Single-cell genomics technologies are ushering in a new research era. In this review, we summarize the benefits and current challenges of using these technologies to probe the transcriptional regulation of plant development. In addition to profiling cells at a single snapshot in time, researchers have recently produced time-resolved datasets to map cell responses to stimuli. Live-imaging and spatial transcriptomic techniques are rapidly being adopted to link a cell's transcriptional profile with its spatial location within a tissue. Combining these technologies is a powerful spatiotemporal approach to investigate cell plasticity and developmental responses that contribute to plant resilience. Although there are hurdles to overcome, we conclude by discussing how single-cell genomics is poised to address developmental questions in the coming years.",37696725,,10.1016/j.pbi.2023.102444,1
Structurally Conserved Primate LncRNAs Are Transiently Expressed during Human Cortical Differentiation and Influence Cell-Type-Specific Genes,"The cerebral cortex has expanded in size and complexity in primates, yet the molecular innovations that enabled primate-specific brain attributes remain obscure. We generated cerebral cortex organoids from human, chimpanzee, orangutan, and rhesus pluripotent stem cells and sequenced their transcriptomes at weekly time points for comparative analysis. We used transcript structure and expression conservation to discover gene regulatory long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). Of 2,975 human, multi-exonic lncRNAs, 2,472 were structurally conserved in at least one other species and 920 were conserved in all. Three hundred eighty-six human lncRNAs were transiently expressed (TrEx) and many were also TrEx in great apes (46%) and rhesus (31%). Many TrEx lncRNAs are expressed in specific cell types by single-cell RNA sequencing. Four TrEx lncRNAs selected based on cell-type specificity, gene structure, and expression pattern conservation were ectopically expressed in HEK293 cells by CRISPRa. All induced trans gene expression changes were consistent with neural gene regulatory activity.",30639214,PMC6372947,10.1016/j.stemcr.2018.12.006,31
Quantitation of mRNA Transcripts and Proteins Using the BD Rhapsody™ Single-Cell Analysis System,"In this review, we describe the BD Rhapsody™ Single-Cell Analysis System, a platform that allows high-throughput capture of nucleic acids from single cells using a simple cartridge workflow and a multitier barcoding system. The resulting captured information can be used to generate various types of next-generation sequencing (NGS) libraries, including whole transcriptome analysis for discovery biology and targeted RNA analysis for high sensitivity transcript detection. The BD Rhapsody system can be used with emerging applications, such as BD™ AbSeq assays, to profile gene expression in both mRNA and protein level to provide ultra-high resolution analysis of single cells.",30968361,,10.1007/978-981-13-6037-4_5,37
RNA Sequencing of Single Human Islet Cells Reveals Type 2 Diabetes Genes,"Pancreatic islet cells are critical for maintaining normal blood glucose levels, and their malfunction underlies diabetes development and progression. We used single-cell RNA sequencing to determine the transcriptomes of 1,492 human pancreatic α, β, δ, and PP cells from non-diabetic and type 2 diabetes organ donors. We identified cell-type-specific genes and pathways as well as 245 genes with disturbed expression in type 2 diabetes. Importantly, 92% of the genes have not previously been associated with islet cell function or growth. Comparison of gene profiles in mouse and human α and β cells revealed species-specific expression. All data are available for online browsing and download and will hopefully serve as a resource for the islet research community.",27667665,,10.1016/j.cmet.2016.08.018,289
Bioinformatic Methods for the Analysis of High-Throughput RNA Sequencing in Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi,"RNA-seq is a powerful method for transcriptome profiling that allows the detection of total RNA present in a single cell, tissues, or organs. mRNA-seq is focused on protein-coding RNAs, and results in large datasets of reads, or portion of sequenced mRNA that can be assembled back to the original transcripts to reconstruct a virtual gene catalog. Studies on the biology of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) often took great advantage of mRNA-seq, and several attempts to decipher their coding potential relied on de novo transcriptome assembly. As the transcriptional profile of an organism is modulated depending on cell types, and in response to specific biological conditions, mRNA-seq is an attractive approach to study the physiology of AMF, which are axenically unculturable and genetically intractable. mRNA-seq analyses require bioinformatic workflows to manipulate the huge amount of raw data generated by the sequencing run, with several crucial steps (e.g., library trimming, reads mapping, normalization, and differential expression calculation) which can strongly affect the final results. Here, we propose a standard workflow for de novo transcriptome assembly and differential expression calculation for AMF, which considers the most common technical issues of working in the absence of reference sequences and with mixed biological samples.",32415601,,10.1007/978-1-0716-0603-2_11,0
geneBasis: an iterative approach for unsupervised selection of targeted gene panels from scRNA-seq,"scRNA-seq datasets are increasingly used to identify gene panels that can be probed using alternative technologies, such as spatial transcriptomics, where choosing the best subset of genes is vital. Existing methods are limited by a reliance on pre-existing cell type labels or by difficulties in identifying markers of rare cells. We introduce an iterative approach, geneBasis, for selecting an optimal gene panel, where each newly added gene captures the maximum distance between the true manifold and the manifold constructed using the currently selected gene panel. Our approach outperforms existing strategies and can resolve cell types and subtle cell state differences.",34872616,PMC8650258,10.1186/s13059-021-02548-z,11
The art of using t-SNE for single-cell transcriptomics,"Single-cell transcriptomics yields ever growing data sets containing RNA expression levels for thousands of genes from up to millions of cells. Common data analysis pipelines include a dimensionality reduction step for visualising the data in two dimensions, most frequently performed using t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (t-SNE). It excels at revealing local structure in high-dimensional data, but naive applications often suffer from severe shortcomings, e.g. the global structure of the data is not represented accurately. Here we describe how to circumvent such pitfalls, and develop a protocol for creating more faithful t-SNE visualisations. It includes PCA initialisation, a high learning rate, and multi-scale similarity kernels; for very large data sets, we additionally use exaggeration and downsampling-based initialisation. We use published single-cell RNA-seq data sets to demonstrate that this protocol yields superior results compared to the naive application of t-SNE.",31780648,PMC6882829,10.1038/s41467-019-13056-x,284
scMultiGAN: cell-specific imputation for single-cell transcriptomes with multiple deep generative adversarial networks,"The emergence of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology has revolutionized the identification of cell types and the study of cellular states at a single-cell level. Despite its significant potential, scRNA-seq data analysis is plagued by the issue of missing values. Many existing imputation methods rely on simplistic data distribution assumptions while ignoring the intrinsic gene expression distribution specific to cells. This work presents a novel deep-learning model, named scMultiGAN, for scRNA-seq imputation, which utilizes multiple collaborative generative adversarial networks (GAN). Unlike traditional GAN-based imputation methods that generate missing values based on random noises, scMultiGAN employs a two-stage training process and utilizes multiple GANs to achieve cell-specific imputation. Experimental results show the efficacy of scMultiGAN in imputation accuracy, cell clustering, differential gene expression analysis and trajectory analysis, significantly outperforming existing state-of-the-art techniques. Additionally, scMultiGAN is scalable to large scRNA-seq datasets and consistently performs well across sequencing platforms. The scMultiGAN code is freely available at https://github.com/Galaxy8172/scMultiGAN.",37903416,PMC11020228,10.1093/bib/bbad384,0
