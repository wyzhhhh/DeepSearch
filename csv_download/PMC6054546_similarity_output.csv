10.1007/978-3-030-66014-7_9,Age-Related Macular Degeneration: From Epigenetics to Therapeutic Implications.,2021.0,"Aberrant regulation of epigenetic mechanisms, including the two most common        types; DNA methylation and histone modification have been implicated in common        chronic progressive conditions, including Alzheimer disease, cardiovascular        disease, and age-related macular degeneration (AMD). All these conditions are        complex, meaning that environmental factors, genetic factors, and their        interactions play a role in disease pathophysiology. Although genome wide        association studies (GWAS), and studies on twins demonstrate the        genetic/hereditary component to these complex diseases, including AMD, this        contribution is much less than 100%. Moreover, the contribution of the hereditary        component decreases in the advanced, later onset forms of these chronic diseases        including AMD. This underscores the need to elucidate how the genetic and        environmental factors function to exert their influence on disease        pathophysiology. By teasing out epigenetic mechanisms and how they exert their        influence on AMD, therapeutic targets can be tailored to prevent and/or slow down        disease progression. Epigenetic studies that incorporate well-characterized        patient tissue samples (including affected tissues and peripheral blood), similar        to those relevant to gene expression studies, along with genetic and        epidemiological information, can be the first step in developing appropriate        functional assays to validate findings and identify potential therapies.",0c5347e1a4c561b4ffd7b8c1d0f27ae213e93613,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0c5347e1a4c561b4ffd7b8c1d0f27ae213e93613,33848004,,,False,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,121103,0.6130049228668213,0.18478260869565216,4,3.65,0.24528301886792453,0.1320754716981132,0.3144182939232129
10.3389/fcell.2023.1149132,The role of epigenetic methylation/demethylation in the regulation of retinal        photoreceptors.,2023.0,"Photoreceptors are integral and crucial for the retina, as they convert light        into electrical signals. Epigenetics plays a vital role in determining the        precise expression of genetic information in space and time during the        development and maturation of photoreceptors, cell differentiation, degeneration,        death, and various pathological processes. Epigenetic regulation has three main        manifestations: histone modification, DNA methylation, and RNA-based mechanisms,        where methylation is involved in two regulatory mechanisms-histone methylation        and DNA methylation. DNA methylation is the most studied form of epigenetic        modification, while histone methylation is a relatively stable regulatory        mechanism. Evidence suggests that normal methylation regulation is essential for        the growth and development of photoreceptors and the maintenance of their        functions, while abnormal methylation can lead to many pathological forms of        photoreceptors. However, the role of methylation/demethylation in regulating        retinal photoreceptors remains unclear. Therefore, this study aims to review the        role of methylation/demethylation in regulating photoreceptors in various        physiological and pathological situations and discuss the underlying mechanisms        involved. Given the critical role of epigenetic regulation in gene expression and        cellular differentiation, investigating the specific molecular mechanisms        underlying these processes in photoreceptors may provide valuable insights into        the pathogenesis of retinal diseases. Moreover, understanding these mechanisms        could lead to the development of novel therapies that target the epigenetic        machinery, thereby promoting the maintenance of retinal function throughout an        individual's lifespan.",3cb401e2978de68d1c3597f7c727d5b5cc278695,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3cb401e2978de68d1c3597f7c727d5b5cc278695,37305686,PMC10251769,background,False,Frontiers in cell and developmental biology,101630250,0.5881797075271606,0.2803738317757009,2,6.081,0.1320754716981132,0.5660377358490566,0.393320426100504
10.1016/j.semcdb.2019.04.001,Epigenetics in neuronal regeneration.,2020.0,"Damage to neuronal tissues in mammals leads to permanent loss of tissue function        that can have major health consequences. While mammals have no inherent        regenerative capacity to functionally repair neuronal tissue, other species such        as amphibians and teleost fish readily replace damaged tissue. The exploration of        development and native regeneration can thus inform the process of inducing        regeneration in non-regenerative systems, which can be used to develop new        therapeutics. Increasing evidence points to an epigenetic component in the        regulation of the changes in cellular gene expression necessary for regeneration.        In this review, we compare evidence of epigenetic roles in development and        regeneration of neuronal tissue. We have focused on three key systems of        important clinical significance: the neural retina, the inner ear, and the spinal        cord in regenerative and non-regenerative species. While evidence for epigenetic        regulation of regeneration is still limited, changes in DNA accessibility,        histone acetylation and DNA methylation have all emerged as key elements in this        process. To date, most studies have used broadly acting experimental        manipulations to establish a role for epigenetics in regeneration, but the advent        of more targeted approaches to modify the epigenome will be critical to        dissecting the relative contributions of these regulatory factors in this process        and the development of methods to stimulate the regeneration in those organisms        like ourselves where only limited regeneration occurs in these neural systems.",f639739e1d25d28cd8539b355d7399c25c01b37f,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f639739e1d25d28cd8539b355d7399c25c01b37f,30951894,PMC6952058,background,True,Seminars in cell & developmental biology,9607332,0.4892518222332001,0.21176470588235294,29,7.499,0.9056603773584906,0.7924528301886793,0.48619841015497667

The development and survival of hair cells are highly controlled        processes. When cells face intracellular and environmental stimuli, epigenetic        regulation controls the structure and function of the genome in response to        different cell fates. During sensory hair cell development, different histone        modifications can induce normal numbers of functional hair cells to generate.        When individuals are exposed to environmental-related hair cell damage,        epigenetic modification also plays a significant role in the regulation of hair        cell fate. Since mammalian hair cells cannot regenerate, their loss can cause        permanent sensorineural hearing loss. Many breakthroughs have been achieved in        recent years in understanding the signaling pathways that determine hair cell        regeneration, and it is fascinating to note that epigenetic regulation plays a        significant role in hair cell regeneration.

Therefore, the study of epigenetic changes is very important to understand the        regulatory mechanism of genes at the molecular, cellular, tissue and organ        levels. DNA methylation is one of the most studied epigenetic modifications,        which plays an important role in maintaining genome stability and ensuring normal        growth and development. Studies have shown that methylation levels in bovine        primordial germ cells, the rearrangement of methylation during embryonic        development and abnormal methylation during placental development are all closely        related to their reproductive processes. In addition, the application of bovine        male sterility and assisted reproductive technology is also related to DNA        methylation. This review introduces the principle, development of detection        methods and application conditions of DNA methylation, with emphasis on the        relationship between DNA methylation dynamics and bovine spermatogenesis,        embryonic development, disease resistance and muscle and fat development, in        order to provide theoretical basis for the application of DNA methylation in        cattle breeding in the future.",5d580ca252ced8d1815865f8fb11afb4f238ac57,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5d580ca252ced8d1815865f8fb11afb4f238ac57,37569258,PMC10419045,,False,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,0.4039194881916046,0.02027027027027027,8,6.208,0.5849056603773585,0.6037735849056604,0.3075858413580423
10.3389/fgene.2022.827274,The Potential Role of Epigenetic Mechanisms in the Development of Retinitis        Pigmentosa and Related Photoreceptor Dystrophies.,2022.0,"Retinitis pigmentosa and related photoreceptor dystrophies (RPRPD) are rare        retinal diseases caused by hereditary gene mutations resulting in photoreceptor        death, followed by vision loss. While numerous genes involved in these diseases        have been identified, many cases have still not been associated with any gene,        indicating that new mechanisms may be involved in the pathogenesis of these        photoreceptor dystrophies. Many genes associated with RPRPD regulate        photoreceptor specification and maturation in the developing retina. Since        retinal development begins with a population of equivalent, proliferating retinal        progenitor cells (RPCs) having a specific ""competence"" in generating all types of        retinal neurons, including cone and rod photoreceptors, we tested the epigenetic        changes in promoters of genes required for photoreceptor development and genes        associated with RPRPD during RPC differentiation into cone and rod        photoreceptors. We found that promoters of many of these genes are epigenetically        repressed in RPCs but have no epigenetic restrictions in photoreceptors. Our        findings also suggest that DNA methylation as an epigenetic mark, and DNA        demethylation as a process, are more important than other epigenetic marks or        mechanisms in the pathogenesis of these diseases. Most notably, irregularities in        the DNA demethylation process during the RPC-to-photoreceptor transition may        significantly contribute to retinitis pigmentosa (RP) pathogenesis since genes        with hypermethylated promoters in RPCs account for at least 40% of autosomal        recessive RP cases and at least 30% of autosomal dominant RP cases. Thus, we        proposed an epigenetic model according to which unsuccessful demethylation of        regulatory sequences (e.g., promoters, enhancers) of genes required for        photoreceptor development, maturation, and function during the        RPC-to-photoreceptor transition may reduce or even eliminate their activity,        leading to RPRPD without any inheritable mutations in these genes.",2ec00657da916fd05a2e6b39033e92864268e34d,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2ec00657da916fd05a2e6b39033e92864268e34d,35360866,PMC8961674,,False,Frontiers in genetics,101560621,0.3434518277645111,0.0967741935483871,10,4.772,0.6981132075471698,0.2830188679245283,0.28891503706946287

We aimed at elucidating the role of novel        DNA methylation modifications in diabetic retinopathy (DR) in patients with type        2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) using an extreme phenotypic design. METHODS/RESULTS:        Two consecutive studies were conducted. A cross-sectional study using an extreme        phenotypic design was conducted to identify rare methylation modifications that        might contribute to DR pathogenesis.

Our aim was to describe the possible effects of these        compounds when administered during pregnancy on the developing embryo and fetus        or, if administered postnatally, their effects on the developing child. These        substances are able to modify gene expression and possibly alleviate        neurobehavioral changes in disturbances that have epigenetic origins, such as        autism spectrum disorder (ASD), depression, Rett syndrome, and fetal alcohol        spectrum disorder (FASD). Valproic acid and SAMe are antagonistic epigenetic        modulators whether administered in utero or postnatally. However, VPA is a major        human teratogen and, whenever possible, should not be used by pregnant women.        Most currently relevant data come from experimental animal studies that aimed to        explore the possibility of using these substances as epigenetic modifiers and        possible therapeutic agents.

In        humans, however, substantial technical and ethical constraints on fetal sampling        have curtailed safe, pathogenic exploration during gestation. Evidence consistent        with in utero origins for PCOS in humans has thus been slow to amass, but the        balance now leans toward developmental fetal origins. Given that PCOS is familial        and highly heritable, difficulties encountered in discerning genetic        contributions to PCOS pathogenesis are puzzling and, to date, accounts for <10%        of PCOS presentations. Unaccounted heritability notwithstanding, molecular        commonality in pathogenic mechanisms is emerging, suggested by co-occurrence at        the same gene loci of (1) PCOS genetic variants (PCOS women), (2) epigenetic        alterations in DNA methylation (PCOS women), and (3) bioinformatics, gene        networks-identified, epigenetic alterations in DNA methylation (female rhesus        monkeys exposed to testosterone (T) in utero). In addition, naturally occurring        hyperandrogenism in female monkeys singles out individuals with PCOS-like        reproductive and metabolic traits accompanied by somatic biomarkers of in utero T        exposure.

A total of 304,761 divergent DNase I-hypersensitive sites        (DHSs) are identified between rhesus macaques and humans, although many of these        sites share conserved DNA sequences. Interestingly, most of the cis-elements        linked to orthologous genes with dynamic expression are divergent DHSs.        Orthologous genes expressed at earlier stages tend to have conserved        cis-elements, whereas orthologous genes specifically expressed at later stages        seldom have conserved cis-elements. These genes are enriched in synapse        organization, learning and memory. Notably, DHSs in the PFC at early stages are        linked to human educational attainment and cognitive performance.

H3K4me3 has been reported to regulate rod photoreceptor differentiation;        however, the roles H3K4me3 plays in retinal progenitor cell (RPC) proliferation        and differentiation during early retinal development remain unclear. METHODS:        Using an in vitro retinal explant culture system, we suppressed the expression of        Setd1a by introducing shSetd1a. We examined the expression level and H3K4me3        level of genes by RNA Sequencing and ChIP assay, respectively. RESULTS: We found        that Setd1a depletion resulted in increased apoptosis and proliferation failure        in late RPCs. Expression of wild-type SETD1A, but not SETD1A that lacked the        catalytic SET domain, reversed the shSetd1a-induced phenotype. RNA Sequencing        revealed that proliferation-related genes were downregulated upon shSetd1a        expression. Based on publicly available H3K4me3-ChIP sequencing data of retinal        development, we identified Uhrf1 as a candidate target gene of Setd1a. The        expression of shSetd1a led to a decrease in Uhrf1 transcript levels and reduced        H3K4me3 levels at the Uhrf1 locus. Increased apoptosis and the suppression of        proliferation in late RPCs were observed in retinal explants expressing shUhrf1,        similar to the outcomes observed in shSetd1a-expressing retinas. The        overexpression of UHRF1 did not rescue shSetd1a-induced apoptosis, but reversed        the suppression of proliferation. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that Setd1a        contributes to the survival and proliferation of retinal cells by regulating        histone methylation, Setd1a regulates Uhrf1 expression, and these two molecules        cooperate to regulate RPC survival and proliferation.",e01967d21877efee30c81ce4b49ead055335272b,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e01967d21877efee30c81ce4b49ead055335272b,33938913,PMC8107498,,False,Investigative ophthalmology & visual science,7703701,0.20705434679985046,0.23214285714285715,4,4.925,0.3018867924528302,0.32075471698113206,0.2483696733121923

The mice were flown for 37 days in animal enclosure        modules on the International Space Station; ground-based control animals were        maintained under similar housing conditions. Mouse retinas were isolated and both        DNA methylome and transcriptome were determined by deep sequencing.

Early studies of genomic        aberrations in RB have provided a valuable insight into how RB can progress        following the tumor-initiating RB1 mutations and have established a notion that        inactivation of RB1 gene is critical to initiate RB but this causative genetic        lesion alone is not sufficient for malignant progression. With the advent of        high-throughput sequencing technologies, we now have access to the comprehensive        genomic and epigenetic landscape of RB and have come to appreciate that RB        tumorigenesis requires both genetic and epigenetic alterations that might be        directly or indirectly driven by RB1 loss. This integrative perspective on RB        tumorigenesis has inspired research efforts to better understand the types and        functions of epigenetic mechanisms contributing to RB development, leading to the        identification of multiple epigenetic regulators misregulated in RB in recent        years. A complete understanding of the intricate network of genetic and        epigenetic factors in modulation of gene expression during RB tumorigenesis        remains a major challenge but would be crucial to translate these findings into        therapeutic interventions.

The data was analyzed using Hidden Markov Model- and change        point-based methods to identify methylome states in different segments of the        studied genomes following genome annotation. We found that promoters of rod and        cone phototransduction genes and rod photoreceptor genes, but not genes required        for the development and function of other retinal phenotypes, were highly        methylated in DNA isolated from human and murine fetal retinas (which mostly        contain RPCs) and postnatal murine RPCs. While these highly methylated genomic        regions were inherited by non-photoreceptor phenotypes during RPC        differentiation, the methylation of these promoters was significantly reduced        during RPC differentiation into photoreceptors and accompanied by increased        expression of these genes. Our analysis of DNA methylation during embryogenesis        revealed low methylation levels in genomic regions containing photoreceptor genes        at the inner cell mass stage, but a sharp increase in methylation at the epiblast        stage, which remained the same later on (except for DNA demethylation in        photoreceptors). Thus, our data suggest that the DNA demethylation pathway is        required for photoreceptor phenotypes in the developing retina.

Endoplasmic reticulum oxidoreductase 1α (ERO1α) is an oxidase that exists        in the luminal side of the ER membrane, participating in protein folding and        secretion and inhibiting apoptosis, but the underlying mechanism on liver injury        induced by homocysteine (Hcy) remains obscure. In this study,        hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) mice model was established in cbs(+/-) mice by        feeding a high-methionine diet for 12 weeks; and cbs(+/-) mice fed with        high-methionine diet exhibited more severe liver injury compared to cbs(+/+)        mice. Mechanistically, we found that Hcy promoted ER stress and apoptosis of        hepatocytes and thereby aggravated liver injury through inhibiting ERO1α        expression; accordingly, overexpression of ERO1α remarkably alleviated ER stress        and apoptosis of hepatocytes induced by Hcy. Epigenetic modification analysis        revealed that Hcy significantly increased levels of DNA methylation and H3 lysine        9 dimethylation (H3K9me2) on ERO1α promoter, which attributed to upregulated DNA        methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) and G9a, respectively. Further study showed that        DNMT1 and G9a cooperatively regulated ERO1α expression in hepatocytes exposed to        Hcy.

METHODS:        DNA methylation data, mRNA expression data, and the corresponding clinical        information of HCC were downloaded from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA, tissue        sample) database. HCC patients with cirrhosis were divided into two groups        according to the presence of NAFLD. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and        differentially methylated genes (DMGs) were obtained. RESULTS: By overlapping 79        up-regulated genes and 1020 hypomethylated genes, we obtained 5        hypomethylated-highly expressed genes (Hypo-HGs). By overlapping 365        down-regulated genes and 481 hypermethylated genes, we identified 13        hypermethylated-lowly expressed genes (Hyper-LGs). Survival analysis of these 18        MDEGs indicated that the expression of DGKK and HOXD9 was significantly        correlated with the overall survival time of NAFLD patients. CONCLUSIONS: We        identified several candidate genes whose expressions were regulated by DNA        methylation of NAFLD of HCC with cirrhosis, which may provide a new field in        understanding the clinical pathological mechanism of NAFLD of HCC with cirrhosis.",5908a729f2e5caa08ae6c7532a65ae4fdc19c618,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5908a729f2e5caa08ae6c7532a65ae4fdc19c618,36397165,PMC9673405,background,False,World journal of surgical oncology,101170544,0.06828854233026505,0.0,0,3.253,0.018867924528301886,0.11320754716981132,0.04029788345379649

Studies have demonstrated        that DNA methylation is critical in retinal development, aging, and disorders.        The current work investigated the effects and underlying mechanism of        5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC), a suppressor of DNA methylation, in the        pathological progression of CNV. METHODS: The DNA methylation profiles of retinal        pigment epithelial (RPE)/choroidal complexes in normal and laser-induced CNV mice        were assessed by Arraystar Mouse RefSeq Promoter Arrays. The CNV area and blood        flow density and intensity were observed by optical coherence tomography        angiography, and fluorescence leakage was examined by fundus fluorescein        angiography in CNV mice with systemic administration of 5-aza-dC. The effects of        5-aza-dC on the biological functions of bEnd.3 cells were estimated by related        assays. Notum gene promoter methylation was measured using bisulfite sequencing        PCR. Methyltransferases and Wnt signaling-related genes were detected in animal        and cell culture experiments by real-time PCR and immunoblot. RESULTS:        Methyltransferases were upregulated, but Notum (a secretion inhibitor of Wnt        signaling) was downregulated in the RPE/choroidal complexes of mice with        experimental CNV. Intraperitoneal injection of 5-aza-dC inactivated the Wnt        pathway and ameliorated the lesion area and the intensity and density of blood        flow, as well as the degree of leakage in CNV. In vitro, vascular endothelial        growth factor A (VEGFA) stimulation promoted methyltransferases expression and        suppressed Notum expression, consequently activating Wnt signaling, whereas        exogenous 5-aza-dC reversed VEGFA-induced hyperpermeability, proliferation,        migration, and tube formation in bEnd.3 cells via demethylation of Notum        promoter. CONCLUSIONS: We observed that 5-aza-dC attenuates the growth of CNV by        inhibiting the Wnt signaling pathway via promoter demethylation of the Wnt        antagonist Notum. These findings provide a theoretical basis for        methylation-based treatment with the Notum gene as a potential target for CNV        treatment.",283cf0e778d31851ac322d4ce11eb72fea1a7ed1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/283cf0e778d31851ac322d4ce11eb72fea1a7ed1,38345554,PMC10866157,background,False,Investigative ophthalmology & visual science,7703701,0.06717857718467712,0.05084745762711865,1,4.925,0.07547169811320754,0.33962264150943394,0.10275670714964683

DNA methylation has been implicated in many diseases.        However, its involvement in lip tissue from NSCLP is not well understood. This        study aimed to investigate the role of dysregulated DNA methylation in NSCLP. DNA        methylation profile was determined in eight injured and five self-normal lip        tissue samples from children with NSCLP by whole-genome bisulfite sequencing. A        total of 2,711 differentially methylated regions (DMRs), corresponding to 1,231        genes were identified. Given the important role of promoter methylation in        regulating gene expression, the promoter DMR-related genes were considered.        Bioinformatics analysis demonstrated that some of them showed potential        associations with NSCLP. Therefore, the well-known NSCLP susceptibility gene, GLI        family zinc finger 2 (GLI2) with an unknown role in its DNA methylation in NSCLP,        was selected for further analysis. The promoter hypomethylation and higher mRNA        expression level of GLI2 were observed in injured lip tissues by verification in        additional samples. Moreover, dual luciferase reporter assay indicated that        promoter hypermethylation of GLI2 inhibited its transcription. Overall, this        study suggested that abnormal DNA methylation in lip tissue may be correlated        with the pathogenesis of congenital NSCLP.",5f066783329e61da572eaf11eb2cec63279e81ec,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5f066783329e61da572eaf11eb2cec63279e81ec,36210532,PMC10092010,background,False,Birth defects research,101701004,0.06693419814109802,0.0,2,2.661,0.16981132075471697,0.07547169811320754,0.05687271227251808

Methyl-CpG binding domain protein 2 (Mbd2) is one of the DNA methylation readers.        Its role and mechanism of regulation remain unclear. The ischemia/reperfusion        (I/R) model in mice primary culture retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and Mbd2        knockout (Mbd2-KO) mice was used in the current study. We demonstrated that Mbd2        mediates RGC apoptosis caused by I/R injury. Mechanistically, the data suggested        that Mbd2 upregulated Mbd2-associated long noncoding RNA 1 (Mbd2-AL1) via        demethylation of its promoter. Furthermore, Mbd2-AL1 sponged microRNA        (miR)-188-3p, thus preventing tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated        factor 3 (Traf3) downregulation and inducing RGC apoptosis. This was further        demonstrated by the fact that inhibition of miR-188-3p diminished the        anti-apoptosis role of Mbd2-AL1 small interfering RNA (siRNA). Finally, it showed        that the apoptosis of retinal cells was attenuated, and the visual function was        preserved in Mbd2-KO mice, which were associated with the        Mbd2-AL1/miR-188-3p/Traf3 axis.

While        it is a familial and highly prevalent endocrine disorder, progress towards a cure        is hindered by absence of a definitive pathogenic mechanism and lack of an animal        model of naturally occurring PCOS. AREAS COVERED: These include an overview of        PCOS and its potential etiology, and an examination of insights gained into its        pathogenic origins. Animal models derived from experimentally-induced        hyperandrogenism during gestation, or from naturally-occurring PCOS-like traits,        most reliably demonstrate reproductive, neuroendocrine and metabolic        pathogenesis. EXPERT OPINION: Genetic studies, while identifying at least 17 PCOS        risk genes, account for <10% of women with PCOS. A number of PCOS risk genes        involve regulation of gonadotropin secretion or action, suggesting a reproductive        neuroendocrine basis for PCOS pathogenesis. Consistent with this notion, a number        of animal models employing fetal androgen excess demonstrate epigenetic induction        of PCOS-like traits, including reproductive neuroendocrine and metabolic        dysfunction. Monkey models are most comprehensive, while mouse models provide        molecular insight, including identifying the androgen receptor, particularly in        neurons, as mediating androgen-induced PCOS-like programming. Naturally-occurring        female hyperandrogenism is also demonstrated in monkeys.

10.3390/cells9081896,Advances in Therapeutic Targeting of Cancer Stem Cells within the Tumor        Microenvironment: An Updated Review.,2020.0,"Despite great strides being achieved in improving cancer patients' outcomes        through better therapies and combinatorial treatment, several hurdles still        remain due to therapy resistance, cancer recurrence and metastasis. Drug        resistance culminating in relapse continues to be associated with fatal disease.        The cancer stem cell theory posits that tumors are driven by specialized cancer        cells called cancer stem cells (CSCs). CSCs are a subpopulation of cancer cells        known to be resistant to therapy and cause metastasis. Whilst the debate on        whether CSCs are the origins of the primary tumor rages on, CSCs have been        further characterized in many cancers with data illustrating that CSCs display        great abilities to self-renew, resist therapies due to enhanced epithelial to        mesenchymal (EMT) properties, enhanced expression of ATP-binding cassette (ABC)        membrane transporters, activation of several survival signaling pathways and        increased immune evasion as well as DNA repair mechanisms. CSCs also display        great heterogeneity with the consequential lack of specific CSC markers        presenting a great challenge to their targeting. In this updated review we        revisit CSCs within the tumor microenvironment (TME) and present novel treatment        strategies targeting CSCs. These promising strategies include targeting        CSCs-specific properties using small molecule inhibitors, immunotherapy, microRNA        mediated inhibitors, epigenetic methods as well as targeting CSC        niche-microenvironmental factors and differentiation. Lastly, we present recent        clinical trials undertaken to try to turn the tide against cancer by targeting        CSC-associated drug resistance and metastasis.",1f84234268c468805ed698fac3872e34f229947c,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1f84234268c468805ed698fac3872e34f229947c,32823711,PMC7464860,,False,Cells,101600052,0.06131153553724289,0.002044989775051125,78,7.666,0.9622641509433962,0.8490566037735849,0.2909095697787405

Disruptor of telomeric silencing 1-like (Dot1L) is the catalytic enzyme        required for histone H3K79 methylation which has been demonstrated to play a role        in transcriptional activation. However, the functions of Dot1L in the process of        cardiac fibrosis still remain unknown. RESULTS: In the present study, we found        that endogenous Dot1L is upregulated in cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) treated with        angiotensin II (Ang II) or transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, along with        elevated extracellular matrix (ECM) such as fibronectin, collagen I and III.        Silencing or inhibiting Dot1L mitigated Ang II-induced myofibroblast generation        and fibrogenesis. We identified the transcription factor-forkhead box O (FoxO) 3a        as a novel substrate of Dot1L, the transcriptional activating mark H3K79me3 level        on the promoter of FoxO3a was increase in activated-CFs, and inhibition of Dot1L        markedly decreased FoxO3a transcription accompanied by a significant decrease in        the expression of fibrogenic gene. Knockdown of FoxO3a could alleviate ECM        deposition induced by Ang II, on the contrary, overexpression FoxO3a resulting in        CFs activation. Consistently, in vivo Dot1L ablation rescued myocardial        ischemia-induced cardiac fibrosis and improved cardiac function. CONCLUSIONS: Our        findings conclude that upregulation of Dot1L results in activation of the cardiac        fibroblasts to promote profibrotic gene, eventually causes cardiac fibrosis.

It is known that diabetes-induced        cardiac fibrosis is a key pathogenic factor contributing topathological changes        in DCM. However, pathogenetic mechanisms underlying diabetes cardiac fibrosis        arestill elusive. Recent studies have indicated that noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) play        a key role in diabetescardiac fibrosis. The increasing complexity of epigenetic        regulator poses great challenges to ourconventional conceptions regarding how        ncRNAs regulate diabetes cardiac fibrosis.

Considering the relatively limited effect of therapy        on early AMD, it is important to focus on the pathogenesis of AMD, especially        early AMD. Ageing is one of the strongest risk factors for AMD, and analysis of        the impact of ageing on AMD development is valuable. Among all the ageing        hallmarks, increased DNA damage accumulation is regarded as the beginning of        cellular senescence and is related to abnormal expression of inflammatory        cytokines, which is called the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP).        The exact pathway for DNA damage that triggers senescence-associated hallmarks is        poorly understood. Recently, mounting evidence has shown that the cGAS/STING        pathway is an important DNA sensor related to proinflammatory factor secretion        and is associated with another hallmark of ageing, SASP.

Bevacizumab alone did not        significantly alter HDAC activity, but increased gene expression of SOD2,        BCL2L13, CASPASE-3, and IL-18 and caused downregulation of HIF-1α and IL-18.        Combination of bevacizumab plus TSA increased gene expression of SOD2, HIF-1α,        GPX3A, BCL2L13, and CASPASE-3, and reduced CASPASE-9 and IL-β. In conclusion, we        demonstrated that anti-VEGF drugs can: (1) alter expression of genes involved in        oxidative stress (GPX3A and SOD2), inflammation (IL-18 and IL-1β) and apoptosis        (BCL2L13, CASPASE-3, and CASPASE-9), and (2) TSA-induced deacetylation altered        transcription for angiogenesis (HIF-1α), apoptosis, and inflammation genes.",809057bc13901996444f79511c3f4cf55be4328e,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/809057bc13901996444f79511c3f4cf55be4328e,33921543,PMC8069662,background,False,Cells,101600052,0.042166538536548615,0.06818181818181818,9,7.666,0.660377358490566,0.8679245283018868,0.2691679718525598

DNA methylation chip was used to analyze abnormal methylation sites among        penetrating and non-penetrating intestinal mucosa tissue of Crohn's disease and        normal intestinal mucosa tissue of healthy controls. Methylation abnormalities of        different locus were verified by pyrosequencing and quantitative polymerase chain        reaction. Differential DNA methylation sites were participated in the positive        regulation of apoptosis and the positive regulation of IL-8 production and were        enriched in signaling pathways related to inflammatory bowel disease and        extracellular matrix receptor interaction signaling pathways.

METHODS: Four independent DNA methylation        datasets for HCC were used to screen for common differentially methylated genes        (CDMGs). Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and        Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis were used to explore the biological        roles of CDMGs in HCC. Univariate Cox analysis and least absolute shrinkage and        selection operator (LASSO) Cox analysis were performed to identify        survival-related CDMGs (SR-CDMGs) and to build a predictive model. The importance        of this model was assessed using Cox regression analysis, propensity        score-matched (PSM) analysis and stratification analysis. A validation group from        the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) was constructed to further validate the model.        RESULTS: Four SR-CDMGs were identified and used to build the predictive model.        The risk score of this model was calculated as follows: risk score = (0.01489826        × methylation level of WDR69) + (0.15868618 × methylation level of HOXB4) +        (0.16674959 × methylation level of CDKL2) + (0.16689301 × methylation level of        HOXA10).

Using an in vitro retinal explant culture        system, we previously revealed the role of Jmjd3 in the development of rod        bipolar cells; however, the roles of Jmjd3 in the development of early-born        retinal cells are unknown due to limitations concerning the use of retinal        explant culture systems. In this study, we investigated the roles of Jmjd3 in the        development of early-born retinal cells. METHODS: We examined retina-specific        conditional Jmjd3 knockout (Jmjd3-cKO) mice using immunohistochemistry and        quantitative reverse transcription PCR and JMJD3 binding to a target locus by        chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis. RESULTS: We observed reductions in        amacrine cells (ACs) and horizontal cells (HCs), as well as lowered expression        levels of several transcription factors involved in the development of ACs and        HCs in the Jmjd3-cKO mouse retina. JMJD3 bound the promoter regions of these        transcription factors. Notably, an elevated number of retinal ganglion cells        (RGCs) was observed at embryonic stages, whereas RGCs were moderately reduced at        later postnatal stages in the Jmjd3-cKO retina.

IRDs are mainly caused by a loss of the post-mitotic        photoreceptor neurons of the retina, or by the degeneration of the retinal        pigment epithelium. Unfortunately, once these cells are damaged, it is        irreversible and leads to permanent vision impairment. Thought to be previously        incurable, gene therapy has been rapidly evolving to be a potential treatment to        prevent further degeneration of the retina and preserve visual function. The        development of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats        (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) base and prime editors have increased        the capabilities of the genome editing toolbox in recent years. Both base and        prime editors evade the creation of double-stranded breaks in deoxyribonucleic        acid (DNA) and the requirement of donor template of DNA for repair, which make        them advantageous methods in developing clinical therapies.

We have discovered that Aldh1l1 is specifically        expressed in the major macroglia of the retina, Müller glia, and, unlike the        brain, is not expressed in retinal astrocytes. This allows use of Aldh1l1 cre        drivers and Nuclear Tagging and Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification        (NuTRAP) constructs for temporally controlled labeling and paired analysis of        Müller glia epigenomes and translatomes. As validated through a variety of        approaches, the Aldh1l1cre/ERT2-NuTRAP model provides Müller glia specific        translatomic and epigenomic profiles without the need to isolate whole cells.        Application of this approach to models of acute injury (optic nerve crush) and        chronic stress (aging) uncovered few common Müller glia-specific transcriptome        changes in inflammatory pathways, and mostly differential signatures for each        stimulus. The expression of members of the IL-6 and integrin-linked kinase        signaling pathways was enhanced in Müller glia in response to optic nerve crush        but not aging. Unique changes in neuroinflammation and fibrosis signaling        pathways were observed in response to aging but not with optic nerve crush. The        Aldh1l1cre/ERT2-NuTRAP model allows focused molecular analyses of a single,        minority cell type within the retina, providing more substantial effect sizes        than whole tissue analyses.

Here, our goal was to investigate the precise role of        methyl-CpG binding domain protein 2 (Mbd2) in the apoptosis of retinal ganglion        cells (RGCs) in the early diabetic retina. Mbd2 was significantly upregulated        after high glucose (HG) treatment and played a proapoptotic role in RGCs during        HG-induced apoptosis. Combining ChIP and gene microarray datasets, the results        showed that Mbd2 possessed potential binding sites for miR-345-5p, thereby        elevating the expression levels of miR-345-5p via the enhancement of promoter        demethylation. Activating transcription factor 1 (Atf1) played an anti-apoptotic        role during the process of apoptosis in RGCs and acted as the target gene for        miR-345-5p. Furthermore, the number of surviving RGCs in the diabetic retina was        increased in Mbd2-knockout mice when compared with wild-type mice and the visual        function became better accordingly. Collectively, our data demonstrated that the        HG-induced overexpression of Mbd2 in the retina was partly responsible for the        apoptosis of retinal neuronal cells through the miR-345-5p/Atf1 axis.

The unbalanced acetylation and        deacetylation of histones have been implicated in AMD pathogenesis or hydrogen        peroxide (H(2)O(2))-induced cell damage. Therefore, strategies aimed at        controlling the balance between acetylation and deacetylation may effectively        protect RPE cells from oxidative damage. Artemisinin is an antimalarial lactone        drug derived from Artemisia annua, with antioxidant activity known to modulate        histone acetylation in the brain, but its effect on the retina is unknown. In        this study, we aimed to investigate whether Artemisinin exerts a cytoprotective        effect on oxidative stress-induced apoptosis in RPE cells by regulating histone        acetylation. We hypothesized that Artemisinin confers cytoprotection toward        H(2)O(2)-induced apoptosis in RPE cells through this mechanism. In the present        study, we found that Artemisinin at a sub-clinic dosage of 20 μM inhibited the        H(2)O(2)-induced cell viability decrease and B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) protein        level decrease and attenuated the H(2)O(2)-induced decrease in the histone H4        lysine (Lys) 8 acetylation [Acetyl-H4 (Lys 8)] level in the retinal RPE cell line        D407. As expected, histone deacetylase inhibitor Trichostatin A at the        concentration of 250 nM increased the Acetyl-H4 (Lys 8) level in D407 cells and        attenuated the H(2)O(2)-induced cell viability decrease and apoptosis. Similar        findings were obtained using adult RPE (ARPE)19 cells, another human RPE cell        line, and primary human RPE cell cultures. In conclusion, these results confirmed        our hypothesis and indicated that Artemisinin attenuated H(2)O(2)-induced        apoptosis in apparent correlation with the increase in the Acetyl-H4 (Lys 8)        level, which is associated with gene transcription and cell survival. By        modulating histone acetylation, Artemisinin may restore the balance between        acetylation and deacetylation and enhance the resistance and survival of RPE        cells under oxidative stress. Our study provides novel mechanistic insights into        the effect of Artemisinin on histone acetylation and apoptosis in RPE cells and        supports the potential application of Artemisinin in the prevention and/or        treatment of AMD.",d0784f15913c86d35f0b23cccc9c0ebfaf6428da,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d0784f15913c86d35f0b23cccc9c0ebfaf6428da,38675608,PMC11051841,background,False,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",100964009,0.02165667712688446,0.13157894736842105,0,4.927,0.03773584905660377,0.37735849056603776,0.12139273302882998

With the discovery of the        intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells, which regulate        non-image-forming visual processes, our knowledge of the photosensitive cell        family in the retina has deepened. Photoreceptor development is regulated by        specific genes and proteins and involves a series of molecular processes        including DNA transcription, post-transcriptional modification, protein        translation, and post-translational modification. Single-cell sequencing is a        promising technology for the study of photoreceptor development.

METHODS: Human retinas were obtained        through eye globe donations for research purposes and cultivated as explants.        Cell death was investigated in retinas with (control) and without retinal pigment        epithelium (RPE) cells to mimic RD. Tissues were studied at different time points        and immunohistological analyses for TUNEL, Cleaved caspase3, AIF, CDK4 and the        epigenetic mark H3K27me3 were performed. Human and monkey eye globes with retinal        detachment served as controls. RESULTS: The number of TUNEL-positive cells,        compared between 1 and 7 days, increased with time in both retinas with RPE (from        1.2 ± 0.46 to 8 ± 0.89, n = 4) and without RPE (from 2.6 ± 0.73 to 16.3 ± 1.27, p        < 0.014). In the group without RPE, cell death peaked at day 3 (p = 0.014) and        was high until day 7. Almost no Cleaved-Caspase3 signal was observed, whereas a        transient augmentation at day 3 of AIF-positive cells was observed to be about        10-fold in comparison to the control group (n = 2). Few CDK4-positive cells were        found in both groups, but significantly more in the RD group at day 7 (1.8 ± 0.24        vs. 4.7 ± 0.58, p = 0.014). The H3K27me3 mark increased by 7-fold after 5 days in        the RD group (p = 0.014) and slightly decreased at day 7 and was also observed to        be markedly increased in human and monkey detached retina samples. CONCLUSION:        AIF expression coincides with the first peak of cell death, whereas the H3K27me3        mark increases during the cell death plateau, suggesting that photoreceptor death        is induced by different successive pathways after RD.

Diabetic retinopathy is considered a multifactorial disease of complex etiology        in which oxidative stress and low chronic inflammation play essential roles.        Chronic exposure to hyperglycemia triggers a loss of redox balance that is        critical for the appearance of neuronal and vascular damage during the        development and progression of the disease. Current therapies for the treatment        of diabetic retinopathy are used in advanced stages of the disease and are unable        to reverse the retinal damage induced by hyperglycemia. The lack of effective        therapies without side effects means there is an urgent need to identify an early        action capable of preventing the development of the disease and its        pathophysiological consequences in order to avoid loss of vision associated with        diabetic retinopathy.

Knowledge of retinal neurogenesis regulation sheds light on retinal        degeneration therapy exploration. Therefore, we integrated the time-series        circRNA, lncRNA, miRNA, and mRNA expression profiles of the developing retina        through whole-transcriptome sequencing. The key functional ncRNAs and the ceRNA        network regulating retinal neurogenesis were identified. RESULTS: Transcriptomic        analysis identified circRNA as the most variable ncRNA subtype. We screened a        series of neurogenesis-related circRNAs, lncRNAs, and miRNAs using different        strategies based on their diversified molecular functions. The expression of        circCDYL, circATXN1, circDYM, circPRGRIP, lncRNA Meg3, and lncRNA Vax2os was        validated by quantitative real-time PCR.

One approach to treating these diseases is to        utilize stem and progenitor cells to replace neurons in situ, with the        expectation that new neurons will create new synaptic circuits or integrate into        existing ones. Reprogramming non-neuronal cells in vivo into stem or progenitor        cells is one strategy for replacing lost neurons. Zebrafish have become a        valuable model for investigating cellular reprogramming and retinal regeneration.

As the immune        system plays a central role in injury response and tissue repair, we here suggest        that multipotent stem cell therapies achieve therapeutic effect by altering the        immune response to injury, thereby limiting damage due to inflammation and        possibly promoting repair.

10.1016/j.exer.2021.108918,Mechanisms of RPE senescence and potential role of αB crystallin peptide as a        senolytic agent in experimental AMD.,2022.0,"Oxidative stress in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) can cause mitochondrial        dysfunction and is likely a causative factor in the pathogenesis of age-related        macular degeneration (AMD). Under oxidative stress conditions, some of the RPE        cells become senescent and a contributory role for RPE senescence in AMD        pathology has been proposed. The purpose of this study is to 1) characterize        senescence in human RPE; 2) investigate the effect of an αB Crystallin chaperone        peptide (mini Cry) in controlling senescence, in particular by regulating        mitochondrial function and senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP)        production and 3) develop mouse models for studying the role of RPE senescence in        dry and nAMD. Senescence was induced in human RPE cells in two ways. First,        subconfluent cells were treated with 0.2 μg/ml doxorubicin (DOX); second,        subconfluent cells were treated with 500 μM H(2)O(2). Senescence biomarkers        (senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-βgal), p21, p16) and mitochondrial        proteins (Fis1, DRP1, MFN2, PGC1-α, mtTFA) were analyzed in control and        experimental groups. The effect of mini Cry on mitochondrial bioenergetics,        glycolysis and SASP was determined. In vivo, retinal degeneration was induced by        intravenous injection of NaIO3 (20 mg/kg) and subretinal fibrosis by        laser-induced choroidal neovascularization. Increased SA-βgal staining and p16        and p21 expression was observed after DOX- or H(2)O(2)-induced senescence and        mini Cry significantly decreased senescence-positive cells. The expression of        mitochondrial biogenesis proteins PGC-1 and mTFA increased with senescence, and        mini Cry reduced expression significantly. Senescent RPE cells were metabolically        active, as evidenced by significantly enhanced oxidative phosphorylation and        anaerobic glycolysis, mini Cry markedly reduced rates of respiration and        glycolysis. Senescent RPE cells maintain a proinflammatory phenotype        characterized by significantly increased production of cytokines (IFN-ˠ, TNF-α,        IL1-α IL1-β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10), and VEGF-A; mini Cry significantly inhibited        their secretion. We identified and localized senescent RPE cells for the first        time in NaIO3-induced retinal degeneration and laser-induced subretinal fibrosis        mouse models. We conclude that mini Cry significantly impairs stress-induced        senescence by modulating mitochondrial biogenesis and fission proteins in RPE        cells. Characterization of senescence could provide further understanding of the        metabolic changes that accompany the senescent phenotype in ocular disease.        Future studies in vivo may better define the role of senescence in AMD and the        therapeutic potential of mini Cry as a senotherapeutic.",34279bfda3ac2850e4f93c229d5ac025a20f167d,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/34279bfda3ac2850e4f93c229d5ac025a20f167d,34986369,PMC8923947,,False,Experimental eye research,370707,0.011597361415624619,0.008,20,3.77,0.8490566037735849,0.1509433962264151,0.15667920842468738

Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is widely        used in eye care and allows the non-invasive, rapid capture of retinal        measurements in exquisite detail. We conducted genome- and phenome-wide analyses        of retinal layer thicknesses using macular OCT images from 44,823 UK Biobank        participants. We performed phenome-wide association analyses, associating retinal        thicknesses with 1,866 incident ICD-based conditions (median 10-year follow-up)        and 88 quantitative traits and blood biomarkers. We performed genome-wide        association analyses, identifying inherited genetic markers which influence the        retina, and replicated our associations among 6,313 individuals from the        LIFE-Adult Study. And lastly, we performed comparative association of phenome-        and genome- wide associations to identify putative causal links between systemic        conditions, retinal layer thicknesses, and ocular disease. Independent        associations with incident mortality were detected for photoreceptor thinning and        ganglion cell complex thinning. Significant phenotypic associations were detected        between retinal layer thinning and ocular, neuropsychiatric, cardiometabolic and        pulmonary conditions. Genome-wide association of retinal layer thicknesses        yielded 259 loci. Consistency between epidemiologic and genetic associations        suggested putative causal links between thinning of the retinal nerve fiber layer        with glaucoma, photoreceptor segment with AMD, as well as poor cardiometabolic        and pulmonary function with PS thinning, among other findings. In conclusion,        retinal layer thinning predicts risk of future ocular and systemic disease.        Furthermore, systemic cardio-metabolic-pulmonary conditions promote retinal        thinning.
