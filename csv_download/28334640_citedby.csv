28334640,miRNAs in synapse development and synaptic plasticity.,10.1016/j.conb.2017.02.014,"Synapses are functional units of the nervous system, through which information is        transferred between neurons. The development and activity-dependent modification        of synapses require temporally and spatially controlled modulation of gene        expression. microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as essential regulators of gene        expression. They are small non-coding RNAs that regulate mRNA stability and        translation by interacting with the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR) of mRNAs.        miRNAs are located to neuronal processes to regulate protein synthesis locally        and their expression is regulated by synaptic activity. This article reviews        recent findings on the role of miRNAs in synapse development and synaptic        plasticity.",PMC5554733,Current opinion in neurobiology,9111376

The interconnectedness between membrane transporters (SLCs) and        microRNAs (miRNAs) in AD pathogenesis has gained increasing attention. This        review explores the localization, substrates, and functions of SLC transporters        in the brain, emphasizing the roles of transporters for glutamate, glucose,        nucleosides, and other essential compounds. The examination delves into the        significance of SLCs in AD, their potential for drug development, and the        intricate realm of miRNAs, encompassing their transcription, processing,        functions, and regulation. MiRNAs have emerged as significant players in AD,        including those associated with mitochondria and synapses. Furthermore, this        review discusses the intriguing nexus of miRNAs targeting SLC transporters and        their potential as therapeutic targets in AD. Finally, the review underscores the        interaction between SLC transporters and miRNA regulation within the context of        Alzheimer's disease, underscoring the need for further research in this area.        This comprehensive review aims to shed light on the complex mechanisms underlying        the causation of AD and provides insights into potential therapeutic approaches.",,Molecular neurobiology,8900963

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play crucial roles in regulating these        changes by targeting specific genes and regulating their expression. The fact        that somatic and dendritic activity in neurons often occurs asynchronously        highlights the need for spatial and dynamic regulation of protein synthesis in        specific milieu and cellular loci. MicroRNAs, which can show distinct patterns of        enrichment, help to establish the localized distribution of plasticity-related        proteins. The recent study using atomic force microscopy (AFM)-based nanoscale        imaging reveals that the abundance of miRNA(miR)-134 is inversely correlated with        the functional activity of dendritic spine structures. However, the miRNAs that        are selectively upregulated in potentiated synapses, and which can thereby        support prospective changes in synaptic efficacy, remain largely unknown. Using        AFM force imaging, significant increases in miR-132 in the dendritic regions        abutting functionally-active spines is discovered. This study provides evidence        for miR-132 as a novel positive miRNA regulator residing in dendritic shafts, and        also suggests that activity-dependent miRNAs localized in distinct        sub-compartments of neurons play bi-directional roles in controlling synaptic        transmission and synaptic plasticity.",PMC11077659,"Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)",101664569

Specific miRNAs are required for NMDA receptor        (NMDAR)-dependent synaptic plasticity by repressing the translation of proteins        involved in dendritic spine morphogenesis. Rapid NMDAR-dependent silencing of        Limk1 is essential for spine shrinkage and requires Ago2 phosphorylation at S387.        Not all gene silencing events are modulated by S387 phosphorylation, and the        mechanisms that govern the selection of specific mRNAs for silencing downstream        of S387 phosphorylation are unknown. Here, we show that NMDAR-dependent S387        phosphorylation causes a rapid and transient increase in the association of Ago2        with Limk1, but not Apt1 mRNA. The specific increase in Limk1 mRNA binding to        Ago2 requires recruitment of the helicase DDX6 to RISC. Furthermore, we show that        DDX6 is required for NMDAR-dependent silencing of Limk1 via miR-134, but not Apt1        via miR-138, and is essential for NMDAR-dependent spine shrinkage.

MicroRNAs        (miRNAs) have been demonstrated to affect sevoflurane anesthesia-induced neuron        damage. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role and mechanism of        miR-181a-5p in sevoflurane-induced hippocampal neuronal injury. Primary        hippocampal neurons were identified using microscopy and immunofluorescence. The        viability and apoptosis of sevoflurane anesthesia-induced neurons were detected        by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and terminal-deoxynucleoitidyl        transferase-mediated nick end-labeling (TUNEL) staining assay, respectively. The        levels of apoptosis- and oxidative stress-related proteins as well as the markers        in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway were examined by immunoblotting.        Enzyme-linked immuno-sorbent assays were performed to examine the levels of        inflammatory cytokines. Luciferase reporter assay was conducted to validate the        combination between miR-181a-5p and DEAD-box helicase 3, X-linked (DDX3X).        Sevoflurane exposure led to significantly inhibited hippocampal neuron viability        and elevated miR-181a-5p expression.

However, our understanding of the translational mechanisms        controlling inhibitory synapses is limited. One distinct form of inhibitory        long-term potentiation (iLTP) enhances postsynaptic clusters of GABA(A)Rs and the        primary inhibitory scaffold, gephyrin, to promote sustained synaptic        strengthening. While we previously found that persistent iLTP requires mRNA        translation, the precise mechanisms controlling gephyrin translation during this        process remain unknown. Here, we identify miR153 as a novel regulator of Gphn        mRNA translation which controls gephyrin protein levels and synaptic clustering,        ultimately impacting GABAergic synaptic structure and function. We find that iLTP        induction downregulates miR153, reversing its translational suppression of Gphn        mRNA and allowing for increased de novo gephyrin protein synthesis and synaptic        clustering during iLTP. Finally, we find that reduced miR153 expression during        iLTP is driven by an excitation-transcription coupling pathway involving        calcineurin, NFAT and HDACs, which also controls the miRNA-dependent upregulation        of GABA(A)Rs. Overall, this work delineates a miRNA-dependent        post-transcriptional mechanism that controls the expression of the key synaptic        scaffold, gephyrin, and may converge with parallel miRNA pathways to coordinate        gene upregulation to maintain inhibitory synaptic plasticity.",PMC10760056,bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology,101680187

Ten miRNA candidates were systematically investigated        in transgenic APP-PS1 mice, noncarrier siblings, and C57BL/6J wild-type controls        at young and old ages. Relative expression levels of tested miRNAs revealed a        similar pattern in both APP-PS1 mice and noncarrier siblings when compared with        age- and sex-matched wild-type controls. However, the differences seen in        expression levels between APP-PS1 mice and noncarrier siblings could possibly        have resulted from underlying molecular etiology of AD.

Post-stroke cognitive impairment highlights the causal relationship between        stroke and cognitive impairment. The pathological damage of stroke, including the        increased release of excitatory amino acids, oxidative stress, inflammatory        responses, apoptosis, changed neurotrophic factor levels and gene expression,        influence synaptic plasticity. Synaptic plasticity refers to the        activity-dependent changes in the strength of synaptic connections and efficiency        of synaptic transmission at pre-existing synapses and can be divided into        structural synaptic plasticity and functional synaptic plasticity. Changes in        synaptic plasticity have been proven to play important roles in the occurrence        and treatment of post-stroke cognitive impairment. Evidence has indicated that        Chinese herbal drugs have effect of treating post-stroke cognitive impairment.

For this reason, we verified in vitro whether miR-27b-3p, miR-181a-5p        and miR-23a-3p modulate SNAP-25 gene and protein expression. Initial experiments        using miRNAs-co-transfected Vero cells and SNAP-25 3'UTR luciferase reporter        plasmids showed that miR-181a-5p (p≤0.01) and miR-23a-3p (p<0.05), but not        miR-27b-3p, modulate the luciferase signal, indicating that these two miRNAs bind        the SNAP-25 3'UTR. Results obtained using human oligodendroglial cell line        (MO3.13) transfected with miR-181a-5p or miR-27b-3p confirmed that miR-181a-5p        and miR-23a-3p regulate SNAP-25 gene and protein expression.

With such simple CNS,        mollusks yet display sufficiently complex behavior, thus ideal for various        studies of behavioral processes, including long-term memory (LTM) formation. For        our research, we use the formation of the fear avoidance reflex in the        terrestrial mollusk Helix lucorum as a learning model. We have shown previously        that LTM formation in Helix requires epigenetic modifications of histones leading        to both activation and inactivation of the specific genes. It is known that        microRNAs (miRNAs) negatively regulate the expression of genes; however, the role        of miRNAs in behavioral regulation has been poorly investigated. Currently, there        is no miRNAs sequencing data being published on Helix lucorum, which makes it        impossible to investigate the role of miRNAs in the memory formation of this        mollusk. In this study, we have performed sequencing and comparative        bioinformatics analysis of the miRNAs from the CNS of Helix lucorum. We have        identified 95 different microRNAs, including microRNAs belonging to the MIR-9,        MIR-10, MIR-22, MIR-124, MIR-137, and MIR-153 families, known to be involved in        various CNS processes of vertebrates and other species, particularly, in the fear        behavior and LTM.

The expression of 17 representatives of        MIR-10 differentially changes during different periods of LTM consolidation in        the CNS of Helix. In addition, using comparative analysis of microRNA expression        upon learning in normal snails and snails with deficient learning abilities with        dysfunction of the serotonergic system, we identified a number of microRNAs from        several families, including MIR-10, which expression changes only in normal        animals.

High relapse rates, which is a hallmark of drug addiction,        prompt the study of changes in Wnt signaling elements (Wnt5a, Wnt7b, and Ctnnb1)        in the motivational aspects of cocaine use and early drug-free period (3 days        after the last exposure to cocaine). For this purpose, an animal model of        intravenous cocaine self-administration and two types of drug-free period        (extinction training and abstinence in the home cage) were used. The studies        showed that chronic cocaine self-administration mainly disturbs the expression of        Wnt5a and Ctnnb1 (the gene encoding β-catenin) in the examined brain structures        (striatum and hippocampus), and the examined types of early abstinence are        characterized by a different pattern of changes in the expression of these genes.        At the same time, in cocaine self-administrated animals, there were no changes in        the level of Wnt5a and β-catenin proteins at the tested time points. Moreover,        exposure to cocaine induces a significant reduction in the striatal and        hippocampal expression of miR-374 and miR-544, which can regulate Wnt5a levels        post-transcriptionally. In summary, previous observations from        experimenter-administered cocaine have not been fully validated in the cocaine        self-administration model. Yoked cocaine administration appears to disrupt Wnt        signaling more than cocaine self-administration. The condition of the        cocaine-free period, the routes of drug administration, and the motivational        aspect of drug administration play an important role in the type of drug-induced        molecular changes observed. Furthermore, in-depth research involving additional        brain regions is needed to determine the exact role of Wnt signaling in        short-term and long-lasting plasticity as well as in the motivational aspects of        cocaine use, and thus to assess its potential as a target for new drug therapy        for cocaine use disorder.",PMC9693497,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791

After modulation        with miR-124 mimic/inhibitor, we identified common responsive mechanisms between        such models. We also reported miR-124 colocalization with microglia in AD patient        hippocampi. Herein, we determined how miR-124 modulation in SWE cells influences        microglia polarized subtypes in the context of inflammation. We used a coculture        system without cell-to-cell contact formed by miR-124 modulated SWE cells and        human CHME3 microglia stimulated with interferon-gamma (IFNγ-MG), in which we        assessed their adopted gene/miRNA profile and proteomic signature. The increase        of miR-124 in SWE cells/secretome (soluble and exosomal) was mimicked in IFNγ-MG.        Treatment of SWE cells with the miR-124 inhibitor led to RAGE overexpression and        loss of neuronal viability, while the mimic caused RAGE/HMGB1 downregulation and        prevented mitochondria membrane potential loss. When accessing the paracrine        effects on microglia, SWE miR-124 inhibitor favored their IFNγ-induced        inflammatory signature (upregulated RAGE/HMGB1/iNOS/IL-1β; downregulated        IL-10/ARG-1), while the mimic reduced microglia activation (downregulated        TNF-α/iNOS) and deactivated extracellular MMP-2/MMP-9 levels. Microglia        proteomics identified 113 responsive proteins to SWE miR-124 levels, including a        subgroup of 17 proteins involved in immune function/inflammation and/or miR-124        targets. A total of 72 proteins were downregulated (e.g., MAP2K6) and 21        upregulated (e.g., PAWR) by the mimic, while the inhibitor also upregulated 21        proteins and downregulated 17 (e.g., TGFB1, PAWR, and EFEMP1). Other targets were        associated with neurodevelopmental mechanisms, synaptic function, and vesicular        trafficking.

Experiments using mouse hippocampal neuron HT22 cells        demonstrated that dihydrotestosterone (DHT) increased the expression of        postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95) by inhibiting FMRP expression.        Administration of miR-125a inhibitor upregulated the PSD95 expression and        significantly increased the DHT-induced upregulation of PSD95. FMRP knockdown in        HT22 cells reduced the expression of miR-125a. Moreover, miR-125a inhibitor        upregulated the PSD95 expression in the DHT-treated HT22 cells with FMRP        knockdown. Subsequently, the effects of androgen-mediated via FMRP in regulating        neural behaviors and PSD95 expression and dendritic spines density/morphology        were investigated using Fmr1 knockout (KO) and wild-type littermate (WT) mice.        The castration of WT mice reduced the androgen levels, aggravated anxiety and        depression, and impaired learning and memory and sociability of mice. DHT        supplementation post-castration reversed the alterations in density and maturity        of dendritic spines of hippocampal neurons and behavioral disorders in WT mice;        however, it did not reveal such effects in Fmr1 KO mice.

In the present study, we aimed to        explore the role and mechanism of microRNA (miR)-212 in depression in vivo.        Chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) mice were established, and        depression-like behaviors were confirmed using the forced swimming test (FST),        sucrose preference test (SPT), and the tail suspension test (TST). Next, the        expression of miR-212 and its potential target, i.e., nuclear factor I-A (NFIA),        was verified using quantitative reverse transcription (qRT)-PCR analysis and        Western blotting in CUMS mice. The effects of miR-212 and NFIA on depression-like        behaviors, inflammatory response, and neuronal apoptosis were examined using FST,        TST, SPT, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) assay, and flow cytometry        analysis. Finally, the relationship between miR-212 and NFIA was examined using a        dual-luciferase reporter assay. Based on our findings, miR-212 was significantly        upregulated, while NFIA was downregulated in CUMS mice. miR-212 overexpression        could suppress the CUMS-induced weight loss, immobility time in FST and TST, and        increased hippocampal neuronal apoptosis and pro-inflammatory cytokines levels.        In addition, NFIA upregulation could partially reverse the effects of miR-212        mimic in CUMS mice. Accordingly, miR-212 could ameliorate CUMS-induced        depression-like behavior in mice by targeting NFIA, indicating its protective        role in depression.",PMC8810195,Bioengineered,101581063

However, these procedures are invasive and expensive, which        hamper their availability to the general population. Here, we report a panel of        microRNAs (miRNAs) in serum that can predict P-tau/Aβ42 in CSF and readily        differentiate AD from other dementias, including vascular dementia (VaD),        Parkinson disease dementia (PDD), behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia        (bvFTD), and dementia with Lewy body (DLB). METHODS: RNA samples were extracted        from the participant's blood. P-tau/Aβ42 of CSF was examined for diagnostic        purposes. A pilot study (controls, 21; AD, 23), followed by second (controls,        216; AD, 190) and third groups (controls, 153; AD, 151), is used to establish and        verify a predictive model of P-tau/Aβ42 in CSF. The test is then applied to a        fourth group of patients with different dementias (controls, 139; AD,155;        amnestic mild cognitive impairment [aMCI], 55; VaD, 51; PDD, 53; bvFTD, 53; DLB,        52) to assess its diagnostic capacity. RESULTS: In the pilot study, 29        upregulated and 31 downregulated miRNAs in the AD group were found. In Dataset 2,        these miRNAs were then included as independent variables in the linear regression        model.

However, the rate of cognitive decline is highly        variable between patients. Synaptic deficits are the neuropathological event most        correlated with cognitive impairment in AD. Considering the important role of        microRNAs (miRNAs) in regulating synaptic plasticity, our objective was to        identify the plasma miRNAs associated with the rate of cognitive decline in        patients with mild AD. METHODS: We analyzed 754 plasma miRNAs from 19 women        diagnosed with mild AD using TaqMan low-density array cards. The patients were        grouped based on the rate of decline in the MMSE score after 2 years [<4 points        (N = 11) and ≥4 points (N = 8)]. The differentially expressed miRNAs between the        two groups were validated in an independent cohort of men and women (N = 53) with        mild AD using RT-qPCR. RESULTS: In the discovery cohort, 17 miRNAs were        differentially expressed according to the fold change between patients with        faster declines in cognition and those with slower declines. miR-342-5p        demonstrated differential expression between the groups and a good correlation        with the rate of cognitive decline in the validation cohort (r = -0.28; p =        0.026). This miRNA had a lower expression level in patients who suffered from        more severe decline than in those who were cognitively more stable after 2 years        (p = 0.049).

At presynaptic and postsynaptic sites, far from the        cell body, local protein synthesis is utilized to continually modify the synaptic        proteome, enabling rapid changes in protein production to support synaptic        function. Synapses undergo diverse forms of plasticity, resulting in long-term,        persistent changes in synapse strength, which are paramount for learning, memory,        and cognition. It is now well-established that local translation of numerous        synaptic proteins is essential for many forms of synaptic plasticity, and much        work has gone into deciphering the strategies that neurons use to regulate        activity-dependent protein synthesis. Recent studies have pointed to a        coordination of the local mRNA translation required for synaptic plasticity and        the trafficking of membranous organelles in neurons. This includes the        co-trafficking of RNAs to their site of action using endosome/lysosome        ""transports,"" the regulation of activity-dependent translation at synapses, and        the role of mitochondria in fueling synaptic translation.

Although        there is no treatment for AD, exposure to enriched environment (EE) in mice, as        well as physical and mental activity in human subjects have been shown to have a        protective effect by slowing the disease's progression and reducing AD-like        cognitive impairment. However, the molecular mechanism of this mitigating effect        is still not understood. One of the mechanisms that has recently been shown to be        involved in neuronal degeneration is microRNAs (miRNAs) regulation, which act as        a post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression. miR-128 has been shown to        be significantly altered in individuals with AD and in mice following exposure to        EE. Here, we focused on elucidating the possible role of miR-128 in AD pathology        and found that miR-128 regulates the expression of two proteins essential for        synaptic transmission, SNAP-25, and synaptotagmin1 (Syt1). Clinically relevant,        in 5xFAD mouse model for AD, this miRNA's expression was found as downregulated,        resembling the alteration found in the hippocampi of individuals with AD.        Interestingly, exposing WT mice to EE also resulted in downregulation of miR-128        expression levels, although EE and AD conditions demonstrate opposing effects on        neuronal functioning and synaptic plasticity. We also found that miR-128        expression downregulation in primary hippocampal cultures from 5xFAD mice results        in increased neuronal network activity and neuronal excitability. Altogether, our        findings place miR-128 as a synaptic player that may contribute to synaptic        functioning and plasticity through regulation of synaptic protein expression and        function.",,Journal of molecular neuroscience : MN,9002991

To date, ZIKV mechanism of        infection and pathogenesis is not entirely understood and different studies on        gene regulation of ZIKV-infected cells have identified a dysregulation of        inflammatory and stem cell maintenance pathways. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are        post-transcriptional regulators of cellular genes and they contribute to cell        development in normal function and disease. Previous reports with integrative        analyses of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and miRNAs during ZIKV infection have not        identified neurological pathway defects. We hypothesized that dysregulation of        pathways involved in neurological functions will be identified by RNA profiling        of ZIKV-infected fetal neurons. We therefore used microarrays to analyze gene        expression levels following ZIKV infection of fetal murine neurons. We observed        that the expression levels of transcription factors such as neural PAS domain        protein 4 (Npas4) and of three members of the orphan nuclear receptor 4 (Nr4a)        were severely decreased after viral infection. We confirmed that their        downregulation was at both the mRNA level and at the protein level. The        dysregulation of these transcription factors has been previously linked to        aberrant neural functions and development. We next examined the miRNA expression        profile in infected primary murine neurons by microarray and found that various        miRNAs were dysregulated upon ZIKV infection.

Finally, using embryonic rat cultures, we demonstrated        that miR-181a inhibition induces ventral midbrain (VM) and cortical neuronal        growth. These data describe a new role for miR-181a in mDA neurons, and provide        proof of principle that miR-181a dysresgulation in PD may alter the activation        state of signalling pathways important for neuronal growth in neurons affected in        PD.",PMC7371012,Neuronal signaling,101721079

Physical        exercise (PE) is a beneficial non-pharmacological strategy and has been described        as an ally to combat cognitive decline in individuals with AD. However, the        molecular mechanisms that govern the beneficial adaptations induced by PE in AD        are not fully elucidated.

Among the plethora of mechanisms involved in the        stress response at the molecular level, the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) is        beginning to be recognized. The control of gene expression by these noncoding        RNAs makes them essential regulators of neuronal and synaptic physiology, and        alterations in their levels have been associated with pathological conditions and        mental disorders. In particular, the excitatory (i.e., glutamate-mediated)        neurotransmission is importantly affected by stress.

The        expression level of VEGFR-2 was analyzed by using in situ hybridization, RT-qPCR,        Western blot, and immunohistochemistry in developing rats. microRNAs were        validated within the spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia. To unveil the molecular        impact of our candidate microRNAs, dissociated cell cultures of sensory and lower        motor neurons were transfected with mimics and inhibitors. We depicted        age-dependent VEGFR-2 expression in sensory and lower motor neurons.

Thousands of mRNAs are localized to subcellular compartments in        neurons-including axons, dendrites, and synapses-where they are thought to        undergo local translation.

Many        small non-coding RNAs are directly involved in the post-transcriptional        modification of other RNA species, while others are themselves substrates for        modification, or are functionally modulated by modification of their target RNAs.        In this review, we explore the known and potential functions of several distinct        classes of small non-coding RNAs in the mammalian brain, focusing on the newly        recognised interplay between the epitranscriptome and the activity of small RNAs.        We discuss the potential for this relationship to influence the spatial and        temporal dynamics of gene activation in the brain, and predict that further        research in the field of epitranscriptomics will identify interactions between        small RNAs and RNA modifications which are essential for higher order brain        functions such as learning and memory.",PMC6027130,Non-coding RNA,101652294
29879109,METTL3-mediated m6A modification is required for cerebellar development.,10.1371/journal.pbio.2004880,"N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA methylation is the most abundant modification on        mRNAs and plays important roles in various biological processes. The formation of        m6A is catalyzed by a methyltransferase complex including methyltransferase-like        3 (METTL3) as a key factor. However, the in vivo functions of METTL3 and m6A        modification in mammalian development remain unclear. Here, we show that specific        inactivation of Mettl3 in mouse nervous system causes severe developmental        defects in the brain. Mettl3 conditional knockout (cKO) mice manifest cerebellar        hypoplasia caused by drastically enhanced apoptosis of newborn cerebellar granule        cells (CGCs) in the external granular layer (EGL). METTL3 depletion-induced loss        of m6A modification causes extended RNA half-lives and aberrant splicing events,        consequently leading to dysregulation of transcriptome-wide gene expression and        premature CGC death. Our findings reveal a critical role of METTL3-mediated m6A        in regulating the development of mammalian cerebellum.",PMC6021109,PLoS biology,101183755

Specific        miRNAs are required for NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-dependent synaptic plasticity by        modulating the translation of proteins involved in dendritic spine morphogenesis        or synaptic transmission. However, it is unknown how NMDAR stimulation stimulates        RISC activity to rapidly repress translation of synaptic proteins. We show that        NMDAR stimulation transiently increases Akt-dependent phosphorylation of Ago2 at        S387, which causes an increase in binding to GW182 and a rapid increase in        translational repression of LIMK1 via miR-134. Furthermore, NMDAR-dependent        down-regulation of endogenous LIMK1 translation in dendrites and dendritic spine        shrinkage requires phospho-regulation of Ago2 at S387. AMPAR trafficking and        hippocampal LTD do not involve S387 phosphorylation, defining this mechanism as a        specific pathway for structural plasticity. This work defines a novel mechanism        for the rapid transduction of NMDAR stimulation into miRNA-mediated translational        repression to control dendritic spine morphology.",PMC5983126,The EMBO journal,8208664

The role        of glyphosate in neurotoxicity has been reported in human and animal models.        However, the detailed mechanism of the role of glyphosate in neuronal development        remains unknown. Recently, several studies have reported evidence linking        neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) with gestational glyphosate exposure. The        current group previously identified microRNAs (miRNAs) that are associated with        the etiology of NDDs, but their expression levels in the developing brain        following glyphosate exposure have not been characterized. In the present study,        miRNA expression patterns were evaluated in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of 28        postnatal day mouse offspring following glyphosate exposure during pregnancy and        lactation. An miRNA microarray detected 55 upregulated and 19 downregulated        miRNAs in the PFC of mouse offspring, and 20 selected deregulated miRNAs were        further evaluated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A total of 11        targets of these selected deregulated miRNAs were analyzed using bioinformatics.        Gene Ontology (GO) terms associated with the relevant miRNAs included        neurogenesis (GO:0050769), neuron differentiation (GO:0030182) and brain        development (GO:0007420). The genes Cdkn1a, Numbl, Notch1, Fosl1 and Lef1 are        involved in the Wnt and Notch signaling pathways, which are closely associated        with neural development. PCR arrays for the mouse Wnt and Notch signaling        pathways were used to validate the effects of glyphosate on the expression        pattern of genes involved in the Wnt and Notch pathways. Nr4a2 and Wnt7b were        downregulated, while Dkk1, Dixdc1, Runx1, Shh, Lef-1 and Axin2 were upregulated        in the PFC of mice offspring following glyphosate exposure during pregnancy and        lactation. These results indicated abnormalities of the Wnt/β-catenin and Notch        pathways.

29209451,miR-149 reduces while let-7 elevates ASIC1a expression in vitro.,,"Acid-sensing ion channel 1a (ASIC1a) is the key subunit that determines        acid-activated currents in neurons. ASIC1a is important for neural plasticity,        learning, and for multiple neurological diseases, including stroke, multiple        sclerosis, and traumatic injuries. These findings underline the importance for        better defining mechanisms that regulate ASIC1a expression. During the past        decade, microRNA has emerged as one important group of regulatory molecules in        controlling protein expression. However, little is known about whether microRNA        regulates ASIC1a. Here, we assessed several microRNAs that have predicted        targeting sequences in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of mouse ASIC1a. Our        results indicated that miR-144 and -149 reduced ASIC1a expression while Let-7        increased ASIC1a protein levels. miR-30c, -98, -125, -182* had no significant        effect. Since a reduction in ASIC1a expression may have translational potentials        in treating neuronal injury, we further asked whether the effect of miR-144 and        miR-149, both reduced ASIC1a expression, was through specific targeting of the        predicted sites on ASIC1a. We mutated the targeting sequence of miR-144 and        miR-149 in ASIC1a UTR. The effect of miR-149 was abolished in the corresponding        mutation. In contrast, miR-144 still reduced ASIC1a level when its predicted        target sequence was mutated. This result indicates that miR-149 targets the 3'UTR        of ASIC1a and reduces its expression.",PMC5698691,"International journal of physiology, pathophysiology and pharmacology",101521074

Identification of biomarkers representing the        cognitive status of PLWHA is a critical step for implementation of successful        cognitive, behavioral and pharmacological strategies to prevent onset and        progression of HAND. However, the presence of co-morbidity factors in PLWHA, the        most common being substance abuse, can prevent the identification of such        biomarkers. We have optimized a protocol to profile plasma miRNAs using        quantitative RT-qPCR and found a miRNA signature with very good discriminatory        ability to distinguish PLWHA with cognitive impairment from those without        cognitive impairment. Here, we have evaluated this miRNA signature in PLWHA with        alcohol use disorder (AUD) at LSU Health Sciences Center (LSUHSC). The results        show that AUD is a potential confounding factor for the miRNAs associated with        cognitive impairment in PLWHA. Furthermore, we have investigated the miRNA        signature associated with cognitive impairment in an independent cohort of PLWHA        using plasma samples from the CNS HIV Antiretroviral Therapy Effects Research        (CHARTER) program.

A        critical issue is to pinpoint the (neuro)biological mechanisms underlying the        susceptibility to stress-related disorder such as PTSD, which develops in the        minority of ~15% of individuals exposed to trauma. Over the last few years, a        first wave of epigenetic studies has been performed in an attempt to identify the        molecular underpinnings of the long-lasting behavioral and mental effects of        trauma exposure. The potential roles of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) such as        microRNAs (miRNAs) in moderating or mediating the impact of severe stress and        trauma are increasingly gaining attention. To date, most studies focusing on the        roles of miRNAs in PTSD have, however, been completed in animals, using        cross-sectional study designs and focusing almost exclusively on subjects with        susceptible phenotypes. Therefore, there is a strong need for new research        comprising translational and cross-species approaches that use longitudinal        designs for studying trajectories of change contrasting susceptible and resilient        subjects.
