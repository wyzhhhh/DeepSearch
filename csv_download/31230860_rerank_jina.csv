Single-Cell Transcriptomic Analyses of Cell Fate Transitions during Human Cardiac Reprogramming,"Direct cellular reprogramming provides a powerful platform to study cell plasticity and dissect mechanisms underlying cell fate determination. Here, we report a single-cell transcriptomic study of human cardiac (hiCM) reprogramming that utilizes an analysis pipeline incorporating current data normalization methods, multiple trajectory prediction algorithms, and a cell fate index calculation we developed to measure reprogramming progression. These analyses revealed hiCM reprogramming-specific features and a decision point at which cells either embark on reprogramming or regress toward their original fibroblast state. In combination with functional screening, we found that immune-response-associated DNA methylation is required for hiCM induction and validated several downstream targets of reprogramming factors as necessary for productive hiCM reprograming. Collectively, this single-cell transcriptomics study provides detailed datasets that reveal molecular features underlying hiCM determination and rigorous analytical pipelines for predicting cell fate conversion.",31230860,PMC6684137,10.1016/j.stem.2019.05.020,66,Cell stem cell,101311472,25.269,0.9144436717033386,0.802675585284281,0.8561872909698997,0.8804387782728392
Integrative analysis of single-cell embryo data reveals transcriptome signatures for the human pre-implantation inner cell mass,"As the source of embryonic stem cells (ESCs), inner cell mass (ICM) can form all tissues of the embryo proper, however, its role in early human lineage specification remains controversial. Although a stepwise differentiation model has been proposed suggesting the existence of ICM as a distinct developmental stage, the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear. In the present study, we perform an integrated analysis on the public human preimplantation embryonic single-cell transcriptomic data and apply a trajectory inference algorithm to measure the cell plasticity. In our results, ICM population can be clearly discriminated on the dimension-reduced graph and confirmed by compelling evidences, thus validating the two-step hypothesis of lineage commitment. According to the branch probabilities and differentiation potential, we determine the precise time points for two lineage segregations. Further analysis on gene expression dynamics and regulatory network indicates that transcription factors including GSC, PRDM1, and SPIC may underlie the decisions of ICM fate. In addition, new human ICM marker genes, such as EPHA4 and CCR8 are discovered and validated by immunofluorescence. Given the potential clinical applications of ESCs, our analysis provides a further understanding of human ICM cells and facilitates the exploration of more unique characteristics in early human development.",37437860,,10.1016/j.ydbio.2023.07.004,0,Developmental biology,372762,3.148,0.8751482367515564,0.0,0.15384615384615385,0.5558581728201646
Integrated analysis of single-cell embryo data yields a unified transcriptome signature for the human pre-implantation epiblast,"Single-cell profiling techniques create opportunities to delineate cell fate progression in mammalian development. Recent studies have provided transcriptome data from human pre-implantation embryos, in total comprising nearly 2000 individual cells. Interpretation of these data is confounded by biological factors, such as variable embryo staging and cell-type ambiguity, as well as technical challenges in the collective analysis of datasets produced with different sample preparation and sequencing protocols. Here, we address these issues to assemble a complete gene expression time course spanning human pre-implantation embryogenesis. We identify key transcriptional features over developmental time and elucidate lineage-specific regulatory networks. We resolve post-hoc cell-type assignment in the blastocyst, and define robust transcriptional prototypes that capture epiblast and primitive endoderm lineages. Examination of human pluripotent stem cell transcriptomes in this framework identifies culture conditions that sustain a naÃ¯ve state pertaining to the inner cell mass. Our approach thus clarifies understanding both of lineage segregation in the early human embryo and ofin vitrostem cell identity, and provides an analytical resource for comparative molecular embryology.",29361568,PMC5818005,10.1242/dev.158501,92,"Development (Cambridge, England)",8701744,6.862,0.8558511734008789,0.8729096989966555,0.38127090301003347,0.7643468244418652
Using Single-Cell and Spatial Transcriptomes to Understand Stem Cell Lineage Specification During Early Embryo Development,"Embryonic development and stem cell differentiation provide a paradigm to understand the molecular regulation of coordinated cell fate determination and the architecture of tissue patterning. Emerging technologies such as single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics are opening new avenues to dissect cell organization, the divergence of morphological and molecular properties, and lineage allocation. Rapid advances in experimental and computational tools have enabled researchers to make many discoveries and revisit old hypotheses. In this review, we describe the use of single-cell RNA sequencing in studies of molecular trajectories and gene regulation networks for stem cell lineages, while highlighting the integratedexperimental and computational analysis of single-cell and spatial transcriptomes in the molecular annotation of tissue lineages and development during postimplantation gastrulation.",32339035,,10.1146/annurev-genom-120219-083220,20,Annual review of genomics and human genetics,100911346,9.34,0.8478417992591858,0.6153846153846154,0.5418060200668896,0.7401432066458125
"Single cell transcriptome analysis of human, marmoset and mouse embryos reveals common and divergent features of preimplantation development","The mouse embryo is the canonical model for mammalian preimplantation development. Recent advances in single cell profiling allow detailed analysis of embryogenesis in other eutherian species, including human, to distinguish conserved from divergent regulatory programs and signalling pathways in the rodent paradigm. Here, we identify and compare transcriptional features of human, marmoset and mouse embryos by single cell RNA-seq. Zygotic genome activation correlates with the presence of polycomb repressive complexes in all three species, while ribosome biogenesis emerges as a predominant attribute in primate embryos, supporting prolonged translation of maternally deposited RNAs. We find that transposable element expression signatures are species, stage and lineage specific. The pluripotency network in the primate epiblast lacks certain regulators that are operative in mouse, but encompasses WNT components and genes associated with trophoblast specification. Sequential activation of GATA6, SOX17 and GATA4 markers of primitive endoderm identity is conserved in primates. Unexpectedly, OTX2 is also associated with primitive endoderm specification in human and non-human primate blastocysts. Our cross-species analysis demarcates both conserved and primate-specific features of preimplantation development, and underscores the molecular adaptability of early mammalian embryogenesis.",30413530,PMC6240320,10.1242/dev.167833,90,"Development (Cambridge, England)",8701744,6.862,0.7662936449050903,0.8695652173913043,0.38461538461538464,0.710612307344392
Comparative single-cell transcriptomic profiles of human androgenotes and parthenogenotes during early development,"Objective:To unravel the differential transcriptomic behavior of human androgenotes (AGs) and parthenogenotes (PGs) throughout the first cell cycles, analyze the differential expression of genes related to key biologic processes, and determine the time frame for embryonic genome activation (EGA) in AGs and PGs.Design:Laboratory study.Setting:Private fertility clinic.Patient(s):Mature oocytes were retrieved from healthy donors and subjected to artificial oocyte activation using calcium ionophore and puromycin to generate PGs (n = 6) or enucleated and subjected to intracytoplasmic sperm injection to generate AGs (n = 10).Intervention(s):Uniparental constructs at different early stages of development were disaggregated into constituent single cells (we suggest the terms parthenocytes and androcytes) to characterize the single-cell transcriptional landscape using next-generation sequencing.Main outcomes measure(s):Transcriptomic profiles comparison between different stages of early development in AGs and PGs.Result(s):The uniparental transcriptomic profiles at the first cell cycle showed 68 down-regulated and 26 up-regulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in PGs compared with AGs. During the third cell cycle, we found 60 up-regulated and 504 down-regulated DEGs in PGs compared with AGs. In the fourth cell cycle, 1,771 up-regulated and 1,171 down-regulated DEGs were found in PGs compared with AGs. The AGs and PGs had reduced EGA profiles during the first 3 cell cycles, and a spike of EGA at the fourth cell cycle was observed in PGs.Conclusion(s):Transcriptomic analysis of AGs and PGs revealed their complementary behavior until the fourth cell cycle. Androgenotes undergo a low wave of transcription during the first cell cycle, which reflects the paternal contribution to cell cycle coordination, mechanics of cell division, and novel transcription regulation. Maternal transcripts are most prominent in the third and fourth cell cycles, with amplification of transcription related to morphogenic progression and embryonic developmental competence acquisition. Regarding EGA, in PGs, a primitive EGA begins at the 1-cell stage and gradually progresses until the 4-cell stage, when crucial epigenetic reprogramming (through methylation) is up-regulated. In addition, our longitudinal single-cell transcriptomic analysis challenges that the zygote and early cleavage stages are the only totipotent entities, by revealing potential totipotency in cleavage-stage AGs and implications of paternal transcripts.",36563838,,10.1016/j.fertnstert.2022.12.027,0,Fertility and sterility,372772,7.49,0.7648916244506836,0.0033444816053511705,0.46488294314381273,0.5525804596202429
Single cell transcriptome profiling of developing chick retinal cells,"The vertebrate retina is a specialized photosensitive tissue comprised of six neuronal and one glial cell types, each of which develops in prescribed proportions at overlapping timepoints from a common progenitor pool. While each of these cells has a specific function contributing to proper vision in the mature animal, their differential representation in the retina as well as the presence of distinctive cellular subtypes makes identifying the transcriptomic signatures that lead to each retinal cell's fate determination and development challenging. We have analyzed transcriptomes from individual cells isolated from the chick retina throughout retinogenesis. While we focused our efforts on the retinal ganglion cells, our transcriptomes of developing chick cells also contained representation from multiple retinal cell types, including photoreceptors and interneurons at different stages of development. Most interesting was the identification of transcriptomes from individual mixed lineage progenitor cells in the chick as these cells offer a window into the cell fate decision-making process. Taken together, these data sets will enable us to uncover the most critical genes acting in the steps of cell fate determination and early differentiation of various retinal cell types.",28510275,,10.1002/cne.24241,8,The Journal of comparative neurology,406041,3.028,0.7581526637077332,0.451505016722408,0.1505016722408027,0.575292936017282
Reconstructing developmental trajectories using latent dynamical systems and time-resolved transcriptomics,"The snapshot nature of single-cell transcriptomics presents a challenge for studying the dynamics of cell fate decisions. Metabolic labeling and splicing can provide temporal information at single-cell level, but current methods have limitations. Here, we present a framework that overcomes these limitations: experimentally, we developed sci-FATE2, an optimized method for metabolic labeling with increased data quality, which we used to profile 45,000 embryonic stem (ES) cells differentiating into neural tube identities. Computationally, we developed a two-stage framework for dynamical modeling: VelvetVAE, a variational autoencoder (VAE) for velocity inference that outperforms all other tools tested, and VelvetSDE, a neural stochastic differential equation (nSDE) framework for simulating trajectory distributions. These recapitulate underlying dataset distributions and capture features such as decision boundaries between alternative fates and fate-specific gene expression. These methods recast single-cell analyses from descriptions of observed data to models of the dynamics that generated them, providing a framework for investigating developmental fate decisions.",38754365,,10.1016/j.cels.2024.04.004,0,Cell systems,101656080,11.091,0.7529220581054688,0.006688963210702341,0.6020066889632107,0.5734923652980639
Integrated pseudotime analysis of human pre-implantation embryo single-cell transcriptomes reveals the dynamics of lineage specification,"Understanding lineage specification during human pre-implantation development is a gateway to improving assisted reproductive technologies and stem cell research. Here we employ pseudotime analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data to reconstruct early mouse and human embryo development. Using time-lapse imaging of annotated embryos, we provide an integrated, ordered, and continuous analysis of transcriptomics changes throughout human development. We reveal that human trophectoderm/inner cell mass transcriptomes diverge at the transition from the B2 to the B3 blastocyst stage, just before blastocyst expansion. We explore the dynamics of the fate markers IFI16 and GATA4 and show that they gradually become mutually exclusive upon establishment of epiblast and primitive endoderm fates, respectively. We also provide evidence that NR2F2 marks trophectoderm maturation, initiating from the polar side, and subsequently spreads to all cells after implantation. Our study pinpoints the precise timing of lineage specification events in the human embryo and identifies transcriptomics hallmarks and cell fate markers.",34004179,,10.1016/j.stem.2021.04.027,56,Cell stem cell,101311472,25.269,0.7501869201660156,0.7759197324414716,0.8595317725752508,0.7772024531029539
Single-cell profiling for advancing birth defects research and prevention,"Cellular analysis of developmental processes and toxicities has traditionally entailed bulk methods (e.g., transcriptomics) that lack single cell resolution or tissue localization methods (e.g., immunostaining) that allow only a few genes to be monitored in each experiment. Recent technological advances have enabled interrogation of genomic function at the single-cell level, providing new opportunities to unravel developmental pathways and processes with unprecedented resolution. Here, we review emerging technologies of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to globally characterize the gene expression sets of different cell types and how different cell types emerge from earlier cell states in development. Cell atlases of experimental embryology and human embryogenesis at single-cell resolution will provide an encyclopedia of genes that define key stages from gastrulation to organogenesis. This technology, combined with computational models to discover key organizational principles, was recognized by Science magazine as the ""Breakthrough of the year"" for 2018 due to transformative potential on the way we study how human cells mature over a lifetime, how tissues regenerate, and how cells change in diseases (e.g., patient-derived organoids to screen disease-specific targets and design precision therapy). Profiling transcriptomes at the single-cell level can fulfill the need for greater detail in the molecular progression of all cell lineages, from pluripotency to adulthood and how cell-cell signaling pathways control progression at every step. Translational opportunities emerge for elucidating pathogenesis of genetic birth defects with cellular precision and improvements for predictive toxicology of chemical teratogenesis.",33496083,PMC8562675,10.1002/bdr2.1870,2,Birth defects research,101701004,2.661,0.7420480251312256,0.24414715719063546,0.13043478260869565,0.5201452030386016
Single-cell transcriptome analysis reveals cell lineage specification in temporal-spatial patterns in human cortical development,"Neurogenesis processes differ in different areas of the cortex in many species, including humans. Here, we performed single-cell transcriptome profiling of the four cortical lobes and pons during human embryonic and fetal development. We identified distinct subtypes of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and their molecular signatures, including a group of previously unidentified transient NPCs. We specified the neurogenesis path and molecular regulations of the human deep-layer, upper-layer, and mature neurons. Neurons showed clear spatial and temporal distinctions, while glial cells of different origins showed development patterns similar to those of mice, and we captured the developmental trajectory of oligodendrocyte lineage cells until the human mid-fetal stage. Additionally, we verified region-specific characteristics of neurons in the cortex, including their distinct electrophysiological features. With systematic single-cell analysis, we decoded human neuronal development in temporal and spatial dimensions from GW7 to GW28, offering deeper insights into the molecular regulations underlying human neurogenesis and cortical development.",32923614,PMC7450478,10.1126/sciadv.aaz2978,48,Science advances,101653440,14.957,0.7379142642021179,0.7391304347826086,0.68561872909699,0.7276983912971904
Dissecting transition cells from single-cell transcriptome data through multiscale stochastic dynamics,"Advances in single-cell technologies allow scrutinizing of heterogeneous cell states, however, detecting cell-state transitions from snap-shot single-cell transcriptome data remains challenging. To investigate cells with transient properties or mixed identities, we present MuTrans, a method based on multiscale reduction technique to identify the underlying stochastic dynamics that prescribes cell-fate transitions. By iteratively unifying transition dynamics across multiple scales, MuTrans constructs the cell-fate dynamical manifold that depicts progression of cell-state transitions, and distinguishes stable and transition cells. In addition, MuTrans quantifies the likelihood of all possible transition trajectories between cell states using coarse-grained transition path theory. Downstream analysis identifies distinct genes that mark the transient states or drive the transitions. The method is consistent with the well-established Langevin equation and transition rate theory. Applying MuTrans to datasets collected from five different single-cell experimental platforms, we show its capability and scalability to robustly unravel complex cell fate dynamics induced by transition cells in systems such as tumor EMT, iPSC differentiation and blood cell differentiation. Overall, our method bridges data-driven and model-based approaches on cell-fate transitions at single-cell resolution.",34556644,PMC8460805,10.1038/s41467-021-25548-w,33,Nature communications,101528555,17.694,0.7369688749313354,0.6755852842809364,0.7324414715719063,0.7237866761293699
Single-cell and spatial transcriptomics during human organogenesis,"The molecular and cellular events that occur during the onset of human organogenesis remain mysterious. We used single-cell and spatial transcriptomics to provide a global view of human embryonic cell-type specification, shedding light on developmental processes such as axial patterning, stage transition, and differences between human and mouse embryonic development.",36949166,PMC10032247,10.1038/s41556-023-01113-z,0,Nature cell biology,100890575,28.213,0.731442391872406,0.010033444816053512,0.8729096989966555,0.6154540638859854
A single-cell transcriptome atlas profiles early organogenesis in human embryos,"The early window of human embryogenesis is largely a black box for developmental biologists. Here we probed the cellular diversity of 4-6 week human embryos when essentially all organs are just laid out. On the basis of over 180,000 single-cell transcriptomes, we generated a comprehensive atlas of 313 clusters in 18 developmental systems, which were annotated with a collection of ontology and markers from 157 publications. Together with spatial transcriptome on embryonic sections, we characterized the molecule and spatial architecture of previously unappreciated cell types. Combined with data from other vertebrates, the rich information shed light on spatial patterning of axes, systemic temporal regulation of developmental progression and potential human-specific regulation. Our study provides a compendium of early progenitor cells of human organs, which can serve as the root of lineage analysis in organogenesis.",36928764,,10.1038/s41556-023-01108-w,15,Nature cell biology,100890575,28.213,0.7120319604873657,0.5618729096989966,0.8762541806020067,0.71484459435262
HelPredictor models single-cell transcriptome to predict human embryo lineage allocation,"The in-depth understanding of cellular fate decision of human preimplantation embryos has prompted investigations on how changes in lineage allocation, which is far from trivial and remains a time-consuming task by experimental methods. It is desirable to develop a novel effective bioinformatics strategy to consider transitions of coordinated embryo lineage allocation and stage-specific patterns. There are rapidly growing applications of machine learning models to interpret complex datasets for identifying candidate development-related factors and lineage-determining molecular events. Here we developed the first machine learning platform, HelPredictor, that integrates three feature selection methods, namely, principal components analysis, F-score algorithm and squared coefficient of variation, and four classical machine learning classifiers that different combinations of methods and classifiers have independent outputs by increment feature selection method. With application to single-cell sequencing data of human embryo, HelPredictor not only achieved 94.9% and 90.9% respectively with cross-validation and independent test, but also fast classified different embryonic lineages and their development trajectories using less HelPredictor-predicted factors. The above-mentioned candidate lineage-specific genes were discussed in detail and were clustered for exploring transitions of embryonic heterogeneity. Our tool can fast and efficiently reveal potential lineage-specific and stage-specific biomarkers and provide insights into how advanced computational tools contribute to development research.

Single-Cell Transcriptome Analysis of Uniparental Embryos Reveals Parent-of-Origin Effects on Human Preimplantation Development,"To investigate the contribution of parental genomes to early embryogenesis, we profiled the single-cell transcriptomes of human biparental and uniparental embryos systematically from the 1-cell to the morula stage. We observed that uniparental embryos exhibited variable and decreased embryonic genome activation (EGA). Comparative transcriptome analysis identified 807 maternally biased expressed genes (MBGs) and 581 paternally biased expressed genes (PBGs) in the preimplantation stages. MBGs became apparent at the 4-cell stage and contributed to the initiation of EGA, whereas PBGs preferentially appeared at the 8-cell stage and might affect embryo compaction and trophectoderm specification. Regulatory network analysis revealed that DUX4, EGR2, and DUXA are key transcription factors in MBGs' expression; ZNF263 and KLF3 are important for PBGs' expression. We demonstrated that parent-specific DNA methylation might account for the expression of most PBGs. Our results provide a valuable resource to understand parental genome activation and might help to elucidate parent-of-origin effects in early human development.",31588047,,10.1016/j.stem.2019.09.004,37,Cell stem cell,101311472,25.269,0.7013041377067566,0.6956521739130435,0.862876254180602,0.7324881682427831
Longitudinal profiling of human androgenotes through single-cell analysis unveils paternal gene expression dynamics in early embryo development,"Study question:How do transcriptomics vary in haploid human androgenote embryos at single cell level in the first four cell cycles of embryo development?Summary answer:Gene expression peaks at the fourth cell cycle, however some androcytes exhibit unique transcriptional behaviors.What is known already:The developmental potential of an embryo is determined by the competence of the oocyte and the sperm. However, studies of the contribution of the paternal genome using pure haploid androgenotes are very scarce.Study design, size, duration:This study was performed analyzing the single-cell transcriptomic sequencing of 38 androcytes obtained from 10 androgenote bioconstructs previously produced in vitro (de Castro et al., 2023). These results were analyzed through different bioinformatics software such as g: Profiler, GSEA, Cytoscape, and Reactome.Participants/materials, setting, methods:Single cell sequencing was used to obtain the transcriptomic profiles of the different androcytes. The results obtained were compared between the different cycles studied using the DESeq2 program and functional enrichment pathways using g: Profiler, Cytoscape, and Reactome.Main results and the role of chance:A wave of paternally driven transcriptomic activation was found during the third-cell cycle, with 1128 upregulated and 225 downregulated genes and the fourth-cell cycle, with 1373 upregulated and 286 downregulated genes, compared to first-cell cycle androcytes. Differentially expressed routes related to cell differentiation, DNA-binding transcription, RNA biosynthesis and RNA polymerase II transcription regulatory complex, and cell death were found in the third and fourth with respect to the first-cell cycle. Conversely, in the fourth cell cycle, 153 downregulated and 332 upregulated genes were found compared with third cell cycle, associated with differentially expressed processes related to E-box binding and zinc finger protein 652 (ZNF652) transcription factor. Further, significant overexpression of LEUTX, PRAMEF1, DUXA, RFPL4A, TRIM43, and ZNF675 found in androgenotes, compared to biparental embryos, highlights the paternal contributions to zygote genome activation.Large scale data:All raw sequencing data are available through the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under accessions number: GSE216501.Limitations, reasons for caution:Extrapolation of biological events from uniparental constructs to biparental embryos should be done with caution. Maternal and paternal genomes do not act independently of each other in a natural condition. The absence of one genome may affect gene transcription of the other. In this sense, the haploid condition of the bioconstructs could mask the transcriptomic patterns of the single cells.Wider implications of the findings:The results obtained demonstrated the level of involvement of the human paternal haploid genome in the early stages of embryo development as well as its evolution at the transcriptomic level, laying the groundwork for the use of these bioconstructs as reliable models to dispel doubts about the genetic role played by the paternal genome in the early cycles of embryo development.Study funding/competing interest(s):This study was funded by Instituto de Salud Carlos III (ISCIII) through the project 'PI22/00924', co-funded by European Regional Development Fund (ERDF); 'A way to make Europe'.

DevOmics: an integrated multi-omics database of human and mouse early embryo,"Transcriptomic and epigenetic alterations during early embryo development have been proven to play essential roles in regulating the cell fate. Nowadays, advances in single-cell transcriptomics and epigenomics profiling techniques provide large volumes of data for understanding the molecular regulatory mechanisms in early embryos and facilitate the investigation of assisted reproductive technology as well as preimplantation genetic testing. However, the lack of integrated data collection and unified analytic procedures greatly limits their usage in scientific research and clinical application. Hence, it is necessary to establish a database integrating the regulatory information of human and mouse early embryos with unified analytic procedures. Here, we introduce DevOmics (http://devomics.cn/), which contains normalized gene expression, DNA methylation, histone modifications (H3K4me3, H3K9me3, H3K27me3, H3K27ac), chromatin accessibility and 3D chromatin architecture profiles of human and mouse early embryos spanning six developmental stages (zygote, 2cell, 4cell, 8cell, morula and blastocyst (ICM, TE)). The current version of DevOmics provides Search and Advanced Search for retrieving genes a researcher is interested in, Analysis Tools including the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) analysis for acquiring DEGs between different types of samples, allelic explorer for displaying allele-specific gene expression as well as epigenetic modifications and correlation analysis for showing the dynamic changes in different layers of data across developmental stages, as well as Genome Browser and Ortholog for visualization.

Deciphering transcriptional and functional heterogeneity in hematopoiesis with single-cell genomics,"Purpose of review:Single-cell genomic approaches have uncovered cell fate biases and heterogeneity within hematopoietic subpopulations. However, standard single-cell transcriptomics suffers from high sampling noise, which particularly skews the distribution of lowly expressed genes, such as transcription factors (TFs). This might preclude the identification of rare transcripts that define cell identity and demarcate cell fate biases. Moreover, these studies need to go hand in hand with relevant functional assays to ensure that observed gene expression changes represent biologically meaningful alterations.Recent findings:Single-cell lineage tracing and functional validation studies have uncovered cell fate bias within transcriptionally distinct hematopoietic stem and progenitor subpopulations. Novel markers identified using these strategies have been proposed to prospectively isolate functionally distinct subpopulations, including long-term hematopoietic stem cells for ex vivo applications. Furthermore, the continuous nature of hematopoiesis has prompted the study of the relationship between stochastic transcriptional noise in hematopoietic TFs and cell fate determination.Summary:An understanding of the limitations of single-cell genomic approaches and follow-up functional assays is critical to discern the technical and biological contribution of noise in hematopoietic heterogeneity, to identify rare gene expression states, and to uncover functionally distinct subpopulations within hematopoiesis.Supplementary video:http://links.lww.com/COH/A23.",33901135,PMC8169609,10.1097/MOH.0000000000000657,3,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,3.218,0.6784335374832153,0.31438127090301005,0.1705685618729097,0.5040500890451132
Single-cell analysis of nonhuman primate preimplantation development in comparison to humans and mice,"Background:Genetic programs underlying preimplantation development and early lineage segregation are highly conserved across mammals. It has been suggested that nonhuman primates would be better model organisms for human embryogenesis, but a limited number of studies have investigated the monkey preimplantation development. In this study, we collect single cells from cynomolgus monkey preimplantation embryos for transcriptome profiling and compare with single-cell RNA-seq data derived from human and mouse embryos.Results:By weighted gene-coexpression network analysis, we found that cynomolgus gene networks have greater conservation with human embryos including a greater number of conserved hub genes than that of mouse embryos. Consistently, we found that early ICM/TE lineage-segregating genes in monkeys exhibit greater similarity with human when compared to mouse, so are the genes in signaling pathways such as LRP1 and TCF7 involving in WNT pathway. Last, we tested the role of one conserved pre-EGA hub gene, SIN3A, using a morpholino knockdown of maternal RNA transcripts in monkey embryos followed by single-cell RNA-seq. We found that SIN3A knockdown disrupts the gene-silencing program during the embryonic genome activation transition and results in developmental delay of cynomolgus embryos.Conclusion:Taken together, our study provided new insight into evolutionarily conserved and divergent transcriptome dynamics during mammalian preimplantation development.",33449399,,10.1002/dvdy.295,2,Developmental dynamics : an official publication of the American Association of,9201927,2.842,0.6732991337776184,0.24749163879598662,0.14715719063545152,0.48290924615285863
Single-Cell Transcriptomic Profiling Identifies Molecular Phenotypes of Newborn Human Lung Cells,"While animal model studies have extensively defined the mechanisms controlling cell diversity in the developing mammalian lung, there exists a significant knowledge gap with regards to late-stage human lung development. The NHLBI Molecular Atlas of Lung Development Program (LungMAP) seeks to fill this gap by creating a structural, cellular and molecular atlas of the human and mouse lung. Transcriptomic profiling at the single-cell level created a cellular atlas of newborn human lungs. Frozen single-cell isolates obtained from two newborn human lungs from the LungMAP Human Tissue Core Biorepository, were captured, and library preparation was completed on the Chromium 10X system. Data was analyzed in Seurat, and cellular annotation was performed using the ToppGene functional analysis tool. Transcriptional interrogation of 5500 newborn human lung cells identified distinct clusters representing multiple populations of epithelial, endothelial, fibroblasts, pericytes, smooth muscle, immune cells and their gene signatures. Computational integration of data from newborn human cells and with 32,000 cells from postnatal days 1 through 10 mouse lungs generated by the LungMAP Cincinnati Research Center facilitated the identification of distinct cellular lineages among all the major cell types. Integration of the newborn human and mouse cellular transcriptomes also demonstrated cell type-specific differences in maturation states of newborn human lung cells. Specifically, newborn human lung matrix fibroblasts could be separated into those representative of younger cells (n= 393), or older cells (n= 158). Cells with each molecular profile were spatially resolved within newborn human lung tissue. This is the first comprehensive molecular map of the cellular landscape of neonatal human lung, including biomarkers for cells at distinct states of maturity.",38540357,PMC10970229,10.3390/genes15030298,1,Genes,101551097,4.141,0.6715782880783081,0.17725752508361203,0.22408026755852842,0.483214531375413
Single-cell analysis of progenitor cell dynamics and lineage specification in the human fetal kidney,"The mammalian kidney develops through reciprocal interactions between the ureteric bud and the metanephric mesenchyme to give rise to the entire collecting system and the nephrons. Most of our knowledge of the developmental regulators driving this process arises from the study of gene expression and functional genetics in mice and other animal models. In order to shed light on human kidney development, we have used single-cell transcriptomics to characterize gene expression in different cell populations, and to study individual cell dynamics and lineage trajectories during development. Single-cell transcriptome analyses of 6414 cells from five individual specimens identified 11 initial clusters of specific renal cell types as defined by their gene expression profile. Further subclustering identifies progenitors, and mature and intermediate stages of differentiation for several renal lineages. Other lineages identified include mesangium, stroma, endothelial and immune cells. Novel markers for these cell types were revealed in the analysis, as were components of key signaling pathways driving renal development in animal models. Altogether, we provide a comprehensive and dynamic gene expression profile of the developing human kidney at the single-cell level.",30166318,PMC6124540,10.1242/dev.164038,83,"Development (Cambridge, England)",8701744,6.862,0.6658452153205872,0.8561872909698997,0.3879598662207358,0.6483365606304794
Mechanisms of fate decision and lineage commitment during haematopoiesis,"Blood stem cells need to both perpetuate themselves (self-renew) and differentiate into all mature blood cells to maintain blood formation throughout life. However, it is unclear how the underlying gene regulatory network maintains this population of self-renewing and differentiating stem cells and how it accommodates the transition from a stem cell to a mature blood cell. Our current knowledge of transcriptomes of various blood cell types has mainly been advanced by population-level analysis. However, a population of seemingly homogenous blood cells may include many distinct cell types with substantially different transcriptomes and abilities to make diverse fate decisions. Therefore, understanding the cell-intrinsic differences between individual cells is necessary for a deeper understanding of the molecular basis of their behaviour. Here we review recent single-cell studies in the haematopoietic system and their contribution to our understanding of the mechanisms governing cell fate choices and lineage commitment.",26526619,,10.1038/icb.2015.96,13,Immunology and cell biology,8706300,5.853,0.659514844417572,0.5418060200668896,0.31438127090301005,0.5669463648445232
Single cell transcriptomic analysis of human pluripotent stem cell chondrogenesis,"The therapeutic application of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) for cartilage regeneration is largely hindered by the low yield of chondrocytes accompanied by unpredictable and heterogeneous off-target differentiation of cells during chondrogenesis. Here, we combine bulk RNA sequencing, single cell RNA sequencing, and bioinformatic analyses, including weighted gene co-expression analysis (WGCNA), to investigate the gene regulatory networks regulating hiPSC differentiation under chondrogenic conditions. We identify specific WNTs and MITF as hub genes governing the generation of off-target differentiation into neural cells and melanocytes during hiPSC chondrogenesis. With heterocellular signaling models, we further show that WNT signaling produced by off-target cells is responsible for inducing chondrocyte hypertrophy. By targeting WNTs and MITF, we eliminate these cell lineages, significantly enhancing the yield and homogeneity of hiPSC-derived chondrocytes. Collectively, our findings identify the trajectories and molecular mechanisms governing cell fate decision in hiPSC chondrogenesis, as well as dynamic transcriptome profiles orchestrating chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation.",33441552,PMC7806634,10.1038/s41467-020-20598-y,67,Nature communications,101528555,17.694,0.6537903547286987,0.8093645484949833,0.7357859531772575,0.7013043131716674
Single cell transcriptomics: moving towards multi-omics,"As the basic units of life, cells present dramatic heterogeneity which, although crucial to an organism's behavior, is undetected by bulk analysis. Recently, much attention has been paid to reveal cellular types and states at the single-cell level including genome, transcriptome, epigenome or proteome-based on sequencing and immunological methods, etc. Among these approaches, transcriptomic analysis provides knowledge of the molecular linkages between genetic information and the proteome, leading to a comprehensive understanding of biological processes and diseases. Compared to single-dimensional inspection, multi-dimensional analysis combines the transcriptome with other ""omics"" to enable a comprehensive understanding of single-cell processes and functions. Moreover, compared to separate observations or single snapshots, spatial dimension and lineage time tracing can provide a more multifaceted understanding of the micro-environment and dynamic processes. In this review, we will introduce current transcriptomic analysis methods, as well as their combination with other omics methods including genomic, proteomic, and epigenetic approaches. Multi-dimensional analysis using these approaches for spatial positioning and lineage tracing applications will be reviewed. The future perspectives of single-cell multi-omics analysis based on the transcriptome will also be discussed.",30849139,,10.1039/c8an01852a,20,The Analyst,372652,5.227,0.6486889719963074,0.6187290969899666,0.2976588628762542,0.5724909751710285
Single-cell transcriptomic characterization of a gastrulating human embryo,"Gastrulation is the fundamental process in all multicellular animals through which the basic body plan is first laid down1-4. It is pivotal in generating cellular diversity coordinated with spatial patterning. In humans, gastrulation occurs in the third week after fertilization. Our understanding of this process in humans is relatively limited and based primarily on historical specimens5-8, experimental models9-12or, more recently, in vitro cultured samples13-16. Here we characterize in a spatially resolved manner the single-cell transcriptional profile of an entire gastrulating human embryo, staged to be between 16 and 19 days after fertilization. We use these data to analyse the cell types present and to make comparisons with other model systems. In addition to pluripotent epiblast, we identified primordial germ cells, red blood cells and various mesodermal and endodermal cell types. This dataset offers a unique glimpse into a central but inaccessible stage of our development. This characterization provides new context for interpreting experiments in other model systems and represents a valuable resource for guiding directed differentiation of human cells in vitro.",34789876,PMC7615353,10.1038/s41586-021-04158-y,114,Nature,410462,69.504,0.6482437252998352,0.8996655518394648,0.979933110367893,0.7648659676213727
A Single-Cell Roadmap of Lineage Bifurcation in Human ESC Models of Embryonic Brain Development,"During human brain development, multiple signaling pathways generate diverse cell types with varied regional identities. Here, we integrate single-cell RNA sequencing and clonal analyses to reveal lineage trees and molecular signals underlying early forebrain and mid/hindbrain cell differentiation from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). Clustering single-cell transcriptomic data identified 41 distinct populations of progenitor, neuronal, and non-neural cells across our differentiation time course. Comparisons with primary mouse and human gene expression data demonstrated rostral and caudal progenitor and neuronal identities from early brain development. Bayesian analyses inferred a unified cell-type lineage tree that bifurcates between cortical and mid/hindbrain cell types. Two methods of clonal analyses confirmed these findings and further revealed the importance of Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling in controlling this lineage decision. Together, these findings provide a rich transcriptome-based lineage map for studying human brain development and modeling developmental disorders.",28094016,PMC5261831,10.1016/j.stem.2016.09.011,69,Cell stem cell,101311472,25.269,0.6467949151992798,0.8160535117056856,0.8662207357859532,0.7245317986178956
SINGLE-CELL TRANSCRIPTOME ANALYSIS IN HEALTH AND DISEASE,"The analysis of the single-cell transcriptome has emerged as a powerful tool to gain insights on the basic mechanisms of health and disease. It is widely used to reveal the cellular diversity and complexity of tissues at cellular resolution by RNA sequencing of the whole transcriptome from a single cell. Equally, it is applied to discover an unknown, rare population of cells in the tissue. The prime advantage of single-cell transcriptome analysis is the detection of stochastic nature of gene expression of the cell in tissue. Moreover, the availability of multiple platforms for the single-cell transcriptome has broadened its approaches to using cells of different sizes and shapes, including the capture of short or full-length transcripts, which is helpful in the analysis of challenging biological samples. And with the development of numerous packages in R and Python, new directions in the computational analysis of single-cell transcriptomes can be taken to characterize healthy versus diseased tissues to obtain novel pathological insights. Downstream analysis such as differential gene expression analysis, gene ontology term analysis, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis, cell-cell interaction analysis, and trajectory analysis has become standard practice in the workflow of single-cell transcriptome analysis to further examine the biology of different cell types. Here, we provide a broad overview of single-cell transcriptome analysis in health and disease conditions currently applied in various studies.",37962963,PMC10883422,10.1097/SHK.0000000000002274,0,"Shock (Augusta, Ga.)",9421564,3.533,0.6352224349975586,0.016722408026755852,0.1939799331103679,0.4232739292259599
Neighbor-specific gene expression revealed from physically interacting cells during mouse embryonic development,"Development of multicellular organisms is orchestrated by persistent cell-cell communication between neighboring partners. Direct interaction between different cell types can induce molecular signals that dictate lineage specification and cell fate decisions. Current single-cell RNA-seq technology cannot adequately analyze cell-cell contact-dependent gene expression, mainly due to the loss of spatial information. To overcome this obstacle and resolve cell-cell contact-specific gene expression during embryogenesis, we performed RNA sequencing of physically interacting cells (PIC-seq) and assessed them alongside similar single-cell transcriptomes derived from developing mouse embryos between embryonic day (E) 7.5 and E9.5. Analysis of the PIC-seq data identified gene expression signatures that were dependent on the presence of specific neighboring cell types. Our computational predictions, validated experimentally, demonstrated that neural progenitor (NP) cells upregulateLhx5andNkx2-1genes, when exclusively interacting with definitive endoderm (DE) cells. Moreover, there was a reciprocal impact on the transcriptome of DE cells, as they tend to upregulateRaxandGscwhen in contact with NP cells. Using individual cell transcriptome data, we formulated a means of computationally predicting the impact of one cell type on the transcriptome of its neighboring cell types. We have further developed a distinctive spatial-t-distributed stochastic neighboring embedding to display the pseudospatial distribution of cells in a 2-dimensional space. In summary, we describe an innovative approach to study contact-specific gene regulation during embryogenesis.",36595695,PMC9926237,10.1073/pnas.2205371120,6,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,12.779,0.6292052268981934,0.4214046822742475,0.6220735785953178,0.5862187883128291
Sci-fate characterizes the dynamics of gene expression in single cells,"Gene expression programs change over time, differentiation and development, and in response to stimuli. However, nearly all techniques for profiling gene expression in single cells do not directly capture transcriptional dynamics. In the present study, we present a method for combined single-cell combinatorial indexing and messenger RNA labeling (sci-fate), which uses combinatorial cell indexing and 4-thiouridine labeling of newly synthesized mRNA to concurrently profile the whole and newly synthesized transcriptome in each of many single cells. We used sci-fate to study the cortisol response in >6,000 single cultured cells. From these data, we quantified the dynamics of the cell cycle and glucocorticoid receptor activation, and explored their intersection. Finally, we developed software to infer and analyze cell-state transitions. We anticipate that sci-fate will be broadly applicable to quantitatively characterize transcriptional dynamics in diverse systems.",32284584,PMC7416490,10.1038/s41587-020-0480-9,54,Nature biotechnology,9604648,68.164,0.6290912628173828,0.7658862876254181,0.9632107023411371,0.7232741556837408
Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of mouse neocortical development,"The development of the mammalian cerebral cortex depends on careful orchestration of proliferation, maturation, and migration events, ultimately giving rise to a wide variety of neuronal and non-neuronal cell types. To better understand cellular and molecular processes that unfold during late corticogenesis, we perform single-cell RNA-seq on the mouse cerebral cortex at a progenitor driven phase (embryonic day 14.5) and at birth-after neurons from all six cortical layers are born. We identify numerous classes of neurons, progenitors, and glia, their proliferative, migratory, and activation states, and their relatedness within and across age. Using the cell-type-specific expression patterns of genes mutated in neurological and psychiatric diseases, we identify putative disease subtypes that associate with clinical phenotypes. Our study reveals the cellular template of a complex neurodevelopmental process, and provides a window into the cellular origins of brain diseases.",30635555,PMC6329831,10.1038/s41467-018-08079-9,116,Nature communications,101528555,17.694,0.6271523237228394,0.903010033444816,0.7391304347826086,0.7047194878791885
Single-cell RNA-Seq reveals the earliest lineage specification and X chromosome dosage compensation in bovine preimplantation embryos,"Lineage specification and X chromosome dosage compensation are two crucial biological processes that occur during preimplantation embryonic development. Although extensively studied in mice, the timing and regulation of these processes remain elusive in other species, including humans. Previous studies have suggested conserved principles of human and bovine early development. This study aims to provide fundamental insights into these programs and the regulation using a bovine embryo model by employing single-cell transcriptomics and genome editing approaches. The study analyzes the transcriptomes of 286 individual cells and reveals that bovine trophectoderm/inner cell mass transcriptomes diverge at the early blastocyst stage, after cavitation but before blastocyst expansion. The study also identifies transcriptomic markers and provides the timing of lineage specification events in the bovine embryo. Importantly, we find that SOX2 is required for the first cell decision program in bovine embryos. Moreover, the study shows the occurrence of X chromosome dosage compensation from morula to late blastocyst and reveals that this compensation results from downregulation of X-linked genes in female embryonic cells. The transcriptional atlas generated by this study is expected to be widely useful in improving our understanding of mammalian early embryo development.",38363564,,10.1096/fj.202302035RR,0,FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for,8804484,5.834,0.6208515167236328,0.020066889632107024,0.30434782608695654,0.4373938531779924
Human organomics: a fresh approach to understanding human development using single-cell transcriptomics,"Innovative methods designed to recapitulate human organogenesis from pluripotent stem cells provide a means to explore human developmental biology. New technologies to sequence and analyze single-cell transcriptomes can deconstruct these 'organoids' into constituent parts, and reconstruct lineage trajectories during cell differentiation. In this Spotlight article we summarize the different approaches to performing single-cell transcriptomics on organoids, and discuss the opportunities and challenges of applying these techniques to generate organ-level, mechanistic models of human development and disease.

Single-cell transcriptomic and spatial landscapes of the developing human pancreas,"Current differentiation protocols have not been successful in reproducibly generating fully functional human beta cells in vitro, partly due to incomplete understanding of human pancreas development. Here, we present detailed transcriptomic analysis of the various cell types of the developing human pancreas, including their spatial gene patterns. We integrated single-cell RNA sequencing with spatial transcriptomics at multiple developmental time points and revealed distinct temporal-spatial gene cascades. Cell trajectory inference identified endocrine progenitor populations and branch-specific genes as the progenitors differentiate toward alpha or beta cells. Spatial differentiation trajectories indicated that Schwann cells are spatially co-located with endocrine progenitors, and cell-cell connectivity analysis predicted that they may interact via L1CAM-EPHB2 signaling. Our integrated approach enabled us to identify heterogeneity and multiple lineage dynamics within the mesenchyme, showing that it contributed to the exocrine acinar cell state. Finally, we have generated an interactive web resource for investigating human pancreas development for the research community.",36513063,,10.1016/j.cmet.2022.11.009,7,Cell metabolism,101233170,31.373,0.6188380122184753,0.431438127090301,0.8896321070234113,0.6355168541538276
Single-cell analysis delineates a trajectory toward the human early otic lineage,"Efficient pluripotent stem cell guidance protocols for the production of human posterior cranial placodes such as the otic placode that gives rise to the inner ear do not exist. Here we use a systematic approach including defined monolayer culture, signaling modulation, and single-cell gene expression analysis to delineate a developmental trajectory for human otic lineage specification in vitro. We found that modulation of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and WNT signaling combined with FGF and retinoic acid treatments over the course of 18 days generates cell populations that develop chronological expression of marker genes of non-neural ectoderm, preplacodal ectoderm, and early otic lineage. Gene expression along this differentiation path is distinct from other lineages such as endoderm, mesendoderm, and neural ectoderm. Single-cell analysis exposed the heterogeneity of differentiating cells and allowed discrimination of non-neural ectoderm and otic lineage cells from off-target populations. Pseudotemporal ordering of human embryonic stem cell and induced pluripotent stem cell-derived single-cell gene expression profiles revealed an initially synchronous guidance toward non-neural ectoderm, followed by comparatively asynchronous occurrences of preplacodal and otic marker genes. Positive correlation of marker gene expression between both cell lines and resemblance to mouse embryonic day 10.5 otocyst cells implied reasonable robustness of the guidance protocol. Single-cell trajectory analysis further revealed that otic progenitor cell types are induced in monolayer cultures, but further development appears impeded, likely because of lack of a lineage-stabilizing microenvironment. Our results provide a framework for future exploration of stabilizing microenvironments for efficient differentiation of stem cell-generated human otic cell types.",27402757,PMC4968758,10.1073/pnas.1605537113,37,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,12.779,0.6179738640785217,0.6989966555183946,0.6254180602006689,0.6356672615909258
Single-Cell Transcriptomic Analyses of the Developing Meninges Reveal Meningeal Fibroblast Diversity and Function,"The meninges are a multilayered structure composed of fibroblasts, blood and lymphatic vessels, and immune cells. Meningeal fibroblasts secrete a variety of factors that control CNS development, yet strikingly little is known about their heterogeneity or development. Using single-cell sequencing, we report distinct transcriptional signatures for fibroblasts in the embryonic dura, arachnoid, and pia. We define new markers for meningeal layers and show conservation in human meninges. We find that embryonic meningeal fibroblasts are transcriptionally distinct between brain regions and identify a regionally localized pial subpopulation marked by the expression of Î¼-crystallin. Developmental analysis reveals a progressive, ventral-to-dorsal maturation of telencephalic meninges. Our studies have generated an unparalleled view of meningeal fibroblasts, providing molecular profiles of embryonic meningeal fibroblasts by layer and yielding insights into the mechanisms of meninges development and function.",32634398,PMC7769050,10.1016/j.devcel.2020.06.009,74,Developmental cell,101120028,13.417,0.616070032119751,0.8361204013377926,0.6454849498327759,0.6659630895059643
Generation and Downstream Analysis of Single-Cell and Single-Nuclei Transcriptomes in Brain Organoids,"Over the past decade, single-cell transcriptomics has significantly evolved and become a standard laboratory method for simultaneous analysis of gene expression profiles of individual cells, allowing the capture of cellular diversity. In order to overcome limitations posed by difficult-to-isolate cell types, an alternative approach aiming at recovering single nuclei instead of intact cells can be utilized for sequencing, making transcriptome profiling of individual cells universally applicable. These techniques have become a cornerstone in the study of brain organoids, establishing them as models of the developing human brain. Leveraging the potential of single-cell and single-nucleus transcriptomics in brain organoid research, this protocol presents a step-by-step guide encompassing key procedures such as organoid dissociation, single-cell or nuclei isolation, library preparation and sequencing. By implementing these alternative approaches, researchers can obtain high-quality datasets, enabling the identification of neuronal and non-neuronal cell types, gene expression profiles, and cell lineage trajectories.

Integrative transcriptomic analysis of developing hematopoietic stem cells in human and mouse at single-cell resolution,"Current understanding of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) development comes from mouse models is considered to be evolutionarily conserved in human. However, the cross-species comparison of the transcriptomic profiles of developmental HSCs at single-cell level is still lacking. Here, we performed integrative transcriptomic analysis of a series of key cell populations during HSC development in human and mouse, including HSC-primed hemogenic endothelial cells and pre-HSCs in mid-gestational aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region, and mature HSCs in fetal liver and adult bone marrow. We demonstrated the general similarity of transcriptomic characteristics between corresponding cell populations of the two species. Of note, one of the previously transcriptomically defined hematopoietic stem progenitor cell (HSPC) populations with certain arterial characteristics in AGM region of human embryos showed close transcriptomic similarity to pre-HSCs in mouse embryos. On the other hand, the other two HSPC populations in human AGM region displayed molecular similarity with fetal liver HSPCs, suggesting the maturation in AGM before HSCs colonizing the fetal liver in human, which was different to that in mouse. Finally, we re-clustered cells based on the integrated dataset and illustrated the evolutionarily conserved molecular signatures of major cell populations. Our results revealed transcriptomic conservation of critical cell populations and molecular characteristics during HSC development between human and mouse, providing a resource and theoretic basis for future studies on mammalian HSC development and regeneration by using mouse models.",33930817,,10.1016/j.bbrc.2021.04.058,4,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,372516,3.322,0.6143361926078796,0.35785953177257523,0.1806020066889632,0.47629402325703546
Single-Cell Transcriptome Profiling of Mouse and hESC-Derived Pancreatic Progenitors,"Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are a potential unlimited source of insulin-producing Î² cells for diabetes treatment. A greater understanding of how Î² cells form during embryonic development will improve current hESC differentiation protocols. All pancreatic endocrine cells, including Î² cells, are derived from Neurog3-expressing endocrine progenitors. This study characterizes the single-cell transcriptomes of 6,905 mouse embryonic day (E) 15.5 and 6,626 E18.5 pancreatic cells isolated from Neurog3-Cre; Rosa26mT/mGembryos, allowing for enrichment of endocrine progenitors (yellow; tdTomato + EGFP) and endocrine cells (green; EGFP). Using a NEUROG3-2A-eGFP CyT49 hESC reporter line (N5-5), 4,462 hESC-derived GFP+ cells were sequenced. Differential expression analysis revealed enrichment of markers that are consistent with progenitor, endocrine, or previously undescribed cell-state populations.

Data Analysis Pipeline for scRNA-seq Experiments to Study Early Oogenesis,"Germ cells as the means for the transmission of genetic information between generations have been a hot topic of research for decades. The analysis of the transcriptomes, that is of the RNA transcripts produced by the genotype at a given time, of germ cells and the surrounding somatic cells, is essential to unravel the cellular and molecular processes regulating gametogenesis. However, the asynchronized differentiation of germ cells and high cellular heterogeneity in the developing ovary or testis represent two unsurmountable challenges for delineating the transcription regulation mechanism of germ cells using traditional bulk RNA sequencing. By performing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), it is now possible to dissect the transcriptome of germ cell development at single-cell resolution, and apply powerful bioinformatics methods to translate raw sequencing data into meaningful information. Here, using the 10Ã Genomic platform and the most widely cited bioinformatics tools, we describe how to analyze early female germ cell development using scRNA-seq data generated from mouse E11.5 to E14.5 ovaries. This pipeline will provide a guide for exploring the processes of early germ cell development at single-cell resolution.",38351456,,10.1007/978-1-0716-3698-5_15,0,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,0.0,0.6101050972938538,0.026755852842809364,0.0,0.37141422894487414
Systematic mapping of TF-mediated cell fate changes by a pooled induction coupled with scRNA-seq and multi-omics approaches,"Transcriptional regulation controls cellular functions through interactions between transcription factors (TFs) and their chromosomal targets. However, understanding the fate conversion potential of multiple TFs in an inducible manner remains limited. Here, we introduce iTF-seq as a method for identifying individual TFs that can alter cell fate toward specific lineages at a single-cell level. iTF-seq enables time course monitoring of transcriptome changes, and with biotinylated individual TFs, it provides a multi-omics approach to understanding the mechanisms behind TF-mediated cell fate changes. Our iTF-seq study in mouse embryonic stem cells identified multiple TFs that trigger rapid transcriptome changes indicative of differentiation within a day of induction. Moreover, cells expressing these potent TFs often show a slower cell cycle and increased cell death. Further analysis using bioChIP-seq revealed that GCM1 and OTX2 act as pioneer factors and activators by increasing gene accessibility and activating the expression of lineage specification genes during cell fate conversion. iTF-seq has utility in both mapping cell fate conversion and understanding cell fate conversion mechanisms.",38580401,PMC11067882,10.1101/gr.277926.123,0,Genome research,9518021,9.438,0.60934978723526,0.030100334448160536,0.5484949832775919,0.4813289358863065
Single-cell transcriptome profiling of the human developing spinal cord reveals a conserved genetic programme with human-specific features,"The spinal cord receives input from peripheral sensory neurons and controls motor output by regulating muscle innervating motor neurons. These functions are carried out by neural circuits comprising molecularly distinct neuronal subtypes generated in a characteristic spatiotemporal arrangement from progenitors in the embryonic neural tube. To gain insight into the diversity and complexity of cells in the developing human neural tube, we used single-cell mRNA sequencing to profile cervical and thoracic regions in four human embryos of Carnegie stages (CS) CS12, CS14, CS17 and CS19 from gestational weeks 4-7. Analysis of progenitor and neuronal populations from the neural tube and dorsal root ganglia identified dozens of distinct cell types and facilitated the reconstruction of the differentiation pathways of specific neuronal subtypes. Comparison with mouse revealed overall similarity of mammalian neural tube development while highlighting some human-specific features. These data provide a catalogue of gene expression and cell type identity in the human neural tube that will support future studies of sensory and motor control systems.

Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of the embryogenic callus clarifies the spatiotemporal developmental trajectories of the early somatic embryo in Dimocarpus longan,"Plant embryogenic calli (ECs) can undergo somatic embryogenesis to regenerate plants. This process is mediated by regulatory factors, such as transcription factors and specifically expressed genes, but the precise molecular mechanisms underlying somatic embryogenesis at the single-cell level remain unclear. In this study, we performed high-resolution single-cell RNA sequencing analysis to determine the cellular changes in the EC of the woody plant species Dimocarpus longan (longan) and clarify the continuous cell differentiation trajectories at the transcriptome level. The highly heterogeneous cells in the EC were divided into 12 putative clusters (e.g., proliferating, meristematic, vascular, and epidermal cell clusters). We determined cluster-enriched expression marker genes and found that overexpression of the epidermal cell marker gene GDSL ESTERASE/LIPASE-1 inhibited the hydrolysis of triacylglycerol. In addition, the stability of autophagy was critical for the somatic embryogenesis of longan. The pseudo-timeline analysis elucidated the continuous cell differentiation trajectories from early embryonic cell division to vascular and epidermal cell differentiation during the somatic embryogenesis of longan. Moreover, key transcriptional regulators associated with cell fates were revealed. We found that ETHYLENE RESPONSIVE FACTOR 6 was characterized as a heat-sensitive factor that negatively regulates longan somatic embryogenesis under high-temperature stress conditions. The results of this study provide new spatiotemporal insights into cell division and differentiation during longan somatic embryogenesis at single-cell resolution.",37235696,,10.1111/tpj.16319,2,The Plant journal : for cell and molecular biology,9207397,7.091,0.606381893157959,0.2508361204013378,0.4414715719063545,0.5022906743563139
Cell population characterization and discovery using single-cell technologies in endocrine systems,"In the last 15 years, single-cell technologies have become robust and indispensable tools to investigate cell heterogeneity. Beyond transcriptomic, genomic and epigenome analyses, technologies are constantly evolving, in particular toward multi-omics, where analyses of different source materials from a single cell are combined, and spatial transcriptomics, where resolution of cellular heterogeneity can be detected in situ. While some of these techniques are still being optimized, single-cell RNAseq has commonly been used because the examination of transcriptomes allows characterization of cell identity and, therefore, unravel previously uncharacterized diversity within cell populations. Most endocrine organs have now been investigated using this technique, and this has given new insights into organ embryonic development, characterization of rare cell types, and disease mechanisms. Here, we highlight recent studies, particularly on the hypothalamus and pituitary, and examine recent findings on the pancreas and reproductive organs where many single-cell experiments have been performed.",32485670,,10.1530/JME-19-0276,4,Journal of molecular endocrinology,8902617,4.869,0.6029386520385742,0.3612040133779264,0.26421404682274247,0.4868468032632783
Single-Cell Resolution of Temporal Gene Expression during Heart Development,"Activation of complex molecular programs in specific cell lineages governs mammalian heart development, from a primordial linear tube to a four-chamber organ. To characterize lineage-specific, spatiotemporal developmental programs, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of >1,200 murine cells isolated at seven time points spanning embryonic day 9.5 (primordial heart tube) to postnatal day 21 (mature heart). Using unbiased transcriptional data, we classified cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells, and fibroblast-enriched cells, thus identifying markers for temporal and chamber-specific developmental programs. By harnessing these datasets, we defined developmental ages of human and mouse pluripotent stem-cell-derived cardiomyocytes and characterized lineage-specific maturation defects in hearts of mice with heterozygous mutations in Nkx2.5 that cause human heart malformations. This spatiotemporal transcriptome analysis of heart development reveals lineage-specific gene programs underlying normal cardiac development and congenital heart disease.",27840107,PMC5198784,10.1016/j.devcel.2016.10.001,232,Developmental cell,101120028,13.417,0.6017106175422668,0.9531772575250836,0.6488294314381271,0.6814277083180023
A single-cell guide to retinal development: Cell fate decisions of multipotent retinal progenitors in scRNA-seq,"Recent advances in high throughput single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology have enabled the simultaneous transcriptomic profiling of thousands of individual cells in a single experiment. To investigate the intrinsic process of retinal development, researchers have leveraged this technology to quantify gene expression in retinal cells across development, in multiple species, and from numerous important models of human disease. In this review, we summarize recent applications of scRNA-seq and discuss how these datasets have complemented and advanced our understanding of retinal progenitor cell competence, cell fate specification, and differentiation.

Embryo-scale reverse genetics at single-cell resolution,"The maturation of single-cell transcriptomic technologies has facilitated the generation of comprehensive cellular atlases from whole embryos1-4. A majority of these data, however, has been collected from wild-type embryos without an appreciation for the latent variation that is present in development. Here we present the 'zebrafish single-cell atlas of perturbed embryos': single-cell transcriptomic data from 1,812 individually resolved developing zebrafish embryos, encompassing 19 timepoints, 23 genetic perturbations and a total of 3.2 million cells. The high degree of replication in our study (eight or more embryos per condition) enables us to estimate the variance in cell type abundance organism-wide and to detect perturbation-dependent deviance in cell type composition relative to wild-type embryos. Our approach is sensitive to rare cell types, resolving developmental trajectories and genetic dependencies in the cranial ganglia neurons, a cell population that comprises less than 1% of the embryo. Additionally, time-series profiling of individual mutants identified a group of brachyury-independent cells with strikingly similar transcriptomes to notochord sheath cells, leading to new hypotheses about early origins of the skull. We anticipate that standardized collection of high-resolution, organism-scale single-cell data from large numbers of individual embryos will enable mapping of the genetic dependencies of zebrafish cell types, while also addressing longstanding challenges in developmental genetics, including the cellular and transcriptional plasticity underlying phenotypic diversity across individuals.",37968389,PMC10665197,10.1038/s41586-023-06720-2,2,Nature,410462,69.504,0.6012424230575562,0.25418060200668896,0.9832775919732442,0.6082370926305203
A single-cell transcriptome atlas for zebrafish development,"The ability to define cell types and how they change during organogenesis is central to our understanding of animal development and human disease. Despite the crucial nature of this knowledge, we have yet to fully characterize all distinct cell types and the gene expression differences that generate cell types during development. To address this knowledge gap, we produced an atlas using single-cell RNA-sequencing methods to investigate gene expression from the pharyngula to early larval stages in developing zebrafish. Our single-cell transcriptome atlas encompasses transcriptional profiles from 44,102 âcells across four days of development using duplicate experiments that confirmed high reproducibility. We annotated 220 identified clusters and highlighted several strategies for interrogating changes in gene expression associated with the development of zebrafish embryos at single-cell resolution. Furthermore, we highlight the power of this analysis to assign new cell-type or developmental stage-specific expression information to many genes, including those that are currently known only by sequence and/or that lack expression information altogether. The resulting atlas is a resource for biologists to generate hypotheses for functional analysis, which we hope integrates with existing efforts to define the diversity of cell-types during zebrafish organogenesis, and to examine the transcriptional profiles that produce each cell type over developmental time.",31782996,PMC7080588,10.1016/j.ydbio.2019.11.008,107,Developmental biology,372762,3.148,0.6003054976463318,0.8929765886287625,0.1605351170568562,0.5708856397249228

New insights into human primordial germ cells and early embryonic development from single-cell analysis,"Human preimplantation developmental studies are difficult to accomplish due to associated ethical and moral issues. Preimplantation cells are rare and exist only in transient cell states. From a single cell, it is very challenging to analyse the origination of the heterogeneity and complexity inherent to the human body. However, recent advances in single-cell technology and data analysis have provided new insights into the process of early human development and germ cell specification.

Single-cell mRNA quantification and differential analysis with Census,"Single-cell gene expression studies promise to reveal rare cell types and cryptic states, but the high variability of single-cell RNA-seq measurements frustrates efforts to assay transcriptional differences between cells. We introduce the Census algorithm to convert relative RNA-seq expression levels into relative transcript counts without the need for experimental spike-in controls. Analyzing changes in relative transcript counts led to dramatic improvements in accuracy compared to normalized read counts and enabled new statistical tests for identifying developmentally regulated genes. Census counts can be analyzed with widely used regression techniques to reveal changes in cell-fate-dependent gene expression, splicing patterns and allelic imbalances.

By using high-coverage scRNA-seq, we devise a computational framework that stratifies single cells of individual embryos into cell types without prior knowledge. Unbiased transcriptome data analysis mapped each cell's physical position and lineage history, yielding the complete history of gene expression at the genome-wide level for every single cell in a developing embryo.

Single-Cell and Spatial Transcriptome Analysis of Dermal Fibroblast Development in Perinatal Mouse Skin: Dynamic Lineage Differentiation and Key Driver Genes,"Several single-cell RNA studies of developing mouse skin have elucidated the molecular and cellular processes involved in skin development. However, they have primarily focused on either the fetal or early postnatal period, leaving a gap in our understanding of skin development. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive time-series analysis by combining single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets collected at different stages of development (embryonic days 13.5, 14.5, and 16.5 and postnatal days 0, 2, and 4) and validated our findings through multipanel in situ spatial transcriptomics. Our analysis indicated that embryonic fibroblasts exhibit heterogeneity from a very early stage and that the rapid determination of each lineage occurs within days after birth. The expression of putative key driver genes, including Hey1, Ebf1, Runx3, and Sox11 for the dermal papilla trajectory; Lrrc15 for the dermal sheath trajectory; Zfp536 and Nrn1 for the papillary fibroblast trajectory; and Lrrn4cl and Mfap5 for the fascia fibroblast trajectory, was detected in the corresponding, spatially identified cell types. Finally, cell-to-cell interaction analysis indicated that the dermal papilla lineage is the primary source of the noncanonical Wnt pathway during skin development.

Single-cell transcriptome analysis reveals the dynamics of human immune cells during early fetal skin development,"The immune system of skin develops in stages in mice. However, the developmental dynamics of immune cells in human skin remains elusive. Here, we perform transcriptome profiling of CD45+hematopoietic cells in human fetal skin at an estimated gestational age of 10-17 weeks by single-cell RNA sequencing. A total of 13 immune cell types are identified. Skin macrophages show dynamic heterogeneity over the course of skin development. A major shift in lymphoid cell developmental states occurs from the first to the second trimester that implies an in situ differentiation process. Gene expression analysis reveals a typical developmental program in immune cells in accordance with their functional maturation, possibly involving metabolic reprogramming. Finally, we identify transcription factors (TFs) that potentially regulate cellular transitions by comparing TFs and TF target gene networks. These findings provide detailed insight into how the immune system of the human skin is established during development.",34380039,,10.1016/j.celrep.2021.109524,11,Cell reports,101573691,9.995,0.5755283832550049,0.5183946488294314,0.568561872909699,0.562708334300829
Identification and functional analysis of long non-coding RNAs in human and mouse early embryos based on single-cell transcriptome data,"Epigenetics regulations have an important role in fertilization and proper embryonic development, and several human diseases are associated with epigenetic modification disorders, such as Rett syndrome, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and Angelman syndrome. However, the dynamics and functions of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), one type of epigenetic regulators, in human pre-implantation development have not yet been demonstrated. In this study, a comprehensive analysis of human and mouse early-stage embryonic lncRNAs was performed based on public single-cell RNA sequencing data. Expression profile analysis revealed that lncRNAs are expressed in a developmental stage-specific manner during human early-stage embryonic development, whereas a more temporal-specific expression pattern was identified in mouse embryos. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis suggested that lncRNAs involved in human early-stage embryonic development are associated with several important functions and processes, such as oocyte maturation, zygotic genome activation and mitochondrial functions. We also found that the network of lncRNAs involved in zygotic genome activation was highly preservative between human and mouse embryos, whereas in other stages no strong correlation between human and mouse embryo was observed. This study provides insight into the molecular mechanism underlying lncRNA involvement in human pre-implantation embryonic development.",27542205,PMC5308646,10.18632/oncotarget.11304,15,Oncotarget,101532965,0.0,0.5734992623329163,0.5652173913043478,0.006688963210702341,0.45848082830275977
Variability of Gene Expression Identifies Transcriptional Regulators of Early Human Embryonic Development,"An analysis of gene expression variability can provide an insightful window into how regulatory control is distributed across the transcriptome. In a single cell analysis, the inter-cellular variability of gene expression measures the consistency of transcript copy numbers observed between cells in the same population. Application of these ideas to the study of early human embryonic development may reveal important insights into the transcriptional programs controlling this process, based on which components are most tightly regulated. Using a published single cell RNA-seq data set of human embryos collected at four-cell, eight-cell, morula and blastocyst stages, we identified genes with the most stable, invariant expression across all four developmental stages. Stably-expressed genes were found to be enriched for those sharing indispensable features, including essentiality, haploinsufficiency, and ubiquitous expression. The stable genes were less likely to be associated with loss-of-function variant genes or human recessive disease genes affected by a DNA copy number variant deletion, suggesting that stable genes have a functional impact on the regulation of some of the basic cellular processes. Genes with low expression variability at early stages of development are involved in regulation of DNA methylation, responses to hypoxia and telomerase activity, whereas by the blastocyst stage, low-variability genes are enriched for metabolic processes as well as telomerase signaling. Based on changes in expression variability, we identified a putative set of gene expression markers of morulae and blastocyst stages. Experimental validation of a blastocyst-expressed variability marker demonstrated that HDDC2 plays a role in the maintenance of pluripotency in human ES and iPS cells. Collectively our analyses identified new regulators involved in human embryonic development that would have otherwise been missed using methods that focus on assessment of the average expression levels; in doing so, we highlight the value of studying expression variability for single cell RNA-seq data.",26288249,PMC4546122,10.1371/journal.pgen.1005428,24,PLoS genetics,101239074,6.02,0.5725435614585876,0.6254180602006689,0.3177257525083612,0.5321548994169587
Single-cell transcriptomics of human embryos identifies multiple sympathoblast lineages with potential implications for neuroblastoma origin,"Characterization of the progression of cellular states during human embryogenesis can provide insights into the origin of pediatric diseases. We examined the transcriptional states of neural crest- and mesoderm-derived lineages differentiating into adrenal glands, kidneys, endothelium and hematopoietic tissue between post-conception weeks 6 and 14 of human development. Our results reveal transitions connecting the intermediate mesoderm and progenitors of organ primordia, the hematopoietic system and endothelial subtypes. Unexpectedly, by using a combination of single-cell transcriptomics and lineage tracing, we found that intra-adrenal sympathoblasts at that stage are directly derived from nerve-associated Schwann cell precursors, similarly to local chromaffin cells, whereas the majority of extra-adrenal sympathoblasts arise from the migratory neural crest. In humans, this process persists during several weeks of development within the large intra-adrenal ganglia-like structures, which may also serve as reservoirs of originating cells in neuroblastoma.",33833454,PMC7610777,10.1038/s41588-021-00818-x,58,Nature genetics,9216904,41.307,0.5723044872283936,0.7859531772575251,0.8929765886287625,0.6791686455142937
Single-cell transcriptome analysis of embryonic and adult endothelial cells allows to rank the hemogenic potential of post-natal endothelium,"Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are crucial for the continuous production of blood cells during life. The transplantation of these cells is one of the most common treatments to cure patient suffering of blood diseases. However, the lack of suitable donors is a major limitation. One option to get HSCs matching perfectly a patient is cellular reprogramming. HSCs emerge from endothelial cells in blood vessels during embryogenesis through the endothelial to hematopoietic transition. Here, we used single-cell transcriptomics analysis to compare embryonic and post-natal endothelial cells to investigate the potential of adult vasculature to be reprogrammed in hematopoietic stem cells. Although transcriptional similarities have been found between embryonic and adult endothelial cells, we found some key differences in term of transcription factors expression. There is a deficit of expression of Runx1, Tal1, Lyl1 and Cbfb in adult endothelial cells compared to their embryonic counterparts. Using a combination of gene expression profiling and gene regulatory network analysis, we found that endothelial cells from the pancreas, brain, kidney and liver appear to be the most suitable targets for cellular reprogramming into HSCs. Overall, our work provides an important resource for the rational design of a reprogramming strategy for the generation of HSCs.",35842474,PMC9288434,10.1038/s41598-022-16127-0,2,Scientific reports,101563288,4.996,0.5708098411560059,0.25752508361204013,0.27424749163879597,0.4488404197437707
Dissecting the initiation of female meiosis in the mouse at single-cell resolution,"Meiosis is one of the most finely orchestrated events during gametogenesis with distinct developmental patterns in males and females. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in this process remain not well known. Here, we report detailed transcriptome analyses of cell populations present in the mouse female gonadal ridges (E11.5) and the embryonic ovaries from E12.5 to E14.5 using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA seq). These periods correspond with the initiation and progression of meiosis throughout the first stage of prophase I. We identified 13 transcriptionally distinct cell populations and 7 transcriptionally distinct germ cell subclusters that correspond to mitotic (3 clusters) and meiotic (4 clusters) germ cells. By analysing cluster-specific gene expression profiles, we found four cell clusters correspond to different cell stages en route to meiosis and characterized their detailed transcriptome dynamics. Our scRNA seq analysis here represents a new important resource for deciphering the molecular pathways driving female meiosis initiation.",32367190,PMC11072979,10.1007/s00018-020-03533-8,24,Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS,9705402,9.207,0.5707500576972961,0.6287625418060201,0.5384615384615384,0.5758948506718894
The promising application of cell-cell interaction analysis in cancer from single-cell and spatial transcriptomics,"Cell-cell interactions instruct cell fate and function. These interactions are hijacked to promote cancer development. Single-cell transcriptomics and spatial transcriptomics have become powerful new tools for researchers to profile the transcriptional landscape of cancer at unparalleled genetic depth. In this review, we discuss the rapidly growing array of computational tools to infer cell-cell interactions from non-spatial single-cell RNA-sequencing and the limited but growing number of methods for spatial transcriptomics data. Downstream analyses of these computational tools and applications to cancer studies are highlighted. We finish by suggesting several directions for further extensions that anticipate the increasing availability of multi-omics cancer data.",37454878,PMC10627116,10.1016/j.semcancer.2023.07.001,7,Seminars in cancer biology,9010218,17.012,0.5687751173973083,0.43478260869565216,0.7157190635451505,0.5713654048865455
Single-cell transcriptomics reveals gene expression dynamics of human fetal kidney development,"The current understanding of mammalian kidney development is largely based on mouse models. Recent landmark studies revealed pervasive differences in renal embryogenesis between mouse and human. The scarcity of detailed gene expression data in humans therefore hampers a thorough understanding of human kidney development and the possible developmental origin of kidney diseases. In this paper, we present a single-cell transcriptomics study of the human fetal kidney. We identified 22 cell types and a host of marker genes. Comparison of samples from different developmental ages revealed continuous gene expression changes in podocytes. To demonstrate the usefulness of our data set, we explored the heterogeneity of the nephrogenic niche, localized podocyte precursors, and confirmed disease-associated marker genes. With close to 18,000 renal cells from five different developmental ages, this study provides a rich resource for the elucidation of human kidney development, easily accessible through an interactive web application.",30789893,PMC6400406,10.1371/journal.pbio.3000152,66,PLoS biology,101183755,9.593,0.5674572587013245,0.8060200668896321,0.5585284280936454,0.6133840542174502
Cell-Cell Communication at the Embryo Implantation Site of Mouse Uterus Revealed by Single-Cell Analysis,"As a crucial step for human reproduction, embryo implantation is a low-efficiency process. Despite rapid advances in recent years, the molecular mechanism underlying embryo implantation remains poorly understood. Here, we used the mouse as an animal model and generated a single-cell transcriptomic atlas of embryo implantation sites. By analyzing inter-implantation sites of the uterus as control, we were able to identify global gene expression changes associated with embryo implantation in each cell type. Additionally, we predicted signaling interactions between uterine luminal epithelial cells and mural trophectoderm of blastocysts, which represent the key mechanism of embryo implantation. We also predicted signaling interactions between uterine epithelial-stromal crosstalk at implantation sites, which are crucial for post-implantation development. Our data provide a valuable resource for deciphering the molecular mechanism underlying embryo implantation.",34068395,PMC8153605,10.3390/ijms22105177,9,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,6.208,0.5645186305046082,0.48494983277591974,0.3311036789297659,0.501921880643902
Tracing the first hematopoietic stem cell generation in human embryo by single-cell RNA sequencing,"Tracing the emergence of the first hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in human embryos, particularly the scarce and transient precursors thereof, is so far challenging, largely due to the technical limitations and the material rarity. Here, using single-cell RNA sequencing, we constructed the first genome-scale gene expression landscape covering the entire course of endothelial-to-HSC transition during human embryogenesis. The transcriptomically defined HSC-primed hemogenic endothelial cells (HECs) were captured at Carnegie stage (CS) 12-14 in an unbiased way, showing an unambiguous feature of arterial endothelial cells (ECs) with the up-regulation of RUNX1, MYB and ANGPT1. Importantly, subcategorizing CD34+CD45-ECs into a CD44+population strikingly enriched HECs by over 10-fold. We further mapped the developmental path from arterial ECs via HSC-primed HECs to hematopoietic stem progenitor cells, and revealed a distinct expression pattern of genes that were transiently over-represented upon the hemogenic fate choice of arterial ECs, including EMCN, PROCR and RUNX1T1. We also uncovered another temporally and molecularly distinct intra-embryonic HEC population, which was detected mainly at earlier CS 10 and lacked the arterial feature. Finally, we revealed the cellular components of the putative aortic niche and potential cellular interactions acting on the HSC-primed HECs. The cellular and molecular programs that underlie the generation of the first HSCs from HECs in human embryos, together with the ability to distinguish the HSC-primed HECs from others, will shed light on the strategies for the production of clinically useful HSCs from pluripotent stem cells.",31501518,PMC6888893,10.1038/s41422-019-0228-6,85,Cell research,9425763,46.297,0.5636181831359863,0.8595317725752508,0.9096989966555183,0.6920170637277456
"Single-cell RNA sequencing for the study of development, physiology and disease","An ongoing technological revolution is continually improving our ability to carry out very high-resolution studies of gene expression patterns. Current technology enables the global gene expression profiles of single cells to be defined, facilitating dissection of heterogeneity in cell populations that was previously hidden. In contrast to gene expression studies that use bulk RNA samples and provide only a virtual average of the diverse constituent cells, single-cell studies enable the molecular distinction of all cell types within a complex population mix, such as a tumour or developing organ. For instance, single-cell gene expression profiling has contributed to improved understanding of how histologically identical, adjacent cells make different differentiation decisions during development. Beyond development, single-cell gene expression studies have enabled the characteristics of previously known cell types to be more fully defined and facilitated the identification of novel categories of cells, contributing to improvements in our understanding of both normal and disease-related physiological processes and leading to the identification of new treatment approaches. Although limitations remain to be overcome, technology for the analysis of single-cell gene expression patterns is improving rapidly and beginning to provide a detailed atlas of the gene expression patterns of all cell types in the human body.",29789704,PMC6070143,10.1038/s41581-018-0021-7,229,Nature reviews.

Transcriptome age of individual cell types inCaenorhabditis elegans,"The phylotranscriptomic analysis of development in several species revealed the expression of older and more conserved genes in midembryonic stages and younger and more divergent genes in early and late embryonic stages, which supported the hourglass mode of development. However, previous work only studied the transcriptome age of whole embryos or embryonic sublineages, leaving the cellular basis of the hourglass pattern and the variation of transcriptome ages among cell types unexplored. By analyzing both bulk and single-cell transcriptomic data, we studied the transcriptome age of the nematodeCaenorhabditis elegansthroughout development. Using the bulk RNA-seq data, we identified the morphogenesis phase in midembryonic development as the phylotypic stage with the oldest transcriptome and confirmed the results using whole-embryo transcriptome assembled from single-cell RNA-seq data. The variation in transcriptome ages among individual cell types remained small in early and midembryonic development and grew bigger in late embryonic and larval stages as cells and tissues differentiate. Lineages that give rise to certain tissues (e.g., hypodermis and some neurons) but not all recapitulated the hourglass pattern across development at the single-cell transcriptome level. Further analysis of the variation in transcriptome ages among the 128 neuron types inC. elegansnervous system found that a group of chemosensory neurons and their downstream interneurons expressed very young transcriptomes and may contribute to adaptation in recent evolution. Finally, the variation in transcriptome age among the neuron types, as well as the age of their cell fate regulators, led us to hypothesize the evolutionary history of some neuron types.",36812209,PMC9992843,10.1073/pnas.2216351120,1,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,12.779,0.5613951683044434,0.1806020066889632,0.6287625418060201,0.49871001068166265
Opportunities and tradeoffs in single-cell transcriptomic technologies,"Recent technological and algorithmic advances enable single-cell transcriptomic analysis with remarkable depth and breadth. Nonetheless, a persistent challenge is the compromise between the ability to profile high numbers of cells and the achievement of full-length transcript coverage. Currently, the field is progressing and developing new and creative solutions that improve cellular throughput, gene detection sensitivity and full-length transcript capture. Furthermore, long-read sequencing approaches for single-cell transcripts are breaking frontiers that have previously blocked full transcriptome characterization. We here present a comprehensive overview of available options for single-cell transcriptome profiling, highlighting the key advantages and disadvantages of each approach.",37953195,,10.1016/j.tig.2023.10.003,1,Trends in genetics : TIG,8507085,0.0,0.5613651275634766,0.18394648829431437,0.010033444816053512,0.3756150631601595
Decoding the Spermatogenesis Program: New Insights from Transcriptomic Analyses,"Spermatogenesis is a complex differentiation process coordinated spatiotemporally across and along seminiferous tubules. Cellular heterogeneity has made it challenging to obtain stage-specific molecular profiles of germ and somatic cells using bulk transcriptomic analyses. This has limited our ability to understand regulation of spermatogenesis and to integrate knowledge from model organisms to humans. The recent advancement of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies provides insights into the cell type diversity and molecular signatures in the testis. Fine-grained cell atlases of the testis contain both known and novel cell types and define the functional states along the germ cell developmental trajectory in many species. These atlases provide a reference system for integrated interspecies comparisons to discover mechanistic parallels and to enable future studies. Despite recent advances, we currently lack high-resolution data to probe germ cell-somatic cell interactions in the tissue environment, but the use of highly multiplexed spatial analysis technologies has begun to resolve this problem. Taken together, recent single-cell studies provide an improvedunderstanding of gametogenesis to examine underlying causes of infertility and enable the development of new therapeutic interventions.",36070560,PMC10722372,10.1146/annurev-genet-080320-040045,8,Annual review of genetics,117605,13.826,0.5557366609573364,0.45819397993311034,0.6588628762541806,0.55685336781186
Single-cell transcriptome analysis defines mesenchymal stromal cells in the mouse incisor dental pulp,"The dental pulp is known to be highly heterogenous, comprising distinct cell types including mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), which represent neural-crest-derived cells with the ability to differentiate into multiple cell lineages. However, the cellular heterogeneity and the transcriptome signature of different cell clusters within the dental pulp remain to be established. To better understand discrete cell types, we applied a single-cell RNA sequencing strategy to establish the RNA expression profiles of individual dental pulp cells from 5- to 6-day-old mouse incisors. Our study revealed distinct subclasses of cells representing osteoblast, odontoblast, endothelial, pancreatic, neuronal, immune, pericyte and ameloblast lineages. Collectively, our research demonstrates the complexity and diversity of cell subclasses within the incisor dental pulp, thus providing a foundation for uncovering the molecular processes that govern cell fate decisions and lineage commitment in dental pulp-derived MSCs.",34915194,,10.1016/j.gep.2021.119228,4,Gene expression patterns : GEP,101167473,1.488,0.5556462407112122,0.36789297658862874,0.12040133779264214,0.4310466073029815
"The double-edged sword of the mammalian oocyte--advantages, drawbacks and approaches for basic and clinical analysis at the single cell level","Oocytes are usually the largest cells in the body and as such offer unique opportunities for single-cell analysis. Unfortunately, these cells are also some of the rarest in the mammalian female, usually necessitating single-cell analysis. In cases of infertility in humans, determining the quality of the oocyte is often restricted to a morphological analysis or to the study of cellular behaviors in the developing embryo. Minimally invasive approaches could greatly assist the clinician to prioritize oocytes for fertilization or following fertilization, which embryo to transfer back into the woman. Transcriptomics of human and mouse oocytes may have great utility, and recently it was learned that the polar body faithfully reflects the transcript prevalence in the oocyte. The polar body may thus serve as a minimally invasive proxy for an oocyte in the clinic. In the mouse, the transcriptomes of oocytes from mice of the same strain are markedly similar; no significant differences are apparent in transcript prevalence or identity. In human oocytes however, the transcript pool is highly variable. This is likely the result of different histories of each oocyte, in the age of the donor woman, the different hormonal exposures and the prolonged time from specification of the primary oocyte to the fully grown and ovulated egg. This variability in human oocytes also emphasizes the need for cell-by-cell analysis of the oocytes in vitro; which oocytes have a better potential for fertilization and development? To this end, new imaging capabilities are being employed. For example, a single-cell analytical device for oocytes (the simple perfusion apparatus, or SPA) enables investigators to load multiple oocytes in individual wells, to visualize them on the microscope and to use controlled temperature and media flow by perfusion for optimal clinical applications. Recently, developed Raman microspectroscopy approaches suggest that this imaging modality may enable more in-depth analysis of the molecular characteristics of an oocyte that, in combination with the SPA and transcriptomic approaches, might assist the clinician to prioritize more effectively human oocytes and embryos for transfer into women. This review is intended to update the reader on the status of the examination of single oocytes from a variety of approaches and to emphasize areas that may be primed for advancement in the near future.",26590170,PMC4767051,10.1093/molehr/gav064,0,Molecular human reproduction,9513710,4.518,0.5532337427139282,0.03678929765886288,0.24414715719063546,0.3881275365982566
Advances and Challenges in Spatial Transcriptomics for Developmental Biology,"Development from single cells to multicellular tissues and organs involves more than just the exact replication of cells, which is known as differentiation. The primary focus of research into the mechanism of differentiation has been differences in gene expression profiles between individual cells. However, it has predominantly been conducted at low throughput and bulk levels, challenging the efforts to understand molecular mechanisms of differentiation during the developmental process in animals and humans. During the last decades, rapid methodological advancements in genomics facilitated the ability to study developmental processes at a genome-wide level and finer resolution. Particularly, sequencing transcriptomes at single-cell resolution, enabled by single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), was a breath-taking innovation, allowing scientists to gain a better understanding of differentiation and cell lineage during the developmental process. However, single-cell isolation during scRNA-seq results in the loss of the spatial information of individual cells and consequently limits our understanding of the specific functions of the cells performed by different spatial regions of tissues or organs. This greatly encourages the emergence of the spatial transcriptomic discipline and tools. Here, we summarize the recent application of scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomic tools for developmental biology. We also discuss the limitations of current spatial transcriptomic tools and approaches, as well as possible solutions and future prospects.",36671541,PMC9855858,10.3390/biom13010156,9,Biomolecules,101596414,6.064,0.5427724123001099,0.4882943143812709,0.32441471571906355,0.4882052534001328
"Single-cell transcriptomics: background, technologies, applications, and challenges","Single-cell sequencing was developed as a high-throughput tool to elucidate unusual and transient cell states that are barely visible in the bulk. This technology reveals the evolutionary status of cells and differences between populations, helps to identify unique cell subtypes and states, reveals regulatory relationships between genes, targets and molecular mechanisms in disease processes, tumor heterogeneity, the state of the immune environment, etc. However, the high cost and technical limitations of single-cell sequencing initially prevented its widespread application, but with advances in research, numerous new single-cell sequencing techniques have been discovered, lowering the cost barrier. Many single-cell sequencing platforms and bioinformatics methods have recently become commercially available, allowing researchers to make fascinating observations. They are now increasingly being used in various industries. Several protocols have been discovered in this context and each technique has unique characteristics, capabilities and challenges.

Single-cell transcriptomics in cancer: computational challenges and opportunities,"Intratumor heterogeneity is a common characteristic across diverse cancer types and presents challenges to current standards of treatment. Advancements in high-throughput sequencing and imaging technologies provide opportunities to identify and characterize these aspects of heterogeneity. Notably, transcriptomic profiling at a single-cell resolution enables quantitative measurements of the molecular activity that underlies the phenotypic diversity of cells within a tumor. Such high-dimensional data require computational analysis to extract relevant biological insights about the cell types and states that drive cancer development, pathogenesis, and clinical outcomes. In this review, we highlight emerging themes in the computational analysis of single-cell transcriptomics data and their applications to cancer research. We focus on downstream analytical challenges relevant to cancer research, including how to computationally perform unified analysis across many patients and disease states, distinguish neoplastic from nonneoplastic cells, infer communication with the tumor microenvironment, and delineate tumoral and microenvironmental evolution with trajectory and RNA velocity analysis.

Single-cell RNA-seq analysis of mouse preimplantation embryos by third-generation sequencing,"The development of next generation sequencing (NGS) platform-based single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) techniques has tremendously changed biological researches, while there are still many questions that cannot be addressed by them due to their short read lengths. We developed a novel scRNA-seq technology based on third-generation sequencing (TGS) platform (single-cell amplification and sequencing of full-length RNAs by Nanopore platform, SCAN-seq). SCAN-seq exhibited high sensitivity and accuracy comparable to NGS platform-based scRNA-seq methods. Moreover, we captured thousands of unannotated transcripts of diverse types, with high verification rate by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR)-coupled Sanger sequencing in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). Then, we used SCAN-seq to analyze the mouse preimplantation embryos. We could clearly distinguish cells at different developmental stages, and a total of 27,250 unannotated transcripts from 9,338 genes were identified, with many of which showed developmental stage-specific expression patterns. Finally, we showed that SCAN-seq exhibited high accuracy on determining allele-specific gene expression patterns within an individual cell.

Novel PRD-like homeodomain transcription factors and retrotransposon elements in early human development,"Transcriptional program that drives human preimplantation development is largely unknown. Here, by using single-cell RNA sequencing of 348 oocytes, zygotes and single blastomeres from 2- to 3-day-old embryos, we provide a detailed analysis of the human preimplantation transcriptome. By quantifying transcript far 5'-ends (TFEs), we include in our analysis transcripts that derive from alternative promoters. We show that 32 and 129 genes are transcribed during the transition from oocyte to four-cell stage and from four- to eight-cell stage, respectively. A number of identified transcripts originates from previously unannotated genes that include the PRD-like homeobox genes ARGFX, CPHX1, CPHX2, DPRX, DUXA, DUXB and LEUTX.

Reconstituting the transcriptome and DNA methylome landscapes of human implantation,"Implantation is a milestone event during mammalian embryogenesis. Implantation failure is a considerable cause of early pregnancy loss in humans1. Owing to the difficulty of obtaining human embryos early after implantation in vivo, it remains unclear how the gene regulatory network and epigenetic mechanisms control the implantation process. Here, by combining an in vitro culture system for the development human embryos after implantation and single-cell multi-omics sequencing technologies, more than 8,000 individual cells from 65 human peri-implantation embryos were systematically analysed. Unsupervised dimensionality reduction and clustering algorithms of the transcriptome data show stepwise implantation routes for the epiblast, primitive endoderm and trophectoderm lineages, suggesting robust preparation for the proper establishment of a mother-to-offspring connection during implantation. Female embryos showed initiation of random X chromosome inactivation based on analysis of parental allele-specific expression of X-chromosome-linked genes during implantation. Notably, using single-cell triple omics sequencing analysis, the re-methylation of the genome in cells from the primitive endoderm lineage was shown to be much slower than in cells of both epiblast and trophectoderm lineages during the implantation process, which indicates that there are distinct re-establishment features in the DNA methylome of the epiblast and primitive endoderm-even though both lineages are derived from the inner cell mass. Collectively, our work provides insights into the complex molecular mechanisms that regulate the implantation of human embryos, and helps to advance future efforts to understanding early embryonic development and reproductive medicine.",31435013,,10.1038/s41586-019-1500-0,123,Nature,410462,69.504,0.5388922691345215,0.9096989966555183,0.9866220735785953,0.7025995755275356
Unraveling Psychiatric Disorders through Neural Single-Cell Transcriptomics Approaches,"The development of single-cell and single-nucleus transcriptome technologies is enabling the unraveling of the molecular and cellular heterogeneity of psychiatric disorders. The complexity of the brain and the relationships between different brain regions can be better understood through the classification of individual cell populations based on their molecular markers and transcriptomic features. Analysis of these unique cell types can explain their involvement in the pathology of psychiatric disorders. Recent studies in both human and animal models have emphasized the importance of transcriptome analysis of neuronal cells in psychiatric disorders but also revealed critical roles for non-neuronal cells, such as oligodendrocytes and microglia. In this review, we update current findings on the brain transcriptome and explore molecular studies addressing transcriptomic alterations identified in human and animal models in depression and stress, neurodegenerative disorders (Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease), schizophrenia, opioid use disorder, and alcohol and psychostimulant abuse. We also comment on potential future directions in single-cell and single-nucleus studies.",36981041,PMC10047992,10.3390/genes14030771,1,Genes,101551097,4.141,0.5386495590209961,0.18729096989966554,0.22742474916387959,0.4061328792253066
Spatial transcriptomic survey of human embryonic cerebral cortex by single-cell RNA-seq analysis,"The cellular complexity of human brain development has been intensively investigated, although a regional characterization of the entire human cerebral cortex based on single-cell transcriptome analysis has not been reported. Here, we performed RNA-seq on over 4,000 individual cells from 22 brain regions of human mid-gestation embryos. We identified 29 cell sub-clusters, which showed different proportions in each region and the pons showed especially high percentage of astrocytes. Embryonic neurons were not as diverse as adult neurons, although they possessed important features of their destinies in adults. Neuron development was unsynchronized in the cerebral cortex, as dorsal regions appeared to be more mature than ventral regions at this stage. Region-specific genes were comprehensively identified in each neuronal sub-cluster, and a large proportion of these genes were neural disease related. Our results present a systematic landscape of the regionalized gene expression and neuron maturation of the human cerebral cortex.",29867213,PMC6028726,10.1038/s41422-018-0053-3,101,Cell research,9425763,46.297,0.5377697348594666,0.8896321070234113,0.9130434782608695,0.6831969579725361
Cell lineage and communication network inference via optimization for single-cell transcriptomics,"The use of single-cell transcriptomics has become a major approach to delineate cell subpopulations and the transitions between them. While various computational tools using different mathematical methods have been developed to infer clusters, marker genes, and cell lineage, none yet integrate these within a mathematical framework to perform multiple tasks coherently. Such coherence is critical for the inference of cell-cell communication, a major remaining challenge. Here, we present similarity matrix-based optimization for single-cell data analysis (SoptSC), in which unsupervised clustering, pseudotemporal ordering, lineage inference, and marker gene identification are inferred via a structured cell-to-cell similarity matrix. SoptSC then predicts cell-cell communication networks, enabling reconstruction of complex cell lineages that include feedback or feedforward interactions. Application of SoptSC to early embryonic development, epidermal regeneration, and hematopoiesis demonstrates robust identification of subpopulations, lineage relationships, and pseudotime, and prediction of pathway-specific cell communication patterns regulating processes of development and differentiation.",30923815,PMC6582411,10.1093/nar/gkz204,69,Nucleic acids research,411011,19.16,0.5343999266624451,0.8193979933110368,0.8093645484949833,0.646392464358671
Transcriptome Analysis at the Single-Cell Level Using SMART Technology,"RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is a powerful method for analyzing cell state, with minimal bias, and has broad applications within the biological sciences. However, transcriptome analysis of seemingly homogenous cell populations may in fact overlook significant heterogeneity that can be uncovered at the single-cell level. The ultra-low amount of RNA contained in a single cell requires extraordinarily sensitive and reproducible transcriptome analysis methods. As next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies mature, transcriptome profiling by RNA-seq is increasingly being used to decipher the molecular signature of individual cells. This unit describes an ultra-sensitive and reproducible protocol to generate cDNA and sequencing libraries directly from single cells or RNA inputs ranging from 10 pg to 10 ng. Important considerations for working with minute RNA inputs are given.

[Dissecting early development of the kidney by single cell transcriptomics],"Each of the billions of the cells in our body exhibits their identity with unique gene expression profile. Recent advances in single cell transcriptomics enable to conduct cell taxonomy identifying new cell types and to re-arrange cells in order of pseudo-time course describing differentiation status of each cell. Even though the cost is still high, the single cell transcriptomics now becomes one of the conventional assays. We have applied the single cell gene expression analysis to dissect human development. In this article, we show our recent progress on a study describing early development of the kidney using human iPS cells by the single cell transcriptomics.",30745515,,10.1254/fpj.153.61,0,Nihon yakurigaku zasshi.

Single cell transcriptomics identifies a signaling network coordinating endoderm and mesoderm diversification during foregut organogenesis,"Visceral organs, such as the lungs, stomach and liver, are derived from the fetal foregut through a series of inductive interactions between the definitive endoderm (DE) and the surrounding splanchnic mesoderm (SM). While DE patterning is fairly well studied, the paracrine signaling controlling SM regionalization and how this is coordinated with epithelial identity is obscure. Here, we use single cell transcriptomics to generate a high-resolution cell state map of the embryonic mouse foregut. This identifies a diversity of SM cell types that develop in close register with the organ-specific epithelium. We infer a spatiotemporal signaling network of endoderm-mesoderm interactions that orchestrate foregut organogenesis. We validate key predictions with mouse genetics, showing the importance of endoderm-derived signals in mesoderm patterning. Finally, leveraging these signaling interactions, we generate different SM subtypes from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), which previously have been elusive.

Single-cell transcriptomics of human islet ontogeny defines the molecular basis of Î²-cell dedifferentiation in T2D,"Objective:Dedifferentiation of pancreatic Î²-cells may reduce islet function in type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, the prevalence, plasticity and functional consequences of this cellular state remain unknown.Methods:We employed single-cell RNAseq to detail the maturation program of Î±- and Î²-cells during human ontogeny. We also compared islets from non-diabetic and T2D individuals.Results:Both Î±- and Î²-cells mature in part by repressing non-endocrine genes; however, Î±-cells retain hallmarks of an immature state, while Î²-cells attain a full Î²-cell specific gene expression program. In islets from T2D donors, both Î±- and Î²-cells have a less mature expression profile, de-repressing the juvenile genetic program and exocrine genes and increasing expression of exocytosis, inflammation and stress response signalling pathways. These changes are consistent with the increased proportion of Î²-cells displaying suboptimal function observed in T2D islets.Conclusions:These findings provide new insights into the molecular program underlying islet cell maturation during human ontogeny and the loss of transcriptomic maturity that occurs in islets of type 2 diabetics.",32739450,PMC7471622,10.1016/j.molmet.2020.101057,37,Molecular metabolism,101605730,8.568,0.528533399105072,0.7023411371237458,0.5083612040133779,0.559260507690468
A dynamical systems treatment of transcriptomic trajectories in hematopoiesis,"Inspired by Waddington's illustration of an epigenetic landscape, cell-fate transitions have been envisioned as bifurcating dynamical systems, wherein exogenous signaling dynamics couple to the enormously complex signaling and transcriptional machinery of a cell to elicit qualitative transitions in its collective state. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), which measures the distributions of possible transcriptional states in large populations of differentiating cells, provides an alternate view, in which development is marked by the variations of a myriad of genes. Here, we present a mathematical formalism for rigorously evaluating, from a dynamical systems perspective, whether scRNA-seq trajectories display statistical signatures consistent with bifurcations and, as a case study, pinpoint regions of multistability along the neutrophil branch of hematopoeitic differentiation. Additionally, we leverage the geometric features of linear instability to identify the low-dimensional phase plane in gene expression space within which the multistability unfolds, highlighting novel genetic players that are crucial for neutrophil differentiation. Broadly, we show that a dynamical systems treatment of scRNA-seq data provides mechanistic insights into the high-dimensional processes of cellular differentiation, taking a step toward systematic construction of mathematical models for transcriptomic dynamics.",37260149,PMC10281553,10.1242/dev.201280,2,"Development (Cambridge, England)",8701744,6.862,0.5276663899421692,0.2608695652173913,0.4013377926421405,0.4490413055372079
Single cell analysis of the developing mouse kidney provides deeper insight into marker gene expression and ligand-receptor crosstalk,"Recent advances in the generation of kidney organoids and the culture of primary nephron progenitors from mouse and human have been based on knowledge of the molecular basis of kidney development in mice. Although gene expression during kidney development has been intensely investigated, single cell profiling provides new opportunities to further subsect component cell types and the signalling networks at play. Here, we describe the generation and analysis of 6732 single cell transcriptomes from the fetal mouse kidney [embryonic day (E)18.5] and 7853 sorted nephron progenitor cells (E14.5). These datasets provide improved resolution of cell types and specific markers, including subdivision of the renal stroma and heterogeneity within the nephron progenitor population. Ligand-receptor interaction and pathway analysis reveals novel crosstalk between cellular compartments and associates new pathways with differentiation of nephron and ureteric epithelium cell types. We identify transcriptional congruence between the distal nephron and ureteric epithelium, showing that most markers previously used to identify ureteric epithelium are not specific. Together, this work improves our understanding of metanephric kidney development and provides a template to guide the regeneration of renal tissue.",31118232,,10.1242/dev.178673,75,"Development (Cambridge, England)",8701744,6.862,0.5271339416503906,0.8394648829431438,0.40468227424749165,0.5651097964283615
Isoform-resolved transcriptome of the human preimplantation embryo,"Human preimplantation development involves extensive remodeling of RNA expression and splicing. However, its transcriptome has been compiled using short-read sequencing data, which fails to capture most full-length mRNAs. Here, we generate an isoform-resolved transcriptome of early human development by performing long- and short-read RNA sequencing on 73 embryos spanning the zygote to blastocyst stages. We identify 110,212 unannotated isoforms transcribed from known genes, including highly conserved protein-coding loci and key developmental regulators. We further identify 17,964 isoforms from 5,239 unannotated genes, which are largely non-coding, primate-specific, and highly associated with transposable elements. These isoforms are widely supported by the integration of published multi-omics datasets, including single-cell 8CLC and blastoid studies. Alternative splicing and gene co-expression network analyses further reveal that embryonic genome activation is associated with splicing disruption and transient upregulation of gene modules. Together, these findings show that the human embryo transcriptome is far more complex than currently known, and will act as a valuable resource to empower future studies exploring development.",37903791,PMC10616205,10.1038/s41467-023-42558-y,4,Nature communications,101528555,17.694,0.5269970297813416,0.3712374581939799,0.7491638795986622,0.5402784854273334
Quantifying Landscape-Flux via Single-Cell Transcriptomics Uncovers the Underlying Mechanism of Cell Cycle,"Recent developments in single-cell sequencing technology enable the acquisition of entire transcriptome data. Understanding the underlying mechanism and identifying the driving force of transcriptional regulation governing cell function directly from these data remains challenging. This study reconstructs a continuous vector field of the cell cycle based on discrete single-cell RNA velocity to quantify the single-cell global nonequilibrium dynamic landscape-flux. It reveals that large fluctuations disrupt the global landscape and genetic perturbations alter landscape-flux, thus identifying key genes in maintaining cell cycle dynamics and predicting associated functional effects. Additionally, it quantifies the fundamental energy cost of the cell cycle initiation and unveils that sustaining the cell cycle requires curl flux and dissipation to maintain the oscillatory phase coherence. This study enables the inference of the cell cycle gene regulatory networks directly from the single-cell transcriptomic data, including the feedback mechanisms and interaction intensity. This provides a golden opportunity to experimentally verify the landscape-flux theory and also obtain its associated quantifications. It also offers a unique framework for combining the landscape-flux theory and single-cell high-through sequencing experiments for understanding the underlying mechanisms of the cell cycle and can be extended to other nonequilibrium biological processes, such as differentiation development and disease pathogenesis.",38353329,PMC11040366,10.1002/advs.202308879,0,"Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)",101664569,17.521,0.5268905162811279,0.046822742474916385,0.725752508361204,0.47064935993590085
Nx1-Seq (Well Based Single-Cell Analysis System),"Research on the hierarchical nature of cell differentiation and heterogeneity in tissues has been performed by isolating and identifying cells by the use of monoclonal antibodies, cell sorting, microdissection, and functional assays. However, it is difficult to analyze continuous changes in cell differentiation and the identification of cells for which cell markers are unclear. Furthermore, cell populations considered identical were shown to be diverse. Recently, single cell gene expression analysis was performed to help understand the complexity of cell populations. Single-cell analysis can analyze the diversity of individual cell populations as well as the tissue microenvironment, and is extremely useful for research on intercellular interactions in diseases and identifying specific marker genes. Recent advances in technology have made it possible to analyze hundreds of single cells.

Single-cell transcriptomics of the developing lateral geniculate nucleus reveals insights into circuit assembly and refinement,"Coordinated changes in gene expression underlie the early patterning and cell-type specification of the central nervous system. However, much less is known about how such changes contribute to later stages of circuit assembly and refinement. In this study, we employ single-cell RNA sequencing to develop a detailed, whole-transcriptome resource of gene expression across four time points in the developing dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), a visual structure in the brain that undergoes a well-characterized program of postnatal circuit development. This approach identifies markers defining the major LGN cell types, including excitatory relay neurons, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, microglia, and endothelial cells. Most cell types exhibit significant transcriptional changes across development, dynamically expressing genes involved in distinct processes including retinotopic mapping, synaptogenesis, myelination, and synaptic refinement. Our data suggest that genes associated with synapse and circuit development are expressed in a larger proportion of nonneuronal cell types than previously appreciated. Furthermore, we used this single-cell expression atlas to identify the Prkcd-Cre mouse line as a tool for selective manipulation of relay neurons during a late stage of sensory-driven synaptic refinement. This transcriptomic resource provides a cellular map of gene expression across several cell types of the LGN, and offers insight into the molecular mechanisms of circuit development in the postnatal brain.",29343640,PMC5798372,10.1073/pnas.1717871115,36,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,12.779,0.5263123512268066,0.6889632107023411,0.6321070234113713,0.5800014575588264
Defining the three cell lineages of the human blastocyst by single-cell RNA-seq,"Here, we provide fundamental insights into early human development by single-cell RNA-sequencing of human and mouse preimplantation embryos. We elucidate conserved transcriptional programs along with those that are human specific. Importantly, we validate our RNA-sequencing findings at the protein level, which further reveals differences in human and mouse embryo gene expression. For example, we identify several genes exclusively expressed in the human pluripotent epiblast, including the transcription factor KLF17. Key components of the TGF-Î² signalling pathway, including NODAL, GDF3, TGFBR1/ALK5, LEFTY1, SMAD2, SMAD4 and TDGF1, are also enriched in the human epiblast. Intriguingly, inhibition of TGF-Î² signalling abrogates NANOG expression in human epiblast cells, consistent with a requirement for this pathway in pluripotency. Although the key trophectoderm factors Id2, Elf5 and Eomes are exclusively localized to this lineage in the mouse, the human orthologues are either absent or expressed in alternative lineages. Importantly, we also identify genes with conserved expression dynamics, including Foxa2/FOXA2, which we show is restricted to the primitive endoderm in both human and mouse embryos. Comparison of the human epiblast to existing embryonic stem cells (hESCs) reveals conservation of pluripotency but also additional pathways more enriched in hESCs. Our analysis highlights significant differences in human preimplantation development compared with mouse and provides a molecular blueprint to understand human embryogenesis and its relationship to stem cells.",26293300,PMC4582176,10.1242/dev.123547,184,"Development (Cambridge, England)",8701744,6.862,0.5258862376213074,0.9364548494983278,0.4080267558528428,0.5844280636430186
Single-Cell Sequencing Methodologies: From Transcriptome to Multi-Dimensional Measurement,"Cells are the basic building blocks of biological systems, with inherent unique molecular features and development trajectories. The study of single cells facilitates in-depth understanding of cellular diversity, disease processes, and organization of multicellular organisms. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies have become essential tools for the interrogation of gene expression patterns and the dynamics of single cells, allowing cellular heterogeneity to be dissected at unprecedented resolution. Nevertheless, measuring at only transcriptome level or 1D is incomplete; the cellular heterogeneity reflects in multiple dimensions, including the genome, epigenome, transcriptome, spatial, and even temporal dimensions. Hence, integrative single cell analysis is highly desired. In addition, the way to interpret sequencing data by virtue of bioinformatic tools also exerts critical roles in revealing differential gene expression. Here, a comprehensive review that summarizes the cutting-edge single-cell transcriptome sequencing methodologies, including scRNA-seq, spatial and temporal transcriptome profiling, multi-omics sequencing and computational methods developed for scRNA-seq data analysis is provided.

Revealing the vectors of cellular identity with single-cell genomics,"Single-cell genomics has now made it possible to create a comprehensive atlas of human cells. At the same time, it has reopened definitions of a cell's identity and of the ways in which identity is regulated by the cell's molecular circuitry. Emerging computational analysis methods, especially in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), have already begun to reveal, in a data-driven way, the diverse simultaneous facets of a cell's identity, from discrete cell types to continuous dynamic transitions and spatial locations. These developments will eventually allow a cell to be represented as a superposition of 'basis vectors', each determining a different (but possibly dependent) aspect of cellular organization and function. However, computational methods must also overcome considerable challenges-from handling technical noise and data scale to forming new abstractions of biology. As the scale of single-cell experiments continues to increase, new computational approaches will be essential for constructing and characterizing a reference map of cell identities.",27824854,PMC5465644,10.1038/nbt.3711,283,Nature biotechnology,9604648,68.164,0.5190337300300598,0.9665551839464883,0.9665551839464883,0.6980423115966312
Single-cell biclustering for cell-specific transcriptomic perturbation detection in AD progression,"The pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease (AD) involves complex gene regulatory changes across different cell types. To help decipher this complexity, we introduce single-cell Bayesian biclustering (scBC), a framework for identifying cell-specific gene network biomarkers in scRNA and snRNA-seq data. Through biclustering, scBC enables the analysis of perturbations in functional gene modules at the single-cell level. Applying the scBC framework to AD snRNA-seq data reveals the perturbations within gene modules across distinct cell groups and sheds light on gene-cell correlations during AD progression. Notably, our method helps to overcome common challenges in single-cell data analysis, including batch effects and dropout events. Incorporating prior knowledge further enables the framework to yield more biologically interpretable results. Comparative analyses on simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate the precision and robustness of our approach compared to other state-of-the-art biclustering methods. scBC holds potential for unraveling the mechanisms underlying polygenic diseases characterized by intricate gene coexpression patterns.",38554701,PMC11045878,10.1016/j.crmeth.2024.100742,0,Cell reports methods,9918227360606676,0.0,0.5183938145637512,0.05016722408026756,0.020066889632107024,0.32508311148072566

Single-Cell Analysis of Hematopoietic Stem Cells,"The study of hematopoiesis has been revolutionized in recent years by the application of single-cell RNA sequencing technologies. The technique coupled with rapidly developing bioinformatic analysis has provided great insight into the cell type compositions of many populations previously defined by their cell surface phenotype. Moreover, transcriptomic information enables the identification of individual molecules and pathways which define novel cell populations and their transitions including cell lineage decisions. Combining single-cell transcriptional profiling with molecular perturbations allows functional analysis of individual factors in gene regulatory networks and better understanding of the earliest stages of malignant transformation. In this chapter we describe a comprehensive protocol for scRNA-Seq analysis of the mouse bone marrow, using both plate-based (low throughput) and droplet-based (high throughput) methods. The protocol includes instructions for sample preparation, an antibody panel for flow cytometric purification of hematopoietic progenitors with index sorting for plate-based analysis or in bulk for droplet-based methods. The plate-based protocol described in this chapter is a combination of the Smart-Seq2 and mcSCRB-Seq protocols, optimized in our laboratory. It utilizes off-the-shelf reagents for cDNA preparation, is amenable to automation using a liquid handler, and takes 4 days from preparation of the cells for sorting to producing a sequencing-ready library.

A Single-Cell Transcriptomic Map of the Human and Mouse Pancreas Reveals Inter- and Intra-cell Population Structure,"Although the function of the mammalian pancreas hinges on complex interactions of distinct cell types, gene expression profiles have primarily been described with bulk mixtures. Here we implemented a droplet-based, single-cell RNA-seq method to determine the transcriptomes of over 12,000 individual pancreatic cells from four human donors and two mouse strains. Cells could be divided into 15 clusters that matched previously characterized cell types: all endocrine cell types, including rare epsilon-cells; exocrine cell types; vascular cells; Schwann cells; quiescent and activated stellate cells; and four types of immune cells. We detected subpopulations of ductal cells with distinct expression profiles and validated their existence with immuno-histochemistry stains. Moreover, among human beta- cells, we detected heterogeneity in the regulation of genes relating to functional maturation and levels of ER stress.

Single-cell transcriptomic landscape of nucleated cells in umbilical cord blood,"Background:For both pediatric and adult patients, umbilical cord blood (UCB) transplant is a therapeutic option for a variety of hematologic diseases, such as blood cancers, myeloproliferative disorders, genetic diseases, and metabolic disorders. However, the level of cellular heterogeneity and diversity of nucleated cells in UCB has not yet been assessed in an unbiased and systemic fashion. In the present study, nucleated cells from UCB were subjected to single-cell RNA sequencing to simultaneously profile the gene expression signatures of thousands of cells, generating a rich resource for further functional studies. Here, we report the transcriptomes of 17,637 UCB cells, covering 12 major cell types, many of which can be further divided into distinct subpopulations.Results:Pseudotemporal ordering of nucleated red blood cells identifies wave-like activation and suppression of transcription regulators, leading to a polarized cellular state, which may reflect nucleated red blood cell maturation. Progenitor cells in UCB also comprise 2 subpopulations with activation of divergent transcription programs, leading to specific cell fate commitment. Detailed profiling of cytotoxic cell populations unveiled granzymes B and K signatures in natural killer and natural killer T-cell types in UCB.Conclusions:Taken together, our data form a comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic landscape that reveals previously unrecognized cell types, pathways, and mechanisms of gene expression regulation.

Single-cell transcriptome profiling reveals molecular heterogeneity in human umbilical cord tissue and culture-expanded mesenchymal stem cells,"Human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (UMSCs) demonstrate great therapeutic potential in regenerative medicine. The use of UMSCs for clinical applications requires high quantity and good quality of cells usually by in vitro expansion. However, the heterogeneity and the characteristics of cultured UMSCs and the cognate human umbilical cord tissue at single-cell resolution remain poorly defined. In this study, we created a single-cell transcriptome profile of human umbilical cord tissue and the cognate culture-expanded UMSCs. Based on the inferred characteristics of cell clusters and trajectory analysis, we identified three subgroups in culture-expanded UMSCs and putative novel transcription factors (TFs) in regulating UMSC state transition. Further, putative ligand-receptor interaction analysis demonstrated that cellular interactions most frequently occurred in epithelial-like cells with other cell groups in umbilical cord tissue. Moreover, we dissected the transcriptomic differences of in vitro and in vivo subgroups and inferred the telomere-related molecules and pathways that might be activated in UMSCs for cell expansion in vitro.

Single-Cell RNA Sequencing of Human Embryonic Stem Cell Differentiation Delineates Adverse Effects of Nicotine on Embryonic Development,"Nicotine, the main chemical constituent of tobacco, is highly detrimental to the developing fetus by increasing the risk of gestational complications and organ disorders. The effects of nicotine on human embryonic development and related mechanisms, however, remain poorly understood. Here, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived embryoid body (EB) in the presence or absence of nicotine. Nicotine-induced lineage-specific responses and dysregulated cell-to-cell communication in EBs, shedding light on the adverse effects of nicotine on human embryonic development. In addition, nicotine reduced cell viability, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), and altered cell cycling in EBs. Abnormal Ca2+signaling was found in muscle cells upon nicotine exposure, as verified in hESC-derived cardiomyocytes. Consequently, our scRNA-seq data suggest direct adverse effects of nicotine on hESC differentiation at the single-cell level and offer a new method for evaluating drug and environmental toxicity on human embryonic development in utero.",30827876,PMC6449785,10.1016/j.stemcr.2019.01.022,21,Stem cell reports,101611300,7.294,0.5080406665802002,0.6220735785953178,0.45484949832775917,0.5202090153327356
Single-cell RNA-seq transcriptome analysis of linear and circular RNAs in mouse preimplantation embryos,"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a new class of non-polyadenylated non-coding RNAs that may play important roles in many biological processes. Here we develop a single-cell universal poly(A)-independent RNA sequencing (SUPeR-seq) method to sequence both polyadenylated and non-polyadenylated RNAs from individual cells. This method exhibits robust sensitivity, precision and accuracy. We discover 2891 circRNAs and 913 novel linear transcripts in mouse preimplantation embryos and further analyze the abundance of circRNAs along development, the function of enriched genes, and sequence features of circRNAs. Our work is key to deciphering regulation mechanisms of circRNAs during mammalian early embryonic development.",26201400,PMC4511241,10.1186/s13059-015-0706-1,198,Genome biology,100960660,17.906,0.5056111812591553,0.939799331103679,0.7859531772575251,0.648517210427734
Integrating Single-Cell and Spatial Transcriptomics Reveals Heterogeneity of Early Pig Skin Development and a Subpopulation with Hair Placode Formation,"The dermis and epidermis, crucial structural layers of the skin, encompass appendages, hair follicles (HFs), and intricate cellular heterogeneity. However, an integrated spatiotemporal transcriptomic atlas of embryonic skin has not yet been described and would be invaluable for studying skin-related diseases in humans. Here, single-cell and spatial transcriptomic analyses are performed on skin samples of normal and hairless fetal pigs across four developmental periods. The cross-species comparison of skin cells illustrated that the pig epidermis is more representative of the human epidermis than mice epidermis. Moreover, Phenome-wide association study analysis revealed that the conserved genes between pigs and humans are strongly associated with human skin-related diseases. In the epidermis, two lineage differentiation trajectories describe hair follicle (HF) morphogenesis and epidermal development. By comparing normal and hairless fetal pigs, it is found that the hair placode (Pc), the most characteristic initial structure in HFs, arises from progenitor-like OGN+/UCHL1+cells. These progenitors appear earlier in development than the previously described early Pc cells and exhibit abnormal proliferation and migration during differentiation in hairless pigs. The study provides a valuable resource for in-depth insights into HF development, which may serve as a key reference atlas for studying human skin disease etiology using porcine models.",38561967,PMC11132071,10.1002/advs.202306703,0,"Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)",101664569,17.521,0.5048903226852417,0.05351170568561873,0.7290969899665551,0.4594559327415798
Single-cell profiling of the developing mouse brain and spinal cord with split-pool barcoding,"To facilitate scalable profiling of single cells, we developed split-pool ligation-based transcriptome sequencing (SPLiT-seq), a single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) method that labels the cellular origin of RNA through combinatorial barcoding. SPLiT-seq is compatible with fixed cells or nuclei, allows efficient sample multiplexing, and requires no customized equipment. We used SPLiT-seq to analyze 156,049 single-nucleus transcriptomes from postnatal day 2 and 11 mouse brains and spinal cords. More than 100 cell types were identified, with gene expression patterns corresponding to cellular function, regional specificity, and stage of differentiation. Pseudotime analysis revealed transcriptional programs driving four developmental lineages, providing a snapshot of early postnatal development in the murine central nervous system. SPLiT-seq provides a path toward comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic analysis of other similarly complex multicellular systems.",29545511,PMC7643870,10.1126/science.aam8999,531,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",404511,63.714,0.5021934509277344,0.979933110367893,0.9364548494983278,0.6845936625298847
Live Cell Genomics: Cell-Specific Transcriptome Capture in Live Single Cells from Complex Tissues,"Analysis of single-cell transcriptomes shows the single-cell heterogeneity between cells within a population which is vital to our understanding of normal function and disease development. To obtain single-cell transcriptome profiling, however, the poly-A RNA must be accurately isolated from the target cell. We developed a single-cell analysis procedure called transcriptome in vivo analysis (TIVA), which will allow accurate characterization of targeted cell-specific transcriptomes from live tissue. This is accomplished using a RNA capture molecule called TIVA tag that captures the transcriptome of selected cells in their natural microenvironment. An important aspect of the TIVA approach is that the tag is delivered into the cytoplasm of live cells using cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs). Once the TIVA tag is in the cellular cytoplasm, it binds to mRNA after photoactivation of the compound. Using CPPs in combination with photoactivation is the first noninvasive access method for accurately isolating single-cell mRNA from live single cells in tissues in their natural microenvironment.",34766318,,10.1007/978-1-0716-1752-6_40,0,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,0.0,0.5017242431640625,0.056856187290969896,0.026755852842809364,0.3177569539251933
Deciphering human macrophage development at single-cell resolution,"Macrophages are the first cells of the nascent immune system to emerge during embryonic development. In mice, embryonic macrophages infiltrate developing organs, where they differentiate symbiotically into tissue-resident macrophages (TRMs)1. However, our understanding of the origins and specialization of macrophages in human embryos is limited. Here we isolated CD45+haematopoietic cells from human embryos at Carnegie stages 11 to 23 and subjected them to transcriptomic profiling by single-cell RNA sequencing, followed by functional characterization of a population of CD45+CD34+CD44+yolk sac-derived myeloid-biased progenitors (YSMPs) by single-cell culture. We also mapped macrophage heterogeneity across multiple anatomical sites and identified diverse subsets, including various types of embryonic TRM (in the head, liver, lung and skin). We further traced the specification trajectories of TRMs from either yolk sac-derived primitive macrophages or YSMP-derived embryonic liver monocytes using both transcriptomic and developmental staging information, with a focus on microglia. Finally, we evaluated the molecular similarities between embryonic TRMs and their adult counterparts. Our data represent a comprehensive characterization of the spatiotemporal dynamics of early macrophage development during human embryogenesis, providing a reference for future studies of the development and function of human TRMs.",32499656,,10.1038/s41586-020-2316-7,179,Nature,410462,69.504,0.5016698837280273,0.9331103678929766,0.9899665551839465,0.6856173148522011
Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of oligodendrocyte lineage cells,"Oligodendrocytes (OLs) are glial cells in the central nervous system (CNS), which produce myelin, a lipid-rich membrane that insulates neuronal axons. The main function ascribed to OLs is to regulate the speed of electric pulse transmission, and as such OLs have been widely considered as a single and discrete population. Nevertheless, OLs and their precursor cells (OPCs) throughout the CNS have different morphologies and regional functional differences have been observed. Moreover, OLs have recently been involved in other functional processes such as metabolic coupling with axons. In this review, we focus on recent advances in single-cell transcriptomics suggesting that OLs are more heterogeneous than previously thought, with defined subpopulations and cell states that are associated with different stages of lineage progression and might also represent distinct functional states.",29126015,,10.1016/j.conb.2017.10.005,18,Current opinion in neurobiology,9111376,7.07,0.5010671615600586,0.5986622073578596,0.43812709030100333,0.5079981564678078
Application of single-cell RNA sequencing in embryonic development,"Embryonic development is a complex process that is regulated by a series of precise cellular behaviours. The limited number of cells in the early stages of embryonic development represents a challenge for studying early gene regulation and maintaining cell sternness. Single-cell sequencing is a new technology for high-throughput sequencing analysis at the single-cell level that not only reflects the heterogeneity between cells but also reveals gene expression characteristics in different cells from limited samples. Currently, the widespread application of single-cell RNA sequencing technology is gradually changing our understanding of disease pathogenesis.

Single-cell transcriptomic analyses provide insights into the developmental origins of neuroblastoma,"Neuroblastoma is a pediatric tumor of the developing sympathetic nervous system. However, the cellular origin of neuroblastoma has yet to be defined. Here we studied the single-cell transcriptomes of neuroblastomas and normal human developing adrenal glands at various stages of embryonic and fetal development. We defined normal differentiation trajectories from Schwann cell precursors over intermediate states to neuroblasts or chromaffin cells and showed that neuroblastomas transcriptionally resemble normal fetal adrenal neuroblasts. Importantly, neuroblastomas with varying clinical phenotypes matched different temporal states along normal neuroblast differentiation trajectories, with the degree of differentiation corresponding to clinical prognosis. Our work highlights the roles of oncogenic MYCN and loss of TFAP2B in blocking differentiation and may provide the basis for designing therapeutic interventions to overcome differentiation blocks.",33767450,,10.1038/s41588-021-00806-1,94,Nature genetics,9216904,41.307,0.49854370951652527,0.8762541806020067,0.8963210702341137,0.6536412758771392
"Single-cell transcriptome analysis of CAR T-cell products reveals subpopulations, stimulation, and exhaustion signatures","Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell adoptive therapy is set to transform the treatment of a rapidly expanding range of malignancies. Although the activation process of normal T cells is well characterized, comparatively little is known about the activation of cells via the CAR. Here we have used flow cytometry together with single-cell transcriptome profiling to characterize the starting material (peripheral blood mononuclear cells) and CAR therapeutic products of 3 healthy donors in the presence and absence of antigen-specific stimulation. Analysis of 53,191 single-cell transcriptomes showed APRIL-based CAR products to contain several subpopulations of cells, with cellular composition reproducible from donor to donor, and all major cellular subsets compatible with CAR expression. Only 50% of CAR-expressing cells displayed transcriptional changes upon CAR-specific antigen exposure. The resulting molecular signature for CAR T-cell activation provides a rich resource for future dissection of underlying mechanisms. Targeted data interrogation also revealed that a small proportion of antigen-responding CAR-expressing cells displayed an exhaustion signature, with both known markers and genes not previously associated with T-cell exhaustion. Comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic analysis thus represents a powerful way to guide the assessment and optimization of clinical-grade CAR-T-cells, and inform future research into the underlying molecular processes.",33489472,PMC7801130,10.1080/2162402X.2020.1866287,14,Oncoimmunology,101570526,7.723,0.49721336364746094,0.5484949832775919,0.48494983277591974,0.5050169813991789
Dissecting the Global Dynamic Molecular Profiles of Human Fetal Kidney Development by Single-Cell RNA Sequencing,"Healthy renal function depends on normal nephrogenesis during embryonic development. However, a comprehensive gene expression profile of human fetal kidney development remains largely unexplored. Here, using a single-cell RNA-sequencing technique, we analyzed >3,000 human fetal renal cells spanning 4 months of development in utero. Unsupervised analysis identified two progenitor subtypes during cap mesenchyme development, suggesting a mechanism for sustaining their progenitor states. Furthermore, we identified critical transcriptional regulators and signaling pathways involved in the segmentation of nephron tubules. We explored the development of the highly heterogeneous collecting duct epithelia and dissected the metabolic gene repertoire and the extracellular matrix composition of the glomerular mesangium. The results provide insights on the molecular basis and regulatory events in human renal development. Moreover, the cell-type-specific expression features of causal genes in congenital renal diseases may be helpful in the treatment of these diseases.",30257215,,10.1016/j.celrep.2018.08.056,49,Cell reports,101573691,9.995,0.49580395221710205,0.7525083612040134,0.5719063545150501,0.5623653144740739
Single-cell transcriptomics uncovers cellular architecture and developmental trajectories in hepatoblastoma,"Background and aims:Hepatoblastoma (HB) is the predominant type of childhood liver cancer. Treatment options for the clinically advanced HB remain limited. We aimed to dissect the cellular and molecular basis underlying HB oncogenesis and heterogeneity at the single-cell level, which could facilitate a better understanding of HB at both the biological and clinical levels.Approach and results:Single-cell transcriptome profiling of tumor and paired distal liver tissue samples from five patients with HB was performed. Deconvolution analysis was used for integrating the single-cell transcriptomic profiles with the bulk transcriptomes of our HB cohort of post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy tumor samples. A single-cell transcriptomic landscape of early human liver parenchymal development was established for exploring the cellular root and hierarchy of HB oncogenesis. As a result, seven distinct tumor cell subpopulations were annotated, and an effective HB subtyping method was established based on their compositions. A HB tumor cell hierarchy was further revealed to not only fit with the classical cancer stem cell (CSC) model but also mirror the early human liver parenchymal development. Moreover, FACT inhibition, which could disrupt the oncogenic positive feedback loop between MYC and SSRP1 in HB, was identified as a promising epigenetic-targeted therapeutic strategy against the CSC-like HB1-Pro-like1 subpopulation and its related high-risk ""Pro-like1"" subtype of HB.Conclusions:Our findings illustrate the cellular architecture and developmental trajectories of HB via integrative bulk and single-cell transcriptome analyses, thus establishing a resourceful framework for the development of targeted diagnostics and therapeutics in the future.",36059151,,10.1002/hep.32775,7,"Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)",8302946,17.298,0.4957963228225708,0.43812709030100333,0.7224080267558528,0.5295848171049137

Single-cell sequencing analysis within biologically relevant dimensions,"The currently predominant approach to transcriptomic and epigenomic single-cell analysis depends on a rigid perspective constrained by reduced dimensions and algorithmically derived and annotated clusters. Here, we developed Seqtometry (sequencing-to-measurement), a single-cell analytical strategy based on biologically relevant dimensions enabled by advanced scoring with multiple gene sets (signatures) for examination of gene expression and accessibility across various organ systems. By utilizing information only in the form of specific signatures, Seqtometry bypasses unsupervised clustering and individual annotations of clusters. Instead, Seqtometry combines qualitative and quantitative cell-type identification with specific characterization of diverse biological processes under experimental or disease conditions. Comprehensive analysis by Seqtometry of various immune cells as well as other cells from different organs and disease-induced states, including multiple myeloma and Alzheimer's disease, surpasses corresponding cluster-based analytical output. We propose Seqtometry as a single-cell sequencing analysis approach applicable for both basic and clinical research.",38198894,,10.1016/j.cels.2023.12.005,1,Cell systems,101656080,11.091,0.49227967858314514,0.1939799331103679,0.6086956521739131,0.45590292420674333
scEpath: energy landscape-based inference of transition probabilities and cellular trajectories from single-cell transcriptomic data,"Motivation:Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) offers unprecedented resolution for studying cellular decision-making processes. Robust inference of cell state transition paths and probabilities is an important yet challenging step in the analysis of these data.Results:Here we present scEpath, an algorithm that calculates energy landscapes and probabilistic directed graphs in order to reconstruct developmental trajectories. We quantify the energy landscape using 'single-cell energy' and distance-based measures, and find that the combination of these enables robust inference of the transition probabilities and lineage relationships between cell states. We also identify marker genes and gene expression patterns associated with cell state transitions. Our approach produces pseudotemporal orderings that are-in combination-more robust and accurate than current methods, and offers higher resolution dynamics of the cell state transitions, leading to new insight into key transition events during differentiation and development. Moreover, scEpath is robust to variation in the size of the input gene set, and is broadly unsupervised, requiring few parameters to be set by the user. Applications of scEpath led to the identification of a cell-cell communication network implicated in early human embryo development, and novel transcription factors important for myoblast differentiation. scEpath allows us to identify common and specific temporal dynamics and transcriptional factor programs along branched lineages, as well as the transition probabilities that control cell fates.Availability and implementation:A MATLAB package of scEpath is available at https://github.com/sqjin/scEpath.Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",29415263,PMC6658715,10.1093/bioinformatics/bty058,48,"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",9808944,6.931,0.4853099584579468,0.745819397993311,0.41471571906354515,0.5232929984861394
Emerging Imaging and Genomic Tools for Developmental Systems Biology,"Animal development is a complex and dynamic process orchestrated by exquisitely timed cell lineage commitment, divisions, migration, and morphological changes at the single-cell level. In the past decade, extensive genetic, stem cell, and genomic studies provided crucial insights into molecular underpinnings and the functional importance of genetic pathways governing various cellular differentiation processes. However, it is still largely unknown how the precise coordination of these pathways is achieved at the whole-organism level and how the highly regulated spatiotemporal choreography of development is established in turn. Here, we discuss the latest technological advances in imaging and single-cell genomics that hold great promise for advancing our understanding of this intricate process. We propose an integrated approach that combines such methods to quantitatively decipher in vivo cellular dynamic behaviors and their underlying molecular mechanisms at the systems level with single-cell, single-molecule resolution.",27003934,,10.1016/j.devcel.2016.02.016,15,Developmental cell,101120028,13.417,0.48466208577156067,0.5719063545150501,0.6521739130434783,0.535613304974642
A geometric approach to characterize the functional identity of single cells,"Single-cell transcriptomic data has the potential to radically redefine our view of cell-type identity. Cells that were previously believed to be homogeneous are now clearly distinguishable in terms of their expression phenotype. Methods for automatically characterizing the functional identity of cells, and their associated properties, can be used to uncover processes involved in lineage differentiation as well as sub-typing cancer cells. They can also be used to suggest personalized therapies based on molecular signatures associated with pathology. We develop a new method, called ACTION, to infer the functional identity of cells from their transcriptional profile, classify them based on their dominant function, and reconstruct regulatory networks that are responsible for mediating their identity. Using ACTION, we identify novel Melanoma subtypes with differential survival rates and therapeutic responses, for which we provide biomarkers along with their underlying regulatory networks.",29666373,PMC5904143,10.1038/s41467-018-03933-2,24,Nature communications,101528555,17.694,0.4845934808254242,0.6321070234113713,0.7525083612040134,0.5676791654183314
Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Resolves Spatiotemporal Development of Pre-thymic Lymphoid Progenitors and Thymus Organogenesis in Human Embryos,"Generation of the first T lymphocytes in the human embryo involves the emergence, migration, and thymus seeding of lymphoid progenitors together with concomitant thymus organogenesis, which is the initial step to establish the entire adaptive immune system. However, the cellular and molecular programs regulating this process remain unclear. We constructed a single-cell transcriptional landscape of human early T lymphopoiesis by using cells from multiple hemogenic and hematopoietic sites spanning embryonic and fetal stages. Among heterogenous early thymic progenitors, one subtype shared common features with a subset of lymphoid progenitors in fetal liver that are known as thymus-seeding progenitors. Unbiased bioinformatics analysis identified a distinct type of pre-thymic lymphoid progenitors in the aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region. In parallel, we investigated thymic epithelial cell development and potential cell-cell interactions during thymus organogenesis.

Single-cell and spatial transcriptomics approaches of cardiovascular development and disease,"Recent advancements in the resolution and throughput of single-cell analyses, including single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), have achieved significant progress in biomedical research in the last decade. These techniques have been used to understand cellular heterogeneity by identifying many rare and novel cell types and characterizing subpopulations of cells that make up organs and tissues. Analysis across various datasets can elucidate temporal patterning in gene expression and developmental cues and is also employed to examine the response of cells to acute injury, damage, or disruption. Specifically, scRNA-seq and spatially resolved transcriptomics have been used to describe the identity of novel or rare cell subpopulations and transcriptional variations that are related to normal and pathological conditions in mammalian models and human tissues. These applications have critically contributed to advance basic cardiovascular research in the past decade by identifying novel cell types implicated in development and disease.

Trophoblast (TB) lineage derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) induced by bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) has been applied as a model for studying TB lineage specification in vitro. With the development of single-cell sequencing technology, it became possible to detect the transcriptome of the post-implantation embryo at unprecedented precision. In this study, we reanalyzed single-cell RNA-seq of post-implantation embryos derived from two separate groups and identified different subtypes of trophoblast cells and their marker, respectively. At the same time, we focused on the gene expression patterns of trophoblast-specific transcription factors in different models. Our analysis sheds new light on the transcription regulation mechanism of trophoblast differentiation at the early stage of pregnancy establishment in human.",33543402,,10.1007/s10142-021-00770-3,2,Functional & integrative genomics,100939343,3.674,0.476777583360672,0.26421404682274247,0.20735785953177258,0.3803809312873062
Resolving cellular dynamics using single-cell temporal transcriptomics,"Cellular dynamics, the transition of a cell from one state to another, is central to understanding developmental processes and disease progression. Single-cell transcriptomics has been pushing the frontiers of cellular dynamics studies into a genome-wide and single-cell level. While most single-cell RNA sequencing approaches are disruptive and only provide a snapshot of cell states, the dynamics of a cell could be reconstructed by either exploiting temporal information hiding in the transcriptomics data or integrating additional information. In this review, we describe these approaches, highlighting their underlying principles, key assumptions, and the rationality to interpret the results as models. We also discuss the recently emerging nondisruptive live-cell transcriptomics methods, which are highly complementary to the computational models for their assumption-free nature.",38194753,,10.1016/j.copbio.2023.103060,0,Current opinion in biotechnology,9100492,10.279,0.4767014682292938,0.06020066889632107,0.5919732441471572,0.416455663546272
Characterization of Gene Expression Signatures for the Identification of Cellular Heterogeneity in the Developing Mammary Gland,"The developing mammary gland depends on several transcription-dependent networks to define cellular identities and differentiation trajectories. Recent technological advancements that allow for single-cell profiling of gene expression have provided an initial picture into the epithelial cellular heterogeneity across the diverse stages of gland maturation. Still, a deeper dive into expanded molecular signatures would improve our understanding of the diversity of mammary epithelial and non-epithelial cellular populations across different tissue developmental stages, mouse strains and mammalian species. Here, we combined differential mammary gland fractionation approaches and transcriptional profiles obtained from FACS-isolated mammary cells to improve our definitions of mammary-resident, cellular identities at the single-cell level. Our approach yielded a series of expression signatures that illustrate the heterogeneity of mammary epithelial cells, specifically those of the luminal fate, and uncovered transcriptional changes to their lineage-defined, cellular states that are induced during gland development. Our analysis also provided molecular signatures that identified non-epithelial mammary cells, including adipocytes, fibroblasts and rare immune cells. Lastly, we extended our study to elucidate expression signatures of human, breast-resident cells, a strategy that allowed for the cross-species comparison of mammary epithelial identities. Collectively, our approach improved the existing signatures of normal mammary epithelial cells, as well as elucidated the diversity of non-epithelial cells in murine and human breast tissue. Our study provides a useful resource for future studies that use single-cell molecular profiling strategies to understand normal and malignant breast development.",33988830,PMC8217035,10.1007/s10911-021-09486-3,11,Journal of mammary gland biology and neoplasia,9601804,2.698,0.4765948951244354,0.5217391304347826,0.13377926421404682,0.4170606160044271
Dissecting the transcriptome landscape of the human fetal neural retina and retinal pigment epithelium by single-cell RNA-seq analysis,"The developmental pathway of the neural retina (NR) and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) has been revealed by extensive research in mice. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of the human NR and RPE, as well as the interactions between these two tissues, have not been well defined. Here, we analyzed 2,421 individual cells from human fetal NR and RPE using single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) technique and revealed the tightly regulated spatiotemporal gene expression network of human retinal cells. We identified major cell classes of human fetal retina and potential crucial transcription factors for each cell class. We dissected the dynamic expression patterns of visual cycle- and ligand-receptor interaction-related genes in the RPE and NR. Moreover, we provided a map of disease-related genes for human fetal retinal cells and highlighted the importance of retinal progenitor cells as potential targets of inherited retinal diseases. Our findings captured the key in vivo features of the development of the human NR and RPE and offered insightful clues for further functional studies.",31269016,PMC6634428,10.1371/journal.pbio.3000365,77,PLoS biology,101183755,9.593,0.47332248091697693,0.8461538461538461,0.5652173913043478,0.5662677360418249
Constructing cell lineages from single-cell transcriptomes,"Advances in single-cell RNA-sequencing have helped reveal the previously underappreciated level of cellular heterogeneity present during cellular differentiation. A static snapshot of single-cell transcriptomes provides a good representation of the various stages of differentiation as differentiation is rarely synchronized between cells. Data from numerous single-cell analyses has suggested that cellular differentiation and development can be conceptualized as continuous processes. Consequently, computational algorithms have been developed to infer lineage relationships between cell types and construct developmental trajectories along which cells are re-ordered such that similarity between successive cell pairs is maximized. Here, we compare and contrast the existing computational methods, and illustrate how they may be applied to build mouse myeloid progenitor lineages from massively parallel RNA single-cell sequencing data.",29107741,,10.1016/j.mam.2017.10.004,12,Molecular aspects of medicine,7603128,16.337,0.47285082936286926,0.5384615384615384,0.705685618729097,0.5325399290558487
Single-cell transcriptomics analysis of cellular heterogeneity and immune mechanisms in neurodegenerative diseases,"Single-cell transcriptomics analysis is an advanced technology that can describe the intracellular transcriptome in complex tissues. It profiles and analyses datasets by single-cell RNA sequencing. Neurodegenerative diseases are identified by the abnormal apoptosis of neurons in the brain with few or no effective therapy strategies at present, which has been a growing healthcare concern and brought a great burden to society. The transcriptome of individual cells provides deep insights into previously unforeseen cellular heterogeneity and gene expression differences in neurodegenerative disorders. It detects multiple cell subsets and functional changes during pathological progression, which deepens the understanding of the molecular underpinnings and cellular basis of neurodegenerative diseases. Furthermore, the transcriptome analysis of immune cells shows the regulation of immune response. Different subtypes of immune cells and their interaction are found to contribute to disease progression. This finding enables the discovery of novel targets and biomarkers for early diagnosis. In this review, we emphasize the principles of the technology, and its recent progress in the study of cellular heterogeneity and immune mechanisms in neurodegenerative diseases. The application of single-cell transcriptomics analysis in neurodegenerative disorders would help explore the pathogenesis of these diseases and develop novel therapeutic methods.",38221677,,10.1111/ejn.16242,0,The European journal of neuroscience,8918110,3.698,0.4716338515281677,0.06354515050167224,0.21070234113712374,0.33782980924465983
"Embryo-scale, single-cell spatial transcriptomics","Spatial patterns of gene expression manifest at scales ranging from local (e.g., cell-cell interactions) to global (e.g., body axis patterning). However, current spatial transcriptomics methods either average local contexts or are restricted to limited fields of view. Here, we introduce sci-Space, which retains single-cell resolution while resolving spatial heterogeneity at larger scales. Applying sci-Space to developing mouse embryos, we captured approximate spatial coordinates and whole transcriptomes of about 120,000 nuclei. We identify thousands of genes exhibiting anatomically patterned expression, leverage spatial information to annotate cellular subtypes, show that cell types vary substantially in their extent of spatial patterning, and reveal correlations between pseudotime and the migratory patterns of differentiating neurons. Looking forward, we anticipate that sci-Space will facilitate the construction of spatially resolved single-cell atlases of mammalian development.",34210887,PMC9118175,10.1126/science.abb9536,94,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",404511,63.714,0.47107115387916565,0.8795986622073578,0.939799331103679,0.6465222909897068
Lineage specification and pluripotency revealed by transcriptome analysis from oocyte to blastocyst in pig,"The inner cell mass (ICM) in blastocyst is the origin of all somatic and germ cells in mammals and pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) in vitro. As the conserved principles between pig and human, here we performed comprehensive single-cell RNA-seq for porcine early embryos from oocyte to early blastocyst (EB). We show the specification of the ICM and trophectoderm in morula and the molecular signature of the precursors. We demonstrate the existence of naÃ¯ve pluripotency signature in morula and ICM of EB, and the specific pluripotent genes and the activity of signalling pathways highlight the characteristics of the naÃ¯ve pluripotency. We observe the absence of dosage compensation with respect to X-chromosome (XC) in morula, and incomplete dosage compensation in the EB. However, the dynamics of dosage compensation may be independent of the expression of XIST induced XC inactivation. Our study describes molecular landmarks of embryogenesis in pig that will provide a better strategy for derivation of porcine PSCs and improve research in regenerative medicine.",31914626,,10.1096/fj.201901818RR,25,FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for,8804484,5.834,0.47064536809921265,0.6387959866220736,0.3076923076923077,0.47168487972240386
Single-Cell Transcriptome Analysis Revealed Heterogeneity and Identified Novel Therapeutic Targets for Breast Cancer Subtypes,"Breast cancer (BC) is a heterogeneous disease, which is primarily classified according to hormone receptors and HER2 expression. Despite the many advances in BC diagnosis and management, the identification of novel actionable therapeutic targets expressed by cancerous cells has always been a daunting task due to the large heterogeneity of the disease and the presence of non-cancerous cells (i.e., immune cells and stromal cells) within the tumor microenvironment. In the current study, we employed computational algorithms to decipher the cellular composition of estrogen receptor-positive (ER+), HER2+, ER+HER2+, and triple-negative BC (TNBC) subtypes from a total of 49,899 single cells' publicly available transcriptomic data derived from 26 BC patients. Restricting the analysis to EPCAM+Lin-tumor epithelial cells, we identified the enriched gene sets in each BC molecular subtype. Integration of single-cell transcriptomic with CRISPR-Cas9 functional screen data identified 13 potential therapeutic targets for ER+, 44 potential therapeutic targets for HER2+, and 29 potential therapeutic targets for TNBC. Interestingly, several of the identified therapeutic targets outperformed the current standard of care for each BC subtype. Given the aggressive nature and lack of targeted therapies for TNBC, elevated expression of ENO1, FDPS, CCT6A, TUBB2A, and PGK1 predicted worse relapse-free survival (RFS) in basal BC (n= 442), while elevated expression of ENO1, FDPS, CCT6A, and PGK1 was observed in the most aggressive BLIS TNBC subtype. Mechanistically, targeted depletion of ENO1 and FDPS halted TNBC cell proliferation, colony formation, and organoid tumor growth under 3-dimensional conditions and increased cell death, suggesting their potential use as novel therapeutic targets for TNBC. Differential expression and gene set enrichment analysis in TNBC revealed enrichment in the cycle and mitosis functional categories in FDPShigh, while ENO1highwas associated with numerous functional categories, including cell cycle, glycolysis, and ATP metabolic processes. Taken together, our data are the first to unravel the unique gene signatures and to identify novel dependencies and therapeutic vulnerabilities for each BC molecular subtype, thus setting the foundation for the future development of more effective targeted therapies for BC.",37190091,PMC10137100,10.3390/cells12081182,3,Cells,101600052,7.666,0.4692161977291107,0.32441471571906355,0.4816053511705686,0.4427337320153929
Cell type identification from single-cell transcriptomes in melanoma,"Background:Single-cell sequencing approaches allow gene expression to be measured at the single-cell level, providing opportunities and challenges to study the aetiology of complex diseases, including cancer.Methods:Based on single-cell gene and lncRNA expression levels, we proposed a computational framework for cell type identification that fully considers cell dropout characteristics. First, we defined the dropout features of the cells and identified the dropout clusters. Second, we constructed a differential co-expression network and identified differential modules. Finally, we identified cell types based on the differential modules.Results:The method was applied to single-cell melanoma data, and eight cell types were identified. Enrichment analysis of the candidate cell marker genes for the two key cell types showed that both key cell types were closely related to the physiological activities of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC); one key cell type was associated with mitosis-related activities, and the other with pathways related to ten diseases.Conclusions:Through identification and analysis of key melanoma-related cell types, we explored the molecular mechanism of melanoma, providing insight into melanoma research. Moreover, the candidate cell markers for the two key cell types are potential therapeutic targets for melanoma.",34784909,PMC8596920,10.1186/s12920-021-01118-3,0,BMC medical genomics,101319628,3.622,0.4676356315612793,0.06688963210702341,0.19732441471571907,0.3334241883013161
The transcriptome dynamics of single cells during the cell cycle,"The cell cycle is among the most basic phenomena in biology. Despite advances in single-cell analysis, dynamics and topology of the cell cycle in high-dimensional gene expression space remain largely unknown. We developed a linear analysis of transcriptome data which reveals that cells move along a planar circular trajectory in transcriptome space during the cycle. Non-cycling gene expression adds a third dimension causing helical motion on a cylinder. We find in immortalized cell lines that cell cycle transcriptome dynamics occur largely independently from other cellular processes. We offer a simple method (""Revelio"") to order unsynchronized cells in time. Precise removal of cell cycle effects from the data becomes a straightforward operation. The shape of the trajectory implies that each gene is upregulated only once during the cycle, and only two dynamic components represented by groups of genes drive transcriptome dynamics. It indicates that the cell cycle has evolved to minimize changes of transcriptional activity and the related regulatory effort. This design principle of the cell cycle may be of relevance to many other cellular differentiation processes.",33205894,PMC7672610,10.15252/msb.20209946,18,Molecular systems biology,101235389,13.068,0.46174484491348267,0.6020066889632107,0.6387959866220736,0.5252074420651465
Spatiotemporal transcriptomic atlas of mouse organogenesis using DNA nanoball-patterned arrays,"Spatially resolved transcriptomic technologies are promising tools to study complex biological processes such as mammalian embryogenesis. However, the imbalance between resolution, gene capture, and field of view of current methodologies precludes their systematic application to analyze relatively large and three-dimensional mid- and late-gestation embryos. Here, we combined DNA nanoball (DNB)-patterned arrays and in situ RNA capture to create spatial enhanced resolution omics-sequencing (Stereo-seq). We applied Stereo-seq to generate the mouse organogenesis spatiotemporal transcriptomic atlas (MOSTA), which maps with single-cell resolution and high sensitivity the kinetics and directionality of transcriptional variation during mouse organogenesis. We used this information to gain insight into the molecular basis of spatial cell heterogeneity and cell fate specification in developing tissues such as the dorsal midbrain. Our panoramic atlas will facilitate in-depth investigation of longstanding questions concerning normal and abnormal mammalian development.",35512705,,10.1016/j.cell.2022.04.003,277,Cell,413066,66.85,0.46153250336647034,0.9632107023411371,0.9498327759197325,0.6595281976720562
cellHarmony: cell-level matching and holistic comparison of single-cell transcriptomes,"To understand the molecular pathogenesis of human disease, precision analyses to define alterations within and between disease-associated cell populations are desperately needed. Single-cell genomics represents an ideal platform to enable the identification and comparison of normal and diseased transcriptional cell populations. We created cellHarmony, an integrated solution for the unsupervised analysis, classification, and comparison of cell types from diverse single-cell RNA-Seq datasets. cellHarmony efficiently and accurately matches single-cell transcriptomes using a community-clustering and alignment strategy to compute differences in cell-type specific gene expression over potentially dozens of cell populations. Such transcriptional differences are used to automatically identify distinct and shared gene programs among cell-types and identify impacted pathways and transcriptional regulatory networks to understand the impact of perturbations at a systems level. cellHarmony is implemented as a python package and as an integrated workflow within the software AltAnalyze. We demonstrate that cellHarmony has improved or equivalent performance to alternative label projection methods, is able to identify the likely cellular origins of malignant states, stratify patients into clinical disease subtypes from identified gene programs, resolve discrete disease networks impacting specific cell-types, and illuminate therapeutic mechanisms. Thus, this approach holds tremendous promise in revealing the molecular and cellular origins of complex disease.",31529053,PMC6868361,10.1093/nar/gkz789,40,Nucleic acids research,411011,19.16,0.4611078202724457,0.7190635451505016,0.8127090301003345,0.5830192072136346
Single-cell RNA-seq reveals distinct dynamic behavior of sex chromosomes during early human embryogenesis,"Several animal and human studies have demonstrated that sex affects kinetics and metabolism during early embryo development. However, the mechanism governing these differences at the molecular level before the expression of the sex-determining gene SRY is unknown. We performed a systematic profiling of gene expression comparing male and female embryos using available single-cell RNA-sequencing data of 1607 individual cells from 99 human preimplantation embryos, covering development stages from 4-cell to late blastocyst. We observed consistent chromosome-wide transcription of autosomes, whereas expression from sex chromosomes exhibits significant differences after embryonic genome activation (EGA). Activation of the Y chromosome is initiated by expression of two genes, RPS4Y1 and DDX3Y, whereas the X chromosome is widely activated, with both copies in females being activated after EGA. In contrast to the stable activation of the Y chromosome, expression of X-linked genes in females declines at the late blastocyst stage, especially in trophectoderm cells, revealing a rapid process of dosage compensation. This dynamic behavior results in a dosage imbalance between male and female embryos, which influences genes involved in cell cycle, protein translation and metabolism. Our results reveal the dynamics of sex chromosomes expression and silencing during early embryogenesis. Studying sex differences during human embryogenesis, as well as understanding the process of X chromosome inactivation and their effects on the sex bias development of in vitro fertilized embryos, will expand the capabilities of assisted reproductive technology and possibly improve the treatment of infertility and enhance reproductive health.",31094050,,10.1002/mrd.23162,14,Molecular reproduction and development,8903333,2.812,0.45989468693733215,0.5518394648829431,0.14381270903010032,0.41506724694500796
Phylogenetic Comparative Analysis of Single-Cell Transcriptomes Reveals Constrained Accumulation of Gene Expression Heterogeneity during Clonal Expansion,"In the same way that a phylogeny summarizes the evolutionary history of species, a cell lineage tree describes the process of clonal expansion, in which gene expression differences between cells naturally accrue as a result of stochastic partitioning and imperfect expression control. How is functional homeostasis, a key factor in the biological function of any population of cells, maintained in the face of such continuous accumulation of transcriptomic heterogeneity remains largely unresolved. To answer this question, we experimentally determined the single-cell transcriptomes and lineage relationships of up to 50% cells in single-HEK293-seeded colonies. Phylogenetic comparative analyses of the single-cell transcriptomes on the cell lineage tree revealed three lines of evidence for the constrained accumulation of transcriptome heterogeneity among cells, including rapid saturation of transcriptomic heterogeneity upon four cell divisions, reduced expression differences within subtrees closer to expression boundaries, and cofluctuations among genes. Our analyses showcased the applicability of phylogenetic comparative methods in cell lineage trees, demonstrated the constrained accumulation of transcriptomic heterogeneity, and provided novel insight into the functional homeostasis of cell populations.",37183780,PMC10210624,10.1093/molbev/msad113,1,Molecular biology and evolution,8501455,8.8,0.4598037302494049,0.19732441471571907,0.5284280936454849,0.4210327398218838
Analysis of Single-Cell Transcriptome Data in Drosophila,"The fly Drosophila is a versatile model organism that has led to fascinating biological discoveries. In the past few years, Drosophila researchers have used single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to gain insights into the cellular composition, and developmental processes of various tissues and organs. Given the success of single-cell technologies a variety of computational tools and software packages were developed to enable and facilitate the analysis of scRNA-seq data.

Single-cell transcriptomics sheds light on the identity and metabolism of developing leaf cells,"As the main photosynthetic instruments of vascular plants, leaves are crucial and complex plant organs. A strict organization of leaf mesophyll and epidermal cell layers orchestrates photosynthesis and gas exchange. In addition, water and nutrients for leaf growth are transported through the vascular tissue. To establish the single-cell transcriptomic landscape of these different leaf tissues, we performed high-throughput transcriptome sequencing of individual cells isolated from young leaves of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) seedlings grown in two different environmental conditions. The detection of approximately 19,000 different transcripts in over 1,800 high-quality leaf cells revealed 14 cell populations composing the young, differentiating leaf. Besides the cell populations comprising the core leaf tissues, we identified subpopulations with a distinct identity or metabolic activity. In addition, we proposed cell-type-specific markers for each of these populations. Finally, an intuitive web tool allows for browsing the presented dataset.

Identification of Cell Types from Single-Cell Transcriptomic Data,"Unprecedented technological advances in single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology have now made it possible to profile genome-wide expression in single cells at low cost and high throughput. There is substantial ongoing effort to use scRNA-seq measurements to identify the ""cell types"" that form components of a complex tissue, akin to taxonomizing species in ecology. Cell type classification from scRNA-seq data involves the application of computational tools rooted in dimensionality reduction and clustering, and statistical analysis to identify molecular signatures that are unique to each type. As datasets continue to grow in size and complexity, computational challenges abound, requiring analytical methods to be scalable, flexible, and robust.

Single-cell network biology for resolving cellular heterogeneity in human diseases,"Understanding cellular heterogeneity is the holy grail of biology and medicine. Cells harboring identical genomes show a wide variety of behaviors in multicellular organisms. Genetic circuits underlying cell-type identities will facilitate the understanding of the regulatory programs for differentiation and maintenance of distinct cellular states. Such a cell-type-specific gene network can be inferred from coregulatory patterns across individual cells. Conventional methods of transcriptome profiling using tissue samples provide only average signals of diverse cell types. Therefore, reconstructing gene regulatory networks for a particular cell type is not feasible with tissue-based transcriptome data. Recently, single-cell omics technology has emerged and enabled the capture of the transcriptomic landscape of every individual cell. Although single-cell gene expression studies have already opened up new avenues, network biology using single-cell transcriptome data will further accelerate our understanding of cellular heterogeneity. In this review, we provide an overview of single-cell network biology and summarize recent progress in method development for network inference from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. Then, we describe how cell-type-specific gene networks can be utilized to study regulatory programs specific to disease-associated cell types and cellular states.

Spatial patterns of gene expression are unveiled in the chick primitive streak by ordering single-cell transcriptomes,"During vertebrate development, progenitor cells give rise to tissues and organs through a complex choreography that commences at gastrulation. A hallmark event of gastrulation is the formation of the primitive streak, a linear assembly of cells along the anterior-posterior (AP) axis of the developing organism. To examine the primitive streak at a single-cell resolution, we measured the transcriptomes of individual chick cells from the streak or the surrounding tissue (the rest of the area pellucida) in Hamburger-Hamilton stage 4 embryos. The single-cell transcriptomes were then ordered by the statistical method Wave-Crest to deduce both the relative position along the AP axis and the prospective lineage of single cells. The ordered transcriptomes reveal intricate patterns of gene expression along the primitive streak.",29678445,,10.1016/j.ydbio.2018.04.007,4,Developmental biology,372762,3.148,0.4449867904186249,0.38127090301003347,0.16387959866220736,0.37602217458562304
Entropy sorting of single-cell RNA sequencing data reveals the inner cell mass in the human pre-implantation embryo,"A major challenge in single-cell gene expression analysis is to discern meaningful cellular heterogeneity from technical or biological noise. To address this challenge, we present entropy sorting (ES), a mathematical framework that distinguishes genes indicative of cell identity. ES achieves this in an unsupervised manner by quantifying if observed correlations between features are more likely to have occurred due to random chance versus a dependent relationship, without the need for any user-defined significance threshold. On synthetic data, we demonstrate the removal of noisy signals to reveal a higher resolution of gene expression patterns than commonly used feature selection methods. We then apply ES to human pre-implantation embryo single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. Previous studies failed to unambiguously identify early inner cell mass (ICM), suggesting that the human embryo may diverge from the mouse paradigm. In contrast, ES resolves the ICM and reveals sequential lineage bifurcations as in the classical model. ES thus provides a powerful approach for maximizing information extraction from high-dimensional datasets such as scRNA-seq data.",36240776,PMC9859930,10.1016/j.stemcr.2022.09.007,5,Stem cell reports,101611300,7.294,0.4445949196815491,0.40468227424749165,0.45819397993311034,0.4393322026450498
Deep sequencing reveals cell-type-specific patterns of single-cell transcriptome variation,"Background:Differentiation of metazoan cells requires execution of different gene expression programs but recent single-cell transcriptome profiling has revealed considerable variation within cells of seeming identical phenotype. This brings into question the relationship between transcriptome states and cell phenotypes. Additionally, single-cell transcriptomics presents unique analysis challenges that need to be addressed to answer this question.Results:We present high quality deep read-depth single-cell RNA sequencing for 91 cells from five mouse tissues and 18 cells from two rat tissues, along with 30 control samples of bulk RNA diluted to single-cell levels. We find that transcriptomes differ globally across tissues with regard to the number of genes expressed, the average expression patterns, and within-cell-type variation patterns. We develop methods to filter genes for reliable quantification and to calibrate biological variation. All cell types include genes with high variability in expression, in a tissue-specific manner. We also find evidence that single-cell variability of neuronal genes in mice is correlated with that in rats consistent with the hypothesis that levels of variation may be conserved.Conclusions:Single-cell RNA-sequencing data provide a unique view of transcriptome function; however, careful analysis is required in order to use single-cell RNA-sequencing measurements for this purpose. Technical variation must be considered in single-cell RNA-sequencing studies of expression variation. For a subset of genes, biological variability within each cell type appears to be regulated in order to perform dynamic functions, rather than solely molecular noise.",26056000,PMC4480509,10.1186/s13059-015-0683-4,49,Genome biology,100960660,17.906,0.4426063895225525,0.7558528428093646,0.7926421404682275,0.5752628303690499
Single-cell transcriptomics of a dynamic cell behavior in murine airways,"Despite advances in high-dimensional cellular analysis, the molecular profiling of dynamic behaviors of cells in their native environment remains a major challenge. We present a method that allows us to couple the physiological behaviors of cells in an intact murine tissue to deep molecular profiling of individual cells. This method enabled us to establish a novel molecular signature for a striking migratory cellular behavior following injury in murine airways.",37083555,PMC10174686,10.7554/eLife.76645,2,eLife,101579614,8.713,0.4413418769836426,0.26755852842809363,0.5150501672240803,0.4213268653206203
Multi-layered Spatial Transcriptomics Identify Secretory Factors Promoting Human Hematopoietic Stem Cell Development,"Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) first emerge in the embryonic aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region. Studies of model organisms defined intersecting signaling pathways that converge to promote HSC emergence predominantly in the ventral domain of the dorsal aorta. Much less is known about mechanisms driving HSC development in humans. Here, to identify secreted signals underlying human HSC development, we combined spatial transcriptomics analysis of dorsoventral polarized signaling in the aorta with gene expression profiling of sorted cell populations and single cells. Our analysis revealed a subset of aortic endothelial cells with a downregulated arterial signature and a predicted lineage relationship with the emerging HSC/progenitor population. Analysis of the ventrally polarized molecular landscape identified endothelin 1 as an important secreted regulator of human HSC development. The obtained gene expression datasets will inform future studies on mechanisms of HSC development in vivo and on generation of clinically relevant HSCs in vitro.",32946788,PMC7671940,10.1016/j.stem.2020.08.004,36,Cell stem cell,101311472,25.269,0.44089049100875854,0.6923076923076923,0.8695652173913043,0.5769088765450545
Spatiotemporal mapping of gene expression landscapes and developmental trajectories during zebrafish embryogenesis,"A major challenge in understanding vertebrate embryogenesis is the lack of topographical transcriptomic information that can help correlate microenvironmental cues within the hierarchy of cell-fate decisions. Here, we employed Stereo-seq to profile 91 zebrafish embryo sections covering six critical time points during the first 24 h of development, obtaining a total of 152,977 spots at a resolution of 10 Ã 10 Ã 15 Î¼m3(close to cellular size) with spatial coordinates. Meanwhile, we identified spatial modules and co-varying genes for specific tissue organizations. By performing the integrated analysis of the Stereo-seq and scRNA-seq data from each time point, we reconstructed the spatially resolved developmental trajectories of cell-fate transitions and molecular changes during zebrafish embryogenesis. We further investigated the spatial distribution of ligand-receptor pairs and identified potentially important interactions during zebrafish embryo development. Our study constitutes a fundamental reference for further studies aiming to understand vertebrate development.",35512701,,10.1016/j.devcel.2022.04.009,34,Developmental cell,101120028,13.417,0.440288782119751,0.6789297658862876,0.6555183946488294,0.5310629013788739
Complete Transcriptome Analysis by 5'-End Single-Cell RNA-Seq with Random Priming,"Single-cell transcriptome analysis reveals heterogeneous cell types in complex tissues and leads to unexpected biological findings when compared to bulk populations. However most of the methods focus on the 3'-end of polyadenylated transcripts using droplet-based technology. To achieve complete transcriptome, we describe single-cell 5'-end transcriptome protocol with random primed-cDNA harvesting on the Fluidigm C1â¢ platform which can isolate and process up to 96 cells from a single run with custom library preparation. The method enables detection of Transcription Start Site (TSS) at the single-cell resolution yielding a more comprehensive overview of gene regulatory elements governing in the EpiSC-like cell (EpiLC) including non-polyadenylated RNA and enhancer RNA activities.",35486244,,10.1007/978-1-0716-2281-0_11,0,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,0.0,0.4384846091270447,0.07357859531772576,0.04013377926421405,0.28583324039261476

Live-seq enables temporal transcriptomic recording of single cells,"Single-cell transcriptomics (scRNA-seq) has greatly advanced our ability to characterize cellular heterogeneity1. However, scRNA-seq requires lysing cells, which impedes further molecular or functional analyses on the same cells. Here, we established Live-seq, a single-cell transcriptome profiling approach that preserves cell viability during RNA extraction using fluidic force microscopy2,3, thus allowing to couple a cell's ground-state transcriptome to its downstream molecular or phenotypic behaviour. To benchmark Live-seq, we used cell growth, functional responses and whole-cell transcriptome read-outs to demonstrate that Live-seq can accurately stratify diverse cell types and states without inducing major cellular perturbations. As a proof of concept, we show that Live-seq can be used to directly map a cell's trajectory by sequentially profiling the transcriptomes of individual macrophages before and after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation, and of adipose stromal cells pre- and post-differentiation. In addition, we demonstrate that Live-seq can function as a transcriptomic recorder by preregistering the transcriptomes of individual macrophages that were subsequently monitored by time-lapse imaging after LPS exposure. This enabled the unsupervised, genome-wide ranking of genes on the basis of their ability to affect macrophage LPS response heterogeneity, revealing basal Nfkbia expression level and cell cycle state as important phenotypic determinants, which we experimentally validated. Thus, Live-seq can address a broad range of biological questions by transforming scRNA-seq from an end-point to a temporal analysis approach.",35978187,PMC9402441,10.1038/s41586-022-05046-9,57,Nature,410462,69.504,0.43620169162750244,0.7792642140468228,0.9933110367892977,0.6162360651437255
Differential Network Analysis Reveals Regulatory Patterns in Neural Stem Cell Fate Decision,"Deciphering regulatory patterns of neural stem cell (NSC) differentiation with multiple stages is essential to understand NSC differentiation mechanisms. Recent single-cell transcriptome datasets became available at individual differentiation. However, a systematic and integrative analysis of multiple datasets at multiple temporal stages of NSC differentiation is lacking. In this study, we propose a new method integrating prior information to construct three gene regulatory networks at pair-wise stages of transcriptome and apply this method to investigate five NSC differentiation paths on four different single-cell transcriptome datasets. By constructing gene regulatory networks for each path, we delineate their regulatory patterns via differential topology and network diffusion analyses. We find 12 common differentially expressed genes among the five NSC differentiation paths, with one common regulatory pattern (Gsk3b_App_Cdk5) shared by all paths. The identified regulatory pattern, partly supported by previous experimental evidence, is essential to all differentiation paths, but it plays a different role in each path when regulating other genes. Together, our integrative analysis provides both common and specific regulatory mechanisms for each of the five NSC differentiation paths.",33439459,,10.1007/s12539-020-00415-2,1,"Interdisciplinary sciences, computational life sciences",101515919,3.492,0.4359615445137024,0.20066889632107024,0.19063545150501673,0.33983779627343885
Comprehensive Integration of Multiple Single-Cell Transcriptomic Data Sets Defines Distinct Cell Populations and Their Phenotypic Changes in Murine Atherosclerosis,"Background:The application of single-cell transcriptomic (single-cell RNA sequencing) analysis to the study of atherosclerosis has provided unique insights into the molecular and genetic mechanisms that mediate disease risk and pathophysiology. However, nonstandardized methodologies and relatively high costs associated with the technique have limited the size and replication of existing data sets and created disparate or contradictory findings that have fostered misunderstanding and controversy.Methods:To address these uncertainties, we have performed a conservative integration of multiple published single-cell RNA sequencing data sets into a single meta-analysis, performed extended analysis of native resident vascular cells, and used in situ hybridization to map the disease anatomic location of the identified cluster cells. To investigate the transdifferentiation of smooth muscle cells to macrophage phenotype, we have developed a classifying algorithm based on the quantification of reporter transgene expression.Results:The reporter gene expression tool indicates that within the experimental limits of the examined studies, transdifferentiation of smooth muscle cell to the macrophage lineage is extremely rare. Validated transition smooth muscle cell phenotypes were defined by clustering, and the location of these cells was mapped to lesion anatomy with in situ hybridization. We have also characterized 5 endothelial cell phenotypes and linked these cellular species to different vascular structures and functions. Finally, we have identified a transcriptomically unique cellular phenotype that constitutes the aortic valve.Conclusions:Taken together, these analyses resolve a number of outstanding issues related to differing results reported with vascular disease single-cell RNA sequencing studies, and significantly extend our understanding of the role of resident vascular cells in anatomy and disease.",38152886,,10.1161/ATVBAHA.123.320030,0,"Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology",9505803,10.514,0.43584150075912476,0.07692307692307693,0.5953177257525084,0.3959530609905919
Microfluidic single-cell transcriptomics: moving towards multimodal and spatiotemporal omics,"Cells are the basic units of life with vast heterogeneity. Single-cell transcriptomics unveils cell-to-cell gene expression variabilities, discovers novel cell types, and uncovers the critical roles of cellular heterogeneity in biological processes. The recent advances in microfluidic technologies have greatly accelerated the development of single-cell transcriptomics with regard to throughput, sensitivity, cost, and automation. In this article, we review state-of-the-art microfluidic single-cell transcriptomics, with a focus on the methodologies. We first summarize six typical microfluidic platforms for isolation and transcriptomic analysis of single cells. Then the on-going trend of microfluidic transcriptomics towards multimodal omics, which integrates transcriptomics with other omics to provide more comprehensive pictures of gene expression networks, is discussed. We also highlight single-cell spatial transcriptomics and single-cell temporal transcriptomics that provide unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution to reveal transcriptomic dynamics in space and time, respectively. The emerging applications of microfluidic single-cell transcriptomics are also discussed. Finally, we discuss the current challenges to be tackled and provide perspectives on the future development of microfluidic single-cell transcriptomics.",34541590,,10.1039/d1lc00607j,9,Lab on a chip,101128948,7.517,0.43548136949539185,0.49498327759197325,0.4682274247491639,0.4539309621654626
Early lineage segregation of multipotent embryonic mammary gland progenitors,"The mammary gland is composed of basal cells and luminal cells. It is generally believed that the mammary gland arises from embryonic multipotent progenitors, but it remains unclear when lineage restriction occurs and what mechanisms are responsible for the switch from multipotency to unipotency during its morphogenesis. Here, we perform multicolour lineage tracing and assess the fate of single progenitors, and demonstrate the existence of a developmental switch from multipotency to unipotency during embryonic mammary gland development. Molecular profiling and single cell RNA-seq revealed that embryonic multipotent progenitors express a unique hybrid basal and luminal signature and the factors associated with the different lineages. Sustained p63 expression in embryonic multipotent progenitors promotes unipotent basal cell fate and was sufficient to reprogram adult luminal cells into basal cells by promoting an intermediate hybrid multipotent-like state. Altogether, this study identifies the timing and the mechanisms mediating early lineage segregation of multipotent progenitors during mammary gland development.",29784918,PMC5985933,10.1038/s41556-018-0095-2,76,Nature cell biology,100890575,28.213,0.43362167477607727,0.842809364548495,0.882943143812709,0.6053235065378871
"Single-cell transcriptomics in the Drosophila visual system: Advances and perspectives on cell identity regulation, connectivity, and neuronal diversity evolution","The Drosophila visual system supports complex behaviors and shares many of its anatomical and molecular features with the vertebrate brain. Yet, it contains a much more manageable number of neurons and neuronal types. In addition to the extensive Drosophila genetic toolbox, this relative simplicity has allowed decades of work to yield a detailed account of its neuronal type diversity, morphology, connectivity and specification mechanisms. In the past three years, numerous studies have applied large scale single-cell transcriptomic approaches to the Drosophila visual system and have provided access to the complete gene expression profile of most neuronal types throughout development. This makes the fly visual system particularly well suited to perform detailed studies of the genetic mechanisms underlying the evolution and development of neuronal systems. Here, we highlight how these transcriptomic resources allow exploring long-standing biological questions under a new light. We first present the efforts made to characterize neuronal diversity in the Drosophila visual system and suggest ways to further improve this description. We then discuss current advances allowed by the single-cell datasets, and envisage how these datasets can be further leveraged to address fundamental questions regarding the regulation of neuronal identity, neuronal circuit development and the evolution of neuronal diversity.",34375653,,10.1016/j.ydbio.2021.08.001,8,Developmental biology,372762,3.148,0.4324229061603546,0.46488294314381273,0.16722408026755853,0.38587514837848697
Decoding the universal human chromatin landscape through teratoma-based profiling,"Teratoma formation is key for evaluating differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells into embryonic germ layers and serves as a model for understanding stem cell differentiation and developmental processes. Its potential for insights into epigenome and transcriptome profiling is significant. This study integrates the analysis of the epigenome and transcriptome of hESC-generated teratomas, comparing transcriptomes between hESCs and teratomas. It employs cell type-specific expression patterns from single-cell data to deconvolve RNA-Seq data and identify cell types within teratomas. Our results provide a catalog of activating and repressive histone modifications, while also elucidating distinctive features of chromatin states. Construction of an epigenetic signature matrix enabled the quantification of diverse cell populations in teratomas and enhanced the ability to unravel the epigenetic landscape in heterogeneous tissue contexts. This study also includes a single cell multiome atlas of expression (scRNA-Seq) and chromatin accessibility (scATAC-Seq) of human teratomas, further revealing the complexity of these tissues.

eSPRESSO: topological clustering of single-cell transcriptomics data to reveal informative genes for spatio-temporal architectures of cells,"Background:Bioinformatics capability to analyze spatio-temporal dynamics of gene expression is essential in understanding animal development. Animal cells are spatially organized as functional tissues where cellular gene expression data contain information that governs morphogenesis during the developmental process. Although several computational tissue reconstruction methods using transcriptomics data have been proposed, those methods have been ineffective in arranging cells in their correct positions in tissues or organs unless spatial information is explicitly provided.Results:This study demonstrates stochastic self-organizing map clustering with Markov chain Monte Carlo calculations for optimizing informative genes effectively reconstruct any spatio-temporal topology of cells from their transcriptome profiles with only a coarse topological guideline. The method, eSPRESSO (enhanced SPatial REconstruction by Stochastic Self-Organizing Map), provides a powerful in silico spatio-temporal tissue reconstruction capability, as confirmed by using human embryonic heart and mouse embryo, brain, embryonic heart, and liver lobule with generally high reproducibility (average max. accuracy = 92.0%), while revealing topologically informative genes, or spatial discriminator genes. Furthermore, eSPRESSO was used for temporal analysis of human pancreatic organoids to infer rational developmental trajectories with several candidate 'temporal' discriminator genes responsible for various cell type differentiations.Conclusions:eSPRESSO provides a novel strategy for analyzing mechanisms underlying the spatio-temporal formation of cellular organizations.",37322439,PMC10268514,10.1186/s12859-023-05355-4,0,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,3.307,0.4311051070690155,0.08361204013377926,0.17391304347826086,0.3101680809638173
Single-cell and spatial transcriptomics: Bridging current technologies with long-read sequencing,"Single-cell technologies have transformed biomedical research over the last decade, opening up new possibilities for understanding cellular heterogeneity, both at the genomic and transcriptomic level. In addition, more recent developments of spatial transcriptomics technologies have made it possible to profile cells in their tissue context. In parallel, there have been substantial advances in sequencing technologies, and the third generation of methods are able to produce reads that are tens of kilobases long, with error rates matching the second generation short reads. Long reads technologies make it possible to better map large genome rearrangements and quantify isoform specific abundances. This further improves our ability to characterize functionally relevant heterogeneity. Here, we show how researchers have begun to combine single-cell, spatial transcriptomics, and long-read technologies, and how this is resulting in powerful new approaches to profiling both the genome and the transcriptome. We discuss the achievements so far, and we highlight remaining challenges and opportunities.",38368637,,10.1016/j.mam.2024.101255,1,Molecular aspects of medicine,7603128,16.337,0.43104520440101624,0.2040133779264214,0.7090301003344481,0.4412358182927837
HUSCH: an integrated single-cell transcriptome atlas for human tissue gene expression visualization and analyses,"Understanding gene expression patterns across different human cell types is crucial for investigating mechanisms of cell type differentiation, disease occurrence and progression. The recent development of single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) technologies significantly boosted the characterization of cell type heterogeneities in different human tissues. However, the huge number of datasets in the public domain also posed challenges in data integration and reuse. We present Human Universal Single Cell Hub (HUSCH, http://husch.comp-genomics.org), an atlas-scale curated database that integrates single-cell transcriptomic profiles of nearly 3 million cells from 185 high-quality human scRNA-seq datasets from 45 different tissues. All the data in HUSCH were uniformly processed and annotated with a standard workflow. In the single dataset module, HUSCH provides interactive gene expression visualization, differentially expressed genes, functional analyses, transcription regulators and cell-cell interaction analyses for each cell type cluster. Besides, HUSCH integrated different datasets in the single tissue module and performs data integration, batch correction, and cell type harmonization. This allows a comprehensive visualization and analysis of gene expression within each tissue based on single-cell datasets from multiple sources and platforms.

Significant Evolutionary Constraints on Neuron Cells Revealed by Single-Cell Transcriptomics,"Recent advances in single-cell RNA-sequencing technology have enabled us to characterize a variety of different cell types in each brain region. However, the evolutionary differences among these cell types remain unclear. Here, we analyzed single-cell RNA-seq data of >280,000 cells and developmental transcriptomes of bulk brain tissues. At the single-cell level, we found that the evolutionary constraints on the cell types of different organs significantly overlap with each other and the transcriptome of neuron cells is one of the most restricted evolutionarily. In addition, mature neurons are under more constraints than neuron stem cells as well as nascent neurons and the order of the constraints of various cell types of the brain is largely conserved in different subregions. We also found that although functionally similar brain regions have comparable evolutionary constraints, the early fetal brain is the least constrained and this pattern is conserved in the mouse, macaque, and humans. These results demonstrate the importance of maintaining the plasticity of early brain development during evolution. The delineation of evolutionary differences between brain cell types has great potential for an improved understanding of the pathogenesis of neurological diseases and drug development efforts aimed at the manipulation of molecular activities at the single-cell level.",32176293,PMC7186789,10.1093/gbe/evaa054,7,Genome biology and evolution,101509707,4.065,0.4304465651512146,0.4414715719063545,0.22073578595317725,0.3907094106626351
Data Analysis in Single-Cell Transcriptome Sequencing,"Single-cell transcriptome sequencing, often referred to as single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), is used to measure gene expression at the single-cell level and provides a higher resolution of cellular differences than bulk RNA-seq. With more detailed and accurate information, scRNA-seq will greatly promote the understanding of cell functions, disease progression, and treatment response. Although the scRNA-seq experimental protocols have been improved very quickly, many challenges in the scRNA-seq data analysis still need to be overcome. In this chapter, we focus on the introduction and discussion of the research status in the field of scRNA-seq data normalization and cluster analysis, which are the two most important challenges in the scRNA-seq data analysis.

CellSTAR: a comprehensive resource for single-cell transcriptomic annotation,"Large-scale studies of single-cell sequencing and biological experiments have successfully revealed expression patterns that distinguish different cell types in tissues, emphasizing the importance of studying cellular heterogeneity and accurately annotating cell types. Analysis of gene expression profiles in these experiments provides two essential types of data for cell type annotation: annotated references and canonical markers. In this study, the first comprehensive database of single-cell transcriptomic annotation resource (CellSTAR) was thus developed.

Molecular mechanism analyses of post-traumatic epilepsy and hereditary epilepsy based on 10Ã single-cell transcriptome sequencing technology,"Background:Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis has been usually conducted on post-traumatic epilepsy (PET) and hereditary epilepsy (HE) patients; however, the transcriptome of patients with traumatic temporal lobe epilepsy has rarely been studied.Materials and methods:Hippocampus tissues isolated from one patient with PTE and one patient with HE were used in the present study. Single cell isolates were prepared and captured using a 10Ã Genomics Chromium Single-Cell 3' kit (V3) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencing system. Raw data were processed, and the cells were filtered and classified using the Seurat R package. Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection was used for visualization. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified based on a p-value â¤0.01 and log fold change (FC) â¥0.25. Gene Ontology (GO, http://geneontology.org/) and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, www.genome.jp/kegg) analyses were performed on the DEGs for enrichment analysis.Results:The reads obtained from the 10Ã genomic platform for PTE and HE were 39.56 M and 30.08 M, respectively. The Q30 score of the RNA reads was >91.6%. After filtering, 7479 PTE cells and 9357 HE cells remained for further study. More than 96.4% of the reads were mapped to GRCh38/GRCm38. The cells were differentially distributed in two groups, with higher numbers of oligodendrocytes (6522 vs. 2532) and astrocytes (133 vs. 52), and lower numbers of microglial cells (2242 vs. 3811), and neurons (3 vs. 203) present in the HE group than in the PTE group. The DEGs in four cell clusters were identified, with 25 being in oligodendrocytes (13 upregulated and 12 downregulated), 87 in microglia cells (42 upregulated and 45 downregulated), 222 in astrocytes (115 upregulated and 107 downregulated), and 393 in neurons (305 upregulated and 88 downregulated). The genes MTND1P23 (downregulated), XIST (downregulated), and RPS4Y1 (upregulated) were commonly expressed in all four cell clusters. The DEGs in microglial cells and astrocytes were enriched in the IL-17 signaling pathway.Conclusion:Our study explored differences in cells found in a patient with PE compared to a patient with HE, and the transcriptome in the different cells was analyzed for the first time. Studying inflammatory and immune functions might be the best approach for investigating traumatic temporal lobe epilepsy in neurons.",38572804,PMC10993349,10.1111/cns.14702,0,CNS neuroscience & therapeutics,101473265,7.035,0.424710214138031,0.08695652173913043,0.43478260869565216,0.3591739545697751
High-Throughput Single-Cell Transcriptome Profiling of Plant Cell Types,"Single-cell transcriptome profiling of heterogeneous tissues can provide high-resolution windows into developmental dynamics and environmental responses, but its application to plants has been limited. Here, we used the high-throughput Drop-seq approach to profile >12,000 cells from Arabidopsis roots. This identified numerous distinct cell types, covering all major root tissues and developmental stages, and illuminated specific marker genes for these populations. In addition, we demonstrate the utility of this approach to study the impact of environmental conditions on developmental processes. Analysis of roots grown with or without sucrose supplementation uncovers changes in the relative frequencies of cell types in response to sucrose. Finally, we characterize the transcriptome changes that occur across endodermis development and identify nearly 800 genes with dynamic expression as this tissue differentiates. Collectively, we demonstrate that single-cell RNA-seq can be used to profile developmental processes in plants and show how they can be altered by external stimuli.",31091459,PMC6758921,10.1016/j.celrep.2019.04.054,137,Cell reports,101573691,9.995,0.42274293303489685,0.9163879598662207,0.5752508361204013,0.5519735190182625
The technology and biology of single-cell RNA sequencing,"The differences between individual cells can have profound functional consequences, in both unicellular and multicellular organisms. Recently developed single-cell mRNA-sequencing methods enable unbiased, high-throughput, and high-resolution transcriptomic analysis of individual cells. This provides an additional dimension to transcriptomic information relative to traditional methods that profile bulk populations of cells. Already, single-cell RNA-sequencing methods have revealed new biology in terms of the composition of tissues, the dynamics of transcription, and the regulatory relationships between genes.

Single-Cell Transcriptomic Profiling of Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived SCGB3A2+ Airway Epithelium,"Lung epithelial lineages have been difficult to maintain in pure form in vitro, and lineage-specific reporters have proven invaluable for monitoring their emergence from cultured pluripotent stem cells (PSCs). However, reporter constructs for tracking proximal airway lineages generated from PSCs have not been previously available, limiting the characterization of these cells. Here, we engineer mouse and human PSC lines carrying airway secretory lineage reporters that facilitate the tracking, purification, and profiling of this lung subtype. Through bulk and single-cell-based global transcriptomic profiling, we find PSC-derived airway secretory cells are susceptible to phenotypic plasticity exemplified by the tendency to co-express both a proximal airway secretory program as well as an alveolar type 2 cell program, which can be minimized by inhibiting endogenous Wnt signaling. Our results provide global profiles of engineered lung cell fates, a guide for improving their directed differentiation, and a human model of the developing airway.",29657097,PMC5995784,10.1016/j.stemcr.2018.03.013,47,Stem cell reports,101611300,7.294,0.42131370306015015,0.7357859531772575,0.46153846153846156,0.4922531047792339
Single-cell transcriptomes reveal characteristic features of cell types within the human adrenal microenvironment,"Various cells within the adrenal microenvironment are important in maintaining the body homeostasis. However, our understanding of adrenal disease pathogenesis is limited by an incomplete molecular characterization of the cell types responsible for the organ's multiple homeostatic functions. We report a cellular landscape of the human adrenal gland using single-cell RNA sequencing. We reveal characteristic features of cell types within the human adrenal microenvironment and found immune activation of nonimmune cells in the adrenal endothelial cells. We also reveal that abundant immune cells occupied a lot of space in adrenal gland. Additionally, Sex-related diversity in the adrenocortical cells and different gene expression profiles between the left and right adrenal gland are also observed at single-cell resolution. Together, at single-cell resolution, the transcriptomic map presents a comprehensive view of the human adrenal gland, which serves as a fundamental baseline description of this organ and paves a way for the further studies of adrenal diseases.",33934358,,10.1002/jcp.30398,7,Journal of cellular physiology,50222,6.513,0.4209566116333008,0.44481605351170567,0.3511705685618729,0.41177129139469615
Tutorial: guidelines for annotating single-cell transcriptomic maps using automated and manual methods,"Single-cell transcriptomics can profile thousands of cells in a single experiment and identify novel cell types, states and dynamics in a wide variety of tissues and organisms. Standard experimental protocols and analysis workflows have been developed to create single-cell transcriptomic maps from tissues. This tutorial focuses on how to interpret these data to identify cell types, states and other biologically relevant patterns with the objective of creating an annotated map of cells. We recommend a three-step workflow including automatic cell annotation (wherever possible), manual cell annotation and verification. Frequently encountered challenges are discussed, as well as strategies to address them. Guiding principles and specific recommendations for software tools and resources that can be used for each step are covered, and an R notebook is included to help run the recommended workflow.

Single-cell transcriptome analysis of Physcomitrella leaf cells during reprogramming using microcapillary manipulation,"Next-generation sequencing technologies have made it possible to carry out transcriptome analysis at the single-cell level. Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data provide insights into cellular dynamics, including intercellular heterogeneity as well as inter- and intra-cellular fluctuations in gene expression that cannot be studied using populations of cells. The utilization of scRNA-seq is, however, restricted to cell types that can be isolated from their original tissues, and it can be difficult to obtain precise positional information for these cells in situ. Here, we established single cell-digital gene expression (1cell-DGE), a method of scRNA-seq that uses micromanipulation to extract the contents of individual living cells in intact tissue while recording their positional information. With 1cell-DGE, we could detect differentially expressed genes (DEGs) during the reprogramming of leaf cells of the moss Physcomitrella patens, identifying 6382 DEGs between cells at 0 and 24 h after excision. Furthermore, we identified a subpopulation of reprogramming cells based on their pseudotimes, which were calculated using transcriptome profiles at 24 h. 1cell-DGE with microcapillary manipulation can be used to analyze the gene expression of individual cells without detaching them from their tightly associated tissues, enabling us to retain positional information and investigate cell-cell interactions.",30873540,PMC6511839,10.1093/nar/gkz181,17,Nucleic acids research,411011,19.16,0.419291228055954,0.5852842809364549,0.8260869565217391,0.5338489843252112
"Ex uno, plures-From One Tissue to Many Cells: A Review of Single-Cell Transcriptomics in Cardiovascular Biology","Recent technological advances have revolutionized the study of tissue biology and garnered a greater appreciation for tissue complexity. In order to understand cardiac development, heart tissue homeostasis, and the effects of stress and injury on the cardiovascular system, it is essential to characterize the heart at high cellular resolution. Single-cell profiling provides a more precise definition of tissue composition, cell differentiation trajectories, and intercellular communication, compared to classical bulk approaches.

Advanced sequencing-based high-throughput and long-read single-cell transcriptome analysis,"Cells are the fundamental building blocks of living systems, exhibiting significant heterogeneity. The transcriptome connects the cellular genotype and phenotype, and profiling single-cell transcriptomes is critical for uncovering distinct cell types, states, and the interplay between cells in development, health, and disease. Nevertheless, single-cell transcriptome analysis faces daunting challenges due to the low abundance and diverse nature of RNAs in individual cells, as well as their heterogeneous expression. The advent and continuous advancements of next-generation sequencing (NGS) and third-generation sequencing (TGS) technologies have solved these problems and facilitated the high-throughput, sensitive, full-length, and rapid profiling of single-cell RNAs. In this review, we provide a broad introduction to current methodologies for single-cell transcriptome sequencing. First, state-of-the-art advancements in high-throughput and full-length single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) platforms using NGS are reviewed. Next, TGS-based long-read scRNA-seq methods are summarized.

HTCA: a database with an in-depth characterization of the single-cell human transcriptome,"Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) is one of the most used single-cell omics in recent decades. The exponential growth of single-cell data has immense potential for large-scale integration and in-depth explorations that are more representative of the study population. Efforts have been made to consolidate published data, yet extensive characterization is still lacking. Many focused on raw-data database constructions while others concentrate mainly on gene expression queries. Hereby, we present HTCA (www.htcatlas.org), an interactive database constructed based on â¼2.3 million high-quality cells from â¼3000 scRNA-seq samples and comprised in-depth phenotype profiles of 19 healthy adult and matching fetal tissues. HTCA provides a one-stop interactive query to gene signatures, transcription factor (TF) activities, TF motifs, receptor-ligand interactions, enriched gene ontology (GO) terms, etc. across cell types in adult and fetal tissues. At the same time, HTCA encompasses single-cell splicing variant profiles of 16 adult and fetal tissues, spatial transcriptomics profiles of 11 adult and fetal tissues, and single-cell ATAC-sequencing (scATAC-seq) profiles of 27 adult and fetal tissues. Besides, HTCA provides online analysis tools to perform major steps in a typical scRNA-seq analysis. Altogether, HTCA allows real-time explorations of multi-omics adult and fetal phenotypic profiles and provides tools for a flexible scRNA-seq analysis.",36130266,PMC9825435,10.1093/nar/gkac791,10,Nucleic acids research,411011,19.16,0.418756365776062,0.5050167224080268,0.8294314381270903,0.5181434515726606
Topological and geometric analysis of cell states in single-cell transcriptomic data,"Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables dissecting cellular heterogeneity in tissues, resulting in numerous biological discoveries. Various computational methods have been devised to delineate cell types by clustering scRNA-seq data, where clusters are often annotated using prior knowledge of marker genes. In addition to identifying pure cell types, several methods have been developed to identify cells undergoing state transitions, which often rely on prior clustering results. The present computational approaches predominantly investigate the local and first-order structures of scRNA-seq data using graph representations, while scRNA-seq data frequently display complex high-dimensional structures. Here, we introduce scGeom, a tool that exploits the multiscale and multidimensional structures in scRNA-seq data by analyzing the geometry and topology through curvature and persistent homology of both cell and gene networks. We demonstrate the utility of these structural features to reflect biological properties and functions in several applications, where we show that curvatures and topological signatures of cell and gene networks can help indicate transition cells and the differentiation potential of cells. We also illustrate that structural characteristics can improve the classification of cell types.",38632952,PMC11024518,10.1093/bib/bbae176,1,Briefings in bioinformatics,100912837,13.994,0.41750892996788025,0.2140468227424749,0.6722408026755853,0.4277628830643402
Single-cell transcriptome profiling reveals intra-tumoral heterogeneity in human chordomas,"Chordoma is a rare and aggressive bone tumor. An accurate investigation of tumor heterogeneity is necessary for the development of effective therapeutic strategies. This study aims to assess the poorly understood tumor heterogeneity of chordomas and identify potential therapeutic targets. Single-cell RNA sequencing was performed to delineate the transcriptomic landscape of chordomas. Six tumor samples of chordomas were obtained, and 33,737 cells passed the quality control test and were analyzed. The main cellular populations identified with specific markers were as follows: chordoma cells (16,052 [47.6%]), fibroblasts (6945 [20.6%]), mononuclear phagocytes (4734 [14.0%]), and T/natural killer (NK) cells (3944 [11.7%]). Downstream analysis of each cell type was performed. Six subclusters of chordomas exhibited properties of an epithelial-like extracellular matrix, stem cells, and immunosuppressive activity. Although few immune checkpoints were detected on cytotoxic immune cells such as T and NK cells, a strong immunosuppressive effect was exerted on the Tregs and M2 macrophages. In addition, the cellular interactions were indicative of enhancement of the TGF-Î² signaling pathway being the main mechanism for tumor progression, invasion, and immunosuppression. These findings, especially from the analysis of molecular targeted therapy and tumor immune microenvironment, may help in the identification of therapeutic targets in chordomas.",35084549,PMC10992276,10.1007/s00262-022-03152-1,14,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,6.63,0.417093425989151,0.5551839464882943,0.3712374581939799,0.43554033652994545
Single-cell transcriptome analysis of human skin identifies novel fibroblast subpopulation and enrichment of immune subsets in atopic dermatitis,"Background:Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a prevalent inflammatory skin disease with a complex pathogenesis involving immune cell and epidermal abnormalities. Despite whole tissue biopsy studies that have advanced the mechanistic understanding of AD, single cell-based molecular alterations are largely unknown.Objective:Our aims were to construct a detailed, high-resolution atlas of cell populations and assess variability in cell composition and cell-specific gene expression in the skin of patients with AD versus in controls.Methods:We performed single-cell RNA sequencing on skin biopsy specimens from 5 patients with AD (4 lesional samples and 5 nonlesional samples) and 7 healthy control subjects, using 10Ã Genomics.Results:We created transcriptomic profiles for 39,042 AD (lesional and nonlesional) and healthy skin cells. Fibroblasts demonstrated a novel COL6A5+COL18A1+subpopulation that was unique to lesional AD and expressed CCL2 and CCL19 cytokines. A corresponding LAMP3+dendritic cell (DC) population that expressed the CCL19 receptor CCR7 was also unique to AD lesions, illustrating a potential role for fibroblast signaling to immune cells. The lesional AD samples were characterized by expansion of inflammatory DCs (CD1A+FCER1A+) and tissue-resident memory T cells (CD69+CD103+). The frequencies of type 2 (IL13+)/type 22 (IL22+) T cells were higher than those of type 1 (IFNG+) in lesional AD, whereas this ratio was slightly diminished in nonlesional AD and further diminished in controls.Conclusion:AD lesions were characterized by expanded type 2/type 22 T cells and inflammatory DCs, and by a unique inflammatory fibroblast that may interact with immune cells to regulate lymphoid cell organization and type 2 inflammation.",32035984,,10.1016/j.jaci.2020.01.042,141,The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology,1275002,14.29,0.41667795181274414,0.919732441471572,0.6822742474916388,0.5704081088802886
A Spatiotemporal Organ-Wide Gene Expression and Cell Atlas of the Developing Human Heart,"The process of cardiac morphogenesis in humans is incompletely understood. Its full characterization requires a deep exploration of the organ-wide orchestration of gene expression with a single-cell spatial resolution. Here, we present a molecular approach that reveals the comprehensive transcriptional landscape of cell types populating the embryonic heart at three developmental stages and that maps cell-type-specific gene expression to specific anatomical domains. Spatial transcriptomics identified unique gene profiles that correspond to distinct anatomical regions in each developmental stage. Human embryonic cardiac cell types identified by single-cell RNA sequencing confirmed and enriched the spatial annotation of embryonic cardiac gene expression. In situ sequencing was then used to refine these results and create a spatial subcellular map for the three developmental phases. Finally, we generated a publicly available web resource of the human developing heart to facilitate future studies on human cardiogenesis.",31835037,,10.1016/j.cell.2019.11.025,276,Cell,413066,66.85,0.41406935453414917,0.959866220735786,0.9531772575250836,0.6310503083726634
A developmental landscape of 3D-cultured human pre-gastrulation embryos,"Our understanding of how human embryos develop before gastrulation, including spatial self-organization and cell type ontogeny, remains limited by available two-dimensional technological platforms1,2that do not recapitulate the in vivo conditions3-5. Here we report a three-dimensional (3D) blastocyst-culture system that enables human blastocyst development up to the primitive streak anlage stage. These 3D embryos mimic developmental landmarks and 3D architectures in vivo, including the embryonic disc, amnion, basement membrane, primary and primate unique secondary yolk sac, formation of anterior-posterior polarity and primitive streak anlage. Using single-cell transcriptome profiling, we delineate ontology and regulatory networks that underlie the segregation of epiblast, primitive endoderm and trophoblast. Compared with epiblasts, the amniotic epithelium shows unique and characteristic phenotypes. After implantation, specific pathways and transcription factors trigger the differentiation of cytotrophoblasts, extravillous cytotrophoblasts and syncytiotrophoblasts. Epiblasts undergo a transition to pluripotency upon implantation, and the transcriptome of these cells is maintained until the generation of the primitive streak anlage. These developmental processes are driven by different pluripotency factors. Together, findings from our 3D-culture approach help to determine the molecular and morphogenetic developmental landscape that occurs during human embryogenesis.",31830756,,10.1038/s41586-019-1875-y,157,Nature,410462,69.504,0.4126485288143158,0.9264214046822743,0.9966555183946488,0.6322045019039741
Single-cell transcriptomics provide insight into metastasis-related subsets of breast cancer,"Breast cancer metastasis is a complex, multi-step process, with high cellular heterogeneity between primary and metastatic breast cancer, and more complex interactions between metastatic cancer cells and other cells in the tumor microenvironment. High-resolution single-cell transcriptome sequencing technology can visualize the heterogeneity of malignant and non-malignant cells in the tumor microenvironment in real time, especially combined with spatial transcriptome analysis, which can directly compare changes between different stages of metastatic samples. Therefore, this study takes single-cell analysis as the first perspective to deeply explore special or rare cell subpopulations related to breast cancer metastasis, systematically summarizes their functions, molecular features, and corresponding treatment strategies, which will contribute to accurately identify, understand, and target tumor metastasis-related driving events, provide a research basis for the mechanistic study of breast cancer metastasis, and provide new clues for its personalized precision treatment.",37858183,PMC10588105,10.1186/s13058-023-01728-y,0,Breast cancer research : BCR,100927353,8.408,0.41241180896759033,0.09364548494983277,0.49498327759197325,0.3651728378889154
FitDevo: accurate inference of single-cell developmental potential using sample-specific gene weight,"The quantification of developmental potential is critical for determining developmental stages and identifying essential molecular signatures in single-cell studies. Here, we present FitDevo, a novel method for inferring developmental potential using scRNA-seq data. The main idea of FitDevo is first to generate sample-specific gene weight (SSGW) and then infer developmental potential by calculating the correlation between SSGW and gene expression. SSGW is generated using a generalized linear model that combines sample-specific information and gene weight learned from a training dataset covering scRNA-seq data of 17 previously published datasets. We have rigorously validated FitDevo's effectiveness using a testing dataset with scRNA-seq data from 28 existing datasets and have also demonstrated its superiority over current methods. Furthermore, FitDevo's broad application scope has been illustrated using three practical scenarios: deconvolution analysis of epidermis, spatial transcriptomic data analysis of hearts and intestines, and developmental potential analysis of breast cancer.

Single Cell Transcriptome Analysis of Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells in Freshly Isolated versus Stored Blood Samples,"Background:Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are widely used as a model in the study of different human diseases. There is often a time delay from blood collection to PBMC isolation during the sampling process, which can result in an experimental bias, particularly when performing single cell RNA-seq (scRNAseq) studies.Methods:This study examined the impact of different time periods from blood draw to PBMC isolation on the subsequent transcriptome profiling of different cell types in PBMCs by scRNAseq using the 10X Chromium Single Cell Gene Expression assay.Results:Examining the five major cell types constituting the PBMC cell population, i.e., CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, NK cells, monocytes, and B cells, both common changes and cell-type-specific changes were observed in the single cell transcriptome profiling over time. In particular, the upregulation of genes regulated by NF-kB in response to TNF was observed in all five cell types. Significant changes in key genes involved in AP-1 signaling were also observed. RBC contamination was a major issue in stored blood, whereas RBC adherence had no direct impact on the cell transcriptome.Conclusions:Significant transcriptome changes were observed across different PBMC cell types as a factor of time from blood draw to PBMC isolation and as a consequence of blood storage.

Cell-type-specific mRNA transcription and degradation kinetics in zebrafish embryogenesis from metabolically labeled single-cell RNA-seq,"During embryonic development, pluripotent cells assume specialized identities by adopting particular gene expression profiles. However, systematically dissecting the relative contributions of mRNA transcription and degradation to shaping those profiles remains challenging, especially within embryos with diverse cellular identities. Here, we combine single-cell RNA-Seq and metabolic labeling to capture temporal cellular transcriptomes of zebrafish embryos where newly-transcribed (zygotic) and pre-existing (maternal) mRNA can be distinguished. We introduce kinetic models to quantify mRNA transcription and degradation rates within individual cell types during their specification. These models reveal highly varied regulatory rates across thousands of genes, coordinated transcription and destruction rates for many transcripts, and link differences in degradation to specific sequence elements. They also identify cell-type-specific differences in degradation, namely selective retention of maternal transcripts within primordial germ cells and enveloping layer cells, two of the earliest specified cell types. Our study provides a quantitative approach to study mRNA regulation during a dynamic spatio-temporal response.",38600066,PMC11006943,10.1038/s41467-024-47290-9,0,Nature communications,101528555,17.694,0.408571720123291,0.10367892976588629,0.7591973244147158,0.417718282910095
Anaplastic transformation in thyroid cancer revealed by single-cell transcriptomics,"The deadliest anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) often transforms from indolent differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC); however, the complex intratumor transformation process is poorly understood. We investigated an anaplastic transformation model by dissecting both cell lineage and cell fate transitions using single-cell transcriptomic and genetic alteration data from patients with different subtypes of thyroid cancer. The resulting spectrum of ATC transformation included stress-responsive DTC cells, inflammatory ATC cells (iATCs), and mitotic-defective ATC cells and extended all the way to mesenchymal ATC cells (mATCs). Furthermore, our analysis identified 2 important milestones: (a) a diploid stage, in which iATC cells were diploids with inflammatory phenotypes and (b) an aneuploid stage, in which mATCs gained aneuploid genomes and mesenchymal phenotypes, producing excessive amounts of collagen and collagen-interacting receptors. In parallel, cancer-associated fibroblasts showed strong interactions among mesenchymal cell types, macrophages shifted from M1 to M2 states, and T cells reprogrammed from cytotoxic to exhausted states, highlighting new therapeutic opportunities for the treatment of ATC.",37053016,PMC10231997,10.1172/JCI169653,16,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,19.456,0.40821778774261475,0.5785953177257525,0.8494983277591973,0.5305494017425587
Single-cell transcriptomic atlas of the human endometrium during the menstrual cycle,"In a human menstrual cycle the endometrium undergoes remodeling, shedding and regeneration, all of which are driven by substantial gene expression changes in the underlying cellular hierarchy. Despite its importance in human fertility and regenerative biology, our understanding of this unique type of tissue homeostasis remains rudimentary. We characterized the transcriptomic transformation of human endometrium at single-cell resolution across the menstrual cycle, resolving cellular heterogeneity in multiple dimensions. We profiled the behavior of seven endometrial cell types, including a previously uncharacterized ciliated cell type, during four major phases of endometrial transformation, and found characteristic signatures for each cell type and phase. We discovered that the human window of implantation opens with an abrupt and discontinuous transcriptomic activation in the epithelia, accompanied with a widespread decidualization feature in the stromal fibroblasts. Our study provides a high-resolution molecular and cellular characterization of human endometrial transformation across the menstrual cycle, providing insights into this essential physiological process.",32929266,,10.1038/s41591-020-1040-z,168,Nature medicine,9502015,87.241,0.40809983015060425,0.9297658862876255,1.0,0.6308130753478876
Pathway trajectory analysis with tensor imputation reveals drug-induced single-cell transcriptomic landscape,"Genome-wide identification of single-cell transcriptomic responses of drugs in various human cells is a challenging issue in medical and pharmaceutical research. Here we present a computational method, tensor-based imputation of gene-expression data at the single-cell level (TIGERS), which reveals the drug-induced single-cell transcriptomic landscape. With this algorithm, we predict missing drug-induced single-cell gene-expression data with tensor imputation, and identify trajectories of regulated pathways considering intercellular heterogeneity. Tensor imputation outperformed existing imputation methods for data completion, and provided cell-type-specific transcriptomic responses for unobserved drugs. For example, TIGERS correctly predicted the cell-type-specific expression of maker genes for pancreatic islets. Pathway trajectory analysis of the imputed gene-expression profiles of all combinations of drugs and human cells identified single-cell-specific drug activities and pathway trajectories that reflect drug-induced changes in pathway regulation.

Analysis of Technical and Biological Variability in Single-Cell RNA Sequencing,"Profiling the transcriptomes of individual cells with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has been widely applied to provide a detailed molecular characterization of cellular heterogeneity within a population of cells. Despite recent technological advances of scRNA-seq, technical variability of gene expression in scRNA-seq is still much higher than that in bulk RNA-seq. Accounting for technical variability is therefore a prerequisite for correctly analyzing single-cell data. This chapter describes a computational pipeline for detecting highly variable genes exhibiting higher cell-to-cell variability than expected by technical noise. The basic pipeline using the scater and scran R/Bioconductor packages includes deconvolution-based normalization, fitting the mean-variance trend, testing for nonzero biological variability, and visualization with highly variable genes. An outline of the underlying theory of detecting highly variable genes is also presented. We illustrate how the pipeline works by using two case studies, one from mouse embryonic stem cells with external RNA spike-ins, and the other from mouse dentate gyrus cells without spike-ins.",30758818,,10.1007/978-1-4939-9057-3_3,2,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,0.0,0.40615513920783997,0.27759197324414714,0.056856187290969896,0.3105827156317274
Unravelling fibrosis using single-cell transcriptomics,"Fibrosis, the excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix, is a major global healthcare burden. Despite major advances in our understanding of the mechanisms regulating fibrosis, treatment options for patients with fibrosis remain very limited. However, recent developments in the rapidly evolving field of single-cell transcriptomics are enabling the interrogation of individual pathogenic cell populations in the context of fibrosis at unprecedented resolution. In this review, we will discuss how single-cell transcriptomics is driving this step change in our understanding of fibrotic disease pathogenesis, and how these cutting-edge approaches should accelerate the precise identification of novel, relevant and potentially druggable therapeutic targets to treat patients with fibrosis.",31670054,,10.1016/j.coph.2019.09.004,4,Current opinion in pharmacology,100966133,4.768,0.4054487347602844,0.38461538461538464,0.2608695652173913,0.37236623082272585
Large-scale integration of single-cell transcriptomic data captures transitional progenitor states in mouse skeletal muscle regeneration,"Skeletal muscle repair is driven by the coordinated self-renewal and fusion of myogenic stem and progenitor cells. Single-cell gene expression analyses of myogenesis have been hampered by the poor sampling of rare and transient cell states that are critical for muscle repair, and do not inform the spatial context that is important for myogenic differentiation. Here, we demonstrate how large-scale integration of single-cell and spatial transcriptomic data can overcome these limitations. We created a single-cell transcriptomic dataset of mouse skeletal muscle by integration, consensus annotation, and analysis of 23 newly collected scRNAseq datasets and 88 publicly available single-cell (scRNAseq) and single-nucleus (snRNAseq) RNA-sequencing datasets. The resulting dataset includes more than 365,000 cells and spans a wide range of ages, injury, and repair conditions. Together, these data enabled identification of the predominant cell types in skeletal muscle, and resolved cell subtypes, including endothelial subtypes distinguished by vessel-type of origin, fibro-adipogenic progenitors defined by functional roles, and many distinct immune populations. The representation of different experimental conditions and the depth of transcriptome coverage enabled robust profiling of sparsely expressed genes. We built a densely sampled transcriptomic model of myogenesis, from stem cell quiescence to myofiber maturation, and identified rare, transitional states of progenitor commitment and fusion that are poorly represented in individual datasets. We performed spatial RNA sequencing of mouse muscle at three time points after injury and used the integrated dataset as a reference to achieve a high-resolution, local deconvolution of cell subtypes. We also used the integrated dataset to explore ligand-receptor co-expression patterns and identify dynamic cell-cell interactions in muscle injury response. We provide a public web tool to enable interactive exploration and visualization of the data. Our work supports the utility of large-scale integration of single-cell transcriptomic data as a tool for biological discovery.",34773081,PMC8589952,10.1038/s42003-021-02810-x,60,Communications biology,101719179,6.548,0.405213326215744,0.7892976588628763,0.35451505016722407,0.4718905375354664

The rise of single-cell transcriptomics in yeast,"The field of single-cell omics has transformed our understanding of biological processes and is constantly advancing both experimentally and computationally. One of the most significant developments is the ability to measure the transcriptome of individual cells by single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq), which was pioneered in higher eukaryotes. While yeast has served as a powerful model organism in which to test and develop transcriptomic technologies, the implementation of scRNA-seq has been significantly delayed in this organism, mainly because of technical constraints associated with its intrinsic characteristics, namely the presence of a cell wall, a small cell size and little amounts of RNA. In this review, we examine the current technologies for scRNA-seq in yeast and highlight their strengths and weaknesses. Additionally, we explore opportunities for developing novel technologies and the potential outcomes of implementing single-cell transcriptomics and extension to other modalities.

Identifying gene expression from single cells to single genes,"Gene regulatory networks reveal how transcription factors contribute to a dynamic cascade of cellular information processing. Recent advances in technologies have enhanced the toolkit for testing GRN mechanisms and connections. Here we emphasize three approaches that we have found important for interrogating transcriptional mechanisms in echinoderms: single cell mRNA sequencing (drop-seq), nascent RNA detection and identification, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). We present these applications in order since it is a logical experimental protocol. With preliminary information from bulk mRNA transcriptome analysis and differential gene expression studies (DE-seq), one may need to test in what specific cells important genes may be expressed and to use single cell sequencing to define such links. Nascent RNA analysis with the Click-iT chemistry allows the investigator to deduce when the RNA was transcribed, not just identify its presence, and ChIP allows the investigator to study direct interactions of putative transcriptional regulators with the gene promoter of interest. This flow of thinking, and the technologies to support it, is presented here for echinoderms.

Bulk and single-cell transcriptome datasets of the mouse fetal and adult rete ovarii and surrounding tissues,"The rete ovarii (RO) is an epithelial structure that arises during development in close proximity to the ovary and persists throughout adulthood. However, the functional significance of the RO remains elusive, and it is absent from recent discussions of female reproductive anatomy. The RO comprises three regions: the intraovarian rete within the ovary, the extraovarian rete in the periovarian tissue, and the connecting rete linking the two. We hypothesize that the RO plays a pivotal role in ovarian homeostasis and responses to physiological changes. To begin to uncover the nature and function of RO cells, we conducted transcriptomic profiling of the RO. This study presents three datasets, and reports our analysis and quality control approaches for bulk, single-cell, and nucleus-level transcriptomics of the fetal and adult RO tissues using the Pax8-rtTA; Tre-H2B-GFP mouse line, where all RO regions express nuclear GFP.

Accurate estimation of cell-type composition from gene expression data,"The rapid development of single-cell transcriptomic technologies has helped uncover the cellular heterogeneity within cell populations. However, bulk RNA-seq continues to be the main workhorse for quantifying gene expression levels due to technical simplicity and low cost. To most effectively extract information from bulk data given the new knowledge gained from single-cell methods, we have developed a novel algorithm to estimate the cell-type composition of bulk data from a single-cell RNA-seq-derived cell-type signature. Comparison with existing methods using various real RNA-seq data sets indicates that our new approach is more accurate and comprehensive than previous methods, especially for the estimation of rare cell types. More importantly, our method can detect cell-type composition changes in response to external perturbations, thereby providing a valuable, cost-effective method for dissecting the cell-type-specific effects of drug treatments or condition changes.

Simultaneous Profiling of mRNA Transcriptome and DNA Methylome from a Single Cell,"Single-cell transcriptome and single-cell methylome analysis have successfully revealed the heterogeneity in transcriptome and DNA methylome between single cells, and have become powerful tools to understand the dynamics of transcriptome and DNA methylome during the complicated biological processes, such as differentiation and carcinogenesis.Inspired by the success of using these single-cell -omics methods to understand the regulation of a particular ""-ome,"" more interests have been put on elucidating the regulatory relationship among multiple-omics at single-cell resolution. The simultaneous profiling of multiple-omics from the same single cell would provide us the ultimate power to understand the relationship among different ""-omes,"" but this idea is not materialized for decades due to difficulties to assay extremely tiny amount of DNA or RNA in a single cell.To address this technical challenge, we have recently developed a novel method named scMT-seq that can simultaneously profile both DNA methylome and RNA transcriptome from the same cell. This method enabled us to measure, from a single cell, the DNA methylation status of the most informative 0.5-1 million CpG sites and mRNA level of 10,000 genes, of which 3200 genes can be further analyzed with both promoter DNA methylation and RNA transcription. Using the scMT-seq data, we have successfully shown the regulatory relationship between DNA methylation and transcriptional level in a single dorsal root ganglion neuron (Hu et al., Genome Biol 17:88, 2016). We believe the scMT-seq would be a powerful technique to uncover the regulatory mechanism between transcription and DNA methylation, and would be of wide interest beyond the epigenetics community.",31028648,,10.1007/978-1-4939-9240-9_21,10,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,0.0,0.3954843282699585,0.5083612040133779,0.06020066889632107,0.3510029715439149
Single-Cell RNA-Seq Mapping of Human Thymopoiesis Reveals Lineage Specification Trajectories and a Commitment Spectrum in T Cell Development,"The challenges in recapitulating in vivo human T cell development in laboratory models have posed a barrier to understanding human thymopoiesis. Here, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (sRNA-seq) to interrogate the rare CD34+progenitor and the more differentiated CD34-fractions in the human postnatal thymus. CD34+thymic progenitors were comprised of a spectrum of specification and commitment states characterized by multilineage priming followed by gradual T cell commitment. The earliest progenitors in the differentiation trajectory were CD7-and expressed a stem-cell-like transcriptional profile, but had also initiated T cell priming. Clustering analysis identified a CD34+subpopulation primed for the plasmacytoid dendritic lineage, suggesting an intrathymic dendritic specification pathway.

scBOL: a universal cell type identification framework for single-cell and spatial transcriptomics data,"Motivation:Over the past decade, single-cell transcriptomic technologies have experienced remarkable advancements, enabling the simultaneous profiling of gene expressions across thousands of individual cells. Cell type identification plays an essential role in exploring tissue heterogeneity and characterizing cell state differences. With more and more well-annotated reference data becoming available, massive automatic identification methods have sprung up to simplify the annotation process on unlabeled target data by transferring the cell type knowledge. However, in practice, the target data often include some novel cell types that are not in the reference data. Most existing works usually classify these private cells as one generic 'unassigned' group and learn the features of known and novel cell types in a coupled way. They are susceptible to the potential batch effects and fail to explore the fine-grained semantic knowledge of novel cell types, thus hurting the model's discrimination ability. Additionally, emerging spatial transcriptomic technologies, such as in situ hybridization, sequencing and multiplexed imaging, present a novel challenge to current cell type identification strategies that predominantly neglect spatial organization. Consequently, it is imperative to develop a versatile method that can proficiently annotate single-cell transcriptomics data, encompassing both spatial and non-spatial dimensions.Results:To address these issues, we propose a new, challenging yet realistic task called universal cell type identification for single-cell and spatial transcriptomics data. In this task, we aim to give semantic labels to target cells from known cell types and cluster labels to those from novel ones. To tackle this problem, instead of designing a suboptimal two-stage approach, we propose an end-to-end algorithm called scBOL from the perspective of Bipartite prototype alignment. Firstly, we identify the mutual nearest clusters in reference and target data as their potential common cell types. On this basis, we mine the cycle-consistent semantic anchor cells to build the intrinsic structure association between two data. Secondly, we design a neighbor-aware prototypical learning paradigm to strengthen the inter-cluster separability and intra-cluster compactness within each data, thereby inspiring the discriminative feature representations. Thirdly, driven by the semantic-aware prototypical learning framework, we can align the known cell types and separate the private cell types from them among reference and target data. Such an algorithm can be seamlessly applied to various data types modeled by different foundation models that can generate the embedding features for cells. Specifically, for non-spatial single-cell transcriptomics data, we use the autoencoder neural network to learn latent low-dimensional cell representations, and for spatial single-cell transcriptomics data, we apply the graph convolution network to capture molecular and spatial similarities of cells jointly. Extensive results on our carefully designed evaluation benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of scBOL over various state-of-the-art cell type identification methods. To our knowledge, we are the pioneers in presenting this pragmatic annotation task, as well as in devising a comprehensive algorithmic framework aimed at resolving this challenge across varied types of single-cell data. Finally, scBOL is implemented in Python using the Pytorch machine-learning library, and it is freely available at https://github.com/aimeeyaoyao/scBOL.",38678389,PMC11056022,10.1093/bib/bbae188,0,Briefings in bioinformatics,100912837,13.994,0.3949008285999298,0.12040133779264214,0.6789297658862876,0.39680671789574384
Transcriptomic Characterization of the Human Cell Cycle in Individual Unsynchronized Cells,"The highly fine-tuned dynamics of cell cycle gene expression have been intensely studied for several decades. However, some previous observations may be difficult to fully decouple from artifacts induced by traditional cell synchronization procedures. In addition, bulk cell measurements may have disguised intricate details. Here, we address this by sorting and transcriptomic sequencing of single cells progressing through the cell cycle without prior synchronization. Genes and pathways with known cell cycle roles are confirmed, associated regulatory sequence motifs are determined, and we also establish ties between other biological processes and the unsynchronized cell cycle. Importantly, we find the G1 phase to be surprisingly heterogeneous, with transcriptionally distinct early and late time points. We additionally note that mRNAs accumulate to reach maximum total levels at mitosis and find that stable transcripts show reduced cell-to-cell variability, consistent with the transcriptional burst model of gene expression. Our study provides the first detailed transcriptional profiling of an unsynchronized human cell cycle.",29045817,,10.1016/j.jmb.2017.10.011,8,Journal of molecular biology,2985088R,0.0,0.39455080032348633,0.47157190635451507,0.06354515050167224,0.3437538915653292
A clustering-independent method for finding differentially expressed genes in single-cell transcriptome data,"A common analysis of single-cell sequencing data includes clustering of cells and identifying differentially expressed genes (DEGs). How cell clusters are defined has important consequences for downstream analyses and the interpretation of results, but is often not straightforward. To address this difficulty, we present singleCellHaystack, a method that enables the prediction of DEGs without relying on explicit clustering of cells. Our method uses Kullback-Leibler divergence to find genes that are expressed in subsets of cells that are non-randomly positioned in a multidimensional space. Comparisons with existing DEG prediction approaches on artificial datasets show that singleCellHaystack has higher accuracy. We illustrate the usage of singleCellHaystack through applications on 136 real transcriptome datasets and a spatial transcriptomics dataset.

Cancer biology had been studied using bulk genomic and gene expression profiling, which however mask the cellular diversity and average the variability among individual molecular programs. Recent advances in single-cell transcriptomic sequencing have enabled a detailed dissection of tumor ecosystems and promoted our understanding of tumorigenesis at single-cell resolution. In the present review, we discuss the main topics of recent cancer studies that have implemented single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). To study cancer cells, scRNA-seq has provided novel insights into the cancer stem-cell model, treatment resistance, and cancer metastasis. To study the tumor microenvironment, scRNA-seq has portrayed the diverse cell types and complex cellular states of both immune and non-immune cells interacting with cancer cells, with the promise to discover novel targets for future immunotherapy.",34405376,PMC8901819,10.1007/s13238-021-00868-1,16,Protein & cell,101532368,15.328,0.39326852560043335,0.5819397993311036,0.6956521739130435,0.49147951000908946
Single-cell temporal transcriptomics from tiny cytoplasmic biopsies,"In a recent issue inNature, Chen et al. present Live-seq, a single-cell transcriptomic profiling method using picoliter scale single-cell cytoplasmic biopsies instead of complete cell lysis. Since the cells quickly recover and basically remain unaffected after the cytoplasmic extraction, the authors transform single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) from an end point to a temporal analysis platform.",36313799,PMC9606287,10.1016/j.crmeth.2022.100319,1,Cell reports methods,9918227360606676,0.0,0.3921622633934021,0.22073578595317725,0.06688963210702341,0.2928224416480814
"Integrating single-cell transcriptomic data across different conditions, technologies, and species","Computational single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) methods have been successfully applied to experiments representing a single condition, technology, or species to discover and define cellular phenotypes. However, identifying subpopulations of cells that are present across multiple data sets remains challenging. Here, we introduce an analytical strategy for integrating scRNA-seq data sets based on common sources of variation, enabling the identification of shared populations across data sets and downstream comparative analysis. We apply this approach, implemented in our R toolkit Seurat (http://satijalab.org/seurat/), to align scRNA-seq data sets of peripheral blood mononuclear cells under resting and stimulated conditions, hematopoietic progenitors sequenced using two profiling technologies, and pancreatic cell 'atlases' generated from human and mouse islets. In each case, we learn distinct or transitional cell states jointly across data sets, while boosting statistical power through integrated analysis. Our approach facilitates general comparisons of scRNA-seq data sets, potentially deepening our understanding of how distinct cell states respond to perturbation, disease, and evolution.",29608179,PMC6700744,10.1038/nbt.4096,4927,Nature biotechnology,9604648,68.164,0.3882700204849243,0.9966555183946488,0.9698996655518395,0.6262730490802522
New avenues for systematically inferring cell-cell communication: through single-cell transcriptomics data,"For multicellular organisms, cell-cell communication is essential to numerous biological processes. Drawing upon the latest development of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), high-resolution transcriptomic data have deepened our understanding of cellular phenotype heterogeneity and composition of complex tissues, which enables systematic cell-cell communication studies at a single-cell level. We first summarize a common workflow of cell-cell communication study using scRNA-seq data, which often includes data preparation, construction of communication networks, and result validation. Two common strategies taken to uncover cell-cell communications are reviewed, e.g., physically vicinal structure-based and ligand-receptor interaction-based one. To conclude, challenges and current applications of cell-cell communication studies at a single-cell resolution are discussed in details and future perspectives are proposed.",32435978,PMC7719148,10.1007/s13238-020-00727-5,52,Protein & cell,101532368,15.328,0.3874005973339081,0.7625418060200669,0.6989966555183946,0.5247480507080372
Multiomics uncovers developing immunological lineages in human,"The development of the human immune system during embryonic and fetal life has historically been difficult to research due to limited access to human tissue. Experimental animal models have been widely used to study development but cellular and molecular programmes may not be conserved across species. The advent of multiomic single-cell technologies and an increase in human developmental tissue biobank resources have facilitated single-cell multiomic studies focused on human immune development. A critical question in the near future is ""How do we best reconcile scientific findings across multiple omic modalities, developmental time, and organismic space?"" In this review, we discuss the application of single-cell multiomic technologies to unravel the major cellular lineages in the prenatal human immune system. We also identify key areas where the combined power of multiomics technologies can be leveraged to address specific immunological gaps in our current knowledge and explore new research horizons in human development.",33569778,PMC8600952,10.1002/eji.202048769,5,European journal of immunology,1273201,6.688,0.3860109746456146,0.411371237458194,0.3745819397993311,0.38879722023887375
Discovering sparse transcription factor codes for cell states and state transitions during development,"Computational analysis of gene expression to determine both the sequence of lineage choices made by multipotent cells and to identify the genes influencing these decisions is challenging. Here we discover a pattern in the expression levels of a sparse subset of genes among cell types in B- and T-cell developmental lineages that correlates with developmental topologies. We develop a statistical framework using this pattern to simultaneously infer lineage transitions and the genes that determine these relationships. We use this technique to reconstruct the early hematopoietic and intestinal developmental trees. We extend this framework to analyze single-cell RNA-seq data from early human cortical development, inferring a neocortical-hindbrain split in early progenitor cells and the key genes that could control this lineage decision. Our work allows us to simultaneously infer both the identity and lineage of cell types as well as a small set of key genes whose expression patterns reflect these relationships.",28296636,PMC5352226,10.7554/eLife.20488,17,eLife,101579614,8.713,0.38577955961227417,0.5886287625418061,0.5183946488294314,0.452872418041612
Mapping Human Pluripotent Stem Cell-derived Erythroid Differentiation by Single-cell Transcriptome Analysis,"There is an imbalance between the supply and demand of functional red blood cells (RBCs) in clinical applications. This imbalance can be addressed by regenerating RBCs using several in vitro methods. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) can handle the low supply of cord blood and the ethical issues in embryonic stem cell research, and provide a promising strategy to eliminate immune rejection. However, no complete single-cell level differentiation pathway exists for the iPSC-derived erythroid differentiation system. In this study, we used iPSC line BC1 to establish a RBC regeneration system. The 10X Genomics single-cell transcriptome platform was used to map the cell lineage and differentiation trajectory on day 14 of the regeneration system. We observed that iPSC differentiation was not synchronized during embryoid body (EB) culture. The cells (on day 14) mainly consisted of mesodermal and various blood cells, similar to the yolk sac hematopoiesis. We identified six cell classifications and characterized the regulatory transcription factor (TF) networks and cell-cell contacts underlying the system. iPSCs undergo two transformations during the differentiation trajectory, accompanied by the dynamic expression of cell adhesion molecules and estrogen-responsive genes. We identified erythroid cells at different stages, such as burst-forming unit erythroid (BFU-E) and orthochromatic erythroblast (ortho-E) cells, and found that the regulation of TFs (e.g., TFDP1 and FOXO3) is erythroid-stage specific. Immune erythroid cells were identified in our system. This study provides systematic theoretical guidance for optimizing the iPSC-derived erythroid differentiation system, and this system is a useful model for simulating in vivo hematopoietic development and differentiation.",34284135,PMC8864192,10.1016/j.gpb.2021.03.009,5,"Genomics, proteomics & bioinformatics",101197608,6.409,0.38572171330451965,0.41471571906354515,0.34448160535117056,0.3832724928656549
Decoding Expression Dynamics of Protein and Transcriptome at the Single-Cell Level in Paired Picoliter Chambers,"Simultaneous analysis of mRNAs and proteins at the single-cell level provides information about the dynamics and correlations of gene and protein expressions in individual cells, enabling a comprehensive study of cellular heterogeneity and expression patterns. Here, we present a platform for about 1000 cellular indexing of mRNAs and membrane proteins, named multi-Paired-seq, with high cell utilization, accurate molecular measurement, and low cost. Based on hydrodynamic differential flow resistance, multi-Paired-seq largely improves cell utilization in the percentage of cells measured in population (>95%). Combined with the pump/valve structure, cell-free antibodies and mRNAs can be removed completely for highly accurate detection (R= 0.96) of protein copies. The picoliter reaction chambers allow high detection sensitivity for both mRNA transcripts and protein copies and low sequencing cost. Using multi-Paired-seq, three clusters of known breast cancer cell types are identified according to multimodal measurements, and the expression correlations between mRNAs and proteins under altered conditions are quantified. Multi-Paired-seq provides multimodal measurements at the single-cell level, which offers a new tool for cell biology, developmental biology, drug discovery, and precision medicine.",35650660,,10.1021/acs.analchem.1c05312,3,Analytical chemistry,370536,8.008,0.3850277364253998,0.3277591973244147,0.4916387959866221,0.39489624051744726
Cell type discovery using single-cell transcriptomics: implications for ontological representation,"Cells are fundamental function units of multicellular organisms, with different cell types playing distinct physiological roles in the body. The recent advent of single-cell transcriptional profiling using RNA sequencing is producing 'big data', enabling the identification of novel human cell types at an unprecedented rate. In this review, we summarize recent work characterizing cell types in the human central nervous and immune systems using single-cell and single-nuclei RNA sequencing, and discuss the implications that these discoveries are having on the representation of cell types in the reference Cell Ontology (CL). We propose a method, based on random forest machine learning, for identifying sets of necessary and sufficient marker genes, which can be used to assemble consistent and reproducible cell type definitions for incorporation into the CL. The representation of defined cell type classes and their relationships in the CL using this strategy will make the cell type classes being identified by high-throughput/high-content technologies findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR), allowing the CL to serve as a reference knowledgebase of information about the role that distinct cellular phenotypes play in human health and disease.",29590361,PMC5946857,10.1093/hmg/ddy100,32,Human molecular genetics,9208958,5.121,0.3849699795246124,0.6722408026755853,0.2909698996655518,0.42362412818299483
Single-cell and spatial transcriptomics enables probabilistic inference of cell type topography,"The field of spatial transcriptomics is rapidly expanding, and with it the repertoire of available technologies. However, several of the transcriptome-wide spatial assays do not operate on a single cell level, but rather produce data comprised of contributions from a - potentially heterogeneous - mixture of cells. Still, these techniques are attractive to use when examining complex tissue specimens with diverse cell populations, where complete expression profiles are required to properly capture their richness. Motivated by an interest to put gene expression into context and delineate the spatial arrangement of cell types within a tissue, we here present a model-based probabilistic method that uses single cell data to deconvolve the cell mixtures in spatial data. To illustrate the capacity of our method, we use data from different experimental platforms and spatially map cell types from the mouse brain and developmental heart, which arrange as expected.",33037292,PMC7547664,10.1038/s42003-020-01247-y,150,Communications biology,101719179,6.548,0.38468092679977417,0.9230769230769231,0.35785953177257523,0.48699584704976423
Transcriptional profiling of single fiber cells in a transgenic paradigm of an inherited childhood cataract reveals absence of molecular heterogeneity,"Our recent single-cell transcriptomic analysis has demonstrated that heterogeneous transcriptional activity attends molecular transition from the nascent to terminally differentiated fiber cells in the developing mouse lens. To understand the role of transcriptional heterogeneity in terminal differentiation and the functional phenotype (transparency) of this tissue, here we present a single-cell analysis of the developing lens, in a transgenic paradigm of an inherited pathology, known as the lamellar cataract. Cataracts hinder transmission of light into the eye. Lamellar cataract is the most prevalent bilateral childhood cataract. In this disease of early infancy, initially, the opacities remain confined to a few fiber cells, thus presenting an opportunity to investigate early molecular events that lead to cataractogenesis. We used a previously established paradigm that faithfully recapitulates this disease in transgenic mice. About 500 single fiber cells, manually isolated from a 2-day-old transgenic lens were interrogated individually for the expression of all known 17 crystallins and 78 other relevant genes using a Biomark HD (Fluidigm). We find that fiber cells from spatially and developmentally discrete regions of the transgenic (cataract) lens show remarkable absence of the heterogeneity of gene expression. Importantly, the molecular variability of cortical fiber cells, the hallmark of the WT lens, is absent in the transgenic cataract, suggesting absence of specific cell-type(s). Interestingly, we find a repetitive pattern of gene activity in progressive states of differentiation in the transgenic lens. This molecular dysfunction portends pathology much before the physical manifestations of the disease.",31243103,PMC6746439,10.1074/jbc.RA119.008853,4,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,0.0,0.3843342959880829,0.3879598662207358,0.07023411371237458,0.3222393735794718
PhyloVelo enhances transcriptomic velocity field mapping using monotonically expressed genes,"Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a powerful approach for studying cellular differentiation, but accurately tracking cell fate transitions can be challenging, especially in disease conditions. Here we introduce PhyloVelo, a computational framework that estimates the velocity of transcriptomic dynamics by using monotonically expressed genes (MEGs) or genes with expression patterns that either increase or decrease, but do not cycle, through phylogenetic time. Through integration of scRNA-seq data with lineage information, PhyloVelo identifies MEGs and reconstructs a transcriptomic velocity field. We validate PhyloVelo using simulated data and Caenorhabditis elegans ground truth data, successfully recovering linear, bifurcated and convergent differentiations. Applying PhyloVelo to seven lineage-traced scRNA-seq datasets, generated using CRISPR-Cas9 editing, lentiviral barcoding or immune repertoire profiling, demonstrates its high accuracy and robustness in inferring complex lineage trajectories while outperforming RNA velocity. Additionally, we discovered that MEGs across tissues and organisms share similar functions in translation and ribosome biogenesis.",37524958,,10.1038/s41587-023-01887-5,3,Nature biotechnology,9604648,68.164,0.3830641508102417,0.3311036789297659,0.9732441471571907,0.4907080557035363
scTPA: a web tool for single-cell transcriptome analysis of pathway activation signatures,"Motivation:At present, a fundamental challenge in single-cell RNA-sequencing data analysis is functional interpretation and annotation of cell clusters. Biological pathways in distinct cell types have different activation patterns, which facilitates the understanding of cell functions using single-cell transcriptomics. However, no effective web tool has been implemented for single-cell transcriptome data analysis based on prior biological pathway knowledge.Results:Here, we present scTPA, a web-based platform for pathway-based analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data in human and mouse. scTPA incorporates four widely-used gene set enrichment methods to estimate the pathway activation scores of single cells based on a collection of available biological pathways with different functional and taxonomic classifications. The clustering analysis and cell-type-specific activation pathway identification were provided for the functional interpretation of cell types from a pathway-oriented perspective. An intuitive interface allows users to conveniently visualize and download single-cell pathway signatures. Overall, scTPA is a comprehensive tool for the identification of pathway activation signatures for the analysis of single cell heterogeneity.Availability and implementation:http://sctpa.bio-data.cn/sctpa.Contact:sujz@wmu.edu.cn or yufulong421@gmail.com or zgj@zjut.edu.cn.Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",32437538,,10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa532,19,"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",9808944,6.931,0.38191086053848267,0.6120401337792643,0.4180602006688963,0.4351665832127217
Analysis of single-cell transcriptomes links enrichment of olfactory receptors with cancer cell differentiation status and prognosis,"Ectopically expressed olfactory receptors (ORs) have been linked with multiple clinically-relevant physiological processes. Previously used tissue-level expression estimation largely shadowed the potential role of ORs due to their overall low expression levels. Even after the introduction of the single-cell transcriptomics, a comprehensive delineation of expression dynamics of ORs in tumors remained unexplored. Our targeted investigation into single malignant cells revealed a complex landscape of combinatorial OR expression events. We observed differentiation-dependent decline in expressed OR counts per cell as well as their expression intensities in malignant cells. Further, we constructed expression signatures based on a large spectrum of ORs and tracked their enrichment in bulk expression profiles of tumor samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). TCGA tumor samples stratified based on OR-centric signatures exhibited divergent survival probabilities. In summary, our comprehensive analysis positions ORs at the cross-road of tumor cell differentiation status and cancer prognosis.",32917933,PMC7486295,10.1038/s42003-020-01232-5,8,Communications biology,101719179,6.548,0.38173800706863403,0.47491638795986624,0.3612040133779264,0.396266884508739
Single-cell RNA-sequencing reports growth-condition-specific global transcriptomes of individual bacteria,"Bacteria respond to changes in their environment with specific transcriptional programmes, but even within genetically identical populations these programmes are not homogenously expressed1. Such transcriptional heterogeneity between individual bacteria allows genetically clonal communities to develop a complex array of phenotypes1, examples of which include persisters that resist antibiotic treatment and metabolically specialized cells that emerge under nutrient-limiting conditions2. Fluorescent reporter constructs have played a pivotal role in deciphering heterogeneous gene expression within bacterial populations3but have been limited to recording the activity of single genes in a few genetically tractable model species, whereas the vast majority of bacteria remain difficult to engineer and/or even to cultivate. Single-cell transcriptomics is revolutionizing the analysis of phenotypic cell-to-cell variation in eukaryotes, but technical hurdles have prevented its robust application to prokaryotes. Here, using an improved poly(A)-independent single-cell RNA-sequencing protocol, we report the faithful capture of growth-dependent gene expression patterns in individual Salmonella and Pseudomonas bacteria across all RNA classes and genomic regions. These transcriptomes provide important reference points for single-cell RNA-sequencing of other bacterial species, mixed microbial communities and host-pathogen interactions.",32807892,,10.1038/s41564-020-0774-1,69,Nature microbiology,101674869,30.964,0.37983831763267517,0.8260869565217391,0.8862876254180602,0.570377906967565
Identifying Subpopulations of Cells in Single-Cell Transcriptomic Data: A Bayesian Mixture Modeling Approach to Zero Inflation of Counts,"In the study of single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-Seq) data, a key component of the analysis is to identify subpopulations of cells in the data. A variety of approaches to this have been considered, and although many machine learning-based methods have been developed, these rarely give an estimate of uncertainty in the cluster assignment. To allow for this, probabilistic models have been developed, but scRNA-Seq data exhibit a phenomenon known as dropout, whereby a large proportion of the observed read counts are zero. This poses challenges in developing probabilistic models that appropriately model the data. We develop a novel Dirichlet process mixture model that employs both a mixture at the cell level to model multiple populations of cells and a zero-inflated negative binomial mixture of counts at the transcript level. By taking a Bayesian approach, we are able to model the expression of genes within clusters, and to quantify uncertainty in cluster assignments. It is shown that this approach outperforms previous approaches that applied multinomial distributions to model scRNA-Seq counts and negative binomial models that do not take into account zero inflation. Applied to a publicly available data set of scRNA-Seq counts of multiple cell types from the mouse cortex and hippocampus, we demonstrate how our approach can be used to distinguish subpopulations of cells as clusters in the data, and to identify gene sets that are indicative of membership of a subpopulation.",37871291,,10.1089/cmb.2022.0273,0,Journal of computational biology : a journal of computational molecular cell,9433358,1.549,0.3794933557510376,0.12374581939799331,0.12374581939799331,0.27719434120981984
Single-cell transcriptome study in forensic medicine: prospective applications,"Next-generation sequencing and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies have advanced rapidly in recent years. scRNA-seq reveals the unique gene expression of each cell type, providing directions for exploring cell heterogeneity, cell type-specific responses to injury/disease, and the mechanisms underlying these processes. The development of sequencing technology and improved sequencing throughput have brought about a revolution in single-cell transcriptome study, bringing great benefits to the fields of medicine and biomedical science. From our perspective, certain issues in forensic medicine may potentially be addressed using single-cell transcriptome studies; however, this powerful technique has not yet attracted sufficient attention in forensic medicine-associated research. Therefore, examining and reviewing the latest developments and applications of single-cell transcriptome studies, we present our views on the future directions of forensic research using this technology, aiming to expand the frontiers of forensic science.",36083564,,10.1007/s00414-022-02889-9,1,International journal of legal medicine,9101456,2.791,0.37920594215393066,0.22408026755852842,0.14046822742474915,0.3004332642890139
Neural cell diversity in the light of single-cell transcriptomics,"The development of highly parallel and affordable high-throughput single-cell transcriptomics technologies has revolutionized our understanding of brain complexity. These methods have been used to build cellular maps of the brain, its different regions, and catalog the diversity of cells in each of them during development, aging and even in disease. Now we know that cellular diversity is way beyond what was previously thought. Single-cell transcriptomics analyses have revealed that cell types previously considered homogeneous based on imaging techniques differ depending on several factors including sex, age and location within the brain. The expression profiles of these cells have also been exploited to understand which are the regulatory programs behind cellular diversity and decipher the transcriptional pathways driving them. In this review, we summarize how single-cell transcriptomics have changed our view on the cellular diversity in the human brain, and how it could impact the way we study neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, we describe the new computational approaches that can be used to study cellular differentiation and gain insight into the functions of individual cell populations under different conditions and their alterations in disease.",38229529,PMC10807474,10.1080/21541264.2023.2295044,1,Transcription,101530967,0.0,0.3791484832763672,0.22742474916387959,0.07357859531772576,0.2876897588621414
Single-cell transcriptomic analysis reveals genome evolution in predatory litostomatean ciliates,"Many ciliated protists prey on other large microbial organisms, including other protists and microscopic metazoans. The ciliate class Litostomatea unites both predatory and endosymbiotic species. The evolution of predation ability in ciliates remains poorly understood, in part, due to a lack of genomic data. To fill this gap, we acquired the transcriptome profiles of six predatory litostomateans using single-cell sequencing technology and investigated their transcriptomic features. Our results show that: (1) in contrast to non-predatory ciliates, the predatory litostomateans have expanded gene families associated with transmembrane activity and reactive oxidative stress response pathways, potentially as a result of cellular behaviors such as fast contraction and extension; (2) the expansion of the calcium-activated BK potassium channel gene family, which hypothetically regulates cell contractility, is an ancient evolutionary event for the class Litostomatea, suggesting a rewired metabolism associated with the hunting behavior of predatory ciliates; and (3) three whole genome duplication (WGD) events have been detected in litostomateans, with genes associated with biosynthetic processes, transmembrane activity, and calcium-activated potassium channel activity being retained during the WGD events. In addition, we explored the evolutionary relationships among 17 ciliate species, including eight litostomateans, and provided a rich foundational dataset for future in-depth phylogenomic studies of Litostomatea. Our comprehensive analyses suggest that the rewired cellular metabolism via expanded gene families and WGD events might be the potential genetic basis for the predation ability of raptorial ciliates.",38368736,,10.1016/j.ejop.2024.126062,0,European journal of protistology,8917383,3.471,0.3791484832763672,0.12709030100334448,0.18729096989966554,0.2903653441464223
Elucidating memory in the brain via single-cell transcriptomics,"Elucidating the neural mechanisms of memory in the brain is a central goal of neuroscience. Here, we discuss modern-day transcriptomics methodologies, and how they are well-poised to revolutionize our insight into memory mechanisms at unprecedented resolution and throughput. Focusing on the hippocampus and amygdala, two regions extensively examined in memory research, we show how single-cell transcriptomics technologies have been leveraged to understand the naÃ¯ve state of these brain regions. Building upon this foundation, we show that these technologies can be applied to single-trial learning paradigms to comprehensively identify molecules and cells that participate in the encoding and retrieval of memory. Transcriptomics also provides an opportunity to understand the cell-type organization of the human hippocampus and amygdala, and due to conservation of these brain regions between humans and rodents, to infer behavioral and causal contributions in the human brain by leveraging rodent cell-type homologies and interventions. Ultimately, such transcriptomic technologies are poised to usher in a qualitatively novel understanding of memory in the brain.",33230878,,10.1111/jnc.15250,4,Journal of neurochemistry,2985190R,0.0,0.3790910243988037,0.391304347826087,0.07692307692307693,0.321100099589115
Single-cell transcriptomes reveal characteristic features of human pancreatic islet cell types,"Pancreatic islets of Langerhans contain several specialized endocrine cell types, which are commonly identified by the expression of single marker genes. However, the established marker genes cannot capture the complete spectrum of cellular heterogeneity in human pancreatic islets, and existing bulk transcriptome datasets provide averages across several cell populations. To dissect the cellular composition of the human pancreatic islet and to establish transcriptomes for all major cell types, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing on 70 cells sorted from human primary tissue. We used this dataset to validate previously described marker genes at the single-cell level and to identify specifically expressed transcription factors for all islet cell subtypes. All data are available for browsing and download, thus establishing a useful resource of single-cell expression profiles for endocrine cells in human pancreatic islets.",26691212,PMC4784001,10.15252/embr.201540946,122,EMBO reports,100963049,9.071,0.3788611888885498,0.9063545150501672,0.5351170568561873,0.5156110277144008
Single-cell transcriptomics dissects the transcriptome alterations of hematopoietic stem cells in myelodysplastic neoplasms,"Background:Myelodysplastic neoplasms (MDS) are myeloid neoplasms characterized by disordered differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells and a predisposition to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The underline pathogenesis remains unclear.Methods:In this study, the trajectory of differentiation and mechanisms of leukemic transformation were explored through bioinformatics analysis of single-cell RNA-Seq data from hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) in MDS patients.Results:Among the HSPC clusters, the proportion of common myeloid progenitor (CMP) was the main cell cluster in the patients with excess blasts (EB)/ secondary AML. Cell cycle analysis indicated the CMP of MDS patients were in an active proliferative state. The genes involved in the cell proliferation, such as MAML3 and PLCB1, were up-regulated in MDS CMP. Further validation analysis indicated that the expression levels of MAML3 and PLCB1 in patients with MDS-EB were significantly higher than those without EB. Patients with high expression of PLCB1 had a higher risk of transformation to AML. PLCB1 inhibitor can suppress proliferation, induce cell cycle arrest, and activate apoptosis of leukemic cells in vitro.Conclusion:This study revealed the transcriptomic change of HSPCs in MDS patients along the pseudotime and indicated that PLCB1 plays a key role in the transformation of MDS into leukemia.",38632656,PMC11022353,10.1186/s12967-024-05165-z,0,Journal of translational medicine,101190741,8.44,0.37811458110809326,0.13043478260869565,0.4983277591973244,0.35262125702605995
Spatially resolved transcriptomic profiling of placental development in dairy cow,"The placenta plays a crucial role in successful mammalian reproduction. Ruminant animals possess a semi-invasive placenta characterized by a highly vascularized structure formed by maternal endometrial caruncles and fetal placental cotyledons, essential for full-term fetal development. The cow placenta harbors at least two trophoblast cell populations: uninucleate (UNC) and binucleate (BNC) cells. However, the limited capacity to elucidate the transcriptomic dynamics of the placental natural environment has resulted in a poor understanding of both the molecular and cellular interactions between trophoblast cells and niches, and the molecular mechanisms governing trophoblast differentiation and functionalization. To fill this knowledge gap, we employed Stereo-seq to map spatial gene expression patterns at near single-cell resolution in the cow placenta at 90 and 130 days of gestation, attaining high-resolution, spatially resolved gene expression profiles. Based on clustering and cell marker gene expression analyses, key transcription factors, including YBX1 and NPAS2, were shown to regulate the heterogeneity of trophoblast cell subpopulations. Cell communication and trajectory analysis provided a framework for understanding cell-cell interactions and the differentiation of trophoblasts into BNCs in the placental microenvironment. Differential analysis of cell trajectories identified a set of genes involved in regulation of trophoblast differentiation. Additionally, spatial modules and co-variant genes that help shape specific tissue structures were identified. Together, these findings provide foundational insights into important biological pathways critical to the placental development and function in cows.",38766743,,10.24272/j.issn.2095-8137.2023.205,0,Zoological research,101697192,0.0,0.37794238328933716,0.13377926421404682,0.0802675585284281,0.26957479452209726
Comprehensive Integration of Single-Cell Data,"Single-cell transcriptomics has transformed our ability to characterize cell states, but deep biological understanding requires more than a taxonomic listing of clusters. As new methods arise to measure distinct cellular modalities, a key analytical challenge is to integrate these datasets to better understand cellular identity and function. Here, we develop a strategy to ""anchor"" diverse datasets together, enabling us to integrate single-cell measurements not only across scRNA-seq technologies, but also across different modalities. After demonstrating improvement over existing methods for integrating scRNA-seq data, we anchor scRNA-seq experiments with scATAC-seq to explore chromatin differences in closely related interneuron subsets and project protein expression measurements onto a bone marrow atlas to characterize lymphocyte populations. Lastly, we harmonize in situ gene expression and scRNA-seq datasets, allowing transcriptome-wide imputation of spatial gene expression patterns. Our work presents a strategy for the assembly of harmonized references and transfer of information across datasets.",31178118,PMC6687398,10.1016/j.cell.2019.05.031,5862,Cell,413066,66.85,0.3775406777858734,1.0,0.9565217391304348,0.617828754497611
A single-cell transcriptomic atlas characterizes cell types and their molecular features in yak ovarian cortex,"The ovary as one of the most dynamic organs produces steroids to orchestrate female secondary sexual characteristics, harbors ovarian reserve for oocytes, releases mature oocytes for fertilization, and maintains pregnancy. Yak (Bos grunniens) is the only bovid animal that can adapt to the harsh climatic conditions on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (altitudes of over 3000 m above sea level). However, the cellular atlas is composed of oocytes and other somatic cells, and their individual molecular characteristics remain to be elucidated in the yak ovary. Here, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was performed to delineate the molecular signature of various cell types in the yak ovarian cortex. A cellular atlas of yak ovarian cortex was constructed successfully on the basis of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from the distinct cell types and their functional enrichment analysis, comprising endothelial cells, nature kill cells, stromal cells, smooth muscle cells, oocytes, macrophages, epithelial cells, and granulosa cells. Meanwhile, the signature genes were determined based on their expression specificity in each cell type. A cell-to-cell communication network was built in light of the differentially overexpressed ligand and receptor genes from each cell type. Further, the oocytes were subdivided into four subtypes based on their individual DEGs and the functional enrichment of the DEGs. FST and TOP2A were identified as maker genes for oocytes by immunostaining in the yak ovarian cortex. The cellular atlas reveals the biological characteristics of the ovarian cortex at the cellular molecular level and provides insights into female reproductive biology via cellular communications in the yak.",36527406,,10.1096/fj.202201176RR,4,FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for,8804484,5.834,0.37605008482933044,0.39464882943143814,0.3110367892976589,0.3667671746434177
Identifying cell populations with scRNASeq,"Single-cell RNASeq (scRNASeq) has emerged as a powerful method for quantifying the transcriptome of individual cells. However, the data from scRNASeq experiments is often both noisy and high dimensional, making the computational analysis non-trivial. Here we provide an overview of different experimental protocols and the most popular methods for facilitating the computational analysis. We focus on approaches for identifying biologically important genes, projecting data into lower dimensions and clustering data into putative cell-populations. Finally we discuss approaches to validation and biological interpretation of the identified cell-types or cell-states.",28712804,,10.1016/j.mam.2017.07.002,97,Molecular aspects of medicine,7603128,16.337,0.37570643424987793,0.8862876254180602,0.7123745819397993,0.5451563020214987
Single cell transcriptome sequencing of stimulated and frozen human peripheral blood mononuclear cells,"Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are blood cells that are a critical part of the immune system used to fight off infection, defending our bodies from harmful pathogens. In biomedical research, PBMCs are commonly used to study global immune response to disease outbreak and progression, pathogen infections, for vaccine development and a multitude of other clinical applications. Over the past few years, the revolution in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has enabled an unbiased quantification of gene expression in thousands of individual cells, which provides a more efficient tool to decipher the immune system in human diseases. In this work, we generate scRNA-seq data from human PBMCs at high sequencing depth (>100,000 reads/cell) for more than 30,000 cells, in resting, stimulated, fresh and frozen conditions. The data generated can be used for benchmarking batch correction and data integration methods, and to study the effect of freezing-thawing cycles on the quality of immune cell populations and their transcriptomic profiles.",37414801,PMC10326076,10.1038/s41597-023-02348-z,1,Scientific data,101640192,8.501,0.37570643424987793,0.23076923076923078,0.5050167224080268,0.37258105118537826
The Conjugation of Antibodies for the Simultaneous Detection of Surface Proteins and Transcriptome Analysis at a Single-Cell Level,"Transcriptome analysis at a single-cell level with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a powerful method for detailed characterization of heterogeneous cell populations.

Pathway centric analysis for single-cell RNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics data with GSDensity,"Advances in single-cell technology have enabled molecular dissection of heterogeneous biospecimens at unprecedented scales and resolutions. Cluster-centric approaches are widely applied in analyzing single-cell data, however they have limited power in dissecting and interpreting highly heterogenous, dynamically evolving data. Here, we present GSDensity, a graph-modeling approach that allows users to obtain pathway-centric interpretation and dissection of single-cell and spatial transcriptomics (ST) data without performing clustering. Using pathway gene sets, we show that GSDensity can accurately detect biologically distinct cells and reveal novel cell-pathway associations ignored by existing methods. Moreover, GSDensity, combined with trajectory analysis can identify curated pathways that are active at various stages of mouse brain development. Finally, GSDensity can identify spatially relevant pathways in mouse brains and human tumors including those following high-order organizational patterns in the ST data. Particularly, we create a pan-cancer ST map revealing spatially relevant and recurrently active pathways across six different tumor types.",38110427,PMC10728201,10.1038/s41467-023-44206-x,2,Nature communications,101528555,17.694,0.37421879172325134,0.2809364548494983,0.7692307692307693,0.43456471985000433

Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Reveals Molecular Features of Heterogeneity in the Murine Retinal Pigment Epithelium,"Transcriptomic analysis of the mammalian retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) aims to identify cellular networks that influence ocular development, maintenance, function, and disease. However, available evidence points to RPE cell heterogeneity within native tissue, which adds complexity to global transcriptomic analysis. Here, to assess cell heterogeneity, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of RPE cells from two young adult male C57BL/6J mice. Following quality control to ensure robust transcript identification limited to cell singlets, we detected 13,858 transcripts among 2667 and 2846 RPE cells. Dimensional reduction by principal component analysis and uniform manifold approximation and projection revealed six distinct cell populations. All clusters expressed transcripts typical of RPE cells; the smallest (C1, containing 1-2% of total cells) exhibited the hallmarks of stem and/or progenitor (SP) cells. Placing C1-6 along a pseudotime axis suggested a relative decrease in melanogenesis and SP gene expression and a corresponding increase in visual cycle gene expression upon RPE maturation. K-means clustering of all detected transcripts identified additional expression patterns that may advance the understanding of RPE SP cell maintenance and the evolution of cellular metabolic networks during development. This work provides new insights into the transcriptome of the mouse RPE and a baseline for identifying experimentally induced transcriptional changes in future studies of this tissue.",36142331,PMC9499471,10.3390/ijms231810419,3,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,6.208,0.37307608127593994,0.33444816053511706,0.3377926421404682,0.358293809300681
Stomach encyclopedia: Combined single-cell and spatial transcriptomics reveal cell diversity and homeostatic regulation of human stomach,"The stomach is an important digestive organ with various biological functions. However, because of the complexity of its cellular and glandular composition, its precise cellular biology has yet to be elucidated. In this study, we conducted single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and subcellular-level spatial transcriptomics analysis of the human stomach and constructed the largest dataset to date: a stomach encyclopedia. This dataset consists of approximately 380,000 cells from scRNA-seq and the spatial transcriptome, enabling integrated analyses of transcriptional and spatial information of gastric and metaplastic cells. This analysis identified LEFTY1 as an uncharacterized stem cell marker, which was confirmed through lineage tracing analysis. A wide variety of cell-cell interactions between epithelial and stromal cells, including PDGFRA+BMP4+WNT5A+fibroblasts, was highlighted in the developmental switch of intestinal metaplasia. Our extensive dataset will function as a fundamental resource in investigations of the stomach, including studies of development, aging, and carcinogenesis.",37819756,,10.1016/j.celrep.2023.113236,2,Cell reports,101573691,9.995,0.37307608127593994,0.2842809364548495,0.5785953177257525,0.39642089960168436

Single Cell RNA-Seq: Cell Isolation and Data Analysis,"Single-cell RNA-sequencing technologies have revolutionized the way that researchers can interrogate cellular relationships and the level of detail by which tissue architecture can be characterized. Multiple cell capturing methods have been developed that, when coupled to next-generation sequencing, can yield cell-to-cell specific information regarding gene expression profiles. One of the commonalities between all of the cell capturing techniques to succeed is the necessity to submit samples with a high cell viability. In addition, these cells should have undergone minimal processing to limit induced stress responses so that their transcriptomes, when sequenced, closely reflect their transcriptomes in vivo at the time of isolation. Below we present a streamlined protocol to isolate fresh cells from tissues in vivo. We also share extensive notes to highlight considerations researchers should take into account before beginning their cell isolation protocol.",34913118,,10.1007/978-1-0716-1847-9_7,2,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,0.0,0.37159261107444763,0.28762541806020064,0.08695652173913043,0.2978719546045348

The need to reassess single-cell RNA sequencing datasets: the importance of biological sample processing,"Background:The advent of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) and additional single-cell omics technologies have provided scientists with unprecedented tools to explore biology at cellular resolution. However, reaching an appropriate number of good quality reads per cell and reasonable numbers of cells within each of the populations of interest are key to infer relevant conclusions about the underlying biology of the dataset. For these reasons, scRNAseq studies are constantly increasing the number of cells analysed and the granularity of the resultant transcriptomics analyses.Methods:We aimed to identify previously described fibroblast subpopulations in healthy adult human skin by using the largest dataset published to date (528,253 sequenced cells) and an unsupervised population-matching algorithm.Results:Our reanalysis of this landmark resource demonstrates that a substantial proportion of cell transcriptomic signatures may be biased by cellular stress and response to hypoxic conditions.Conclusions:We postulate that careful design of experimental conditions is needed to avoid long processing times of biological samples. Additionally, computation of large datasets might undermine the extent of the analysis, possibly due to long processing times.",35399227,PMC8984215,10.12688/f1000research.54864.2,6,F1000Research,101594320,0.0,0.3714786171913147,0.4280936454849498,0.0903010033444816,0.3265661000806751
[Application of single-cell transcriptome sequencing in mechanistic toxicology],"Traditional bulk RNA sequencing assesses the average expression level of genes in tissues rather than the differences in cellular responses. Accordingly, it is hard to differentiate sensitive responding cells, leading to inaccurate identification of toxicity pathways. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) isolated single cells from tissue and subjected them to cell subtypes-specific transcriptome analysis. This technique in toxicological studies realizes the heterogeneous cellular responses in the tissue microenvironment upon chemical exposure. Thus it helps to identify sensitive responding cells and key molecular events, providing a powerful tool and a new perspective for exploring the mechanisms of toxicity and the modes of action. This review summarizes the development, principle, method, application and limitations of scRNA-seq in mechanistic toxicological researches, and discusses the prospect of multi-directional applications.",35092987,,10.3760/cma.j.cn112150-20210513-00469,0,Zhonghua yu fang yi xue za zhi [Chinese journal of preventive medicine],7904962,0.0,0.3711366057395935,0.14046822742474915,0.09364548494983277,0.2695047059186725
Single cell transcriptome profiling of the human alcohol-dependent brain,"Alcoholism remains a prevalent health concern throughout the world. Previous studies have identified transcriptomic patterns in the brain associated with alcohol dependence in both humans and animal models. But none of these studies have systematically investigated expression within the unique cell types present in the brain. We utilized single nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) to examine the transcriptomes of over 16 000 nuclei isolated from the prefrontal cortex of alcoholic and control individuals. Each nucleus was assigned to one of seven major cell types by unsupervised clustering. Cell type enrichment patterns varied greatly among neuroinflammatory-related genes, which are known to play roles in alcohol dependence and neurodegeneration. Differential expression analysis identified cell type-specific genes with altered expression in alcoholics. The largest number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), including both protein-coding and non-coding, were detected in astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and microglia. To our knowledge, this is the first single cell transcriptome analysis of alcohol-associated gene expression in any species and the first such analysis in humans for any addictive substance. These findings greatly advance the understanding of transcriptomic changes in the brain of alcohol-dependent individuals.",32142123,PMC7206851,10.1093/hmg/ddaa038,43,Human molecular genetics,9208958,5.121,0.36886027455329895,0.7290969899665551,0.29431438127090304,0.425998438979471
An optimized workflow for single-cell transcriptomics and repertoire profiling of purified lymphocytes from clinical samples,"Establishing clinically relevant single-cell (SC) transcriptomic workflows from cryopreserved tissue is essential to move this emerging immune monitoring technology from the bench to the bedside. Improper sample preparation leads to detrimental cascades, resulting in loss of precious time, money and finally compromised data. There is an urgent need to establish protocols specifically designed to overcome the inevitable variations in sample quality resulting from uncontrollable factors in a clinical setting. Here, we explore sample preparation techniques relevant to a range of clinically relevant scenarios, where SC gene expression and repertoire analysis are applied to a cryopreserved sample derived from a small amount of blood, with unknown or partially known preservation history. We compare a total of ten cell-counting, viability-improvement, and lymphocyte-enrichment methods to highlight a number of unexpected findings. Trypan blue-based automated counters, typically recommended for single-cell sample quantitation, consistently overestimate viability. Advanced sample clean-up procedures significantly impact total cell yield, while only modestly increasing viability. Finally, while pre-enrichment of B cells from whole peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) results in the most reliable BCR repertoire data, comparable T-cell enrichment strategies distort the ratio of CD4+ and CD8+ cells. Furthermore, we provide high-resolution analysis of gene expression and clonotype repertoire of different B cell subtypes. Together these observations provide both qualitative and quantitative sample preparation guidelines that increase the chances of obtaining high-quality single-cell transcriptomic and repertoire data from human PBMCs in a variety of clinical settings.",32042039,PMC7010687,10.1038/s41598-020-58939-y,14,Scientific reports,101563288,4.996,0.36840569972991943,0.5585284280936454,0.27759197324414714,0.38826750010551014
Single-cell transcriptome conservation in cryopreserved cells and tissues,"A variety of single-cell RNA preparation procedures have been described. So far, protocols require fresh material, which hinders complex study designs. We describe a sample preservation method that maintains transcripts in viable single cells, allowing one to disconnect time and place of sampling from subsequent processing steps. We sequence single-cell transcriptomes from >1000 fresh and cryopreserved cells using 3'-end and full-length RNA preparation methods. Our results confirm that the conservation process did not alter transcriptional profiles. This substantially broadens the scope of applications in single-cell transcriptomics and could lead to a paradigm shift in future study designs.",28249587,PMC5333448,10.1186/s13059-017-1171-9,87,Genome biology,100960660,17.906,0.36829209327697754,0.8662207357859532,0.7993311036789298,0.5540856238591632
Slingshot: cell lineage and pseudotime inference for single-cell transcriptomics,"Background:Single-cell transcriptomics allows researchers to investigate complex communities of heterogeneous cells. It can be applied to stem cells and their descendants in order to chart the progression from multipotent progenitors to fully differentiated cells. While a variety of statistical and computational methods have been proposed for inferring cell lineages, the problem of accurately characterizing multiple branching lineages remains difficult to solve.Results:We introduce Slingshot, a novel method for inferring cell lineages and pseudotimes from single-cell gene expression data. In previously published datasets, Slingshot correctly identifies the biological signal for one to three branching trajectories. Additionally, our simulation study shows that Slingshot infers more accurate pseudotimes than other leading methods.Conclusions:Slingshot is a uniquely robust and flexible tool which combines the highly stable techniques necessary for noisy single-cell data with the ability to identify multiple trajectories.

Spatial Genomic Analysis: A Multiplexed Transcriptional Profiling Method that Reveals Subpopulations of Cells Within Intact Tissues,"Here, we present Spatial Genomic Analysis (SGA), a quantitative single-cell transcriptional profiling method that takes advantage of single-molecule imaging of individual transcripts for up to a hundred genes. SGA relies on a machine learning-based image analysis pipeline that performs cell segmentation and transcript counting in a robust way. SGA is suitable for various in situ applications and was originally developed to address heterogeneity in the neural crest, which is a transient embryonic stem cell population important for formation of various vertebrate body structures. After being specified as multipotent neural crest stem cells in the dorsal neural tube, they go through an epithelial to mesenchymal transition in order to migrate to different destinations around the body, and gradually turn from stem cells to progenitors prior to final commitment. The molecular details of this process remain largely unknown, and upon their emergence, the neural crest cells have been considered as a single homogeneous population. Technical limitations have restricted the possibility to parse the neural crest cell pool into subgroups according to multiplex gene expression properties. By using SGA, we were able to identify subgroups inside the neural crest niche in the dorsal neural tube. The high sensitivity of the method allows detection of low expression levels and we were able to determine factors not previously shown to be present in neural crest stem cells, such as pluripotency or lineage markers. Finally, SGA analysis also provides prediction of gene relationships within individual cells, and thus has broad utility for powerful transcriptome analyses in original biological contexts.",30194538,PMC8014251,10.1007/7651_2018_188,4,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,0.0,0.3677242696285248,0.3979933110367893,0.09698996655518395,0.3196312172955095
Single-cell transcriptomic architecture and cellular communication circuits of parametrial adipose tissue in pregnant mice,"Aims:The activity and interactions of cellular subpopulations in the adipose tissue microenvironment are critical for the coordination of local and systemic adaptation during pregnancy. With a particular interest in parametrial adipose tissue (PmAT), single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) was utilized to unveil the gestative cellular composition and functional shift.Materials and methods:To identify cell-type-enriched transcriptome profiles, a total of 18,074 cells in adipose tissue were studied. The cell populations were cataloged, and signaling crosstalk between adipocytes and other composition factions via soluble and membrane-bound factors were evaluated.Key findings:A marked decline of pregnancy adipocytes and relative elevation of non-adipocyte fractions were observed. A subpopulation of adipocytes, Adipo_5, with unique properties in the response to estrogen and the embryonic processes involved in pregnancy, was defined. Interactome analysis revealed the potential contribution of PmAT to the establishment of maternal-fetal immune tolerance. During gestation, adipocytes shut down outgoing signaling, resulting in deterioration of the resistin-related incoming signaling network in B cells, which would therefore benefit tissue-specific maternal-fetal tolerance. Furthermore, a subpopulation of adipocytes, Aipo_2, was also considered to take part in a paradigm shift in the process of pregnancy-induced chemical stiffness-triggered vesicular remodeling via the THBS signaling pathway network.Significance:These data-derived findings will encourage investigation into the role of pregnant PmTA in pregnancy-related immunological, hypertensive and metabolic disorders, with the ultimate goal of establishing preventive strategies to mitigate these pregnancy-related health challenges. This translational aspect of our work holds significant promise for improving maternal and fetal well-being.",37907153,,10.1016/j.lfs.2023.122214,0,Life sciences,375521,6.78,0.36681652069091797,0.14381270903010032,0.3779264214046823,0.32443773850150726
Transcriptomic changes in single yeast cells under various stress conditions,"Background:The stress response of Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been extensively studied in the past decade. However, with the advent of recent technology in single-cell transcriptome profiling, there is a new opportunity to expand and further understanding of the yeast stress response with greater resolution on a system level. To understand transcriptomic changes in baker's yeast S. cerevisiae cells under stress conditions, we sequenced 117 yeast cells under three stress treatments (hypotonic condition, glucose starvation and amino acid starvation) using a full-length single-cell RNA-Seq method.Results:We found that though single cells from the same treatment showed varying degrees of uniformity, technical noise and batch effects can confound results significantly. However, upon careful selection of samples to reduce technical artifacts and account for batch-effects, we were able to capture distinct transcriptomic signatures for different stress conditions as well as putative regulatory relationships between transcription factors and target genes.Conclusion:Our results show that a full-length single-cell based transcriptomic analysis of the yeast may help paint a clearer picture of how the model organism responds to stress than do bulk cell population-based methods.",36829151,PMC9960639,10.1186/s12864-023-09184-w,0,BMC genomics,100965258,4.547,0.36624962091445923,0.14715719063545152,0.2508361204013378,0.2993484347560334
Multi-level cellular and functional annotation of single-cell transcriptomes using scPipeline,"Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) offers functional insight into complex biology, allowing for the interrogation of cellular populations and gene expression programs at single-cell resolution.

Single Cell Sequencing Analysis for Blood Tissue,"Single-cell sequencing is a technique based on sequencing genomic, transcriptomic and epigenomic analysis at the level of individual cells. Compared with traditional sequencing techniques, it can study intercellular heterogeneity and provide in-depth information on cell distribution, cell types and cell function of a specific population. This paper used blood tissue samples to analyze single-cell sequencing. Cells were downscaled by principal component analysis (PCA) and used Leiden clustering to discover cell heterogeneity in the same cluster and annotated after screening marker genes.

Gene-expression memory-based prediction of cell lineages from scRNA-seq datasets,"Assigning single cell transcriptomes to cellular lineage trees by lineage tracing has transformed our understanding of differentiation during development, regeneration, and disease. However, lineage tracing is technically demanding, often restricted in time-resolution, and most scRNA-seq datasets are devoid of lineage information. Here we introduce Gene Expression Memory-based Lineage Inference (GEMLI), a computational tool allowing to robustly identify small to medium-sized cell lineages solely from scRNA-seq datasets. GEMLI allows to study heritable gene expression, to discriminate symmetric and asymmetric cell fate decisions and to reconstruct individual multicellular structures from pooled scRNA-seq datasets. In human breast cancer biopsies, GEMLI reveals previously unknown gene expression changes at the onset of cancer invasiveness. The universal applicability of GEMLI allows studying the role of small cell lineages in a wide range of physiological and pathological contexts, notably in vivo. GEMLI is available as an R package on GitHub ( https://github.com/UPSUTER/GEMLI ).",38553478,PMC10980719,10.1038/s41467-024-47158-y,0,Nature communications,101528555,17.694,0.36579644680023193,0.15384615384615385,0.7725752508361204,0.404762149016594
Live Cell Genomics: Cell-Specific Transcriptome Capture in Live Tissues and Cells,"The sensitivity of new transcriptomic techniques is rapidly improving to the point that single-cell molecular analysis is now becoming commonplace. However to obtain accurate transcriptome data, the initial experimental steps must strive to maintain the natural environment of cell and always get set in motion under in vivo conditions. Achieving these critical experimental parameters is technically challenging for investigators and currently the most frequently used molecular techniques experimentally commence with tissues or cells in artificial environments or under in vitro conditions. Here we review an innovative experimental approach that is called transcriptome in vivo analysis (TIVA) that was designed to overcome theses well-known limitations. The TIVA methods permit cell-specific transcriptome capture from viable intact heterogeneous tissues. Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) are used to deliver multifunctional transcriptome-capture tags (TIVA tags) to the cytoplasm of the cell under in vivo conditions. The TIVA capture tag enables investigators to target and isolate cell-specific transcriptomes in their natural microenvironments. The combination of maintaining in vivo conditions and selective cell-specific transcriptome capture provides investigators with the opportunity to yield the most biologically accurate and informative transcriptome data hitherto.",26202288,,10.1007/978-1-4939-2806-4_30,3,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,0.0,0.3655698895454407,0.3411371237458194,0.10367892976588629,0.30830514442960555

scPower accelerates and optimizes the design of multi-sample single cell transcriptomic studies,"Single cell RNA-seq has revolutionized transcriptomics by providing cell type resolution for differential gene expression and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analyses. However, efficient power analysis methods for single cell data and inter-individual comparisons are lacking. Here, we present scPower; a statistical framework for the design and power analysis of multi-sample single cell transcriptomic experiments. We modelled the relationship between sample size, the number of cells per individual, sequencing depth, and the power of detecting differentially expressed genes within cell types. We systematically evaluated these optimal parameter combinations for several single cell profiling platforms, and generated broad recommendations. In general, shallow sequencing of high numbers of cells leads to higher overall power than deep sequencing of fewer cells.

"Exploratory bioinformatics investigation reveals importance of ""junk"" DNA in early embryo development","Background:Instead of testing predefined hypotheses, the goal of exploratory data analysis (EDA) is to find what data can tell us. Following this strategy, we re-analyzed a large body of genomic data to study the complex gene regulation in mouse pre-implantation development (PD).Results:Starting with a single-cell RNA-seq dataset consisting of 259 mouse embryonic cells derived from zygote to blastocyst stages, we reconstructed the temporal and spatial gene expression pattern during PD. The dynamics of gene expression can be partially explained by the enrichment of transposable elements in gene promoters and the similarity of expression profiles with those of corresponding transposons. Long Terminal Repeats (LTRs) are associated with transient, strong induction of many nearby genes at the 2-4 cell stages, probably by providing binding sites for Obox and other homeobox factors. B1 and B2 SINEs (Short Interspersed Nuclear Elements) are correlated with the upregulation of thousands of nearby genes during zygotic genome activation. Such enhancer-like effects are also found for human Alu and bovine tRNA SINEs. SINEs also seem to be predictive of gene expression in embryonic stem cells (ESCs), raising the possibility that they may also be involved in regulating pluripotency. We also identified many potential transcription factors underlying PD and discussed the evolutionary necessity of transposons in enhancing genetic diversity, especially for species with longer generation time.Conclusions:Together with other recent studies, our results provide further evidence that many transposable elements may play a role in establishing the expression landscape in early embryos. It also demonstrates that exploratory bioinformatics investigation can pinpoint developmental pathways for further study, and serve as a strategy to generate novel insights from big genomic data.",28231763,PMC5324221,10.1186/s12864-017-3566-0,25,BMC genomics,100965258,4.547,0.3640989661216736,0.6421404682274248,0.25418060200668896,0.3977235937198269

DIMM-SC: a Dirichlet mixture model for clustering droplet-based single cell transcriptomic data,"Motivation:Single cell transcriptome sequencing (scRNA-Seq) has become a revolutionary tool to study cellular and molecular processes at single cell resolution. Among existing technologies, the recently developed droplet-based platform enables efficient parallel processing of thousands of single cells with direct counting of transcript copies using Unique Molecular Identifier (UMI). Despite the technology advances, statistical methods and computational tools are still lacking for analyzing droplet-based scRNA-Seq data. Particularly, model-based approaches for clustering large-scale single cell transcriptomic data are still under-explored.Results:We developed DIMM-SC, a Dirichlet Mixture Model for clustering droplet-based Single Cell transcriptomic data. This approach explicitly models UMI count data from scRNA-Seq experiments and characterizes variations across different cell clusters via a Dirichlet mixture prior. We performed comprehensive simulations to evaluate DIMM-SC and compared it with existing clustering methods such as K-means, CellTree and Seurat. In addition, we analyzed public scRNA-Seq datasets with known cluster labels and in-house scRNA-Seq datasets from a study of systemic sclerosis with prior biological knowledge to benchmark and validate DIMM-SC. Both simulation studies and real data applications demonstrated that overall, DIMM-SC achieves substantially improved clustering accuracy and much lower clustering variability compared to other existing clustering methods. More importantly, as a model-based approach, DIMM-SC is able to quantify the clustering uncertainty for each single cell, facilitating rigorous statistical inference and biological interpretations, which are typically unavailable from existing clustering methods.Availability and implementation:DIMM-SC has been implemented in a user-friendly R package with a detailed tutorial available on www.pitt.edu/â¼wec47/singlecell.html.Contact:wei.chen@chp.edu or hum@ccf.org.Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",29036318,PMC6454475,10.1093/bioinformatics/btx490,24,"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",9808944,6.931,0.3591393828392029,0.6354515050167224,0.4214046822742475,0.4268548671617157

exFINDER: identify external communication signals using single-cell transcriptomics data,"Cells make decisions through their communication with other cells and receiving signals from their environment. Using single-cell transcriptomics, computational tools have been developed to infer cell-cell communication through ligands and receptors. However, the existing methods only deal with signals sent by the measured cells in the data, the received signals from the external system are missing in the inference. Here, we present exFINDER, a method that identifies such external signals received by the cells in the single-cell transcriptomics datasets by utilizing the prior knowledge of signaling pathways. In particular, exFINDER can uncover external signals that activate the given target genes, infer the external signal-target signaling network (exSigNet), and perform quantitative analysis on exSigNets. The applications of exFINDER to scRNA-seq datasets from different species demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of identifying external signals, revealing critical transition-related signaling activities, inferring critical external signals and targets, clustering signal-target paths, and evaluating relevant biological events.

From Bite to Byte: Dental Structures Resolved at a Single-Cell Resolution,"The systematic classification of the cells that compose a tissue or an organ is key to understanding how these cells cooperate and interact as a functional unit. Our capacity to detect features that define cell identity has evolved from morphological and chemical analyses, through the use of predefined genetic markers, to unbiased transcriptomic and epigenetic profiling. The innovative technology of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables transcriptional profiling of thousands of individual cells. Since its development, scRNA-seq has been extensively applied to numerous organs and tissues in a wide range of animal models and human samples, thereby providing a plethora of fundamental biological insights into their development, homeostasis, and pathology. In this review, we present the findings of 3 recent studies that employed scRNA-seq to unravel the complexity of cellular composition in mammalian teeth. These findings offer an unprecedented catalogue of cell types in the mouse incisor, which is a convenient model system for studying continuous tooth growth. These studies identified novel cell types in the tooth epithelium and mesenchyme, as well as new markers for known cell types. Computational analyses of the data also uncovered the lineage and dynamics of cell states during ameloblast and odontoblast differentiation during both normal homeostasis and injury repair. The transcriptional differences between the mouse incisor and mouse and human molars uncover species-specific as well as shared features in tooth cell composition. Here, we highlight these findings and discuss important similarities and differences between these studies. We also discuss potential future applications of scRNA-seq in dental research and dentistry.

Single-cell transcriptomes identify human islet cell signatures and reveal cell-type-specific expression changes in type 2 diabetes,"Blood glucose levels are tightly controlled by the coordinated action of at least four cell types constituting pancreatic islets. Changes in the proportion and/or function of these cells are associated with genetic and molecular pathophysiology of monogenic, type 1, and type 2 (T2D) diabetes. Cellular heterogeneity impedes precise understanding of the molecular components of each islet cell type that govern islet (dys)function, particularly the less abundant delta and gamma/pancreatic polypeptide (PP) cells. Here, we report single-cell transcriptomes for 638 cells from nondiabetic (ND) and T2D human islet samples. Analyses of ND single-cell transcriptomes identified distinct alpha, beta, delta, and PP/gamma cell-type signatures. Genes linked to rare and common forms of islet dysfunction and diabetes were expressed in the delta and PP/gamma cell types. Moreover, this study revealed that delta cells specifically express receptors that receive and coordinate systemic cues from the leptin, ghrelin, and dopamine signaling pathways implicating them as integrators of central and peripheral metabolic signals into the pancreatic islet. Finally, single-cell transcriptome profiling revealed genes differentially regulated between T2D and ND alpha, beta, and delta cells that were undetectable in paired whole islet analyses.

Here, we present ACME (ACetic-MEthanol), a dissociation approach for single-cell transcriptomics that simultaneously fixes cells. ACME-dissociated cells have high RNA integrity, can be cryopreserved multiple times, and are sortable and permeable. As a proof of principle, we provide single-cell transcriptomic data of different species, using both droplet-based and combinatorial barcoding single-cell methods. ACME uses affordable reagents, can be done in most laboratories and even in the field, and thus will accelerate our knowledge of cell types across the tree of life.",33827654,PMC8028764,10.1186/s13059-021-02302-5,26,Genome biology,100960660,17.906,0.35767972469329834,0.6488294314381271,0.8060200668896321,0.5055777344815309
ICAT: a novel algorithm to robustly identify cell states following perturbations in single-cell transcriptomes,"Motivation:The detection of distinct cellular identities is central to the analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) experiments. However, in perturbation experiments, current methods typically fail to correctly match cell states between conditions or erroneously remove population substructure. Here, we present the novel, unsupervised algorithm Identify Cell states Across Treatments (ICAT) that employs self-supervised feature weighting and control-guided clustering to accurately resolve cell states across heterogeneous conditions.Results:Using simulated and real datasets, we show ICAT is superior in identifying and resolving cell states compared with current integration workflows. While requiring no a priori knowledge of extant cell states or discriminatory marker genes, ICAT is robust to low signal strength, high perturbation severity, and disparate cell type proportions. We empirically validate ICAT in a developmental model and find that only ICAT identifies a perturbation-unique cellular response. Taken together, our results demonstrate that ICAT offers a significant improvement in defining cellular responses to perturbation in scRNA-seq data.Availability and implementation:https://github.com/BradhamLab/icat.",37086439,PMC10172037,10.1093/bioinformatics/btad278,1,"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",9808944,6.931,0.35644665360450745,0.23411371237458195,0.42474916387959866,0.3456405674135406
"Cell function and identity revealed by comparative scRNA-seq analysis in human nasal, bronchial and epididymis epithelia","The evolutionary relationship of cells within tissues having a similar function but located in different anatomical sites is of considerable biological interest. The development of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) protocols has greatly enhanced opportunities to address this topic. Here we focus on cells in the epithelium which lines two regions of the human respiratory tract and the male genital ducts to delineate the shared, differentiated functions of the different cell populations. Transcriptomic data were used to assess the gene expression profiles of human bronchial, nasal, and epididymal epithelium (HBE, HNE, and HEE). Bulk RNA-seq showed many shared genes expressed in cells from the nasal and bronchial epithelium and highlighted their divergence from the epididymal epithelium. ScRNA-seq in HBE and HNE cells demonstrated overlapping gene expression patterns within basal and secretory cell populations. Moreover, the distribution of cell types was altered in HNE cells derived from donors with cystic fibrosis (CF) when compared to cells from healthy donors. Next, the HBE and HNE datasets were merged and confirmed intersection of cell type gene expression profiles from the two sites. However, secretory and ciliated cells were the most abundant types in the HBE samples, while more basal cells were seen in the HNE populations. We then merged single-cell data from the epididymis to determine if overlapping functions of these cells corresponded to those in the airway. Of note, only the pulmonary ionocytes/epididymis clear cells showed a strongly conserved identity, which was confirmed by imputation in bulk RNA-seq datasets from the same cells.",35597096,PMC9357053,10.1016/j.ejcb.2022.151231,10,European journal of cell biology,7906240,6.02,0.3562226891517639,0.5117056856187291,0.3210702341137124,0.3802887974375466
Reference-free inferring of transcriptomic events in cancer cells on single-cell data,"Background:Cancerous cells' identity is determined via a mixture of multiple factors such as genomic variations, epigenetics, and the regulatory variations that are involved in transcription. The differences in transcriptome expression as well as abnormal structures in peptides determine phenotypical differences. Thus, bulk RNA-seq and more recent single-cell RNA-seq data (scRNA-seq) are important to identify pathogenic differences. In this case, we rely on k-mer decomposition of sequences to identify pathogenic variations in detail which does not need a reference, so it outperforms more traditional Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) analysis techniques depending on the alignment of the sequences to a reference.Results:Via our alignment-free analysis, over esophageal and glioblastoma cancer patients, high-frequency variations over multiple different locations (repeats, intergenic regions, exons, introns) as well as multiple different forms (fusion, polyadenylation, splicing, etc.) could be discovered. Additionally, we have analyzed the importance of less-focused events systematically in a classic transcriptome analysis pipeline where these events are considered as indicators for tumor prognosis, tumor prediction, tumor neoantigen inference, as well as their connection with respect to the immune microenvironment.Conclusions:Our results suggest that esophageal cancer (ESCA) and glioblastoma processes can be explained via pathogenic microbial RNA, repeated sequences, novel splicing variants, and long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs). We expect our application of reference-free process and analysis to be helpful in tumor and normal samples differential scRNA-seq analysis, which in turn offers a more comprehensive scheme for major cancer-associated events.",38769480,PMC11107047,10.1186/s12885-024-12331-5,0,BMC cancer,100967800,4.638,0.3559987545013428,0.16387959866220736,0.25752508361204013,0.2978801891556552
Integration of Computational Analysis and Spatial Transcriptomics in Single-cell Studies,"Recent advances of single-cell transcriptomics technologies and allied computational methodologies have revolutionized molecular cell biology. Meanwhile, pioneering explorations in spatial transcriptomics have opened up avenues to address fundamental biological questions in health and diseases.

Harnessing Single-Cell RNA Sequencing to Better Understand How Diseased Cells Behave the Way They Do in Cardiovascular Disease,"The transition of healthy arteries and cardiac valves into dense, cell-rich, calcified, and fibrotic tissues is driven by a complex interplay of both cellular and molecular mechanisms. Specific cell types in these cardiovascular tissues become activated following the exposure to systemic stimuli including circulating lipoproteins or inflammatory mediators. This activation induces multiple cascades of events where changes in cell phenotypes and activation of certain receptors may trigger multiple pathways and specific alterations to the transcriptome. Modifications to the transcriptome and proteome can give rise to pathological cell phenotypes and trigger mechanisms that exacerbate inflammation, proliferation, calcification, and recruitment of resident or distant cells. Accumulating evidence suggests that each cell type involved in vascular and valvular diseases is heterogeneous. Single-cell RNA sequencing is a transforming medical research tool that enables the profiling of the unique fingerprints at single-cell levels. Its applications have allowed the construction of cell atlases including the mammalian heart and tissue vasculature and the discovery of new cell types implicated in cardiovascular disease. Recent advances in single-cell RNA sequencing have facilitated the identification of novel resident cell populations that become activated during disease and has allowed tracing the transition of healthy cells into pathological phenotypes. Furthermore, single-cell RNA sequencing has permitted the characterization of heterogeneous cell subpopulations with unique genetic profiles in healthy and pathological cardiovascular tissues. In this review, we highlight the latest groundbreaking research that has improved our understanding of the pathological mechanisms of atherosclerosis and future directions for calcific aortic valve disease.",33327741,PMC8105278,10.1161/ATVBAHA.120.314776,17,"Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology",9505803,10.514,0.35309353470802307,0.5919732441471572,0.5986622073578596,0.4499832111258172

Assessing single-cell transcriptomic variability through density-preserving data visualization,"Nonlinear data visualization methods, such as t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) and uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP), summarize the complex transcriptomic landscape of single cells in two dimensions or three dimensions, but they neglect the local density of data points in the original space, often resulting in misleading visualizations where densely populated subsets of cells are given more visual space than warranted by their transcriptional diversity in the dataset. Here we present den-SNE and densMAP, which are density-preserving visualization tools based on t-SNE and UMAP, respectively, and demonstrate their ability to accurately incorporate information about transcriptomic variability into the visual interpretation of single-cell RNA sequencing data. Applied to recently published datasets, our methods reveal significant changes in transcriptomic variability in a range of biological processes, including heterogeneity in transcriptomic variability of immune cells in blood and tumor, human immune cell specialization and the developmental trajectory of Caenorhabditis elegans. Our methods are readily applicable to visualizing high-dimensional data in other scientific domains.",33462509,PMC8195812,10.1038/s41587-020-00801-7,34,Nature biotechnology,9604648,68.164,0.35264748334884644,0.6822742474916388,0.9765886287625418,0.5433610652601439
Network inference with Granger causality ensembles on single-cell transcriptomics,"Cellular gene expression changes throughout a dynamic biological process, such as differentiation. Pseudotimes estimate cells' progress along a dynamic process based on their individual gene expression states. Ordering the expression data by pseudotime provides information about the underlying regulator-gene interactions. Because the pseudotime distribution is not uniform, many standard mathematical methods are inapplicable for analyzing the ordered gene expression states. Here we present single-cell inference of networks using Granger ensembles (SINGE), an algorithm for gene regulatory network inference from ordered single-cell gene expression data. SINGE uses kernel-based Granger causality regression to smooth irregular pseudotimes and missing expression values. It aggregates predictions from an ensemble of regression analyses to compile a ranked list of candidate interactions between transcriptional regulators and target genes. In two mouse embryonic stem cell differentiation datasets, SINGE outperforms other contemporary algorithms. However, a more detailed examination reveals caveats about poor performance for individual regulators and uninformative pseudotimes.",35139376,PMC9093087,10.1016/j.celrep.2022.110333,43,Cell reports,101573691,9.995,0.3519790470600128,0.7324414715719063,0.5819397993311036,0.4740636824166097
Resolving plant development in space and time with single-cell genomics,"Single-cell genomics technologies are ushering in a new research era. In this review, we summarize the benefits and current challenges of using these technologies to probe the transcriptional regulation of plant development. In addition to profiling cells at a single snapshot in time, researchers have recently produced time-resolved datasets to map cell responses to stimuli. Live-imaging and spatial transcriptomic techniques are rapidly being adopted to link a cell's transcriptional profile with its spatial location within a tissue. Combining these technologies is a powerful spatiotemporal approach to investigate cell plasticity and developmental responses that contribute to plant resilience. Although there are hurdles to overcome, we conclude by discussing how single-cell genomics is poised to address developmental questions in the coming years.",37696725,,10.1016/j.pbi.2023.102444,1,Current opinion in plant biology,100883395,9.396,0.3515336513519287,0.23745819397993312,0.5451505016722408,0.36744192994159197
Insights into Gonadal Sex Differentiation Provided by Single-Cell Transcriptomics in the Chicken Embryo,"Although the genetic triggers for gonadal sex differentiation vary across species, the cell biology of gonadal development was long thought to be largely conserved. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of gonadal sex differentiation, using single-cell sequencing in the embryonic chicken gonad during sexual differentiation. The data show that chicken embryonic-supporting cells do not derive from the coelomic epithelium, in contrast to other vertebrates studied. Instead, they derive from a DMRT1+/PAX2+/WNT4+/OSR1+mesenchymal cell population. We find a greater complexity of gonadal cell types than previously thought, including the identification of two distinct sub-populations of Sertoli cells in developing testes and derivation of embryonic steroidogenic cells from a differentiated supporting-cell lineage. Altogether, these results indicate that, just as the genetic trigger for sex differs across vertebrate groups, cell lineage specification in the gonad may also vary substantially.",32268081,,10.1016/j.celrep.2020.03.055,39,Cell reports,101573691,9.995,0.35064372420310974,0.7157190635451505,0.5852842809364549,0.470586903418187
Hedgehog-FGF signaling axis patterns anterior mesoderm during gastrulation,"The mechanisms used by embryos to pattern tissues across their axes has fascinated developmental biologists since the founding of embryology. Here, using single-cell technology, we interrogate complex patterning defects and define a Hedgehog (Hh)-fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling axis required for anterior mesoderm lineage development during gastrulation. Single-cell transcriptome analysis of Hh-deficient mesoderm revealed selective deficits in anterior mesoderm populations, culminating in defects to anterior embryonic structures, including the pharyngeal arches, heart, and anterior somites. Transcriptional profiling of Hh-deficient mesoderm during gastrulation revealed disruptions to both transcriptional patterning of the mesoderm and FGF signaling for mesoderm migration. Mesoderm-specificFgf4/Fgf8double-mutants recapitulated anterior mesoderm defects and Hh-dependent GLI transcription factors modulated enhancers at FGF gene loci. Cellular migration defects during gastrulation induced by Hh pathway antagonism were mitigated by the addition of FGF4 protein. These findings implicate a multicomponent signaling hierarchy activated by Hh ligands from the embryonic node and executed by FGF signals in nascent mesoderm to control anterior mesoderm patterning.",32561646,PMC7354932,10.1073/pnas.1914167117,18,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,12.779,0.3503102660179138,0.6086956521739131,0.6354515050167224,0.4590155910488754
Recovery and analysis of transcriptome subsets from pooled single-cell RNA-seq libraries,"Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) methods generate sparse gene expression profiles for thousands of single cells in a single experiment. The information in these profiles is sufficient to classify cell types by distinct expression patterns but the high complexity of scRNA-seq libraries often prevents full characterization of transcriptomes from individual cells. To extract more focused gene expression information from scRNA-seq libraries, we developed a strategy to physically recover the DNA molecules comprising transcriptome subsets, enabling deeper interrogation of the isolated molecules by another round of DNA sequencing. We applied the method in cell-centric and gene-centric modes to isolate cDNA fragments from scRNA-seq libraries. First, we resampled the transcriptomes of rare, single megakaryocytes from a complex mixture of lymphocytes and analyzed them in a second round of DNA sequencing, yielding up to 20-fold greater sequencing depth per cell and increasing the number of genes detected per cell from a median of 1313 to 2002. We similarly isolated mRNAs from targeted T cells to improve the reconstruction of their VDJ-rearranged immune receptor mRNAs. Second, we isolated CD3D mRNA fragments expressed across cells in a scRNA-seq library prepared from a clonal T cell line, increasing the number of cells with detected CD3D expression from 59.7% to 100%. Transcriptome resampling is a general approach to recover targeted gene expression information from single-cell RNA sequencing libraries that enhances the utility of these costly experiments, and may be applicable to the targeted recovery of molecules from other single-cell assays.",30496484,PMC6393243,10.1093/nar/gky1204,8,Nucleic acids research,411011,19.16,0.3503102660179138,0.4782608695652174,0.8394648829431438,0.47373131011242053
Characterizing spatial gene expression heterogeneity in spatially resolved single-cell transcriptomic data with nonuniform cellular densities,"Recent technological advances have enabled spatially resolved measurements of expression profiles for hundreds to thousands of genes in fixed tissues at single-cell resolution. However, scalable computational analysis methods able to take into consideration the inherent 3D spatial organization of cell types and nonuniform cellular densities within tissues are still lacking. To address this, we developed MERINGUE, a computational framework based on spatial autocorrelation and cross-correlation analysis to identify genes with spatially heterogeneous expression patterns, infer putative cell-cell communication, and perform spatially informed cell clustering in 2D and 3D in a density-agnostic manner using spatially resolved transcriptomic data. We applied MERINGUE to a variety of spatially resolved transcriptomic data sets including multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH), spatial transcriptomics, Slide-seq, and aligned in situ hybridization (ISH) data. We anticipate that such statistical analysis of spatially resolved transcriptomic data will facilitate our understanding of the interplay between cell state and spatial organization in tissue development and disease.",34035045,PMC8494224,10.1101/gr.271288.120,50,Genome research,9518021,9.438,0.3501991033554077,0.7591973244147158,0.5551839464882943,0.47299571619384667
Analysis of aggregated cell-cell statistical distances within pathways unveils therapeutic-resistance mechanisms in circulating tumor cells,"Motivation:As 'omics' biotechnologies accelerate the capability to contrast a myriad of molecular measurements from a single cell, they also exacerbate current analytical limitations for detecting meaningful single-cell dysregulations. Moreover, mRNA expression alone lacks functional interpretation, limiting opportunities for translation of single-cell transcriptomic insights to precision medicine. Lastly, most single-cell RNA-sequencing analytic approaches are not designed to investigate small populations of cells such as circulating tumor cells shed from solid tumors and isolated from patient blood samples.Results:In response to these characteristics and limitations in current single-cell RNA-sequencing methodology, we introduce an analytic framework that models transcriptome dynamics through the analysis of aggregated cell-cell statistical distances within biomolecular pathways. Cell-cell statistical distances are calculated from pathway mRNA fold changes between two cells. Within an elaborate case study of circulating tumor cells derived from prostate cancer patients, we develop analytic methods of aggregated distances to identify five differentially expressed pathways associated to therapeutic resistance. Our aggregation analyses perform comparably with Gene Set Enrichment Analysis and better than differentially expressed genes followed by gene set enrichment. However, these methods were not designed to inform on differential pathway expression for a single cell. As such, our framework culminates with the novel aggregation method, cell-centric statistics (CCS). CCS quantifies the effect size and significance of differentially expressed pathways for a single cell of interest. Improved rose plots of differentially expressed pathways in each cell highlight the utility of CCS for therapeutic decision-making.Availability and implementation:http://www.lussierlab.org/publications/CCS/ CONTACT: yves@email.arizona.edu or piegorsch@math.arizona.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",27307648,PMC4908332,10.1093/bioinformatics/btw248,10,"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",9808944,6.931,0.3501991033554077,0.5150501672240803,0.4280936454849498,0.39874822455505066
SCAR: Single-cell and Spatially-resolved Cancer Resources,"Advances in sequencing and imaging technologies offer a unique opportunity to unravel cell heterogeneity and develop new immunotherapy strategies for cancer research. There is an urgent need for a resource that effectively integrates a vast amount of transcriptomic profiling data to comprehensively explore cancer tissue heterogeneity and the tumor microenvironment. In this context, we developed the Single-cell and Spatially-resolved Cancer Resources (SCAR) database, a combined tumor spatial and single-cell transcriptomic platform, which is freely accessible at http://8.142.154.29/SCAR2023 or http://scaratlas.com. SCAR contains spatial transcriptomic data from 21 tumor tissues and single-cell transcriptomic data from 11 301 352 cells encompassing 395 cancer subtypes and covering a wide variety of tissues, organoids, and cell lines. This resource offers diverse functional modules to address key cancer research questions at multiple levels, including the screening of tumor cell types, metabolic features, cell communication and gene expression patterns within the tumor microenvironment. Moreover, SCAR enables the analysis of biomarker expression patterns and cell developmental trajectories. SCAR also provides a comprehensive analysis of multi-dimensional datasets based on 34 state-of-the-art omics techniques, serving as an essential tool for in-depth mining and understanding of cell heterogeneity and spatial location.

Single-cell transcriptomic heterogeneity between conduit and resistance mesenteric arteries in rats,"The endothelium contains morphologically similar cells throughout the vasculature, but individual cells along the length of a single vascular tree or in different regional circulations function dissimilarly. When observations made in large arteries are extrapolated to explain the function of endothelial cells (ECs) in the resistance vasculature, only a fraction of these observations are consistent between artery sizes. To what extent endothelial (EC) and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) from different arteriolar segments of the same tissue differ phenotypically at the single-cell level remains unknown. Therefore, single-cell RNA-seq (10x Genomics) was performed using a 10X Genomics Chromium system. Cells were enzymatically digested from large (>300 Âµm) and small (<150 Âµm) mesenteric arteries from nine adult male Sprague-Dawley rats, pooled to create six samples (3 rats/sample, 3 samples/group). After normalized integration, the dataset was scaled before unsupervised cell clustering and cluster visualization using UMAP plots. Differential gene expression analysis allowed us to infer the biological identity of different clusters. Our analysis revealed 630 and 641 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between conduit and resistance arteries for ECs and VSMCs, respectively. Gene ontology analysis (GO-Biological Processes, GOBP) of scRNA-seq data discovered 562 and 270 pathways for ECs and VSMCs, respectively, that differed between large and small arteries. We identified eight and seven unique ECs and VSMCs subpopulations, respectively, with DEGs and pathways identified for each cluster. These results and this dataset allow the discovery and support of novel hypotheses needed to identify mechanisms that determine the phenotypic heterogeneity between conduit and resistance arteries.",36912534,PMC10085562,10.1152/physiolgenomics.00126.2022,2,Physiological genomics,9815683,4.297,0.349643737077713,0.3010033444816054,0.23411371237458195,0.3168096536178653
Cell atlas of the foetal human heart and implications for autoimmune-mediated congenital heart block,"Aims:Investigating human heart development and applying this to deviations resulting in disease is incomplete without molecular characterization of the cell types required for normal functioning. We investigated foetal human heart single-cell transcriptomes from mid-gestational healthy and anti-SSA/Ro associated congenital heart block (CHB) samples.Methods and results:Three healthy foetal human hearts (19th to 22nd week of gestation) and one foetal heart affected by autoimmune-associated CHB (21st week of gestation) were subjected to enzymatic dissociation using the Langendorff preparation to obtain single-cell suspensions followed by 10Ã Genomics- and Illumina-based single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq). In addition to the myocytes, fibroblasts, immune cells, and other minor cell types, previously uncharacterized diverse sub-populations of endothelial cells were identified in the human heart. Differential gene expression analysis revealed increased and heterogeneous interferon responses in varied cell types of the CHB heart compared with the healthy controls. In addition, we also identified matrisome transcripts enriched in CHB stromal cells that potentially contribute to extracellular matrix deposition and subsequent fibrosis.Conclusion:These data provide an information-rich resource to further our understanding of human heart development, which, as illustrated by comparison to a heart exposed to a maternal autoimmune environment, can be leveraged to provide insight into the pathogenesis of disease.",31589297,PMC7314636,10.1093/cvr/cvz257,41,Cardiovascular research,77427,13.081,0.34908878803253174,0.7224080267558528,0.6421404682274248,0.48236297181617455
Single-cell technologies to study the immune system,"The immune system is composed of a variety of cells that act in a coordinated fashion to protect the organism against a multitude of different pathogens. The great variability of existing pathogens corresponds to a similar high heterogeneity of the immune cells. The study of individual immune cells, the fundamental unit of immunity, has recently transformed from a qualitative microscopic imaging to a nearly complete quantitative transcriptomic analysis. This shift has been driven by the rapid development of multiple single-cell technologies. These new advances are expected to boost the detection of less frequent cell types and transient or intermediate cell states. They will highlight the individuality of each single cell and greatly expand the resolution of current available classifications and differentiation trajectories.

Global coordination level in single-cell transcriptomic data,"Genes are linked by underlying regulatory mechanisms and by jointly implementing biological functions, working in coordination to apply different tasks in the cells. Assessing the coordination level between genes from single-cell transcriptomic data, without a priori knowledge of the map of gene regulatory interactions, is a challenge. A 'top-down' approach has recently been developed to analyze single-cell transcriptomic data by evaluating the global coordination level between genes (called GCL). Here, we systematically analyze the performance of the GCL in typical scenarios of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. We show that an individual anomalous cell can have a disproportionate effect on the GCL calculated over a cohort of cells. In addition, we demonstrate how the GCL is affected by the presence of clusters, which are very common in scRNA-seq data. Finally, we analyze the effect of the sampling size of the Jackknife procedure on the GCL statistics. The manuscript is accompanied by a description of a custom-built Python package for calculating the GCL. These results provide practical guidelines for properly pre-processing and applying the GCL measure in transcriptional data.",35534606,PMC9085802,10.1038/s41598-022-11507-y,2,Scientific reports,101563288,4.996,0.346762478351593,0.30434782608695654,0.2809364548494983,0.3251143431982468
From whole-mount to single-cell spatial assessment of gene expression in 3D,"Unravelling spatio-temporal patterns of gene expression is crucial to understanding core biological principles from embryogenesis to disease. Here we review emerging technologies, providing automated, high-throughput, spatially resolved quantitative gene expression data. Novel techniques expand on current benchmark protocols, expediting their incorporation into ongoing research. These approaches digitally reconstruct patterns of embryonic expression in three dimensions, and have successfully identified novel domains of expression, cell types, and tissue features. Such technologies pave the way for unbiased and exhaustive recapitulation of gene expression levels in spatial and quantitative terms, promoting understanding of the molecular origin of developmental defects, and improving medical diagnostics.",33097816,PMC7584572,10.1038/s42003-020-01341-1,55,Communications biology,101719179,6.548,0.3464307188987732,0.7725752508361204,0.36789297658862874,0.43595207682421383
Single-cell transcriptome analysis reveals the effectiveness of cytokine priming irrespective of heterogeneity in mesenchymal stromal cells,"Background aims:Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are recognized as a potential cell-based therapy for regenerative medicine. Short-term inflammatory cytokine pre-stimulation (cytokine priming) is a promising approach to enhance regenerative efficacy of MSCs. However, it is unclear whether their intrinsic heterogenic nature causes an unequal response to cytokine priming, which might blunt the accessibility of clinical applications.Methods:In this study, by analyzing the single-cell transcriptomic landscape of human bone marrow MSCs from a naÃ¯ve to cytokine-primed state, we elucidated the potential mechanism of superior therapeutic potential in cytokine-primed MSCs.Results:We found that cytokine-primed MSCs had a distinct transcriptome landscape. Although substantial heterogeneity was identified within the population in both naÃ¯ve and primed states, cytokine priming enhanced the several characteristics of MSCs associated with therapeutic efficacy irrespective of heterogeneity. After cytokine-priming, all sub-clusters of MSCs possessed high levels of immunoregulatory molecules, trophic factors, stemness-related genes, anti-apoptosis markers and low levels of multi-lineage and senescence signatures, which are critical for their therapeutic potency.Conclusions:In conclusion, our results provide new insights into MSC heterogeneity under cytokine stimulation and suggest that cytokine priming reprogrammed MSCs independent of heterogeneity.",37715776,,10.1016/j.jcyt.2023.08.006,0,Cytotherapy,100895309,6.196,0.3464307188987732,0.17391304347826086,0.3277591973244147,0.308192879499799
"Single-cell transcriptomics in human skin research: available technologies, technical considerations and disease applications","Single-cell technologies have revolutionized research in the last decade, including for skin biology. Single-cell RNA sequencing has emerged as a powerful tool allowing the dissection of human disease pathophysiology at unprecedented resolution by assessing cell-to-cell variation, facilitating identification of rare cell populations and elucidating cellular heterogeneity. In dermatology, this technology has been widely applied to inflammatory skin disorders, fibrotic skin diseases, wound healing complications and cutaneous neoplasms. Here, we discuss the available technologies and technical considerations of single-cell RNA sequencing and describe its applications to a broad spectrum of dermatological diseases.",35196402,PMC9311140,10.1111/exd.14547,8,Experimental dermatology,9301549,4.511,0.3460991382598877,0.4816053511705686,0.2408026755852843,0.3521410883071032
"Interactive, integrated analysis of single-cell transcriptomic and phylogenetic data with PhyloVision","Recent advances in CRISPR-Cas9 engineering and single-cell assays have enabled the simultaneous measurement of single-cell transcriptomic and phylogenetic profiles. However, there are few computational tools enabling users to integrate and derive insight from a joint analysis of these two modalities. Here, we describe ""PhyloVision"": an open-source software for interactively exploring data from both modalities and for identifying and interpreting heritable gene modules whose concerted expression are associated with phylogenetic relationships. PhyloVision provides a feature-rich, interactive, and shareable web-based report for investigating these modules while also supporting several other data and meta-data exploration capabilities. We demonstrate the utility of PhyloVision using a published dataset of metastatic lung adenocarcinoma cells, whose phylogeny was resolved using a CRISPR-Cas9-based lineage-tracing system. Together, we anticipate that PhyloVision and the methods it implements will be a useful resource for scalable and intuitive data exploration for any assay that simultaneously measures cell state and lineage.",35497495,PMC9046453,10.1016/j.crmeth.2022.100200,3,Cell reports methods,9918227360606676,0.0,0.3449949324131012,0.3511705685618729,0.11371237458193979,0.29997354807662324
Single cell transcriptomics clarifies the basophil differentiation trajectory and identifies pre-basophils upstream of mature basophils,"Basophils are the rarest granulocytes and are recognized as critical cells for type 2 immune responses. However, their differentiation pathway remains to be fully elucidated. Here, we assess the ontogenetic trajectory of basophils by single-cell RNA sequence analysis. Combined with flow cytometric and functional analyses, we identify c-Kit-CLEC12Ahipre-basophils located downstream of pre-basophil and mast cell progenitors (pre-BMPs) and upstream of CLEC12Alomature basophils. The transcriptomic analysis predicts that the pre-basophil population includes previously-defined basophil progenitor (BaP)-like cells in terms of gene expression profile. Pre-basophils are highly proliferative and respond better to non-IgE stimuli but less to antigen plus IgE stimulation than do mature basophils. Although pre-basophils usually remain in the bone marrow, they emerge in helminth-infected tissues, probably through IL-3-mediated inhibition of their retention in the bone marrow. Thus, the present study identifies pre-basophils that bridge the gap between pre-BMPs and mature basophils during basophil ontogeny.",37202383,PMC10195816,10.1038/s41467-023-38356-1,7,Nature communications,101528555,17.694,0.3443332016468048,0.44816053511705684,0.7792642140468228,0.4520848708208588
Single-nucleus and single-cell transcriptomes compared in matched cortical cell types,"Transcriptomic profiling of complex tissues by single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) affords some advantages over single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq). snRNA-seq provides less biased cellular coverage, does not appear to suffer cell isolation-based transcriptional artifacts, and can be applied to archived frozen specimens. We used well-matched snRNA-seq and scRNA-seq datasets from mouse visual cortex to compare cell type detection. Although more transcripts are detected in individual whole cells (~11,000 genes) than nuclei (~7,000 genes), we demonstrate that closely related neuronal cell types can be similarly discriminated with both methods if intronic sequences are included in snRNA-seq analysis. We estimate that the nuclear proportion of total cellular mRNA varies from 20% to over 50% for large and small pyramidal neurons, respectively. Together, these results illustrate the high information content of nuclear RNA for characterization of cellular diversity in brain tissues.",30586455,PMC6306246,10.1371/journal.pone.0209648,226,PloS one,101285081,3.752,0.3442229926586151,0.9464882943143813,0.2140468227424749,0.4386408190065403
Simultaneous deep transcriptome and proteome profiling in a single mouse oocyte,"Although single-cell multi-omics technologies are undergoing rapid development, simultaneous transcriptome and proteome analysis of a single-cell individual still faces great challenges. Here, we developed a single-cell simultaneous transcriptome and proteome (scSTAP) analysis platform based on microfluidics, high-throughput sequencing, and mass spectrometry technology to achieve deep and joint quantitative analysis of transcriptome and proteome at the single-cell level, providing an important resource for understanding the relationship between transcription and translation in cells. This platform was applied to analyze single mouse oocytes at different meiotic maturation stages, reaching an average quantification depth of 19,948 genes and 2,663 protein groups in single mouse oocytes. In particular, we analyzed the correlation of individual RNA and protein pairs, as well as the meiosis regulatory network with unprecedented depth, and identified 30 transcript-protein pairs as specific oocyte maturational signatures, which could be productive for exploring transcriptional and translational regulatory features during oocyte meiosis.",37976159,,10.1016/j.celrep.2023.113455,1,Cell reports,101573691,9.995,0.34356194734573364,0.2408026755852843,0.5886287625418061,0.37202345603285825
Inferring transcriptomic cell states and transitions only from time series transcriptome data,"Cellular stages of biological processes have been characterized using fluorescence-activated cell sorting and genetic perturbations, charting a limited landscape of cellular states. Time series transcriptome data can help define new cellular states at the molecular level since the analysis of transcriptional changes can provide information on cell states and transitions. However, existing methods for inferring cell states from transcriptome data use additional information such as prior knowledge on cell types or cell-type-specific markers to reduce the complexity of data. In this study, we present a novel time series clustering framework to infer TRAnscriptomic Cellular States (TRACS) only from time series transcriptome data by integrating Gaussian process regression, shape-based distance, and ranked pairs algorithm in a single computational framework. TRACS determines patterns that correspond to hidden cellular states by clustering gene expression data. TRACS was used to analyse single-cell and bulk RNA sequencing data and successfully generated cluster networks that reflected the characteristics of key stages of biological processes. Thus, TRACS has a potential to help reveal unknown cellular states and transitions at the molecular level using only time series transcriptome data. TRACS is implemented in Python and available at http://github.com/BML-cbnu/TRACS/ .",34131182,PMC8206345,10.1038/s41598-021-91752-9,2,Scientific reports,101563288,4.996,0.3434518277645111,0.3076923076923077,0.2842809364548495,0.3244657454881381
ASURAT: functional annotation-driven unsupervised clustering of single-cell transcriptomes,"Motivation:Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis reveals heterogeneity and dynamic cell transitions. However, conventional gene-based analyses require intensive manual curation to interpret biological implications of computational results. Hence, a theory for efficiently annotating individual cells remains warranted.Results:We present ASURAT, a computational tool for simultaneously performing unsupervised clustering and functional annotation of disease, cell type, biological process and signaling pathway activity for single-cell transcriptomic data, using a correlation graph decomposition for genes in database-derived functional terms. We validated the usability and clustering performance of ASURAT using scRNA-seq datasets for human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, which required fewer manual curations than existing methods. Moreover, we applied ASURAT to scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptome datasets for human small cell lung cancer and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, respectively, identifying previously overlooked subpopulations and differentially expressed genes. ASURAT is a powerful tool for dissecting cell subpopulations and improving biological interpretability of complex and noisy transcriptomic data.Availability and implementation:ASURAT is published on Bioconductor (https://doi.org/10.18129/B9.bioc.ASURAT).

Single-nucleus transcriptomic analysis of human dorsal root ganglion neurons,"Somatosensory neurons with cell bodies in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) project to the skin, muscles, bones, and viscera to detect touch and temperature as well as to mediate proprioception and many types of interoception. In addition, the somatosensory system conveys the clinically relevant noxious sensations of pain and itch. Here, we used single nuclear transcriptomics to characterize transcriptomic classes of human DRG neurons that detect these diverse types of stimuli. Notably, multiple types of human DRG neurons have transcriptomic features that resemble their mouse counterparts although expression of genes considered important for sensory function often differed between species. More unexpectedly, we identified several transcriptomic classes with no clear equivalent in the other species. This dataset should serve as a valuable resource for the community, for example as means of focusing translational efforts on molecules with conserved expression across species.",34825887,PMC8626086,10.7554/eLife.71752,65,eLife,101579614,8.713,0.34235161542892456,0.7993311036789298,0.5217391304347826,0.46962501608009727
