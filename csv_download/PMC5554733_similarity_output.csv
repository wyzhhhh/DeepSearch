10.1002/advs.202306630,AFM Imaging Reveals MicroRNA-132 to be a Positive Regulator of Synaptic        Functions.,2024.0,"The modification of synaptic and neural connections in adults, including the        formation and removal of synapses, depends on activity-dependent synaptic and        structural plasticity. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play crucial roles in regulating these        changes by targeting specific genes and regulating their expression. The fact        that somatic and dendritic activity in neurons often occurs asynchronously        highlights the need for spatial and dynamic regulation of protein synthesis in        specific milieu and cellular loci. MicroRNAs, which can show distinct patterns of        enrichment, help to establish the localized distribution of plasticity-related        proteins. The recent study using atomic force microscopy (AFM)-based nanoscale        imaging reveals that the abundance of miRNA(miR)-134 is inversely correlated with        the functional activity of dendritic spine structures. However, the miRNAs that        are selectively upregulated in potentiated synapses, and which can thereby        support prospective changes in synaptic efficacy, remain largely unknown. Using        AFM force imaging, significant increases in miR-132 in the dendritic regions        abutting functionally-active spines is discovered. This study provides evidence        for miR-132 as a novel positive miRNA regulator residing in dendritic shafts, and        also suggests that activity-dependent miRNAs localized in distinct        sub-compartments of neurons play bi-directional roles in controlling synaptic        transmission and synaptic plasticity.",7cb22153e16bb0b24b651c1c61c9035881c79666,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7cb22153e16bb0b24b651c1c61c9035881c79666,38493494,PMC11077659,,False,"Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)",101664569,0.851706326007843,0.08,0,17.521,0.0,0.9850746268656716,0.43527309183220364

Using a conditional transgenic toolkit        for competitive inhibition of miRNA function in Drosophila, we performed an        unbiased screen for novel regulators of synapse morphogenesis at the larval        neuromuscular junction (NMJ). From a set of ten new validated regulators of NMJ        growth, we discovered that miR-34 mutants display synaptic phenotypes and cell        type-specific functions suggesting distinct downstream mechanisms in the        presynaptic and postsynaptic compartments. A search for conserved downstream        targets for miR-34 identified the junctional receptor CNTNAP4/Neurexin-IV        (Nrx-IV) and the membrane cytoskeletal effector Adducin/Hu-li tai shao (Hts) as        proteins whose synaptic expression is restricted by miR-34. Manipulation of        miR-34, Nrx-IV or Hts-M function in motor neurons or muscle supports a model        where presynaptic miR-34 inhibits Nrx-IV to influence active zone formation,        whereas, postsynaptic miR-34 inhibits Hts to regulate the initiation of bouton        formation from presynaptic terminals.",20267904ea61bf49045ed9a4eff426914dfe2482,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/20267904ea61bf49045ed9a4eff426914dfe2482,32107390,PMC7046720,,False,Nature communications,101528555,0.8469578623771667,0.06666666666666667,19,17.694,0.7611940298507462,1.0,0.5449331298574286
10.1007/s12031-021-01862-2,miR-128 as a Regulator of Synaptic Properties in 5xFAD Mice Hippocampal Neurons.,2021.0,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by progressive synaptic dysfunction,        deterioration of neuronal transmission, and consequently neuronal death. Although        there is no treatment for AD, exposure to enriched environment (EE) in mice, as        well as physical and mental activity in human subjects have been shown to have a        protective effect by slowing the disease's progression and reducing AD-like        cognitive impairment. However, the molecular mechanism of this mitigating effect        is still not understood. One of the mechanisms that has recently been shown to be        involved in neuronal degeneration is microRNAs (miRNAs) regulation, which act as        a post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression. miR-128 has been shown to        be significantly altered in individuals with AD and in mice following exposure to        EE. Here, we focused on elucidating the possible role of miR-128 in AD pathology        and found that miR-128 regulates the expression of two proteins essential for        synaptic transmission, SNAP-25, and synaptotagmin1 (Syt1). Clinically relevant,        in 5xFAD mouse model for AD, this miRNA's expression was found as downregulated,        resembling the alteration found in the hippocampi of individuals with AD.        Interestingly, exposing WT mice to EE also resulted in downregulation of miR-128        expression levels, although EE and AD conditions demonstrate opposing effects on        neuronal functioning and synaptic plasticity. We also found that miR-128        expression downregulation in primary hippocampal cultures from 5xFAD mice results        in increased neuronal network activity and neuronal excitability. Altogether, our        findings place miR-128 as a synaptic player that may contribute to synaptic        functioning and plasticity through regulation of synaptic protein expression and        function.",f3105ae53a1d2053b397ed2ff0a6d5ef356c00bb,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f3105ae53a1d2053b397ed2ff0a6d5ef356c00bb,34151409,,,False,Journal of molecular neuroscience : MN,9002991,0.8342719078063965,0.030927835051546393,7,2.866,0.3582089552238806,0.16417910447761194,0.3410109153177614
10.3389/fnins.2018.00707,MicroRNAs Engage in Complex Circuits Regulating Adult Neurogenesis.,2018.0,"The finding that the adult mammalian brain is still capable of producing neurons        has ignited a new field of research aiming to identify the molecular mechanisms        regulating adult neurogenesis. An improved understanding of these mechanisms        could lead to the development of novel approaches to delay cognitive decline and        facilitate neuroregeneration in the adult human brain. Accumulating evidence        suggest microRNAs (miRNAs), which represent a class of post-transcriptional gene        expression regulators, as crucial part of the gene regulatory networks governing        adult neurogenesis. This review attempts to illustrate how miRNAs modulate key        processes in the adult neurogenic niche by interacting with each other and with        transcriptional regulators. We discuss the function of miRNAs in adult        neurogenesis following the life-journey of an adult-born neuron from the adult        neural stem cell (NSCs) compartment to its final target site. We first survey how        miRNAs control the initial step of adult neurogenesis, that is the transition of        quiescent to activated proliferative adult NSCs, and then go on to discuss the        role of miRNAs to regulate neuronal differentiation, survival, and functional        integration of the newborn neurons. In this context, we highlight miRNAs that        converge on functionally related targets or act within cross talking gene        regulatory networks. The cooperative manner of miRNA action and the broad target        repertoire of each individual miRNA could make the miRNA system a promising tool        to gain control on adult NSCs in the context of therapeutic approaches.",244cd453637dbbe2f38ac27660b454d65e7a5fa7,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/244cd453637dbbe2f38ac27660b454d65e7a5fa7,30455620,PMC6230569,background,False,Frontiers in neuroscience,101478481,0.8219033479690552,0.04895104895104895,33,5.152,0.8955223880597015,0.31343283582089554,0.4474947075532257
10.3389/fnagi.2021.705989,Reduced Levels of miR-342-5p in Plasma Are Associated With Worse Cognitive        Evolution in Patients With Mild Alzheimer's Disease.,2021.0,"BACKGROUND: Progressive cognitive decline is the most relevant clinical symptom        of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the rate of cognitive decline is highly        variable between patients. Synaptic deficits are the neuropathological event most        correlated with cognitive impairment in AD. Considering the important role of        microRNAs (miRNAs) in regulating synaptic plasticity, our objective was to        identify the plasma miRNAs associated with the rate of cognitive decline in        patients with mild AD. METHODS: We analyzed 754 plasma miRNAs from 19 women        diagnosed with mild AD using TaqMan low-density array cards. The patients were        grouped based on the rate of decline in the MMSE score after 2 years [<4 points        (N = 11) and ≥4 points (N = 8)]. The differentially expressed miRNAs between the        two groups were validated in an independent cohort of men and women (N = 53) with        mild AD using RT-qPCR. RESULTS: In the discovery cohort, 17 miRNAs were        differentially expressed according to the fold change between patients with        faster declines in cognition and those with slower declines. miR-342-5p        demonstrated differential expression between the groups and a good correlation        with the rate of cognitive decline in the validation cohort (r = -0.28; p =        0.026). This miRNA had a lower expression level in patients who suffered from        more severe decline than in those who were cognitively more stable after 2 years        (p = 0.049). CONCLUSION: Lower levels of miR-342-5p in plasma were associated        with faster cognitive decline in patients with mild AD after 2 years of        follow-up.",08c85394e42c9fce651b11f3c450d36791922c65,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/08c85394e42c9fce651b11f3c450d36791922c65,34497505,PMC8421031,background,False,Frontiers in aging neuroscience,101525824,0.801159143447876,0.0,13,5.702,0.582089552238806,0.40298507462686567,0.3881089370642135

Specific        miRNAs are required for NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-dependent synaptic plasticity by        modulating the translation of proteins involved in dendritic spine morphogenesis        or synaptic transmission. However, it is unknown how NMDAR stimulation stimulates        RISC activity to rapidly repress translation of synaptic proteins. We show that        NMDAR stimulation transiently increases Akt-dependent phosphorylation of Ago2 at        S387, which causes an increase in binding to GW182 and a rapid increase in        translational repression of LIMK1 via miR-134. Furthermore, NMDAR-dependent        down-regulation of endogenous LIMK1 translation in dendrites and dendritic spine        shrinkage requires phospho-regulation of Ago2 at S387. AMPAR trafficking and        hippocampal LTD do not involve S387 phosphorylation, defining this mechanism as a        specific pathway for structural plasticity. This work defines a novel mechanism        for the rapid transduction of NMDAR stimulation into miRNA-mediated translational        repression to control dendritic spine morphology.",31d7e7fa179e6156ed4794c2646f5e53afa827f7,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/31d7e7fa179e6156ed4794c2646f5e53afa827f7,29712715,PMC5983126,background,False,The EMBO journal,8208664,0.7345005869865417,0.13114754098360656,36,14.012,0.9253731343283582,0.9701492537313433,0.5571375506983604

However, the impact of rapid miRNA modulation on synaptic efficacy        is unknown. Here, we examined the effect of acute (12 min), intrahippocampal        infusion of a miR-34a antagonist (antimiR) on medial perforant path-evoked        synaptic transmission in the dentate gyrus of adult anesthetised rats.        AntimiR-34a infusion acutely depressed medial perforant path-evoked field        excitatory post-synaptic potentials (fEPSPs). The fEPSP decrease was detected        within 9 min of infusion, lasted for hours, and was associated with knockdown of        antimiR-34a levels. AntimiR-34a-induced synaptic depression was        sequence-specific; no changes were elicited by infusion of scrambled or mismatch        control. The rapid modulation suggests that a target, or set of targets, is        regulated by miR-34a. Western blot analysis of dentate gyrus lysates revealed        enhanced expression of Arc, a known miR-34a target, and four novel predicted        targets (Ctip2, PKI-1α, TCF4 and Ube2g1). Remarkably, antimiR-34a had no effect        when infused during the maintenance phase of long-term potentiation. We conclude        that miR-34a regulates basal synaptic efficacy in the adult dentate gyrus in        vivo.

Physical        exercise (PE) is a beneficial non-pharmacological strategy and has been described        as an ally to combat cognitive decline in individuals with AD. However, the        molecular mechanisms that govern the beneficial adaptations induced by PE in AD        are not fully elucidated.

Dicer and the fine-tuning of microRNA (miRNA)        network are important for maintaining the normal functions of central nervous        system and dysregulation of miRNAs is implicated in neurological disorders.        However, little is known about the role of Dicer and miRNAs of astrocytes in the        homeostasis of synapse as well as its plasticity. By selectively deleting Dicer        in postnatal astrocytes, Dicer-deficient mice exhibited reactive astrogliosis and        deficits in dendritic spine formation. Astrocyte-conditioned medium (ACM)        collected from Dicer-null astrocytes caused synapse degeneration in cultured        primary neurons. The expression of chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5) elevated in        Dicer-deleted astrocytes which led to the significant augmentation of secreted        CCL5 in ACM. In neurons treated with Dicer KO-ACM, CCL5 supplementation inhibited        MAPK/CREB signaling pathway and exacerbated the synaptic formation deficiency,        while CCL5 knockdown partially rescued the synapse degeneration. Moreover, we        validated CCL5 as miR-324-5p targeted gene. ACM collected from miR-324-5p        antagomir-transfected astrocytes mimicked the effect of CCL5 treatment on        inhibiting synapse formation and MAPK/CREB signaling in Dicer KO-ACM-cocultured        neurons. Furthermore, decreased miR-324-5p expression and elevated CCL5        expression were observed in the brain of aging mice.

After modulation        with miR-124 mimic/inhibitor, we identified common responsive mechanisms between        such models. We also reported miR-124 colocalization with microglia in AD patient        hippocampi. Herein, we determined how miR-124 modulation in SWE cells influences        microglia polarized subtypes in the context of inflammation. We used a coculture        system without cell-to-cell contact formed by miR-124 modulated SWE cells and        human CHME3 microglia stimulated with interferon-gamma (IFNγ-MG), in which we        assessed their adopted gene/miRNA profile and proteomic signature.

Such variation in cognitive        trajectory is only partially explained by common neurodegenerative pathologies.        Hence, we aimed to identify new molecular processes underlying variation in        cognitive trajectory using brain microRNA profile followed by an integrative        analysis with brain transcriptome and proteome. Individual cognitive trajectories        were derived from longitudinally assessed cognitive-test scores of older-adult        brain donors from four longitudinal cohorts. Postmortem brain microRNA profiles,        transcriptomes, and proteomes were derived from the dorsolateral prefrontal        cortex. The global microRNA association study of cognitive trajectory was        performed in a discovery (n = 454) and replication cohort (n = 134), followed by        a meta-analysis that identified 6 microRNAs. Among these, miR-132-3p and        miR-29a-3p were most significantly associated with cognitive trajectory. They        explain 18.2% and 2.0% of the variance of cognitive trajectory, respectively, and        act independently of the eight measured neurodegenerative pathologies.        Furthermore, integrative transcriptomic and proteomic analyses revealed that        miR-132-3p was significantly associated with 24 of the 47 modules of co-expressed        genes of the transcriptome, miR-29a-3p with 3 modules, and identified 84 and 214        downstream targets of miR-132-3p and miR-29a-3p, respectively, in cognitive        trajectory.

A pioneering field of research in AD        is brain stimulation via electromagnetic fields (EMFs), which may produce        clinical benefits. Noninvasive brain stimulation techniques, such as transcranial        magnetic stimulation (TMS), have been developed to treat neurological and        psychiatric disorders. The purpose of the present review is to identify        neurobiological changes, including inflammatory, neurodegenerative, apoptotic,        neuroprotective and genetic changes, which are associated with repetitive TMS        (rTMS) treatment in patients with AD. Furthermore, it aims to evaluate the effect        of TMS treatment in patients with AD and to identify the associated mechanisms.        The present review highlights the changes in inflammatory and apoptotic        mechanisms, mitochondrial enzymatic activities, and modulation of gene expression        (microRNA expression profiles) associated with rTMS or sham procedures. At the        molecular level, it has been suggested that EMFs generated by TMS may affect the        cell redox status and amyloidogenic processes. TMS may also modulate gene        expression by acting on both transcriptional and post‑transcriptional regulatory        mechanisms. TMS may increase brain cortical excitability, induce specific        potentiation phenomena, and promote synaptic plasticity and recovery of impaired        functions; thus, it may re‑establish cognitive performance in patients with AD.",46f173fb88c2965a988383cb0d71469640c1c9a1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/46f173fb88c2965a988383cb0d71469640c1c9a1,35119081,PMC8845030,,False,Molecular medicine reports,101475259,0.4638389050960541,0.0,9,3.423,0.43283582089552236,0.19402985074626866,0.23318152227508487

This study investigated whether Fragile X mental        retardation protein (FMRP), a selective RNA-binding protein that regulates        synaptic protein expression by interacting with miRNAs, mediates the effects of        androgens that play an important role in regulating the synaptic plasticity in        the hippocampus. Experiments using mouse hippocampal neuron HT22 cells        demonstrated that dihydrotestosterone (DHT) increased the expression of        postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95) by inhibiting FMRP expression.        Administration of miR-125a inhibitor upregulated the PSD95 expression and        significantly increased the DHT-induced upregulation of PSD95. FMRP knockdown in        HT22 cells reduced the expression of miR-125a. Moreover, miR-125a inhibitor        upregulated the PSD95 expression in the DHT-treated HT22 cells with FMRP        knockdown. Subsequently, the effects of androgen-mediated via FMRP in regulating        neural behaviors and PSD95 expression and dendritic spines density/morphology        were investigated using Fmr1 knockout (KO) and wild-type littermate (WT) mice.        The castration of WT mice reduced the androgen levels, aggravated anxiety and        depression, and impaired learning and memory and sociability of mice. DHT        supplementation post-castration reversed the alterations in density and maturity        of dendritic spines of hippocampal neurons and behavioral disorders in WT mice;        however, it did not reveal such effects in Fmr1 KO mice. Further,        immunohistochemical staining and western blotting analyses after knocking down        miR-125a revealed similar effects of castration and post-castration DHT        supplementation on PSD95 protein expression. These findings clarified that FMRP        mediated the effects of DHT through miR-125a in regulating the expression of        hippocampal synaptic protein PSD95.

Here, we report a panel of        microRNAs (miRNAs) in serum that can predict P-tau/Aβ42 in CSF and readily        differentiate AD from other dementias, including vascular dementia (VaD),        Parkinson disease dementia (PDD), behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia        (bvFTD), and dementia with Lewy body (DLB). METHODS: RNA samples were extracted        from the participant's blood. P-tau/Aβ42 of CSF was examined for diagnostic        purposes. A pilot study (controls, 21; AD, 23), followed by second (controls,        216; AD, 190) and third groups (controls, 153; AD, 151), is used to establish and        verify a predictive model of P-tau/Aβ42 in CSF.

More recently, microRNAs        have been detected extracellularly and circulating in blood and other body        fluids, where they are protected from degradation by encapsulation in vesicles,        such as exosomes, or by association with proteins. These microRNAs are thought to        be released from cells selectively through active processes and taken up by        specific target cells within the same or in remote tissues where they are able to        exert their repressive function. These characteristics make extracellular        microRNAs ideal candidates for intercellular communication over short and long        distances. This review aims to explore the potential mechanisms underlying        microRNA communication within the nervous system and between the nervous system        and other tissues.

However, the regulation of VEGFR-2 expression during        development is not yet well understood. As microRNAs are considered to be key        players during neuronal maturation and regenerative processes, we identified the        two microRNAs (miRNAs)-miR-129-5p and miR-130a-3p-that may have an impact on        VEGFR-2 expression in young and mature sensory and lower motor neurons. The        expression level of VEGFR-2 was analyzed by using in situ hybridization, RT-qPCR,        Western blot, and immunohistochemistry in developing rats. microRNAs were        validated within the spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia. To unveil the molecular        impact of our candidate microRNAs, dissociated cell cultures of sensory and lower        motor neurons were transfected with mimics and inhibitors. We depicted        age-dependent VEGFR-2 expression in sensory and lower motor neurons. In detail,        in lower motor neurons, VEGFR-2 expression was significantly reduced during        maturation, in conjunction with an increased level of miR-129-5p. In sensory        dorsal root ganglia, VEGFR-2 expression increased during maturation and was        accompanied by an overexpression of miR-130a-3p. In a second step, the functional        significance of these microRNAs with respect to VEGFR-2 expression was proven.        Whereas miR-129-5p seems to decrease VEGFR-2 expression in a direct manner in the        CNS, miR-130a-3p might indirectly control VEGFR-2 expression in the PNS.

To date, ZIKV mechanism of        infection and pathogenesis is not entirely understood and different studies on        gene regulation of ZIKV-infected cells have identified a dysregulation of        inflammatory and stem cell maintenance pathways. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are        post-transcriptional regulators of cellular genes and they contribute to cell        development in normal function and disease. Previous reports with integrative        analyses of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and miRNAs during ZIKV infection have not        identified neurological pathway defects. We hypothesized that dysregulation of        pathways involved in neurological functions will be identified by RNA profiling        of ZIKV-infected fetal neurons. We therefore used microarrays to analyze gene        expression levels following ZIKV infection of fetal murine neurons. We observed        that the expression levels of transcription factors such as neural PAS domain        protein 4 (Npas4) and of three members of the orphan nuclear receptor 4 (Nr4a)        were severely decreased after viral infection. We confirmed that their        downregulation was at both the mRNA level and at the protein level. The        dysregulation of these transcription factors has been previously linked to        aberrant neural functions and development. We next examined the miRNA expression        profile in infected primary murine neurons by microarray and found that various        miRNAs were dysregulated upon ZIKV infection. An integrative analysis of the        differentially expressed miRNAs and mRNAs indicated that miR-7013-5p targets        Nr4a3 gene. Using miRmimics, we corroborated that miR-7013-5p downregulates Nr4a3        mRNA and protein levels. Our data identify a profound dysregulation of neural        transcription factors with an overexpression of miR-7013-5p that results in        decreased Nr4a3 expression, likely a main contributor to ZIKV-induced neuronal        dysfunction.",25746ae249163d2e3e86d7f17af0a8818f211cf7,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/25746ae249163d2e3e86d7f17af0a8818f211cf7,34048439,PMC8191876,,False,PLoS neglected tropical diseases,101291488,0.4253068268299103,0.010309278350515464,5,4.781,0.31343283582089554,0.2835820895522388,0.22126799819514945

In both Huntington's disease        (HD) models and human samples, altered expression of miRNAs involved in synapse        regulation was reported. Recently, the use of EV cargo to reverse phenotypic        alterations in disease models with synaptopathy as the end result of the        pathophysiological cascade has become an interesting possibility. Methods: Here,        we assessed the contribution of EVs to GABAergic synaptic alterations using a        human HD model and studied the miRNA content of isolated EVs. Results: After        differentiating human induced pluripotent stem cells into electrophysiologically        active striatal-like GABAergic neurons, we found that HD-derived neurons        displayed reduced density of inhibitory synapse markers and GABA        receptor-mediated ionotropic signaling. Treatment with EVs secreted by control        (CTR) fibroblasts reversed the deficits in GABAergic synaptic transmission and        increased the density of inhibitory synapses in HD-derived neuron cultures, while        EVs from HD-derived fibroblasts had the opposite effects on CTR-derived neurons.        Moreover, analysis of miRNAs from purified EVs identified a set of differentially        expressed miRNAs between manifest HD, premanifest, and CTR lines with predicted        synaptic targets.

With such simple CNS,        mollusks yet display sufficiently complex behavior, thus ideal for various        studies of behavioral processes, including long-term memory (LTM) formation. For        our research, we use the formation of the fear avoidance reflex in the        terrestrial mollusk Helix lucorum as a learning model. We have shown previously        that LTM formation in Helix requires epigenetic modifications of histones leading        to both activation and inactivation of the specific genes. It is known that        microRNAs (miRNAs) negatively regulate the expression of genes; however, the role        of miRNAs in behavioral regulation has been poorly investigated. Currently, there        is no miRNAs sequencing data being published on Helix lucorum, which makes it        impossible to investigate the role of miRNAs in the memory formation of this        mollusk. In this study, we have performed sequencing and comparative        bioinformatics analysis of the miRNAs from the CNS of Helix lucorum. We have        identified 95 different microRNAs, including microRNAs belonging to the MIR-9,        MIR-10, MIR-22, MIR-124, MIR-137, and MIR-153 families, known to be involved in        various CNS processes of vertebrates and other species, particularly, in the fear        behavior and LTM. We have shown that in the CNS of Helix lucorum MIR-10 family        (26 miRNAs) is the most representative one, including Hlu-Mir-10-S5-5p and        Hlu-Mir-10-S9-5p as top hits. Moreover, we have shown the involvement of the        MIR-10 family in LTM formation in Helix. The expression of 17 representatives of        MIR-10 differentially changes during different periods of LTM consolidation in        the CNS of Helix. In addition, using comparative analysis of microRNA expression        upon learning in normal snails and snails with deficient learning abilities with        dysfunction of the serotonergic system, we identified a number of microRNAs from        several families, including MIR-10, which expression changes only in normal        animals.

Sequences in 3' UTRs confer alterations in mRNA stability,        direct mRNA localization to subcellular regions, and impart translational        control. Thousands of mRNAs are localized to subcellular compartments in        neurons-including axons, dendrites, and synapses-where they are thought to        undergo local translation. Despite an established role for 3' UTR sequences in        imparting mRNA localization in neurons, the specific RNA sequences and structural        features at play remain poorly understood.

The        regulation of APA in neurons and the neuronal functions of longer 3' UTR mRNA        isoforms are starting to be uncovered. Surprising roles for 3' UTRs are emerging        beyond the regulation of protein synthesis and include roles as RBP delivery        scaffolds and regulators of alternative splicing. Evidence is also emerging that        3' UTRs can be cleaved, leading to stable, isolated 3' UTR fragments which are of        unknown function.

At presynaptic and postsynaptic sites, far from the        cell body, local protein synthesis is utilized to continually modify the synaptic        proteome, enabling rapid changes in protein production to support synaptic        function. Synapses undergo diverse forms of plasticity, resulting in long-term,        persistent changes in synapse strength, which are paramount for learning, memory,        and cognition. It is now well-established that local translation of numerous        synaptic proteins is essential for many forms of synaptic plasticity, and much        work has gone into deciphering the strategies that neurons use to regulate        activity-dependent protein synthesis. Recent studies have pointed to a        coordination of the local mRNA translation required for synaptic plasticity and        the trafficking of membranous organelles in neurons.

Melatonin receptor 2 (MT2) is        widely expressed in the hippocampus and mediates the biological functions of        melatonin. It is known that melatonin application is protective to dendritic        abnormalities in AD. However, whether MT2 is involved in the neuroprotection and        the underlying mechanisms are not clear. Here, we first found that MT2 is        dramatically reduced in the dendritic compartment upon the insult of oligomer Aβ.        MT2 activation prevented the Aβ-induced disruption of dendritic complexity and        spine. Importantly, activation of MT2 decreased cAMP, which in turn inactivated        transcriptional factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α(C/EBPα) to suppress        miR-125b expression and elevate the expression of its target, GluN2A. In        addition, miR-125b mimics fully blocked the protective effects of MT2 activation        on dendritic trees and spines. Finally, injection of a lentivirus containing a        miR-125b sponge into the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice effectively rescued the        dendritic abnormalities and learning/memory impairments.

Current PD treatments are symptomatic, wear off over time and do        not protect against DA neuronal loss. Finding a way to re-grow midbrain DA (mDA)        neurons is a promising disease-modifying therapeutic strategy for PD. However,        reliable biomarkers are required to allow such growth-promoting approaches to be        applied early in the disease progression. miR-181a has been shown to be        dysregulated in PD patients, and has been identified as a potential biomarker for        PD. Despite studies demonstrating the enrichment of miR-181a in the brain,        specifically in neurites of postmitotic neurons, the role of miR-181a in mDA        neurons remains unknown. Herein, we used cell culture models of human mDA neurons        to investigate a potential role for miR-181a in mDA neurons. We used a        bioninformatics analysis to identify that miR-181a targets components of the bone        morphogenetic protein (BMP) signalling pathway, including the transcription        factors Smad1 and Smad5, which we find are expressed by rat mDA neurons and are        required for BMP-induced neurite growth.

The role        of glyphosate in neurotoxicity has been reported in human and animal models.        However, the detailed mechanism of the role of glyphosate in neuronal development        remains unknown. Recently, several studies have reported evidence linking        neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) with gestational glyphosate exposure. The        current group previously identified microRNAs (miRNAs) that are associated with        the etiology of NDDs, but their expression levels in the developing brain        following glyphosate exposure have not been characterized. In the present study,        miRNA expression patterns were evaluated in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of 28        postnatal day mouse offspring following glyphosate exposure during pregnancy and        lactation. An miRNA microarray detected 55 upregulated and 19 downregulated        miRNAs in the PFC of mouse offspring, and 20 selected deregulated miRNAs were        further evaluated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A total of 11        targets of these selected deregulated miRNAs were analyzed using bioinformatics.        Gene Ontology (GO) terms associated with the relevant miRNAs included        neurogenesis (GO:0050769), neuron differentiation (GO:0030182) and brain        development (GO:0007420). The genes Cdkn1a, Numbl, Notch1, Fosl1 and Lef1 are        involved in the Wnt and Notch signaling pathways, which are closely associated        with neural development. PCR arrays for the mouse Wnt and Notch signaling        pathways were used to validate the effects of glyphosate on the expression        pattern of genes involved in the Wnt and Notch pathways. Nr4a2 and Wnt7b were        downregulated, while Dkk1, Dixdc1, Runx1, Shh, Lef-1 and Axin2 were upregulated        in the PFC of mice offspring following glyphosate exposure during pregnancy and        lactation. These results indicated abnormalities of the Wnt/β-catenin and Notch        pathways.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the role and mechanism of        miR-181a-5p in sevoflurane-induced hippocampal neuronal injury. Primary        hippocampal neurons were identified using microscopy and immunofluorescence. The        viability and apoptosis of sevoflurane anesthesia-induced neurons were detected        by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and terminal-deoxynucleoitidyl        transferase-mediated nick end-labeling (TUNEL) staining assay, respectively. The        levels of apoptosis- and oxidative stress-related proteins as well as the markers        in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway were examined by immunoblotting.        Enzyme-linked immuno-sorbent assays were performed to examine the levels of        inflammatory cytokines. Luciferase reporter assay was conducted to validate the        combination between miR-181a-5p and DEAD-box helicase 3, X-linked (DDX3X).        Sevoflurane exposure led to significantly inhibited hippocampal neuron viability        and elevated miR-181a-5p expression. Knockdown of miR-181a-5p alleviated        sevoflurane-induced neuron injury by reducing cell apoptosis, inflammatory        response, and oxidative stress. Additionally, DDX3X was targeted and negatively        regulated by miR-181a-5p. Moreover, miR-181a-5p inhibitor activated the        Wnt/β-catenin pathway via DDX3X in sevoflurane-treated cells. Rescue experiments        revealed that DDX3X knockdown or overexpression of Wnt antagonist Dickkopf-1        (DKK1) reversed the suppressive effects of miR-181a-5p inhibitor on cell        apoptosis, inflammatory response, and oxidative stress in sevoflurane-treated        neuronal cells.

However, the underlying mechanisms are not entirely understood. METHODS: Rat        models of VCI were established with cerebral ischemia using occlusion of the        middle cerebral artery or bilateral common carotid artery. The brain structure        and function imaging were measured through animal MRI. miRNA expression was        detected by chip and qPCR. Synaptic functional plasticity was detected using        electrophysiological techniques. RESULTS: This study demonstrated the enhancement        of Regional Homogeneity (ReHo) activity of blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD)        signal in the entorhinal cortical (EC) and hippocampus (HIP) in response to EA        treatment. miR-219a was selected and confirmed to be elevated in HIP and EC in        VCI but decreased after EA. N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor1 (NMDAR1) was        identified as the target gene of miR-219a. miR-219a regulated NMDAR-mediated        autaptic currents, spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSC), and        long-term potentiation (LTP) of the EC-HIP CA1 circuit influencing synaptic        plasticity. EA was able to inhibit miR-219a, enhancing synaptic plasticity of the        EC-HIP CA1 circuit and increasing expression of NMDAR1 while promoting the        phosphorylation of downstream calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II        (CaMKII), improving overall learning and memory in VCI rat models.

Methyl        CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) is a positive mediator of BDNF and is regulated by        miR-132-3p. In the present study, we explored the possible molecular mechanism of        miR-132, focusing on the involvement of MeCP2 and BDNF in the formation of        anxiety-like symptoms of PTSD. Single prolonged stress (SPS) was used to        establish a model of PTSD in adult rats and the anxiety-like behavior was tested        by the elevated plus-maze (EPM).

These complex        diseases seem to have a heritable component; however, genome-wide association        studies failed to identify the genetic loci involved in the etiology. So, how can        these changes be transmitted from one generation to the next?

The formation of        m6A is catalyzed by a methyltransferase complex including methyltransferase-like        3 (METTL3) as a key factor. However, the in vivo functions of METTL3 and m6A        modification in mammalian development remain unclear. Here, we show that specific        inactivation of Mettl3 in mouse nervous system causes severe developmental        defects in the brain. Mettl3 conditional knockout (cKO) mice manifest cerebellar        hypoplasia caused by drastically enhanced apoptosis of newborn cerebellar granule        cells (CGCs) in the external granular layer (EGL).

METHODS: Goat skeletal muscle satellite cells isolated in the        pre-laboratory were used as the test material. First, the expression of        miR-188-5p in goat muscle tissues at different developmental stages was detected        by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). In        addition, miR-188-5p was transfected into goat skeletal muscle satellite cells by        constructing mimics and inhibitors of miR-188-5p, respectively.

High relapse rates, which is a hallmark of drug addiction,        prompt the study of changes in Wnt signaling elements (Wnt5a, Wnt7b, and Ctnnb1)        in the motivational aspects of cocaine use and early drug-free period (3 days        after the last exposure to cocaine). For this purpose, an animal model of        intravenous cocaine self-administration and two types of drug-free period        (extinction training and abstinence in the home cage) were used. The studies        showed that chronic cocaine self-administration mainly disturbs the expression of        Wnt5a and Ctnnb1 (the gene encoding β-catenin) in the examined brain structures        (striatum and hippocampus), and the examined types of early abstinence are        characterized by a different pattern of changes in the expression of these genes.        At the same time, in cocaine self-administrated animals, there were no changes in        the level of Wnt5a and β-catenin proteins at the tested time points. Moreover,        exposure to cocaine induces a significant reduction in the striatal and        hippocampal expression of miR-374 and miR-544, which can regulate Wnt5a levels        post-transcriptionally. In summary, previous observations from        experimenter-administered cocaine have not been fully validated in the cocaine        self-administration model. Yoked cocaine administration appears to disrupt Wnt        signaling more than cocaine self-administration. The condition of the        cocaine-free period, the routes of drug administration, and the motivational        aspect of drug administration play an important role in the type of drug-induced        molecular changes observed. Furthermore, in-depth research involving additional        brain regions is needed to determine the exact role of Wnt signaling in        short-term and long-lasting plasticity as well as in the motivational aspects of        cocaine use, and thus to assess its potential as a target for new drug therapy        for cocaine use disorder.",12d0f87d1bdf761a1f70eb8192c588eb2503f9ab,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/12d0f87d1bdf761a1f70eb8192c588eb2503f9ab,36430488,PMC9693497,,False,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,0.04672495648264885,0.0,2,6.208,0.22388059701492538,0.6268656716417911,0.14162942724330213
