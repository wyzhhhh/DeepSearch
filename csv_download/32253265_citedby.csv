32253265,"Tumor Microenvironment Is Critical for the Maintenance of Cellular States Found        in Primary Glioblastomas.",10.1158/2159-8290.CD-20-0057,"Glioblastoma (GBM), an incurable tumor, remains difficult to model and more        importantly to treat due to its genetic/epigenetic heterogeneity and plasticity        across cellular states. The ability of current tumor models to recapitulate the        cellular states found in primary tumors remains unexplored. To address this        issue, we compared single-cell RNA sequencing of tumor cells from 5 patients        across four patient-specific glioblastoma stem cell (GSC)-derived model types,        including glioma spheres, tumor organoids, glioblastoma cerebral organoids        (GLICO), and patient-derived xenografts. We find that GSCs within the GLICO model        are enriched for a neural progenitor-like cell subpopulation and recapitulate the        cellular states and their plasticity found in the corresponding primary parental        tumors. These data demonstrate how the contribution of a neuroanatomically        accurate human microenvironment is critical and sufficient for recapitulating the        cellular states found in human primary GBMs, a principle that may likely apply to        other tumor models. SIGNIFICANCE: It has been unclear how well different        patient-derived GBM models are able to recreate the full heterogeneity of primary        tumors. Here, we provide a complete transcriptomic characterization of the major        model types. We show that the microenvironment is crucial for recapitulating GSC        cellular states, highlighting the importance of tumor-host cell interactions.See        related commentary by Luo and Weiss, p. 907.This article is highlighted in the In        This Issue feature, p. 890.",PMC10256258,Cancer discovery,101561693

However, little is known about        how the spatial organization of GBM genomes underlies this heterogeneity and its        effects. Here, we compile a cohort of 28 patient-derived glioblastoma stem        cell-like lines (GSCs) known to reflect the properties of their tumor-of-origin;        six of these were primary-relapse tumor pairs from the same patient. We generate        and analyze 5â€‰kbp-resolution chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) data from all        GSCs to systematically map thousands of standalone and complex structural        variants (SVs) and the multitude of neoloops arising as a result. By combining        Hi-C, histone modification, and gene expression data with chromatin folding        simulations, we explain how the pervasive, uneven, and idiosyncratic occurrence        of neoloops sustains tumor-specific transcriptional programs via the formation of        new enhancer-promoter contacts. We also show how even moderately recurrent        neoloops can relate to patient-specific vulnerabilities. Together, our data        provide a resource for dissecting GBM biology and heterogeneity, as well as for        informing therapeutic approaches.",PMC11082206,Nature communications,101528555

The mainstay of therapy remains        maximal safe surgical resection followed by concurrent radiation therapy and        temozolomide chemotherapy. Despite intensive investigation, alternative treatment        options, such as immunotherapy or targeted molecular therapy, have yielded        limited success to achieve long-term remission. This difficulty is partly due to        the lack of pre-clinical models that fully recapitulate the intratumoral and        intertumoral heterogeneity of GBM and the complex tumor microenvironment.        Recently, GBM 3D organoids originating from resected patient tumors, genetic        manipulation of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived brain organoids and        bio-printing or fusion with non-malignant tissues have emerged as novel culture        systems to portray the biology of GBM.

Here we describe        long-term GLICOs, a novel model in which COs are grown from embryonic stem cell        cultures containing low levels of GSCs and tumor development is monitored over        extended durations (ltGLICOs). Single-cell profiling of ltGLICOs revealed an        unexpectedly long latency period prior to GSC expansion, and that normal organoid        development was unimpaired by the presence of low numbers of GSCs. However, as        organoids age they experience chronic hypoxia and oxidative stress which remodels        the tumor microenvironment to promote GSC expansion. Receptor-ligand modelling        identified astrocytes, which secreted various pro-tumorigenic ligands including        FGF1, as the primary cell type for GSC crosstalk and single-cell multi-omic        analysis revealed these astrocytes were under the control of ischemic regulatory        networks. Functional validation confirmed hypoxia as a driver of pro-tumorigenic        astrocytic ligand secretion and that GSC expansion was accelerated by        pharmacological induction of oxidative stress. When controlled for genotype, the        close association between glioma aggressiveness and patient age has very few        proposed biological explanations.

However, with the advent and explosion of        next-generation sequencing, cancer phenotypes are turning out to be far more        heterogenous than initially thought, and the classification is continually being        updated to include more subtypes. Tumors are indeed highly dynamic, and they can        evolve and undergo various changes in their characteristics during disease        progression. The picture becomes even more complex when the tumor responds to a        therapy. In all these cases, cancer cells acquire the ability to        transdifferentiate, changing subtype, and adapt to changing microenvironments.        These modifications affect the tumor's growth rate, invasiveness, response to        treatment, and overall clinical behavior. Studying tumor subtype transitions is        crucial for understanding tumor evolution, predicting disease outcomes, and        developing personalized treatment strategies.

Our previous studies have revealed that LINC00691 is        up-regulated in serum of GC patients as a novel potential biomarker for GC        diagnosis and prognosis. However, the roles of serum exosomal LINC00691 in GC has        not been clarified. This study aimed to find the expression pattern of serum        exosomal LINC00691 in GC patients and the correlation between the level of serum        exosomal LINC00691 and the pathology of gastric cancer patients. METHODS: We        collected the serum of 94 GC patients before surgery and extracted exosomes to        detect the expression level of exosomal LINC00691, with 21 healthy volunteers and        17 patients with benign gastric diseases as controls. Surgical GC tissues and        paired healthy tissues were collected to culture primary cancer-associated        fibroblasts (CAFs) and normal fibroblasts (NFs). We then treated NFs with        LINC00691-rich GC cell culture supernatant or exosomes and detected the        activation markers and biological functions of the fibroblasts. RESULTS: The        results of real-time qPCR indicated that the serum exosomal LINC00691 of GC        patients was significantly higher than that of healthy subjects and patients with        benign gastric diseases, and was associated with the clinicopathology of GC        patients. More interestingly, when the NFs were treated with GC exosomes, the        level of LINC00691 was significantly increased, the cell proliferation and        migration were noticeably enhanced, and the ability to accelerate GC cell        proliferation and invasion was promoted, which means that the induced fibroblasts        gained the properties of CAFs.

GSCs can be divided into the mesenchymal        (MES) and proneural (PN) subtypes, and these two subtypes of GSCs can undergo        interconversion under certain conditions. MES GSCs have higher malignancy and        radioresistance and are closely associated with an immunosuppressive        microenvironment. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play a broad role in GBM, while        the role of GSCs subtype remains unknown. Methods: We performed RNA sequencing to        explore the lncRNA expression profile in MES- and PN-subtype GBM tissues. The        biological function of a host gene-MIR222HG-in GBM development was confirmed in        vitro and in vivo. Specifically, RNA sequencing, RNA pulldown, mass spectrometry,        RIP, ChIP, luciferase reporter assays and Co-IP were performed. Results:        MIR222HG, the expression of which can be induced by SPI1, has high levels in MES        GBM tissues. Functionally, we demonstrated that MIR222HG promotes the MES        transition and radioresistance in GSCs in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically,        MIR222HG can bind to the YWHAE/HDAC5 complex to promote the MES transition of        GSCs through H4 deacetylation. Moreover, cotranscribed miR221 and miR222 can be        delivered to macrophages via exosomes to target SOCS3, causing immunosuppressive        polarization. Finally, PLX-4720 sensitivity is associated with SPI1 expression        and acts on MES GSCs to enhance radiosensitivity. Conclusions: This study        demonstrates that targeting SPI1 to block transcription of the MIR222HG cluster        helps to reduce radioresistance and combat the immunosuppressive microenvironment        in GBM.

In this study, we investigate the role of the transcription factor        TCF12 in the regulation of GBM proliferation using human and murine GBM cell        lines and an in vivo GBM xenograft model. Our study shows that TCF12 deficiency        severely impairs proliferation of tumor cells in vitro by disrupting/blocking the        G1 to S phase transition.

METHODS: A        glioma-related TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) cohort and a CGGA (Chinese Glioma        Genome Atlas) cohort were incorporated into this study. Variance expression        profiling was executed via the ""limma"" R package. The ""clusterProfiler"" R package        was applied to perform a GO (Gene Ontology) analysis. The Kaplan-Meier (K-M)        curve, LASSO regression analysis, and Cox analyses were implemented to determine        the prognostic genes. A fibroblast-related risk model was created and affirmed by        independent cohorts. We derived enriched pathways between the fibroblast-related        high- and low-risk subgroups using gene set variation analysis (GSEA). The immune        infiltration cell and the stromal cell were calculated using the microenvironment        cell populations-counter (MCP-counter) method, and the immunotherapy response was        assessed with the SubMap algorithm. The chemotherapy sensitivity was estimated        using the ""pRRophetic"" R package. RESULTS: A total of 93 differentially expressed        fibroblast-related genes (DEFRGs) were uncovered in glioma. Seven prognostic        genes were filtered out to create a fibroblast-related gene signature in the        TCGA-glioma cohort training set. We then affirmed the fibroblast-related risk        model via TCGA-glioma cohort and CGGA-glioma cohort testing sets. The Cox        regression analysis proved that the fibroblast-related risk score was an        independent prognostic predictor in prediction of the overall survival of glioma        patients. The fibroblast-related gene signature revealed by the GSEA was        applicable to the immune-relevant pathways. The MCP-counter algorithm results        pointed to significant distinctions in the tumor microenvironment between        fibroblast-related high- and low-risk subgroups. The SubMap analysis proved that        the fibroblast-related risk score could predict the clinical sensitivity of        immunotherapy. The chemotherapy sensitivity analysis indicated that low-risk        patients were more sensitive to multiple chemotherapeutic drugs.

The inherently cold tumor immune        microenvironment (TIME) in gliomas, characterized by a high ratio of pro-tumor to        anti-tumor immune cell infiltrates, acts as a seemingly insurmountable barrier to        immunotherapy. Glioma stem cells (GSCs) within these tumors are key contributors        to this cold TIME, often functioning indirectly through activation and        recruitment of pro-tumor immune cell types.

Results: The immune and stromal components in TME were negatively        related to patient prognosis. Differentially expressed genes sharing immune score        and stromal score were mainly involved in the immune response. C-C chemokine        receptor type 5 (CCR5), as only a hub gene, was significantly higher in LGG        patients than normal patients and negatively correlated with the prognosis of        patients.

Results: M2-like TAMs infiltration was elevated in high-grade gliomas.        TGFBI was preferentially secreted by M2-like TAMs and associated with a poor        prognosis for patients with GBM.

Increasing evidence shows that        glioblastoma (GBM) cells display prominent intrinsic plasticity and reversibly        adapt to dynamic microenvironmental conditions. Limited genetic evolution at        recurrence further suggests that resistance mechanisms also largely operate at        the phenotypic level. Here we review recent literature underpinning the role of        GBM plasticity in creating gradients of heterogeneous cells including those that        carry cancer stem cell (CSC) properties. A historical perspective from the        hierarchical to the nonhierarchical concept of CSCs towards the recent        appreciation of GBM plasticity is provided. Cellular states interact dynamically        with each other and with the surrounding brain to shape a flexible tumor        ecosystem, which enables swift adaptation to external pressure including        treatment. We present the key components regulating intra-tumoral phenotypic        heterogeneity and the equilibrium of phenotypic states, including genetic,        epigenetic, and microenvironmental factors. We further discuss plasticity in the        context of intrinsic tumor resistance, where a variable balance between        preexisting resistant cells and adaptive persisters leads to reversible        adaptation upon treatment. Innovative efforts targeting regulators of plasticity        and mechanisms of state transitions towards treatment-resistant states are needed        to restrict the adaptive capacities of GBM.",PMC9071273,Neuro-oncology,100887420

METHODS: We combine        multiplexed drug perturbation in acute slice culture from freshly resected tumors        with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to profile transcriptome-wide drug        responses in individual patients. We applied this approach to drug perturbations        on slices derived from six glioblastoma (GBM) resections to identify conserved        drug responses and to one additional GBM resection to identify patient-specific        responses. RESULTS: We used scRNA-seq to demonstrate that acute slice cultures        recapitulate the cellular and molecular features of the originating tumor tissue        and the feasibility of drug screening from an individual tumor. Detailed        investigation of etoposide, a topoisomerase poison, and the histone deacetylase        (HDAC) inhibitor panobinostat in acute slice cultures revealed cell type-specific        responses across multiple patients.

To clarify the reliability of the        method, we got the LAFs derived tumor cells from three different tumor mass of        HXEX-ALL1 xenografts. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, HXWMF-1 is the first        fibroblastic tumor cell line derived from LAFs or CAFs. In addition, the cell        line provided firm evidence for that leukemia cells may induce LAFs/CAFs        malignant transformation, which may help to develop brand new theory and        therapeutic strategies for patients with relapsed /refractory ALL.",PMC7977166,Cancer cell international,101139795

Here we describe        a method for culturing human glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) in 3D by co-culturing        them with pluripotent stem cell-derived brain organoids. This requires multiple        coordinated steps, including the generation of cerebral organoids, and the growth        and fluorescence tagging of GSCs. We highlight how to recognize optimal organoid        generation and how to efficiently mark GSCs, before describing optimized        co-culture conditions. We show that GSCs can efficiently integrate into brain        organoids and maintain a significant degree of cell fate heterogeneity, paving        the way for the analysis of GSC fate behavior and lineage progression.

Cellular heterogeneity and extensive        invasion of surrounding brain tissues are characteristic features of GBM that        contribute to its intractability. Current GBM model systems do not recapitulate        some of the complex features of GBM and have not produced sufficiently-effective        treatments. This has cast doubt on the effectiveness of current GBM models and        drug discovery paradigms.

However, a systematic investigation        into the prognostic value of AS events in glioblastoma (GBM) is urgently        required. The gene expression profile and matched AS events data of GBM patients        were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas Project (TCGA) and TCGA SpliceSeq        database, respectively. 775 AS events were identified as prognostic factors using        univariate Cox regression analysis. The least absolute shrinkage and selection        operator (LASSO) cox model was performed to narrow down candidate AS events, and        a risk score model based on several AS events were developed subsequently. The        risk score-based signature was proved as an efficient predictor of overall        survival and was closely related to the tumor purity and immunosuppression in        GBM. Combined similarity network fusion and consensus clustering (SNF-CC)        analysis revealed two distinct GBM subtypes based on the prognostic AS events,        and the associations between this novel molecular classification and        clinicopathological factors, immune cell infiltration, as well as immunogenic        features were further explored. We also constructed a regulatory network to        depict the potential mechanisms that how prognostic splicing factors (SFs)        regulate splicing patterns in GBM.

Our understanding of tumor homeostasis is limited by a lack of        genetic tools to selectively identify tumor states and fate transitions. Here, we        use glioblastoma subtype signatures to construct synthetic genetic tracing        cassettes and investigate tumor heterogeneity at cellular and molecular levels,        in vitro and in vivo. Through synthetic locus control regions, we demonstrate        that proneural glioblastoma is a hardwired identity, whereas mesenchymal        glioblastoma is an adaptive and metastable cell state driven by proinflammatory        and differentiation cues and DNA damage, but not hypoxia. Importantly, we        discovered that innate immune cells divert glioblastoma cells to a        proneural-to-mesenchymal transition that confers therapeutic resistance. Our        synthetic genetic tracing methodology is simple, scalable, and widely applicable        to study homeostasis in development and diseases. In glioblastoma, the method        causally links distinct (micro)environmental, genetic, and pharmacologic        perturbations and mesenchymal commitment. SIGNIFICANCE: Glioblastoma is        heterogeneous and incurable. Here, we designed synthetic reporters to reflect the        transcriptional output of tumor cell states and signaling pathways' activity.        This method is generally applicable to study homeostasis in normal tissues and        diseases.

Neural stem cells (NSCs) are the main cell type in the SVZ region and        exhibit tumor-homing ability. AIM: To evaluate the effects of conditioned medium        (CM) derived from SVZ NSCs on the cancer-related behaviors of glioma cells.        METHODS: The characteristics of SVZ hNSCs were identified by immunofluorescence.        The normoxic-hNSC-CM and hypoxic-hNSC-CM (3% O(2), oxygen-glucose deprived [OGD]        culturing) were collected from 80%-90% confluent SVZ NSCs in sterile conditions.        The CCK8 and Transwell assays were used to compare and evaluate the effects of        normoxic-CM and hypoxic-CM on glioma proliferation and invasion. Then proteins        secreted from SVZ NSCs into the CM were investigated by mass spectrometry, and        the potential effects of candidate protein NCAN in the regulation of glioma        progression were examined by CCK8 and Transwell assays. RESULTS: The CM from SVZ        NSCs significantly increased the proliferation and invasion of glioma cells,        particularly the CM from OGD NSCs induced under hypoxic conditions. Furthermore,        the secreted protein neurocan (NCAN) in CM from OGD NSCs was identified by        proteomic analysis. NCAN was expressed in glioma cells and played regulatory        roles in mediating the progression of glioma cells mainly via the        Rho/Rho-associated protein kinase pathway. CONCLUSION: Our study identified a        potential interactive mechanism between SVZ NSCs and glioma cells, in which SVZ        NSCs promote glioma progression via the secreted protein NCAN. These findings        suggested that exploring the CM derived from cells could be a novel strategy for        optimizing treatments and that NCAN derived from SVZ NSCs may be a potential new        target in glioma progression.",PMC7705462,World journal of stem cells,101535826

METHODS:        Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7)        were used to investigate the psychological condition of GBM patients in our        department. To further explore the potential mechanism, bioinformatic methods        were used to screen out genes that could be indicators of outcome in GBM,        followed by gene ontology (GO) analysis, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes        (KEGG) analysis, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis. Further,        cellular experiments were conducted to evaluate the proliferation, migration        capacity of primary GBM cells from the patients. RESULTS: It was revealed that        patients with higher PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores had significantly worse prognosis        than their lower-scored counterparts.
