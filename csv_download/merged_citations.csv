10.3390/bioengineering11040325,Endothelial Reprogramming in Atherosclerosis.,2024.0,"Atherosclerosis (AS) is a severe vascular disease that results in millions of        cases of mortality each year. The development of atherosclerosis is associated        with vascular structural lesions, characterized by the accumulation of immune        cells, mesenchymal cells, lipids, and an extracellular matrix at the intimal        resulting in the formation of an atheromatous plaque. AS involves complex        interactions among various cell types, including macrophages, endothelial cells        (ECs), and smooth muscle cells (SMCs). Endothelial dysfunction plays an essential        role in the initiation and progression of AS. Endothelial dysfunction can        encompass a constellation of various non-adaptive dynamic alterations of biology        and function, termed ""endothelial reprogramming"". This phenomenon involves        transitioning from a quiescent, anti-inflammatory state to a pro-inflammatory and        proatherogenic state and alterations in endothelial cell identity, such as        endothelial to mesenchymal transition (EndMT) and endothelial-to-immune cell-like        transition (EndIT). Targeting these processes to restore endothelial balance and        prevent cell identity shifts, alongside modulating epigenetic factors, can        attenuate atherosclerosis progression. In the present review, we discuss the role        of endothelial cells in AS and summarize studies in endothelial reprogramming        associated with the pathogenesis of AS.",4ccad93734b70abf212cb57511f4b9cecbc22aed,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4ccad93734b70abf212cb57511f4b9cecbc22aed,38671747,PMC11048243,background,False,"Bioengineering (Basel, Switzerland)",101676056

Although considerable progress has been made in        understanding the transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms of iCM reprogramming,        its translational regulation remains largely unexplored. Here, we characterized        the translational landscape of iCM reprogramming through integrative ribosome and        transcriptomic profiling, and found extensive translatome repatterning during        this process. Loss of function screening for translational regulators uncovered        Ybx1 as a critical barrier to iCM induction. In a mouse model of myocardial        infarction, removing Ybx1 enhanced in vivo reprogramming, resulting in improved        heart function and reduced scar size. Mechanistically, Ybx1 depletion        de-repressed the translation of its direct targets SRF and Baf60c, both of which        mediated the effect of Ybx1 depletion on iCM generation. Furthermore, removal of        Ybx1 allowed single factor Tbx5-mediated iCM conversion. In summary, this study        revealed a new layer of regulatory mechanism that controls cardiac reprogramming        at the translational level.",618f57cae9d1d2c132f31f755d2eb29215022722,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/618f57cae9d1d2c132f31f755d2eb29215022722,38524149,PMC10959502,result,False,Nature cardiovascular research,9918284280206676

However, the limited        improvement in cardiac function calls for enhanced strategies. We reported        enhanced efficacy of our miR reprogramming cocktail miR combo (miR-1, miR-133a,        miR-208a, and miR-499) via RNA-sensing receptor stimulation. We hypothesized that        we could combine RNA-sensing receptor activation with fibroblast reprogramming by        chemically modifying miR combo. To test the hypothesis, miR combo was modified to        enhance interaction with the RNA-sensing receptor Rig1 via the addition of a        5'-triphosphate (5'ppp) group. Importantly, when compared with unmodified miR        combo, 5'ppp-modified miR combo markedly improved reprogramming efficacy        in vitro. Enhanced reprogramming efficacy correlated with a type-I interferon        immune response with strong and selective secretion of interferon β (IFNβ).        Antibody blocking studies and media replacement experiments indicated that        5'ppp-miR combo utilized IFNβ to enhance fibroblast reprogramming efficacy.

However, the efficacy, cellular maturity and        specific targeting are still major challenges of direct reprogramming. Here we        describe novel approaches in direct reprogramming that address these challenges.

Direct cardiac        reprogramming is a recently emerged promising approach to repair damaged        myocardium by directly converting resident cardiac fibroblasts into        cardiomyocyte-like cells. The achievement of in vivo direct reprogramming of        fibroblasts has been shown, by multiple laboratories independently, to improve        cardiac function and mitigate fibrosis post-myocardial infarction, which holds        great potential for clinical application.

10.1186/s41065-023-00297-6,Construction and validation of a cuproptosis-related diagnostic gene signature        for atrial fibrillation based on ensemble learning.,2023.0,"BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common type of cardiac        arrhythmia. Nonetheless, the accurate diagnosis of this condition continues to        pose a challenge when relying on conventional diagnostic techniques. Cell death        is a key factor in the pathogenesis of AF. Existing investigations suggest that        cuproptosis may also contribute to AF. This investigation aimed to identify a        novel diagnostic gene signature associated with cuproptosis for AF using ensemble        learning methods and discover the connection between AF and cuproptosis. RESULTS:        Two genes connected to cuproptosis, including solute carrier family 31 member 1        (SLC31A1) and lipoic acid synthetase (LIAS), were selected by integration of        random forests and eXtreme Gradient Boosting algorithms. Subsequently, a        diagnostic model was constructed that includes the two genes for AF using the        Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) algorithm with good performance (the        area under the curve value > 0.75). The microRNA-transcription factor-messenger        RNA network revealed that homeobox A9 (HOXA9) and Tet methylcytosine dioxygenase        1 (TET1) could target SLC31A1 and LIAS in AF. Functional enrichment analysis        indicated that cuproptosis might be connected to immunocyte activities.        Immunocyte infiltration analysis using the CIBERSORT algorithm suggested a        greater level of neutrophils in the AF group. According to the outcomes of        Spearman's rank correlation analysis, there was a negative relation between        SLC31A1 and resting dendritic cells and eosinophils. The study found a positive        relationship between LIAS and eosinophils along with resting memory CD4(+) T        cells. Conversely, a negative correlation was detected between LIAS and CD8(+) T        cells and regulatory T cells. CONCLUSIONS: This study successfully constructed a        cuproptosis-related diagnostic model for AF based on the LightGBM algorithm and        validated its diagnostic efficacy. Cuproptosis may be regulated by HOXA9 and TET1        in AF.

How c-JUN regulates human cardiomyocyte cell        fate remains unknown. Here, we used the in vitro differentiation of human        pluripotent stem cells into cardiomyocytes to study the role of c-JUN.        Surprisingly, the knockout of c-JUN improved cardiomyocyte generation, as        determined by the number of TNNT2+ cells. ATAC-seq data showed that the c-JUN        defect led to increased chromatin accessibility on critical regulatory elements        related to cardiomyocyte development. ChIP-seq data showed that the knockout        c-JUN increased RBBP5 and SETD1B expression, leading to improved H3K4me3        deposition on key genes that regulate cardiogenesis. The c-JUN KO phenotype could        be copied using the histone demethylase inhibitor CPI-455, which also        up-regulated H3K4me3 levels and increased cardiomyocyte generation. Single-cell        RNA-seq data defined three cell branches, and knockout c-JUN activated more        regulons that are related to cardiogenesis.

However, this process has been less successful        in human cells, thus limiting the potential clinical applicability of this        technology in regenerative medicine. We hypothesized that this issue is due to a        lack of cross-species concordance between the required transcription factor        combinations for mouse and human cells. To address this issue, we identified        novel transcription factor candidates to induce cell conversion between human        fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes, using the network-based algorithm Mogrify. We        developed an automated, high-throughput method for screening transcription        factor, small molecule, and growth factor combinations, utilizing acoustic liquid        handling and high-content kinetic imaging cytometry. Using this high-throughput        platform, we screened the effect of 4960 unique transcription factor combinations        on direct conversion of 24 patient-specific primary human cardiac fibroblast        samples to cardiomyocytes. Our screen revealed the combination of MYOCD, SMAD6,        and TBX20 (MST) as the most successful direct reprogramming combination, which        consistently produced up to 40% TNNT2(+) cells in just 25 days. Addition of FGF2        and XAV939 to the MST cocktail resulted in reprogrammed cells with spontaneous        contraction and cardiomyocyte-like calcium transients. Gene expression profiling        of the reprogrammed cells also revealed the expression of cardiomyocyte        associated genes. Together, these findings indicate that cardiac direct        reprogramming in human cells can be achieved at similar levels to those attained        in mouse fibroblasts.

The        heart has limited regenerative potential; therefore, lost cardiac tissue cannot        be replenished after cardiac injury. Conventional therapies are unable to restore        functional cardiac tissue. In recent decades, much attention has been paid to        regenerative medicine to overcome this issue. Direct reprogramming is a promising        therapeutic approach in regenerative cardiac medicine that has the potential to        provide in situ cardiac regeneration. It consists of direct cell fate conversion        of one cell type into another, avoiding transition through an intermediary        pluripotent state. In injured cardiac tissue, this strategy directs        transdifferentiation of resident non-myocyte cells (NMCs) into mature functional        cardiac cells that help to restore the native tissue. Over the years,        developments in reprogramming methods have suggested that regulation of several        intrinsic factors in NMCs can help to achieve in situ direct cardiac        reprogramming. Among NMCs, endogenous cardiac fibroblasts have been studied for        their potential to be directly reprogrammed into both induced cardiomyocytes and        induced cardiac progenitor cells, while pericytes can transdifferentiate towards        endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells.

However, the common mechanisms governing how reprogramming        cells undergo transcriptome and epigenome remodeling (i.e., regulatome        remodeling) have not been investigated. Here, by characterizing early changes in        the regulatome of three different types of direct reprogramming, we identify        lineage-specific features as well as common regulatory transcription factors. Of        particular interest, we discover that the neuronal factor Ascl1 possesses        cross-lineage potential; together with Mef2c, it drives efficient cardiac        reprogramming toward a mature and induced cardiomyocyte phenotype. Through        ChIP-seq and RNA-seq, we find that MEF2C drives the shift in ASCL1 binding away        from neuronal genes toward cardiac genes, guiding their co-operative epigenetic        and transcription activities.

However, it        is insufficient to generate functional induced cardiomyocytes from human        fibroblasts using conventional reprogramming cocktails, and the underlying        molecular mechanisms are not well studied. METHODS: To discover potential missing        factors for human direct reprogramming, we performed transcriptomic comparison        between human induced cardiomyocytes and functional cardiomyocytes. RESULTS: We        identified TBX20 (T-box transcription factor 20) as the top cardiac gene that is        unable to be activated by the MGT133 reprogramming cocktail (MEF2C, GATA4, TBX5,        and miR-133). TBX20 is required for normal heart development and cardiac function        in adult cardiomyocytes, yet its role in cardiac reprogramming remains undefined.        We show that the addition of TBX20 to the MGT133 cocktail (MGT+TBX20) promotes        cardiac reprogramming and activates genes associated with cardiac contractility,        maturation, and ventricular heart. Human induced cardiomyocytes produced with        MGT+TBX20 demonstrated more frequent beating, calcium oscillation, and higher        energy metabolism as evidenced by increased mitochondria numbers and        mitochondrial respiration. Mechanistically, comprehensive transcriptomic,        chromatin occupancy, and epigenomic studies revealed that TBX20 colocalizes with        MGT reprogramming factors at cardiac gene enhancers associated with heart        contraction, promotes chromatin binding and co-occupancy of MGT factors at these        loci, and synergizes with MGT for more robust activation of target gene        transcription. CONCLUSIONS: TBX20 consolidates MGT cardiac reprogramming factors        to activate cardiac enhancers to promote cardiac cell fate conversion. Human        induced cardiomyocytes generated with TBX20 showed enhanced cardiac function in        contractility and mitochondrial respiration.",f41e95df717eda4441cd6ee8cbcdc3857003b969,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f41e95df717eda4441cd6ee8cbcdc3857003b969,36102189,PMC9662826,,False,Circulation,147763

We        previously identified PU.1, IRF8, and BATF3 transcription factors as sufficient        to induce cDC1 fate in mouse fibroblasts, but reprogramming of human somatic        cells was limited by low efficiency. Here, we investigated single-cell        transcriptional dynamics during human cDC1 reprogramming. Human induced cDC1s        (hiDC1s) generated from embryonic fibroblasts gradually acquired a global cDC1        transcriptional profile and expressed antigen presentation signatures, whereas        other DC subsets were not induced at the single-cell level during the        reprogramming process.

Rat cardiac        fibroblasts treated with GMT + ETV2 demonstrated calcium transients upon        electrical stimulation and contractility synchronous with surrounding neonatal        cardiomyocytes, whereas cells treated with GMT or ETV2 alone failed to contract        in co-culture experiments. Human cardiac fibroblasts treated with ETV2 and then        GMT likewise demonstrated greater prevalence of cTnT expression than did cells        treated with GMT alone (2.8-fold increase, p < 0.05).

Similarly, patients suffering        from coronary artery disease can opt to do nothing; stop progression and treat        their symptoms with medical therapy; or undergo revascularization either        percutaneously or surgically. There are few options, however, for those who        develop chronic coronary artery disease without suitable revascularization        strategies. They have missed their exit and are stuck in this metaphorical        traffic jam, with no radio and no cell phone. These patients may experience        refractory angina or develop ischemic cardiomyopathy and heart failure. Exploring        solutions to this increasingly widespread problem is imperative. Chronic heart        failure is rising, while the number of organs available for transplantation        remains limited. Similarly, bridge therapies such as ventricular assist devices        are resource intensive and are typically only performed at select, high-volume        institutions. In the following article, the authors explore cardiac regenerative        strategies to bridge this therapeutic gap.

The induced        fibroblasts (>80%) showed phenotypic changes as indicated by an Nkx2.5 cardiac        enhancer reporter.

Transcriptomic analysis showed that cell cycle and        heart development pathways were important to accelerate CPC formation during the        early reprogramming stage. The CRISPR system opened the silenced chromatin locus,        thereby allowing transcriptional factors to access their own promoters and        eventually forming a positive feedback loop. The regenerative potential of ciCPCs        was assessed after implantation in mouse myocardial infarction models. The        engrafted ciCPCs differentiated into cardiovascular cells in vivo but also        significantly improved contractile function and scar formation.

However, the use of stem cells has limitations, and        therefore, ""direct cardiac reprogramming"" is emerging as an alternative        treatment. Myocardial regeneration transdifferentiates cardiac fibroblasts into        cardiomyocytes in situ.Three cardiogenic transcription factors: Gata4, Mef2c, and        Tbx5 (GMT) can induce direct reprogramming of fibroblasts into induced        cardiomyocytes (iCMs), in mice. However, in humans, additional factors, such as        Mesp1 and Myocd, are required. Inflammation and immune responses hinder the        reprogramming process in mice, and epigenetic modifiers such as TET1 are involved        in direct cardiac reprogramming in humans. The three main approaches to improving        reprogramming efficiency are (1) improving direct cardiac reprogramming factors,        (2) improving cell culture conditions, and (3) regulating epigenetic factors.        miR-133 is a potential candidate for the first approach. For the second approach,        inhibitors of TGF-β and Wnt signals, Akt1 overexpression, Notch signaling pathway        inhibitors, such as DAPT ((S)-tert-butyl 2-((S)-2-(2-(3,5-difluorophenyl)        acetamido) propanamido)-2-phenylacetate), fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2,        FGF-10, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF: FFV) can influence        reprogramming. Reducing the expression of Bmi1, which regulates the        mono-ubiquitination of histone H2A, alters histone modification, and subsequently        the reprogramming efficiency, in the third approach. In addition, diclofenac, a        non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, and high level of Mef2c overexpression        could improve direct cardiac reprogramming.Direct cardiac reprogramming needs        improvement if it is to be used in humans, and the molecular mechanisms involved        remain largely elusive.

Due to the limited regenerative capacity of adult hearts, the        damage caused by heart injury cannot be reversed and eventually progress into        heart failure. In need of cardiovascular disease treatment, many therapies aimed        at either cell transplantation or cell regeneration have been proposed. Direct        reprogramming of somatic cells into induced cardiomyocytes (iCMs) is considered        to be a promising strategy for regenerative medicine. The induction of        cardiomyocytes from non-myocytes can be achieved efficiently via ectopic        expression of reprogramming factors both in vitro and in vivo in the mouse model,        however, the generation of human induced cardiomyocyte-like cells (hiCMs) remains        challenging. The inefficiency of hiCMs production called for the identification        of the additional epigenetic memories in non-myocytes which might be damping the        hiCM reprogramming. Here, we conducted an unbiased loss-of-function screening        focusing on epigenetic regulators and identified enhancer of zeste homolog 2        (EZH2) as an important epigenetic barrier during hiCM reprogramming. We found        that the removal of EZH2 via genetic knockdown or treatment of EZH2 selective        degrader significantly increased the hiCM reprogramming efficiency and led to        profound activation of cardiac genes and repression of collagen and extracellular        matrix genes. Furthermore, EZH2 inhibitors targeting its catalytic activity also        promotes hiCM reprogramming, suggesting that EZH2 may restrain cardiac conversion        through H3K27me3-mediated gene repression. Indeed, genomic profiling of H3K27me3        revealed a subset of cardiac genes that remain repressed with high levels of        H3K27me3 despite of the delivery of the reprogramming factors. Inhibition of        EZH2, however, leads to reduced H3K27me3 occupancy and robust activation of these        cardiac genes. Taken together, our data suggested that EZH2 inhibition        facilitates the activation of cardiac genes in fibroblasts and eases the        production of hiCMs.",9d9673fcf2a3279c4b0c6d97b0c93ddff8c7c5eb,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9d9673fcf2a3279c4b0c6d97b0c93ddff8c7c5eb,34087994,PMC8238038,"methodology,background",True,Stem cell research,101316957

Although the        majority of the cardiac mass is composed of cardiomyocytes, cardiac fibroblasts        (CFs) are one type of most numerous cells in the heart and the primary drivers of        fibrosis, which prevents ventricular rupture immediately after MI but the        fibrotic scar expansion and LV dilatation can eventually lead to heart failure.        However, embryonic CFs produce cytokines that can activate proliferation in        cultured cardiomyocytes, and the structural proteins produced by CFs may regulate        cardiomyocyte cell-cycle activity by modulating the stiffness of the        extracellular matrix (ECM). CFs can also be used to generate induced-pluripotent        stem cells and induced cardiac progenitor cells, both of which can differentiate        into cardiomyocytes and vascular cells, but cardiomyocytes appear to be more        readily differentiated from iPSCs that have been reprogrammed from CFs than from        other cell types. Furthermore, the results from recent studies suggest that        cultured CFs, as well as the CFs present in infarcted hearts, can be reprogrammed        directly into cardiomyocytes. This finding is very exciting as should we be able        to successfully increase the efficiency of this reprogramming, we could        remuscularize the injured ventricle and restore the LV function without need the        transplantation of cells or cell products.

However, the effectiveness of        reprogramming is notably low. We have recently demonstrated that the        effectiveness of reprogramming fibroblasts into heart muscle cells        (cardiomyocytes) is increased by the addition of RNA-sensing receptor ligands.        Clinical use of these ligands is problematic due to their ability to induce        adverse inflammatory events. To overcome this issue, we sought to determine        whether synthetic analogs of natural RNA-sensing receptor ligands, which avoid        generating inflammatory insults and are nuclease resistant, would similarly        enhance fibroblast reprogramming into cardiomyocytes. Indeed, one such stabilized        RNA, ICR2, increased the expression of cardiomyocyte-specific mRNAs in        reprogrammed fibroblasts. Moreover, ICR2 enhanced the ability of reprogramming        factors to produce cardiomyocytes with mature sarcomeres.

Here, we show that autophagy-related 5 (Atg5)-dependent autophagy, an        evolutionarily conserved self-digestion process, was induced and required for iCM        reprogramming. Unexpectedly, the autophagic factor Beclin1 (Becn1) was found to        suppress iCM induction in an autophagy-independent manner.

ROS mainly act through several targets        (such as kinases and transcription factors) and have diverse roles in different        stages of cardiac differentiation, proliferation, and maturation. Therefore,        further detailed investigation and characterization of redox signaling will help        the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of ROS during different cellular        processes and enable the design of targeted strategies to foster cardiac        regeneration and functional recovery.

Thus,        proper timing and level of ROS generation after a myocardial injury need to be        tailored to ensure the maximal efficacy of regenerative therapies and avoid        undesired damage.",14554ae465b54ded0a48d04cd052b9ca3c974f50,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/14554ae465b54ded0a48d04cd052b9ca3c974f50,32908625,PMC7475763,background,False,Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity,101479826
10.1016/j.xpro.2019.100010,An Optimized Protocol for Human Direct Cardiac Reprogramming.,2020.0,"Direct cardiac reprogramming, the conversion of fibroblasts into        cardiomyocyte-like cells (iCMs), is an attractive approach to heal the injured        heart. Here we present a new approach to human cardiac reprogramming that        utilizes a polycistronic three-factor reprogramming cocktail and one microRNA.        Our protocol produces cardiac Troponin T positive human iCMs (hiCMs) at an        efficiency of 40%-60%, approximately double that of previous protocols, within        just 2 weeks. The resulting hiCMs display cardiomyocyte-like sarcomere structure,        gene expression, and calcium oscillation. For complete details on the use and        execution of this protocol, please refer to Zhou et al.

10.1161/JAHA.119.015686,Enhanced Generation of Induced Cardiomyocytes Using a Small-Molecule Cocktail to        Overcome Barriers to Cardiac Cellular Reprogramming.,2020.0,"Background Given known inefficiencies in reprogramming of fibroblasts into mature        induced cardiomyocytes (iCMs), we sought to identify small molecules that would        overcome these barriers to cardiac cell transdifferentiation. Methods and Results        We screened alternative combinations of compounds known to impact cell        reprogramming using morphologic and functional cell differentiation assays in        vitro. After screening 6 putative reprogramming factors, we found that a        combination of the histone deacetylase inhibitor sodium butyrate, the WNT        inhibitor ICG-001, and the cardiac growth regulator retinoic acid (RA) maximally        enhanced iCM generation from primary rat cardiac fibroblasts when combined with        administration of the cardiodifferentiating transcription factors Gata4, Mef2C,        and Tbx5 (GMT) compared with GMT administration alone (23±1.5% versus 3.3±0.2%;        P<0.0001). Expression of the cardiac markers cardiac troponin T, Myh6, and Nkx2.5        was upregulated as early as 10 days after GMT-sodium butyrate, ICG-001, and RA        treatment. Human iCM generation was likewise enhanced when administration of the        human cardiac reprogramming factors GMT, Hand2, and Myocardin plus miR-590 was        combined with sodium butyrate, ICG-001, and RA compared with GMT, Hand2, and        Myocardin plus miR-590 treatment alone (25±1.3% versus 5.7±0.4%; P<0.0001). Rat        and human iCMs also more frequently demonstrated spontaneous beating in coculture        with neonatal cardiomyocytes with the addition of sodium butyrate, ICG-001, and        RA to transcription factor cocktails compared with transcription factor treatment        alone. Conclusions The combined administration of histone deacetylase and WNT        inhibitors with RA enhances rat and human iCM generation induced by transcription        factor administration alone. These findings suggest opportunities for improved        translational approaches for cardiac regeneration.",405c020c53f97f7d9aadbbb6f4e201b5973cee9a,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/405c020c53f97f7d9aadbbb6f4e201b5973cee9a,32500803,PMC7429035,,False,Journal of the American Heart Association,101580524
10.3389/fmicb.2020.00361,Single-Cell Analysis of Foot-and-Mouth Disease Virus.,2020.0,"With the rapid development of single-cell technologies, the mechanisms underlying        viral infections and the interactions between hosts and viruses are starting to        be explored at the single-cell level. The foot-and-mouth-disease (FMD) virus        (FMDV) causes an acute and persistent infection that can result in the break-out        of FMD, which can have serious effects on animal husbandry. Single-cell        techniques have emerged as powerful approaches to analyze virus infection at the        resolution of individual cells. In this review, the existing single-cell studies        examining FMDV will be systematically summarized, and the central themes of these        studies will be presented.",d827cd67a6d6f44171d1b1903414d8a8f867e0a8,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d827cd67a6d6f44171d1b1903414d8a8f867e0a8,32194538,PMC7066083,,False,Frontiers in microbiology,101548977
10.3390/cells8070679,Ameliorating the Fibrotic Remodeling of the Heart through Direct Cardiac        Reprogramming.,2019.0,"Coronary artery disease is the most common form of cardiovascular diseases,        resulting in the loss of cardiomyocytes (CM) at the site of ischemic injury. To        compensate for the loss of CMs, cardiac fibroblasts quickly respond to injury and        initiate cardiac remodeling in an injured heart. In the remodeling process,        cardiac fibroblasts proliferate and differentiate into myofibroblasts, which        secrete extracellular matrix to support the intact structure of the heart, and        eventually differentiate into matrifibrocytes to form chronic scar tissue.        Discovery of direct cardiac reprogramming offers a promising therapeutic strategy        to prevent/attenuate this pathologic remodeling and replace the cardiac fibrotic        scar with myocardium in situ. Since the first discovery in 2010, many progresses        have been made to improve the efficiency and efficacy of reprogramming by        understanding the mechanisms and signaling pathways that are activated during        direct cardiac reprogramming. Here, we overview the development and recent        progresses of direct cardiac reprogramming and discuss future directions in order        to translate this promising technology into an effective therapeutic paradigm to        reverse cardiac pathological remodeling in an injured heart.",0c559cd1b8c5beaeb27abe9ab3edffdc9e1e705a,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0c559cd1b8c5beaeb27abe9ab3edffdc9e1e705a,31277520,PMC6679082,,False,Cells,101600052
