Many methods for data integration have been        developed for the identification of key elements that explain or predict disease        risk or other biological outcomes. The heterogeneous graph representation of        multi-omics data provides an advantage for discerning patterns suitable for        predictive/exploratory analysis, thus permitting the modeling of complex        relationships. Graph-based approaches-including graph neural networks-potentially        offer a reliable methodological toolset that can provide a tangible alternative        to scientists and clinicians that seek ideas and implementation strategies in the        integrated analysis of their omics sets for biomedical research. Graph-based        workflows continue to push the limits of the technological envelope, and this        perspective provides a focused literature review of research articles in which        graph machine learning is utilized for integrated multi-omics data analyses, with        several examples that demonstrate the effectiveness of graph-based approaches.",853a7dffa87fbdddf9fb63f836ee648d0fd268e4,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/853a7dffa87fbdddf9fb63f836ee648d0fd268e4,38729996,,,False,British journal of cancer,370635
10.1186/s12911-024-02521-3,Exploring machine learning strategies for predicting cardiovascularÂ disease risk        factors from multi-omic data.,2024.0,"BACKGROUND: Machine learning (ML) classifiers are increasingly used for        predicting cardiovascular disease (CVD) and related risk factors using omics        data, although these outcomes often exhibit categorical nature and class        imbalances. However, little is known about which ML classifier, omics data, or        upstream dimension reduction strategy has the strongest influence on prediction        quality in such settings. Our study aimed to illustrate and compare different        machine learning strategies to predict CVD risk factors under different        scenarios. METHODS: We compared the use of six ML classifiers in predicting CVD        risk factors using blood-derived metabolomics, epigenetics and transcriptomics        data. Upstream omic dimension reduction was performed using either unsupervised        or semi-supervised autoencoders, whose downstream ML classifier performance we        compared. CVD risk factors included systolic and diastolic blood pressure        measurements and ultrasound-based biomarkers of left ventricular diastolic        dysfunction (LVDD; E/e' ratio, E/A ratio, LAVI) collected from 1,249 Finnish        participants, of which 80% were used for model fitting. We predicted individuals        with low, high or average levels of CVD risk factors, the latter class being the        most common. We constructed multi-omic predictions using a meta-learner that        weighted single-omic predictions. Model performance comparisons were based on the        F1 score. Finally, we investigated whether learned omic representations from        pre-trained semi-supervised autoencoders could improve outcome prediction in an        external cohort using transfer learning. RESULTS: Depending on the ML classifier        or omic used, the quality of single-omic predictions varied. Multi-omics        predictions outperformed single-omics predictions in most cases, particularly in        the prediction of individuals with high or low CVD risk factor levels.        Semi-supervised autoencoders improved downstream predictions compared to the use        of unsupervised autoencoders. In addition, median gains in Area Under the Curve        by transfer learning compared to modelling from scratch ranged from 0.09 to 0.14        and 0.07 to 0.11 units for transcriptomic and metabolomic data, respectively.        CONCLUSIONS: By illustrating the use of different machine learning strategies in        different scenarios, our study provides a platform for researchers to evaluate        how the choice of omics, ML classifiers, and dimension reduction can influence        the quality of CVD risk factor predictions.",ad6c26fed31dc4c6ac9d4689aadb7215ffcf4ba7,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ad6c26fed31dc4c6ac9d4689aadb7215ffcf4ba7,38698395,PMC11064347,methodology,False,BMC medical informatics and decision making,101088682

However, current methods ignore the potential        correlations between samples in integrating multi-omics data. In addition,        providing accurate biological explanations still poses significant challenges due        to the complexity of deep learning models. Therefore, there is an urgent need for        a deep learning-based multi-omics integration method to explore the potential        correlations between samples and provide model interpretability. Herein, we        propose a novel interpretable multi-omics data integration method (DeepKEGG) for        cancer recurrence prediction and biomarker discovery. In DeepKEGG, a biological        hierarchical module is designed for local connections of neuron nodes and model        interpretability based on the biological relationship between genes/miRNAs and        pathways. In addition, a pathway self-attention module is constructed to explore        the correlation between different samples and generate the potential pathway        feature representation for enhancing the prediction performance of the model.        Lastly, an attribution-based feature importance calculation method is utilized to        discover biomarkers related to cancer recurrence and provide a biological        interpretation of the model. Experimental results demonstrate that DeepKEGG        outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in 5-fold cross validation.

Large-scale and        multi-dimensional analyses of entire cancer genomes, as exemplified by projects        like The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), have yielded an extensive repository of data        that holds the potential to unveil the underlying biology of these malignancies.        Mutations stand out as the principal catalysts of cellular transformation.        Nonetheless, other global genomic processes, such as alterations in gene        expression and chromosomal re-arrangements, also play crucial roles in conferring        cellular immortality. The incorporation of multi-omics data specific to cancer        has demonstrated the capacity to enhance our comprehension of the molecular        mechanisms underpinning carcinogenesis. This report elucidates how the        integration of comprehensive data on methylation, gene expression, and copy        number variations can effectively facilitate the unsupervised clustering of        cancer samples. We have identified regressors that can effectively classify tumor        and normal samples with an optimal integration of RNA sequencing, DNA        methylation, and copy number variation while also achieving significant p-values.        Further, these regressors were trained using linear and logistic regression with        k-means clustering. For comparison, we employed autoencoder- and stacking-based        omics integration and computed silhouette scores to evaluate the clusters. The        proof of concept is illustrated using liver cancer data. Our analysis serves to        underscore the feasibility of unsupervised cancer classification by considering        genetic markers beyond mutations, thereby emphasizing the clinical relevance of        additional global cellular parameters that contribute to the transformative        process in cells.

Here, we explored more possibilities about it and developed        the R package CWGCNA (causal WGCNA), which works from the traditional WGCNA        pipeline but mines more information. It couples a mediation model with WGCNA, so        the causal relationships among WGCNA modules, module features, and phenotypes can        be found, demonstrating whether the module change causes the phenotype change or        vice versa. After that, when annotating the module gene set functions, it uses a        novel network-based method, considering the modules' topological structures and        capturing their influence on the gene set functions. In addition to conducting        these biological explorations, CWGCNA also contains a machine learning section to        perform clustering and classification on multi-omics data, given the increasing        popularity of this data type. Some basic functions, such as differential feature        identification, are also available in our package.

Current multi-omics integration methods typically output lists, clusters, or        subnetworks of molecules related to an outcome. Even with expert domain        knowledge, discerning the biological processes involved is a time-consuming        activity. Here we propose PathIntegrate, a method for integrating multi-omics        datasets based on pathways, designed to exploit knowledge of biological systems        and thus provide interpretable models for such studies. PathIntegrate employs        single-sample pathway analysis to transform multi-omics datasets from the        molecular to the pathway-level, and applies a predictive single-view or        multi-view model to integrate the data. Model outputs include multi-omics        pathways ranked by their contribution to the outcome prediction, the contribution        of each omics layer, and the importance of each molecule in a pathway. Using        semi-synthetic data we demonstrate the benefit of grouping molecules into        pathways to detect signals in low signal-to-noise scenarios, as well as the        ability of PathIntegrate to precisely identify important pathways at low effect        sizes.

Integrating multi-omics data represents a viable approach to comprehending the        intricate pathophysiology of complex diseases like cancer. Conventional machine        learning techniques are not ideal for analyzing the complex interrelationships        among different categories of omics data. Numerous models have been suggested        using graph-based learning to uncover veiled representations and network        formations unique to distinct types of omics data to heighten predictions        regarding cancers and characterize patients' profiles, amongst other applications        aimed at improving disease management in medical research. The existing        graph-based state-of-the-art multi-omics integration approaches for cancer        subtype prediction, MOGONET, and SUPREME, use a graph convolutional network        (GCN), which fails to consider the level of importance of neighboring nodes on a        particular node. To address this gap, we hypothesize that paying attention to        each neighbor or providing appropriate weights to neighbors based on their        importance might improve the cancer subtype prediction. The natural choice to        determine the importance of each neighbor of a node in a graph is to explore the        graph attention network (GAT). Here, we propose MOGAT, a novel multi-omics        integration approach, leveraging GAT models that incorporate graph-based learning        with an attention mechanism. MOGAT utilizes a multi-head attention mechanism to        extract appropriate information for a specific sample by assigning unique        attention coefficients to neighboring samples. Based on our knowledge, our group        is the first to explore GAT in multi-omics integration for cancer subtype        prediction. To evaluate the performance of MOGAT in predicting cancer subtypes,        we explored two sets of breast cancer data from TCGA and METABRIC. Our proposed        approach, MOGAT, outperforms MOGONET by 32% to 46% and SUPREME by 2% to 16% in        cancer subtype prediction in different scenarios, supporting our hypothesis.

Although researchers have begun to study cancer        differentiation and subtype prediction, most of relevant methods are based on        traditional machine learning and rely on single omics data. It is necessary to        explore a deep learning algorithm that integrates multi-omics data to achieve        classification prediction of cancer differentiation and subtypes. Methods: This        paper proposes a multi-omics data fusion algorithm based on a multi-view graph        neural network (MVGNN) for predicting cancer differentiation and subtype        classification. The model framework consists of a graph convolutional network        (GCN) module for learning features from different omics data and an attention        module for integrating multi-omics data. Three different types of omics data are        used. For each type of omics data, feature selection is performed using methods        such as the chi-square test and minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR).        Weighted patient similarity networks are constructed based on the selected omics        features, and GCN is trained using omics features and corresponding similarity        networks. Finally, an attention module integrates different types of omics        features and performs the final cancer classification prediction. Results: To        validate the cancer classification predictive performance of the MVGNN model, we        conducted experimental comparisons with traditional machine learning models and        currently popular methods based on integrating multi-omics data using 5-fold        cross-validation.

Accurate cancer subtype        classification is critical for patient diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis.        Ever-increasing multi-omics data describes the characteristics of the patients        from different views and serves as complementary information to promote cancer        subtype identification. However, omics data generally have different        distributions and high dimensions. How to effectively integrate multiple omics        data to classify cancer subtypes accurately is a challenge for researchers. This        work proposes a method integrating multi-omics data based on supervised graph        contrast learning (MCRGCN) to classify cancer subtypes. The method considers the        unique feature distribution of each omics data and the interaction of different        omics data features to improve the accuracy of cancer subtype classification. To        achieve this, MCRGCN first constructs different sample networks based on the        multi-omics data of the samples. Then, it puts the omics data and adjacency        matrix of the sample into different residual graph convolution models to get        multi-omics features of the samples, which are trained with a supervised        comparison loss to maintain that the sample features of each omics should be as        consistent as possible. Finally, we input the sample features combining        multi-omics features into a classifier to obtain the cancer subtypes. We applied        MCRGCN to the invasive breast carcinoma (BRCA) and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM)        datasets, integrating gene expression, miRNA expression, and DNA methylation        data.

Each omics technique only provides a limited view of the underlying biological        process and integrating heterogeneous omics layers simultaneously would lead to a        more comprehensive and detailed understanding of diseases and phenotypes.        However, one obstacle faced when performing multi-omics data integration is the        existence of unpaired multi-omics data due to instrument sensitivity and cost.        Studies may fail if certain aspects of the subjects are missing or incomplete. In        this paper, we propose a deep learning method for multi-omics integration with        incomplete data by Cross-omics Linked unified embedding with Contrastive Learning        and Self Attention (CLCLSA). Utilizing complete multi-omics data as supervision,        the model employs cross-omics autoencoders to learn the feature representation        across different types of biological data. The multi-omics contrastive learning        is employed, which maximizes the mutual information between different types of        omics. In addition, the feature-level self-attention and omics-level        self-attention are employed to dynamically identify the most informative features        for multi-omics data integration. Finally, a Softmax classifier is employed to        perform multi-omics data classification. Extensive experiments were conducted on        four public multi-omics datasets.

Current multi-omics integration methods typically output lists, clusters, or        subnetworks of molecules related to an outcome. Even with expert domain        knowledge, discerning the biological processes involved is a time-consuming        activity. Here we propose PathIntegrate, a method for integrating multi-omics        datasets based on pathways, designed to exploit knowledge of biological systems        and thus provide interpretable models for such studies. PathIntegrate employs        single-sample pathway analysis to transform multi-omics datasets from the        molecular to the pathway-level, and applies a predictive single-view or        multi-view model to integrate the data. Model outputs include multi-omics        pathways ranked by their contribution to the outcome prediction, the contribution        of each omics layer, and the importance of each molecule in a pathway. Using        semi-synthetic data we demonstrate the benefit of grouping molecules into        pathways to detect signals in low signal-to-noise scenarios, as well as the        ability of PathIntegrate to precisely identify important pathways at low effect        sizes.

Supervised ensemble methods have gained popularity in recent years for        multi-omics data analysis. However, existing research based on supervised        learning algorithms often fails to fully harness the information from unlabeled        nodes and overlooks the latent features within and among different omics, as well        as the various associations among features. Here, we present a novel multi-omics        integrative method MOSEGCN, based on the Transformer multi-head self-attention        mechanism and Graph Convolutional Networks(GCN),        withÂ theÂ aimÂ ofÂ enhancingÂ theÂ accuracyÂ ofÂ complexÂ diseaseÂ classification. MOSEGCN        first employs the Transformer multi-head self-attention mechanism and Similarity        Network Fusion (SNF) to separately learn the inherent correlations of latent        features within and among different omics, constructing a comprehensive view of        diseases. Subsequently, it feeds the learned crucial information into a        self-ensembling Graph Convolutional Network (SEGCN) built upon semi-supervised        learning methods for training and testing, facilitating a better analysis and        utilization of information from multi-omics data to achieve precise        classification of disease subtypes. RESULTS: The experimental results show that        MOSEGCN outperforms several state-of-the-art multi-omics integrative analysis        approaches on three types of omics data: mRNA expression data, microRNA        expression data, and DNA methylation data, with accuracy rates of 83.0% for        Alzheimer's disease and 86.7% for breast cancer subtyping. Furthermore, MOSEGCN        exhibits strong generalizability on the GBM dataset, enabling the identification        of important biomarkers for related diseases.

The        volume, variety and velocity of toxicological data from legacy studies,        literature, high-throughput assays, sensor technologies and omics approaches        create opportunities but also complexities that AI can help address. In        particular, machine learning is well suited to handle and integrate large,        heterogeneous datasets that are both structured and unstructured-a key challenge        in modern toxicology. AI methods like deep neural networks, large language        models, and natural language processing have successfully predicted toxicity        endpoints, analyzed high-throughput data, extracted facts from literature, and        generated synthetic data. Beyond automating data capture, analysis, and        prediction, AI techniques show promise for accelerating quantitative risk        assessment by providing probabilistic outputs to capture uncertainties.

Dysregulation of miRNA expression and function has been linked to a        variety of diseases including cancer. They play a complex role in cancers, having        both tumour suppressor and promoter properties. In addition, a single miRNA can        be involved in regulating several mRNAs or many miRNAs can regulate a single        mRNA, therefore assessing these roles is essential to a better understanding in        cancer initiation and development. Pancreatic cancer is a leading cause of cancer        death worldwide, in part due to the lack of diagnostic tools and limited        treatment options. The most common form of pancreatic cancer, pancreatic ductal        adenocarcinoma (PDAC), is characterised by major genetic mutations that drive        cancer initiation and progression. The regulation or interaction of miRNAs with        these cancer driving mutations suggests a strong link between the two.

Integrating multi-omics data has been proven to be effective for        building more precise classification models. Most current multi-omics integrative        models use either an early fusion in the form of concatenation or late fusion        with a separate feature extractor for each omic, which are mainly based on deep        neural networks. Due to the nature of biological systems, graphs are a better        structural representation of bio-medical data. Although few graph neural network        (GNN) based multi-omics integrative methods have been proposed, they suffer from        three common disadvantages. One is most of them use only one type of connection,        either inter-omics or intra-omic connection; second, they only consider one kind        of GNN layer, either graph convolution network (GCN) or graph attention network        (GAT); and third, most of these methods have not been tested on a more complex        classification task, such as cancer molecular subtypes. RESULTS: In this study,        we propose a novel end-to-end multi-omics GNN framework for accurate and robust        cancer subtype classification. The proposed model utilizes multi-omics data in        the form of heterogeneous multi-layer graphs, which combine both inter-omics and        intra-omic connections from established biological knowledge. The proposed model        incorporates learned graph features and global genome features for accurate        classification. We tested the proposed model on the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)        Pan-cancer dataset and TCGA breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA) dataset for        molecular subtype and cancer subtype classification, respectively. The proposed        model shows superior performance compared to four current state-of-the-art        baseline models in terms of accuracy, F1 score, precision, and recall.

Proximal femoral        strengths for specific loading conditions can be computed by subject-specific        finite element analysis (FEA) using quantitative computerized tomography (QCT)        images. However, the radiation and availability of QCT limit its clinical        usability. Alternative low-dose and widely available measurements, such as dual        energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and genetic factors, would be preferable for        bone strength assessment. The aim of this paper is to design a deep        learning-based model to predict proximal femoral strength using multi-view        information fusion. RESULTS: We developed new models using multi-view variational        autoencoder (MVAE) for feature representation learning and a product of expert        (PoE) model for multi-view information fusion. We applied the proposed models to        an in-house Louisiana Osteoporosis Study (LOS) cohort with 931 male subjects,        including 345 African Americans and 586 Caucasians. We performed genome-wide        association studies (GWAS) to select 256 genetic variants with the lowest        p-values for each proximal femoral strength and integrated whole genome sequence        (WGS) features and DXA-derived imaging features to predict proximal femoral        strength. The best prediction model for fall fracture load was acquired by        integrating WGS features and DXA-derived imaging features. The designed models        achieved the mean absolute percentage error of 18.04%, 6.84% and 7.95% for        predicting proximal femoral fracture loads using linear models of fall loading,        nonlinear models of fall loading, and nonlinear models of stance loading,        respectively. CONCLUSION: The proposed models are capable of predicting proximal        femoral strength using WGS features and DXA-derived imaging features.

However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms        behind this association remain elusive. With emerging multimodal data for these        mechanisms, machine learning methods can be applied for phenotype prediction at        different scales, but due to the black-box nature of machine learning,        integrating these modalities and interpreting biological mechanisms can be        challenging. Additionally, the partial availability of these multimodal data        presents a challenge in developing these predictive models. METHOD: To address        these challenges, we developed DeepGAMI, an interpretable neural network model to        improve genotype-phenotype prediction from multimodal data. DeepGAMI leverages        functional genomic information, such as eQTLs and gene regulation, to guide        neural network connections. Additionally, it includes an auxiliary learning layer        for cross-modal imputation allowing the imputation of latent features of missing        modalities and thus predicting phenotypes from a single modality. Finally,        DeepGAMI uses integrated gradient to prioritize multimodal features for various        phenotypes. RESULTS: We applied DeepGAMI to several multimodal datasets including        genotype and bulk and cell-type gene expression data in brain diseases, and gene        expression and electrophysiology data of mouse neuronal cells.

However, the current multi-modal fusion methods for biomedical        data require more effective exploitation of intra- and inter-modal interactions,        and the application of powerful fusion methods to biomedical data is relatively        rare. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-modal data fusion method that        addresses these limitations. Our proposed method utilizes a graph neural network        and a 3D convolutional network to identify intra-modal relationships. By doing        so, we can extract meaningful features from each modality, preserving crucial        information. To fuse information from different modalities, we employ the        Low-rank Multi-modal Fusion method, which effectively integrates multiple        modalities while reducing noise and redundancy. Additionally, our method        incorporates the Cross-modal Transformer to automatically learn relationships        between different modalities, facilitating enhanced information exchange and        representation. We validate the effectiveness of our proposed method using lung        CT imaging data and physiological and biochemical data obtained from patients        diagnosed with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).

However, most        approaches focus on single data modalities leading to slow progress in methods to        integrate complementary data types. Development of effective multimodal fusion        approaches is becoming increasingly important as a single modality might not be        consistent and sufficient to capture the heterogeneity of complex diseases to        tailor medical care and improve personalised medicine. Many initiatives now focus        on integrating these disparate modalities to unravel the biological processes        involved in multifactorial diseases such as cancer. However, many obstacles        remain, including lack of usable data as well as methods for clinical validation        and interpretation.

However, most        direct applications of DL will deliver models with limited transparency and        explainability, which constrain their deployment in biomedical settings. METHODS:        This systematic review discusses DL models used to support inference in cancer        biology with a particular emphasis on multi-omics analysis. It focuses on how        existing models address the need for better dialogue with prior knowledge,        biological plausibility and interpretability, fundamental properties in the        biomedical domain. For this, we retrieved and analyzed 42 studies focusing on        emerging architectural and methodological advances, the encoding of biological        domain knowledge and the integration of explainability methods. RESULTS: We        discuss the recent evolutionary arch of DL models in the direction of integrating        prior biological relational and network knowledge to support better        generalisation (e.g. pathways or Protein-Protein-Interaction networks) and        interpretability.

Integrating multi-omics data has been demonstrated to        enhance the accuracy of analyzing and classifying complex diseases. This can be        attributed to the highly correlated nature of the data with various diseases, as        well as the comprehensive and complementary information it provides. However,        integrating multi-omics data for complex diseases is challenged by data        characteristics such as high imbalance, scale variation, heterogeneity, and noise        interference. These challenges further emphasize the importance of developing        effective methods for multi-omics data integration. RESULTS: We proposed a novel        multi-omics data learning model called MODILM, which integrates multiple omics        data to improve the classification accuracy of complex diseases by obtaining more        significant and complementary information from different single-omics data. Our        approach includes four key steps: 1) constructing a similarity network for each        omics data using the cosine similarity measure, 2) leveraging Graph Attention        Networks to learn sample-specific and intra-association features from similarity        networks for single-omics data, 3) using Multilayer Perceptron networks to map        learned features to a new feature space, thereby strengthening and extracting        high-level omics-specific features, and 4) fusing these high-level features using        a View Correlation Discovery Network to learn cross-omics features in the label        space, which results in unique class-level distinctiveness for complex diseases.

However, an        uncomplicated and accurate method to identify subtypes is currently lacking. This        study utilized photoacoustic spectral analysis (PASA) based on the partial least        squares discriminant algorithm (PLS-DA) to identify molecular breast cancer        subtypes at the biomacromolecular level in vivo. The area of power spectrum        density (APSD) was extracted to semi-quantify the biomacromolecule content. The        feature wavelengths were obtained via the variable importance in projection (VIP)        score and the selectivity ratio (Sratio), to identify the biomarkers. The PASA        achieved an accuracy of 84%. Most of the feature wavelengths fell into the        collagen-dominated absorption waveband, which was consistent with the        histopathological results.

We performed        retrospective evaluations of 133 patients with pathologically confirmed PTC, who        were assigned to the training cohort and validation cohort (7â:â3), and extracted        radiomics features from the preoperative US, T2-weighted        (T2WI),diffusion-weighted (DWI), and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted (CE-T1WI)        images. Optimal subsets were selected using minimum redundancy, maximum        relevance, and recursive feature elimination in the support vector machine (SVM).        For LNM prediction, the radiomics model was constructed by SVM, and Multi-Omics        Graph cOnvolutional NETworks (MOGONET) was used for the effective classification        of multiradiomics data. Multivariable logistic regression incorporating        multiradiomics signatures and clinical risk factors was used to generate a        nomogram, whose performance and clinical utility were assessed. Results showed        that the nine most predictive features were separately selected from US, T2WI,        DWI, and CE-T1WI images, and 18 features were selected in the combined model. The        combined radiomics model showed better performance than models based on US, T2WI,        DWI, and CE-T1WI. In a comparison of the combined radiomics and MOGONET model,        receiver operating curve analysis showed that the area under the curve (AUC)        value (95% CI) was 0.84 (0.76-0.93) and 0.84 (0.71-0.96) for the MOGONET model in        the training and validation cohorts, respectively. The corresponding values (95%        CI) for the combined radiomics model were 0.82 (0.74-0.90) and 0.77 (0.61-0.94),        respectively. The MOGONET model had better performance and better prediction        specificity compared with the combined radiomics model. The nomogram including        the MOGONET signature showed a better predictive value (AUC: 0.81 vs. 0.88) in        the training and validation (AUC: 0.74vs. 0.87) cohorts, as compared with the        clinical model.

Advancement in        high-throughput multi-omics approaches has enabled the collection of molecular        assessments at different layers, providing a complementary perspective of complex        diseases. Numerous computational methods have been developed for the omics-based        patient classification or disease outcome prediction. Yet, a systematic        benchmarking of those methods using various combinations of omics data for the        prediction of asthma development is still lacking. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to        investigate the computational methods in disease status prediction using        multi-omics data. METHOD: We systematically benchmarked 18 computational methods        using all the 63 combinations of six omics data (GWAS, miRNA, mRNA, microbiome,        metabolome, DNA methylation) collected in The Vitamin D Antenatal Asthma        Reduction Trial (VDAART) cohort. We evaluated each method using standard        performance metrics for each of the 63 omics combinations. RESULTS: Our results        indicate that overall Logistic Regression, Multi-Layer Perceptron, and MOGONET        display superior performance, and the combination of transcriptional, genomic and        microbiome data achieves the best prediction.

Presently, the majority        of studies rely far too heavily on gene expression data, omitting the enormous        power of multi-omics fusion data and the potential for patient similarities.        Method: In this study, we created a gastric cancer subtype classification model        called RRGCN based on residual graph convolutional network (GCN) using        multi-omics fusion data and patient similarity network. Given the multi-omics        data's high dimensionality, we built an artificial neural network Autoencoder        (AE) to reduce the dimensionality of the data and extract hidden layer features.        The model is then built using the feature data. In addition, we computed the        correlation between patients using the Pearson correlation coefficient, and this        relationship between patients forms the edge of the graph structure. Four graph        convolutional network layers and two residual networks with skip connections make        up RRGCN, which reduces the amount of information lost during transmission        between layers and prevents model degradation. Results: The results show that        RRGCN significantly outperforms other classification methods with an accuracy as        high as 0.87 when compared to four other traditional machine learning methods and        deep learning models. Conclusion: In terms of subtype classification, RRGCN        excels in all areas and has the potential to offer fresh perspectives on disease        mechanisms and disease progression.

RESULTS: In this work, we propose a graph        convolution network-based method called MRNGCN that integrates multiple gene        relationship networks to identify cancer driver genes. First, we constructed        three gene relationship networks, including the gene-gene, gene-outlying gene and        gene-miRNA networks. Then, genes learnt feature presentations from the three        networks through three sharing-parameter heterogeneous graph convolution network        (HGCN) models with the self-attention mechanism. After that, these gene features        pass a convolution layer to generate fused features. Finally, we utilized the        fused features and the original feature to optimize the model by minimizing the        node and link prediction losses. Meanwhile, we combined the fused features, the        original features and the three features learned from every network through a        logistic regression model to predict cancer driver genes.

Accurately        identifying TF-DNA bindings and constructing their relationships with chromatin        features is a long-standing goal in the bioinformatic field. However, this has        remained elusive due to the complex binding mechanisms and heterogeneity among        inputs. Here, we have developed the GHTNet (General Hybrid Transformer Network),        a transformer-based model to predict TF-DNA binding specificity. The GHTNet        decodes the relationship between tissue-specific TF-DNA binding and chromatin        features via a specific input scheme of alternative inputs and reveals important        gene regions and tissue-specific motifs. Our experiments show that the GHTNet has        excellent performance, achieving about a 5% absolute improvement over existing        methods. The TF-DNA binding mechanism analysis shows that the importance of        TF-DNA binding features varies across tissues. The best predictor is based on the        DNA sequence, followed by epigenomics and shape. In addition, cross-species        studies address the limited data, thus providing new ideas in this case.        Moreover, the GHTNet is applied to interpret the relationship among TFs,        chromatin features, and diseases associated with AD46 tissue.

To        efficiently analyze the big pan-cancer methylation data and to overcome the        co-methylation phenomenon, a MapReduce-based distributed and parallel-designed        partial least squares approach was proposed. The large-scale high-dimensional        methylation data were first decomposed into distributed blocks according to their        genome locations. A distributed and parallel data processing strategy was        proposed based on the framework of MapReduce, and then latent variables were        further extracted for each distributed block. A set of pan-cancer signatures        through a differential co-expression network followed by statistical tests was        further identified based on their gene expression profiles. In total, 15 TCGA and        3 GEO datasets were used as the training and testing data, respectively, to        verify our method. As a result, 22,000 potential methylation loci were selected        as highly related loci with early-stage pan-cancer diagnosis. Of these, 67        methylation loci were further identified as pan-cancer signatures considering        their gene expression as well. The survival analysis as well as pathway        enrichment analysis on them shows that not only these loci may serve as potential        drug targets, but also the proposed method may serve as a uniform framework for        signature identification with big data.",0ee13a9040121d1de56df710226e00ece6253239,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0ee13a9040121d1de56df710226e00ece6253239,36338981,PMC9626520,"background,methodology",False,Frontiers in genetics,101560621

As revealed by many novel discoveries,        the role of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) in understanding disease mechanisms is        becoming increasingly important. Since ncRNAs primarily act as regulators of        transcription, associating ncRNAs with diseases involves multiple inference        steps. Leveraging the fast-accumulating high-throughput screening results, a        number of computational models predicting ncRNA-disease associations have been        developed. These tools suggest novel disease-related biomarkers or therapeutic        targetable ncRNAs, contributing to the realization of precision medicine. In this        survey, we first introduce the biological roles of different ncRNAs and summarize        the databases containing ncRNA-disease associations. Then, we suggest a new trend        in recent computational prediction of ncRNA-disease association, which is the        mode of action (MoA) network perspective.

RESULTS: In this study, 16 representative deep learning methods are        comprehensively evaluated on simulated, single-cell, and cancer multi-omics        datasets. For each of the datasets, two tasks are designed: classification and        clustering. The classification performance is evaluated by using three        benchmarking metrics including accuracy, F1 macro, and F1 weighted. Meanwhile,        the clustering performance is evaluated by using four benchmarking metrics        including the Jaccard index (JI), C-index, silhouette score, and Davies Bouldin        score. For the cancer multi-omics datasets, the methods' strength in capturing        the association of multi-omics dimensionality reduction results with survival and        clinical annotations is further evaluated.

10.3390/metabo12030225,"Integration of Multiplied Omics, a Step Forward in Systematic Dairy Research.",2022.0,"Due to their unique multi-gastric digestion system highly adapted for rumination,        dairy livestock has complicated physiology different from monogastric animals.        However, the microbiome-based mechanism of the digestion system is congenial for        biology approaches. Different omics and their integration have been widely        applied in the dairy sciences since the previous decade for investigating their        physiology, pathology, and the development of feed and management protocols. The        rumen microbiome can digest dietary components into utilizable sugars, proteins,        and volatile fatty acids, contributing to the energy intake and feed efficiency        of dairy animals, which has become one target of the basis for omics applications        in dairy science. Rumen, liver, and mammary gland are also frequently targeted in        omics because of their crucial impact on dairy animals' energy metabolism,        production performance, and health status. The application of omics has made        outstanding contributions to a more profound understanding of the physiology,        etiology, and optimizing the management strategy of dairy animals, while the        multi-omics method could draw information of different levels and organs        together, providing an unprecedented broad scope on traits of dairy animals. This        article reviewed recent omics and multi-omics researches on physiology, feeding,        and pathology on dairy animals and also performed the potential of multi-omics on        systematic dairy research.",a0bdd4067274779f035083c326867c249b304ee2,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a0bdd4067274779f035083c326867c249b304ee2,35323668,PMC8955540,,False,Metabolites,101578790
10.3389/fgene.2022.824451,Machine Learning: A New Prospect in Multi-Omics Data Analysis of Cancer.,2022.0,"Cancer is defined as a large group of diseases that is associated with abnormal        cell growth, uncontrollable cell division, and may tend to impinge on other        tissues of the body by different mechanisms through metastasis. What makes cancer        so important is that the cancer incidence rate is growing worldwide which can        have major health, economic, and even social impacts on both patients and the        governments. Thereby, the early cancer prognosis, diagnosis, and treatment can        play a crucial role at the front line of combating cancer. The onset and        progression of cancer can occur under the influence of complicated mechanisms and        some alterations in the level of genome, proteome, transcriptome, metabolome etc.        Consequently, the advent of omics science and its broad research branches (such        as genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, and so forth) as        revolutionary biological approaches have opened new doors to the comprehensive        perception of the cancer landscape. Due to the complexities of the formation and        development of cancer, the study of mechanisms underlying cancer has gone beyond        just one field of the omics arena. Therefore, making a connection between the        resultant data from different branches of omics science and examining them in a        multi-omics field can pave the way for facilitating the discovery of novel        prognostic, diagnostic, and therapeutic approaches. As the volume and complexity        of data from the omics studies in cancer are increasing dramatically, the use of        leading-edge technologies such as machine learning can have a promising role in        the assessments of cancer research resultant data. Machine learning is        categorized as a subset of artificial intelligence which aims to data parsing,        classification, and data pattern identification by applying statistical methods        and algorithms. This acquired knowledge subsequently allows computers to learn        and improve accurate predictions through experiences from data processing. In        this context, the application of machine learning, as a novel computational        technology offers new opportunities for achieving in-depth knowledge of cancer by        analysis of resultant data from multi-omics studies. Therefore, it can be        concluded that the use of artificial intelligence technologies such as machine        learning can have revolutionary roles in the fight against cancer.",2ffb6b147794ad3f12160a000f6c106742205212,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2ffb6b147794ad3f12160a000f6c106742205212,35154283,PMC8829119,,False,Frontiers in genetics,101560621
10.3389/fmolb.2021.768106,Computational Methods for Single-Cell Imaging and Omics Data Integration.,2022.0,"Integrating single cell omics and single cell imaging allows for a more effective        characterisation of the underlying mechanisms that drive a phenotype at the        tissue level, creating a comprehensive profile at the cellular level. Although        the use of imaging data is well established in biomedical research, its primary        application has been to observe phenotypes at the tissue or organ level, often        using medical imaging techniques such as MRI, CT, and PET. These imaging        technologies complement omics-based data in biomedical research because they are        helpful for identifying associations between genotype and phenotype, along with        functional changes occurring at the tissue level. Single cell imaging can act as        an intermediary between these levels. Meanwhile new technologies continue to        arrive that can be used to interrogate the genome of single cells and its related        omics datasets. As these two areas, single cell imaging and single cell omics,        each advance independently with the development of novel techniques, the        opportunity to integrate these data types becomes more and more attractive. This        review outlines some of the technologies and methods currently available for        generating, processing, and analysing single-cell omics- and imaging data, and        how they could be integrated to further our understanding of complex biological        phenomena like ageing. We include an emphasis on machine learning algorithms        because of their ability to identify complex patterns in large multidimensional        data.",f4d3e5102b38245dbfa49c22d42bdbf5d8392122,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f4d3e5102b38245dbfa49c22d42bdbf5d8392122,35111809,PMC8801747,,False,Frontiers in molecular biosciences,101653173

A systems biology approach to studying AD        involves analyses of various body systems, biological scales, environmental        elements, and clinical outcomes to understand the genotype to phenotype        relationship that potentially drives AD development. Currently, there are many        research investigations probing how modifiable and nonmodifiable factors impact        AD symptom presentation. This review specifically focuses on how imaging        modalities can be integrated into systems biology approaches using model mouse        populations to link brain level functional and structural changes to disease        onset and progression. Combining imaging and omics data promotes the        classification of AD into subtypes and paves the way for precision medicine        solutions to prevent and treat AD.",0d6b4a35e816602988ed2f6c90930dab1c4a0767,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0d6b4a35e816602988ed2f6c90930dab1c4a0767,34767943,PMC10112395,,False,Neurobiology of disease,9500169
10.3390/ijms221910291,Risk Prediction of Cardiovascular Events by Exploration of Molecular Data with        Explainable Artificial Intelligence.,2021.0,"Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) annually take almost 18 million lives worldwide.        Most lethal events occur months or years after the initial presentation. Indeed,        many patients experience repeated complications or require multiple interventions        (recurrent events). Apart from affecting the individual, this leads to high        medical costs for society. Personalized treatment strategies aiming at prediction        and prevention of recurrent events rely on early diagnosis and precise prognosis.        Complementing the traditional environmental and clinical risk factors,        multi-omics data provide a holistic view of the patient and disease progression,        enabling studies to probe novel angles in risk stratification. Specifically,        predictive molecular markers allow insights into regulatory networks, pathways,        and mechanisms underlying disease. Moreover, artificial intelligence (AI)        represents a powerful, yet adaptive, framework able to recognize complex patterns        in large-scale clinical and molecular data with the potential to improve risk        prediction. Here, we review the most recent advances in risk prediction of        recurrent cardiovascular events, and discuss the value of molecular data and        biomarkers for understanding patient risk in a systems biology context. Finally,        we introduce explainable AI which may improve clinical decision systems by making        predictions transparent to the medical practitioner.",2b9d67f82fb26e99ea49a7299dbd494e2a9a4228,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2b9d67f82fb26e99ea49a7299dbd494e2a9a4228,34638627,PMC8508897,,False,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791
