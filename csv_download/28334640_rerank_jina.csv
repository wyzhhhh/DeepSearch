Role of MicroRNA in Governing Synaptic Plasticity,"Although synaptic plasticity in neural circuits is orchestrated by an ocean of genes, molecules, and proteins, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Recently, it is well acknowledged that miRNA exerts widespread regulation over the translation and degradation of target gene in nervous system. Increasing evidence suggests that quite a few specific miRNAs play important roles in various respects of synaptic plasticity including synaptogenesis, synaptic morphology alteration, and synaptic function modification. More importantly, the miRNA-mediated regulation of synaptic plasticity is not only responsible for synapse development and function but also involved in the pathophysiology of plasticity-related diseases. A review is made here on the function of miRNAs in governing synaptic plasticity, emphasizing the emerging regulatory role of individual miRNAs in synaptic morphological and functional plasticity, as well as their implications in neurological disorders. Understanding of the way in which miRNAs contribute to synaptic plasticity provides rational clues in establishing the novel therapeutic strategy for plasticity-related diseases.",27034846,PMC4808557,10.1155/2016/4959523,35,Neural plasticity,100883417,3.144,0.9720456600189209,0.8060200668896321,0.18729096989966554,0.7818896033692121
MicroRNAs and Synaptic Plasticity: From Their Molecular Roles to Response to Therapy,"Synaptic plasticity is the ability of synapses to weaken or strengthen over time, in response to changes in the activity of the neurons. It is orchestrated by a variety of genes, proteins, and external and internal factors, especially epigenetic factors. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are well-acknowledged epigenetic modulators that regulate the translation and degradation of target genes in the nervous system. Increasing evidence has suggested that a number of miRNAs play important roles in modulating various aspects of synaptic plasticity. The deregulation of miRNAs could be associated with pathological alterations in synaptic plasticity, which could lead to different CNS-related diseases. Herein, we provide an update on the role of miRNAs in governing synaptic plasticity. In addition, we also summarize recent researches on the role of miRNAs in drug addiction, and their targets and mechanism of action. Understanding of the way in which miRNAs contribute to synaptic plasticity provides rational clues in establishing the novel biomarkers and new therapeutic strategies for the diagnosis and treatment of plasticity-related diseases and drug addiction.",35666404,,10.1007/s12035-022-02907-2,5,Molecular neurobiology,8900963,5.682,0.9549003839492798,0.2842809364548495,0.4983277591973244,0.7294619695000026
"Research progress on the roles of microRNAs in governing synaptic plasticity, learning and memory","The importance of non-coding RNA involved in biological processes has become apparent in recent years and the mechanism of transcriptional regulation has also been identified. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) represent a class of small regulatory non-coding RNAs of 22bp in length that mediate gene silencing by identifying specific sequences in the target messenger RNAs (mRNAs). Many miRNAs are highly expressed in the central nervous system in a spatially and temporally controlled manner in normal physiology, as well as in certain pathological conditions. There is growing evidence that a considerable number of specific miRNAs play important roles in synaptic plasticity, learning and memory function. In addition, the dysfunction of these molecules may also contribute to the etiology of several neurodegenerative diseases. Here we provide an overview of the current literatures, which support non-coding RNA-mediated gene function regulation represents an important but underappreciated, layer of epigenetic control that facilitates learning and memory functions.",28866103,,10.1016/j.lfs.2017.08.033,15,Life sciences,375521,6.78,0.920647144317627,0.5785953177257525,0.6655518394648829,0.8012177180287032
miRNAs in synapse development and synaptic plasticity,"Synapses are functional units of the nervous system, through which information is transferred between neurons. The development and activity-dependent modification of synapses require temporally and spatially controlled modulation of gene expression. microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as essential regulators of gene expression. They are small non-coding RNAs that regulate mRNA stability and translation by interacting with the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR) of mRNAs. miRNAs are located to neuronal processes to regulate protein synthesis locally and their expression is regulated by synaptic activity.

Current Updates on the Role of MicroRNA in the Diagnosis and Treatment of Neurodegenerative Diseases,"Background:MicroRNAs (miRNA) are small noncoding RNAs that play a significant role in the regulation of gene expression. The literature has explored the key involvement of miRNAs in the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of various neurodegenerative diseases (NDD), such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and Huntington's disease (HD). The miRNA regulates various signalling pathways; its dysregulation is involved in the pathogenesis of NDD.Objective:The present review is focused on the involvement of miRNAs in the pathogenesis of NDD and their role in the treatment or management of NDD. The literature provides comprehensive and cutting-edge knowledge for students studying neurology, researchers, clinical psychologists, practitioners, pathologists, and drug development agencies to comprehend the role of miRNAs in the NDD's pathogenesis, regulation of various genes/signalling pathways, such as Î±-synuclein, P53, amyloid-Î², high mobility group protein (HMGB1), and IL-1Î², NMDA receptor signalling, cholinergic signalling, etc. Methods: The issues associated with using anti-miRNA therapy are also summarized in this review. The data for this literature were extracted and summarized using various search engines, such as Google Scholar, Pubmed, Scopus, and NCBI using different terms, such as NDD, PD, AD, HD, nanoformulations of mRNA, and role of miRNA in diagnosis and treatment.Results:The miRNAs control various biological actions, such as neuronal differentiation, synaptic plasticity, cytoprotection, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, apoptosis and chaperone-mediated autophagy, and neurite growth in the central nervous system and diagnosis. Various miRNAs are involved in the regulation of protein aggregation in PD and modulating Î²-secretase activity in AD. In HD, mutation in the huntingtin (Htt) protein interferes with Ago1 and Ago2, thus affecting the miRNA biogenesis. Currently, many anti-sense technologies are in the research phase for either inhibiting or promoting the activity of miRNA.Conclusion:This review provides new therapeutic approaches and novel biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of NDDs by using miRNA.",37861022,,10.2174/0115665232261931231006103234,1,Current gene therapy,101125446,4.676,0.9099069833755493,0.08695652173913043,0.3745819397993311,0.6382518823330219
Synaptic plasticity and depression: the role of miRNAs dysregulation,"Background:MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been recently shown to exert several functional roles in the development and function of neurons. Moreover, numerous miRNAs are present in high abundance in presynaptic and postsynaptic sites regulating synaptic plasticity and activity through different mechanisms.Methods:We searched PubMed and Google Scholar databases with key words ""Synaptic plasticity"", ""miRNA"" and ""major depressive disorder.Results:Synaptic plasticity has an essential role in the ability of the brain to integrate transitory experiences into constant memory traces. Thus, it participates in the development of neuropsychiatric diseases such as major depressive disorder (MDD). Most notably, MDD-related alterations in synaptic function have been found to be closely related with abnormal expression of miRNAs.Conclusions:Several miRNAs such as miR-9-5p, miR-204-5p, miR-128-3, miR-26a-3p, miR-218, miR-22-3p, miR-124-3p, miR-136-3p, miR-154-5p, miR-323a-3p, miR-425-5p, miR-34a, miR-137, miR-204-5p, miR-99a, miR-134, miR-124-3p and miR-3130-5p have been shown to be involved in the regulation of synaptic plasticity in the context of MDD.

Causes and Consequences of MicroRNA Dysregulation in Neurodegenerative Diseases,"Neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), originate from a loss of neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) and are severely debilitating. The incidence of neurodegenerative diseases increases with age, and they are expected to become more common due to extended life expectancy. Because of no clear mechanisms, these diseases have become a major challenge in neurobiology. It is well recognized that these disorders become the culmination of many different genetic and environmental influences. Prior studies have shown that microRNAs (miRNAs) are pathologically altered during the inexorable course of some neurodegenerative diseases, suggesting that miRNAs may be the contributing factor in neurodegeneration. Here, we review what is known about the involvement of miRNAs in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. The biogenesis of miRNAs and various functions of miRNAs that act as the chief regulators will be discussed. We focus in particular on dysregulation of miRNAs which leads to several neurodegenerative diseases from three aspects: miRNA-generating disorders, miRNA-targeting genes and epigenetic alterations. Furthermore, recent evidences have shown that circulating miRNA expression levels are changed in patients with neurodegenerative diseases. Circulating miRNA expression levels are reported in patients in order to evaluate their application as biomarkers of these diseases. A discussion is included with a potential diagnostic biomarker and the possible future direction in exploring the nexus between miRNAs and various neurodegenerative diseases.",24973986,,10.1007/s12035-014-8803-9,65,Molecular neurobiology,8900963,5.682,0.8991213440895081,0.9163879598662207,0.5016722408026756,0.823084846587484
The role of microRNAs in neurodegenerative diseases: a review,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding RNAs which are essential post-transcriptional gene regulators in various neuronal degenerative diseases and playact a key role in these physiological progresses. Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, multiple sclerosis, and, stroke, are seriously threats to the life and health of all human health and life kind. Recently, various studies have reported that some various miRNAs can regulate the development of neurodegenerative diseases as well as act as biomarkers to predict these neuronal diseases conditions. Endogenic miRNAs such as miR-9, the miR-29 family, miR-15, and the miR-34 family are generally dysregulated in animal and cell models. They are involved in regulating the physiological and biochemical processes in the nervous system by targeting regulating different molecular targets and influencing a variety of pathways. Additionally, exogenous miRNAs derived from homologous plants and defined as botanmin, such as miR2911 and miR168, can be taken up and transferred by other species to be and then act analogously to endogenic miRNAs to regulate the physiological and biochemical processes. This review summarizes the mechanism and principle of miRNAs in the treatment of some neurodegenerative diseases, as well as discusses several types of miRNAs which were the most commonly reported in diseases. These miRNAs could serve as a study provided some potential biomarkers in neurodegenerative diseases might be an ideal and/or therapeutic targets for neurodegenerative diseases. Finally, the role accounted of the prospective exogenous miRNAs involved in mammalian diseases is described. 1. Listing a large number of neural-related miRNAs and sorting out their pathways. 2.

MicroRNA: Basic concepts and implications for regeneration and repair of neurodegenerative diseases,"MicroRNAs (miRNA) are small non-coding molecules that revolutionized our knowledge about the regulation of gene expression. Capable to target a large number of mRNA, miRNA are thought to regulate around 30% of the entire human genome. Therefore, these molecules are able to regulate several biological processes, including neuronal survival, differentiation and regeneration. Additionally, miRNA might act as valuable clinical agents in brain pathological conditions. Their specific expression patterns in the brain parenchyma and/or in circulating fluids have been highlighted as potential biomarkers, while the modulation of their activity may have therapeutic value for several neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we describe miRNA biogenesis, signaling and regulation as well as the role of miR-9, miR-124, miR-132 and miR-137 in both adult neurogenesis and neurodegeneration, namely in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The relationship between miRNA, neurodegeneration and neurogenesis will be highlighted. Moreover, the benefits, outcomes and limitations of therapies using miRNA technology for neurodegenerative disorders will also be discussed.",28709951,,10.1016/j.bcp.2017.07.008,36,Biochemical pharmacology,101032,6.1,0.8864204287528992,0.8127090301003345,0.5752508361204013,0.8094442304958867
Regulation of AMPAR expression by microRNAs,"AMPA receptors (AMPARs) are the major excitatory neurotransmitter receptor in the brain, and their expression at synapses is a critical determinant of synaptic transmission and therefore brain function. Synaptic plasticity involves increases or decreases in synaptic strength, caused by changes in the number or subunit-specific subtype of AMPARs expressed at synapses, and resulting in modifications of functional connectivity of neuronal circuits, a process which is thought to underpin learning and the formation or loss of memories. Furthermore, numerous neurological disorders involve dysregulation of excitatory synaptic transmission or aberrant recruitment of plasticity processes. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) repress the translation of target genes by partial complementary base pairing with mRNAs, and are the core component of a mechanism widely used in a range of cell processes for regulating protein translation. MiRNA-dependent translational repression can occur locally in neuronal dendrites, close to synapses, and can also result in relatively rapid changes in protein expression. MiRNAs are therefore well-placed to regulate synaptic plasticity via the local control of AMPAR subunit synthesis, and can also result in synaptic dysfunction in the event of dysregulation in disease. Here, I will review the miRNAs that have been identified as playing a role in physiological or pathological changes in AMPAR subunit expression at synapses, focussing on miRNAs that target mRNAs encoding AMPAR subunits, and on miRNAs that target AMPAR accessory proteins involved in AMPAR trafficking and hence the regulation of AMPAR synaptic localisation.

The role of microRNAs in the pathophysiology of human central nervous system: A focus on neurodegenerative diseases,"microRNAs (miRNAs) are suggested to play substantial roles in regulating the development and various physiologic functions of the central nervous system (CNS). These include neurogenesis, cell fate and differentiation, morphogenesis, formation of dendrites, and targeting non-neural mRNAs. Notably, deregulation of an increasing number of miRNAs is associated with several neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and CNS tumors. They are particularly known to affect the amyloid Î² (AÎ²) cleavage and accumulation, tau protein homeostasis, and expression of alpha-synuclein (Î±-syn), Parkin, PINK1, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) that play pivotal roles in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. These include miR-16, miR-17-5p, miR-20a, miR-106a, miR-106b, miR-15a, miR-15b, miR-103, miR-107, miR-298, miR-328, miR-195, miR-485, and miR-29. In CNS tumors, several miRNAs, including miR-31, miR-16, and miR-21 have been identified to modulate tumorigenesis through impacting tumor invasion and apoptosis. In this review article, we have a look at the recent advances on our knowledge about the role of miRNAs in human brain development and functions, neurodegenerative diseases, and their clinical potentials.",37832609,,10.1016/j.arr.2023.102090,9,Ageing research reviews,101128963,11.788,0.8670357465744019,0.43812709030100333,0.882943143812709,0.7844354947673835
MicroRNAs in Neurodegenerative Diseases,"MicroRNAs are small noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression at the posttranscriptional level in a sequence-specific manner. After their discovery in 1993, mounting data have provided compelling evidence for their causal involvement in several human diseases, such as cancer and disorders of the brain. MicroRNAs have been described as the main regulator of homeostasis in neurons, and their dysregulation results in pathological conditions in the brain. In this review, we will focus on the role of MicroRNAs as novel drug targets and biomarkers of the three main neurodegenerative disorders (Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's diseases, and Huntington's disease) and their role in other neurological disorders including traumatic brain injury and status epilepticus.",28838542,,10.1016/bs.ircmb.2017.04.002,81,International review of cell and molecular biology,101475846,6.42,0.851212203502655,0.9431438127090301,0.6354515050167224,0.8264463856467434
AFM Imaging Reveals MicroRNA-132 to be a Positive Regulator of Synaptic Functions,"The modification of synaptic and neural connections in adults, including the formation and removal of synapses, depends on activity-dependent synaptic and structural plasticity. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play crucial roles in regulating these changes by targeting specific genes and regulating their expression. The fact that somatic and dendritic activity in neurons often occurs asynchronously highlights the need for spatial and dynamic regulation of protein synthesis in specific milieu and cellular loci. MicroRNAs, which can show distinct patterns of enrichment, help to establish the localized distribution of plasticity-related proteins. The recent study using atomic force microscopy (AFM)-based nanoscale imaging reveals that the abundance of miRNA(miR)-134 is inversely correlated with the functional activity of dendritic spine structures. However, the miRNAs that are selectively upregulated in potentiated synapses, and which can thereby support prospective changes in synaptic efficacy, remain largely unknown. Using AFM force imaging, significant increases in miR-132 in the dendritic regions abutting functionally-active spines is discovered. This study provides evidence for miR-132 as a novel positive miRNA regulator residing in dendritic shafts, and also suggests that activity-dependent miRNAs localized in distinct sub-compartments of neurons play bi-directional roles in controlling synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity.",38493494,PMC11077659,10.1002/advs.202306630,0,"Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)",101664569,17.521,0.8504685759544373,0.0,0.9531772575250836,0.7009165970776791
The Dysregulation of microRNAs and the Role of Stress in the Pathogenesis of Mental Disorders,"MicroRNAs are endogenous small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression by means of partial complementarity to microRNA binding sites at their target genes. These molecules have emerged as key regulators of almost every biological process including accurate control of neuronal gene expression. The authors discuss the current state of microRNA research, including studies of psychiatric disorders (schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder and affective disorders). Stress has also been shown to have a critical role in the development of psychiatric disorders, at least partially, through mechanisms related to neural plasticity. Synaptic connections in the brain undergo experience-dependent functional or morphological changes through complex pathways that are not yet fully understood, but for which microRNAs might have a critical role. The focus is on the role that microRNAs play in the development of psychiatric disorders and their potential to serve as biomarkers of disease as well as targets for pharmacological treatment.",30499408,,10.2174/1568026619666181130135253,4,Current topics in medicinal chemistry,101119673,3.57,0.8463238477706909,0.22073578595317725,0.23745819397993312,0.5994331046490367
MicroRNAs regulate synaptic plasticity underlying drug addiction,"Chronic use of drugs of abuse results in neurochemical, morphological and behavioral plasticity that underlies the emergence of compulsive drug seeking and vulnerability to relapse during periods of attempted abstinence. Identifying and reversing addiction-relevant plasticity is seen as a potential point of pharmacotherapeutic intervention in drug-addicted individuals. Despite considerable advances in our understanding of the actions of drugs of abuse in the brain, this information has thus far yielded few novel treatment options addicted individuals. MicroRNAs are small noncoding RNAs that can each regulate the translation of hundreds to thousands of messenger RNAs. The highly pleiotropic nature of miRNAs has focused attention on their contribution to addiction-relevant structural and functional plasticity in the brain and their potential utility as targets for medications development. In this review, we discuss the roles of miRNAs in synaptic plasticity underlying the development of addiction and then briefly discuss the possibility of using circulating miRNA as biomarkers for addiction.",28873276,PMC5837931,10.1111/gbb.12424,46,"Genes, brain, and behavior",101129617,3.708,0.8460696339607239,0.8695652173913043,0.26421404682274247,0.7343976332192437
MicroRNA-322 Cluster Promotes Tau Phosphorylation via Targeting Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor,"Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a crucial regulator to support synaptic plasticity and neuronal survival, its significant decrease is a pathophysiological hallmark in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains and accounts for poor prognosis. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) interfere with the translation of target mRNAs and control a variety of physiological and pathological processes. MiR-322 is the rodent homologue of human miR-424, it is involved in the modulation of cell differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis and metabolic activities in diverse tissues and organs. However, the roles and potential mechanisms of miR-322 remain elusive in AD pathogenesis. Here we observed miR-322 is significantly increased along with BDNF decrease in AD mouse brain. Bioinformatics prediction implicated that BDNF 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) possesses the putative target sequence of miR-322. Luciferase reporter assay identified that miR-322 can directly conjugate to BDNF 3'-UTR. The functional research showed that MiR-322 input deregulates BDNF expression at either mRNA or protein levels, whereas miR-322 silence restores BDNF expression in vitro. Furthermore, we found miR-322 promotes Tau phosphorylation via negatively controlling BDNF-TrkB receptor activation, otherwise MiR-322 silence restores TrkB activation and attenuates tau phosphorylation. Collectively, this study demonstrated a novel miRNA-dependent manner of BDNF degradation in AD pathogenesis, it may drive a miRNAs- or BDNF based therapeutic strategies against Alzheimer's disease.",29464486,,10.1007/s11064-018-2475-1,16,Neurochemical research,7613461,4.414,0.8366881012916565,0.5986622073578596,0.3511705685618729,0.6919794159589404
Recent Advances in the Roles of MicroRNA and MicroRNA-Based Diagnosis in Neurodegenerative Diseases,"Neurodegenerative diseases manifest as progressive loss of neuronal structures and their myelin sheaths and lead to substantial morbidity and mortality, especially in the elderly. Despite extensive research, there are few effective treatment options for the diseases. MicroRNAs have been shown to be involved in the developmental processes of the central nervous system. Mounting evidence suggest they play an important role in the development of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. However, there are few reviews regarding the roles of miRNAs in neurodegenerative diseases. This review summarizes the recent developments in the roles of microRNAs in neurodegenerative diseases and presents the application of microRNA-based methods in the early diagnosis of these diseases.",36551041,PMC9776063,10.3390/bios12121074,2,Biosensors,101609191,5.743,0.8361535668373108,0.13043478260869565,0.5585284280936454,0.6394847822428547
Targeting MicroRNAs in Prevention and Treatment of Neurodegenerative Disorders,"Preclinical Research microRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) that are key regulators of gene expression. They act on wide range of targets by binding to mRNA via imperfect complementarity at 3' UTR. Evidence suggests that miRNAs regulate many biological processes including neuronal development, differentiation, and disease. Altered expression of several miRNAs has been reported in many neurodegenerative disorders (NDDs). Many miRNAs are altered in these diseases, but miRNA 15, miRNA 21, and miRNA 146a have been shown to play critical role in many neurodegenerative conditions. As these miRNAs regulate many genes, miRNA targeted approaches would allow concurrently targeting of multiple effectors of pathways that regulate disease progression. In this review, we describe the role of miRNAs in various NDDs and their potential as therapeutic tools in prevention and treatment of neurological conditions.",26359796,,10.1002/ddr.21277,14,Drug development research,8204468,5.004,0.8356177806854248,0.5518394648829431,0.4214046822742475,0.696019497842693
Role of microRNAs in neurodegeneration induced by environmental neurotoxicants and aging,"The progressive loss of neuronal structure and functions resulting in the death of neurons is considered as neurodegeneration. Environmental toxicants induced degeneration of neurons is accelerated with aging. In adult brains, most of the neurons are post-mitotic, and their loss results in the development of diseases like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Huntington's disease (HD). Neurodegenerative diseases have several similarities at the sub-cellular and molecular levels, such as synaptic degeneration, oxidative stress, inflammation, and cognitive decline, which are also known in brain aging. Identification of these similarities at the molecular level offers hope for the development of new therapeutics to ameliorate all neurodegenerative diseases simultaneously. Aging is known as the most strongly associated additive factor in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Studies carried out so far identified several genes, which are responsible for selective degeneration of neurons in different neurodegenerative diseases. Countless efforts have been made in identifying therapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases; however, the discovery of effective therapy remains elusive. Findings made in the last two decades identified microRNAs (miRNAs) as the most potent post-transcription regulatory RNA molecule, which can condition protein levels in the cell and tissue-specific manner. Identification of miRNAs, which regulate both neurotoxicant and aging-associated degeneration of brain cells, raises the possibility that roads leading to aging and neurotoxicant induced neurodegeneration cross at some point. Identification of miRNAs, which are common to aging and neurotoxicant induced neurodegeneration, will help in understanding the complex mechanism of neurodegenerative disease development. In the future, the use of natural miRNAs in vivo in therapy will be able to tackle several issues of aging and neurodegeneration. In the present review, we have provided a summary of findings made on the role of miRNAs in neurodegeneration and explored the common link made by miRNAs between aging and neurotoxicants induced neurodegeneration.",32283224,,10.1016/j.arr.2020.101068,13,Ageing research reviews,101128963,11.788,0.8333246111869812,0.5384615384615384,0.8862876254180602,0.7849445994881085
The Functional Role of microRNAs in the Pathogenesis of Tauopathy,"Tauopathies are neurodegenerative disorders which include Alzheimer's disease, Pick's disease, corticobasal degeneration, and progressive supranuclear palsy among others. Pathologically, they are characterized by the accumulation of highly phosphorylated and aggregated tau protein in different brain regions. Currently, the mechanisms responsible for their pathogenesis are not known, and for this reason, there is no cure. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are abundantly present in the central nervous system where they act as master regulators of pathways considered important for tau post-translational modifications, metabolism, and clearance. Although in recent years, several miRNAs have been reported to be altered in tauopathy, we still do not know whether these changes contribute to the onset and progression of the disorder, or are secondary events following the development of tau neuropathology. Additionally, since miRNAs are relatively stable in biological fluids and their measurement is easy and non-invasive, these small molecules hold the potential to function as biomarkers for tauopathy. Herein, we showcase recent findings on the biological link between miRNAs and the pathogenesis of tauopathy, and present emerging evidence supporting their role as biomarkers and targets for novel therapies against them.",33050194,PMC7600742,10.3390/cells9102262,7,Cells,101600052,7.666,0.8281063437461853,0.36789297658862874,0.7290969899665551,0.716261799558748
Mechanism and Therapeutic Prospect of miRNAs in Neurodegenerative Diseases,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are the smallest class of noncoding RNAs, which widely exist in animals and plants. They can inhibit translation or overexpression by combining with mRNA and participate in posttranscriptional regulation of genes, resulting in reduced expression of target proteins, affecting the development, growth, aging, metabolism, and other physiological and pathological processes of animals and plants. It is a powerful negative regulator of gene expression. It mediates the information exchange between different cellular pathways in cellular homeostasis and stress response and regulates the differentiation, plasticity, and neurotransmission of neurons. In neurodegenerative diseases, in addition to the complex interactions between genetic susceptibility and environmental factors, miRNAs can serve as a promising diagnostic tool for diseases. They can also increase or reduce neuronal damage by regulating the body's signaling pathways, immune system, stem cells, gut microbiota, etc. They can not only affect the occurrence of diseases and exacerbate disease progression but also promote neuronal repair and reduce apoptosis, to prevent and slow down the development of diseases. This article reviews the research progress of miRNAs on the mechanism and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases in the nervous system.

MicroRNA-dependent control of neuroplasticity in affective disorders,"Affective disorders are a group of neuropsychiatric disorders characterized by severe mood dysregulations accompanied by sleep, eating, cognitive, and attention disturbances, as well as recurring thoughts of suicide. Clinical studies consistently show that affective disorders are associated with reduced size of brain regions critical for mood and cognition, neuronal atrophy, and synaptic loss in these regions. However, the molecular mechanisms that mediate these changes and thereby increase the susceptibility to develop affective disorders remain poorly understood. MicroRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) are small regulatory RNAs that repress gene expression by binding to the 3'UTR of mRNAs. They have the ability to bind to hundreds of target mRNAs and to regulate entire gene networks and cellular pathways implicated in brain function and plasticity, many of them conserved in humans and other animals. In rodents, miRNAs regulate synaptic plasticity by controlling the morphology of dendrites and spines and the expression of neurotransmitter receptors. Furthermore, dysregulated miRNA expression is frequently observed in patients suffering from affective disorders. Together, multiple lines of evidence suggest a link between miRNA dysfunction and affective disorder pathology, providing a rationale to consider miRNAs as therapeutic tools or molecular biomarkers. This review aims to highlight the most recent and functionally relevant studies that contributed to a better understanding of miRNA function in the development and pathogenesis of affective disorders. We focused on in vivo functional studies, which demonstrate that miRNAs control higher brain functions, including mood and cognition, in rodents, and that their dysregulation causes disease-related behaviors.",33941769,PMC8093191,10.1038/s41398-021-01379-7,19,Translational psychiatry,101562664,7.989,0.8264318704605103,0.6321070234113713,0.7792642140468228,0.7781333697679449
The role of microRNA-485 in neurodegenerative diseases,"Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) are age-related disorders characterized by progressive neurodegeneration and neuronal cell loss in the central nervous system. Neuropathological conditions such as the accumulation of misfolded proteins can cause neuroinflammation, apoptosis, and synaptic dysfunction in the brain, leading to the development of NDDs including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNA molecules that regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally via RNA interference. Recently, some studies have reported that some miRNAs play an important role in the development of NDDs by regulating target gene expression. MiRNA-485 (miR-485) is a highly conserved brain-enriched miRNA. Accumulating clinical reports suggest that dysregulated miR-485 may be involved in the pathogenesis of AD and PD. Emerging studies have also shown that miR-485 plays a novel role in the regulation of neuroinflammation, apoptosis, and synaptic function in the pathogenesis of NDDs. In this review, we introduce the biological characteristics of miR-485, provide clinical evidence of the dysregulated miR-485 in NDDs, novel roles of miR-485 in neuropathological events, and discuss the potential of targeting miR-485 as a diagnostic and therapeutic marker for NDDs.",35793556,,10.1515/revneuro-2022-0039,4,Reviews in the neurosciences,8711016,4.703,0.8174288272857666,0.22408026755852842,0.3779264214046823,0.6108586341641021
miRNA: local guardians of presynaptic function in plasticity and disease,"Environmental fitness is an essential component of animal survival. Fitness is achieved through responsive physiological plasticity of tissues across the entire body, and particularly in the nervous system. At the molecular level, neural plasticity is mediated via gene-environmental interactions whereby developmental cues and experience dependent input adapt neuronal function to ever changing demands. To this end, neuronal gene regulation must be coupled to changes in neural activity. Seminal discoveries of the 20th century demonstrated neural activity modifies gene expression through calcium-dependent gene transcription. Building on this model, recent work over the last two decades shows that mRNA products of transcriptional programming continue to be regulated in the neuron through the activity-dependent post-transcriptional action of microRNAs (miRNAs). miRNAs are special post-transcriptional regulators that can tune gene expression within the spatial and temporal requirements of synaptic compartments. This mode of gene regulation has proven to be essential for synaptic function and plasticity as miRNA loss of function is highly associated with neural disease. In this review we will discuss current perspective on the link between presynaptic plasticity and miRNA biogenesis in the neuron.",33586621,PMC8216186,10.1080/15476286.2020.1871214,8,RNA biology,101235328,4.766,0.8168451189994812,0.4080267558528428,0.39464882943143814,0.650642188456545
miR-128 as a Regulator of Synaptic Properties in 5xFAD Mice Hippocampal Neurons,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by progressive synaptic dysfunction, deterioration of neuronal transmission, and consequently neuronal death. Although there is no treatment for AD, exposure to enriched environment (EE) in mice, as well as physical and mental activity in human subjects have been shown to have a protective effect by slowing the disease's progression and reducing AD-like cognitive impairment. However, the molecular mechanism of this mitigating effect is still not understood. One of the mechanisms that has recently been shown to be involved in neuronal degeneration is microRNAs (miRNAs) regulation, which act as a post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression. miR-128 has been shown to be significantly altered in individuals with AD and in mice following exposure to EE. Here, we focused on elucidating the possible role of miR-128 in AD pathology and found that miR-128 regulates the expression of two proteins essential for synaptic transmission, SNAP-25, and synaptotagmin1 (Syt1). Clinically relevant, in 5xFAD mouse model for AD, this miRNA's expression was found as downregulated, resembling the alteration found in the hippocampi of individuals with AD. Interestingly, exposing WT mice to EE also resulted in downregulation of miR-128 expression levels, although EE and AD conditions demonstrate opposing effects on neuronal functioning and synaptic plasticity. We also found that miR-128 expression downregulation in primary hippocampal cultures from 5xFAD mice results in increased neuronal network activity and neuronal excitability. Altogether, our findings place miR-128 as a synaptic player that may contribute to synaptic functioning and plasticity through regulation of synaptic protein expression and function.",34151409,,10.1007/s12031-021-01862-2,6,Journal of molecular neuroscience : MN,9002991,2.866,0.8155264854431152,0.3311036789297659,0.13377926421404682,0.5822924798946316
Role of miRNAs in Neurodegeneration: From Disease Cause to Tools of Biomarker Discovery and Therapeutics,"Neurodegenerative diseases originate from neuronal loss in the central nervous system (CNS). These debilitating diseases progress with age and have become common due to an increase in longevity. The National Institute of Environmental Health Science's 2021 annual report suggests around 6.2 million Americans are living with Alzheimer's disease, and there is a possibility that there will be 1.2 million Parkinson's disease patients in the USA by 2030. There is no clear-cut universal mechanism for identifying neurodegenerative diseases, and therefore, they pose a challenge for neurobiology scientists. Genetic and environmental factors modulate these diseases leading to familial or sporadic forms. Prior studies have shown that miRNA levels are altered during the course of the disease, thereby suggesting that these noncoding RNAs may be the contributing factor in neurodegeneration. In this review, we highlight the role of miRNAs in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Through this review, we aim to achieve four main objectives: First, we highlight how dysregulation of miRNA biogenesis led to these diseases. Second, we highlight the computational or bioinformatics tools required to identify the putative molecular targets of miRNAs, leading to biological molecular pathways or mechanisms involved in these diseases. Third, we focus on the dysregulation of miRNAs and their target genes leading to several neurodegenerative diseases. In the final section, we highlight the use of miRNAs as potential diagnostic biomarkers in the early asymptomatic preclinical diagnosis of these age-dependent debilitating diseases. Additionally, we discuss the challenges and advances in the development of miRNA therapeutics for brain targeting. We list some of the innovative strategies employed to deliver miRNA into target cells and the relevance of these viral and non-viral carrier systems in RNA therapy for neurodegenerative diseases. In summary, this review highlights the relevance of studying brain-enriched miRNAs, the mechanisms underlying their regulation of target gene expression, their dysregulation leading to progressive neurodegeneration, and their potential for biomarker marker and therapeutic intervention. This review thereby highlights ways for the effective diagnosis and prevention of these neurodegenerative disorders in the near future.",35327979,PMC8951370,10.3390/genes13030425,26,Genes,101551097,4.141,0.8153795003890991,0.745819397993311,0.3010033444816054,0.6985922487284428
MiR-431 attenuates synaptic plasticity and memory deficits in APPswe/PS1dE9 mice,"Synaptic plasticity impairment plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and emerging evidence has shown that microRNAs (miRs) are alternative biomarkers and therapeutic targets for synaptic dysfunctions in AD. In this study, we found that the level of miR-431 was downregulated in the plasma of patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment and AD. In addition, it was decreased in the hippocampus and plasma of APPswe/PS1dE9 (APP/PS1) mice. Lentivirus-mediated miR-431 overexpression in the hippocampus CA1 ameliorated synaptic plasticity and memory deficits of APP/PS1 mice, while it did not affect amyloid-Î² levels. Smad4 was identified as a target of miR-431, and Smad4 knockdown modulated the expression of synaptic proteins, including SAP102, and protected against synaptic plasticity and memory dysfunctions in APP/PS1 mice. Furthermore, Smad4 overexpression reversed the protective effects of miR-431, indicating that miR-431 attenuated synaptic impairment at least partially by Smad4 inhibition. Thus, these results indicated that miR-431/Smad4 might be a potential therapeutic target for AD treatment.",37192007,PMC10371242,10.1172/jci.insight.166270,5,JCI insight,101676073,9.484,0.8110781908035278,0.28762541806020064,0.822742474916388,0.7087204930774343
miR-181a negatively modulates synaptic plasticity in hippocampal cultures and its inhibition rescues memory deficits in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease,"MicroRNAs play a pivotal role in rapid, dynamic, and spatiotemporal modulation of synaptic functions. Among them, recent emerging evidence highlights that microRNA-181a (miR-181a) is particularly abundant in hippocampal neurons and controls the expression of key plasticity-related proteins at synapses. We have previously demonstrated that miR-181a was upregulated in the hippocampus of a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and correlated with reduced levels of plasticity-related proteins. Here, we further investigated the underlying mechanisms by which miR-181a negatively modulated synaptic plasticity and memory. In primary hippocampal cultures, we found that an activity-dependent upregulation of the microRNA-regulating protein, translin, correlated with reduction of miR-181a upon chemical long-term potentiation (cLTP), which induced upregulation of GluA2, a predicted target for miR-181a, and other plasticity-related proteins. Additionally, AÎ² treatment inhibited cLTP-dependent induction of translin and subsequent reduction of miR-181a, and cotreatment with miR-181a antagomir effectively reversed the effects elicited by AÎ² but did not rescue translin levels, suggesting that the activity-dependent upregulation of translin was upstream of miR-181a. In mice, a learning episode markedly decreased miR-181a in the hippocampus and raised the protein levels of GluA2. Lastly, we observed that inhibition of miR-181a alleviated memory deficits and increased GluA2 and GluA1 levels, without restoring translin, in the 3xTg-AD model. Taken together, our results indicate that miR-181a is a major negative regulator of the cellular events that underlie synaptic plasticity and memory through AMPA receptors, and importantly, AÎ² disrupts this process by suppressing translin and leads to synaptic dysfunction and memory impairments in AD.",32087004,PMC7059142,10.1111/acel.13118,27,Aging cell,101130839,11.005,0.8062431216239929,0.7591973244147158,0.8595317725752508,0.807491692372389
miR-101a-3p Impairs Synaptic Plasticity and Contributes to Synucleinopathy,"Background:Synucleinopathies are disorders characterized by the abnormal accumulation of Î±-synuclein (aSyn). Synaptic compromise is observed in synucleinopathies parallel to aSyn aggregation and is accompanied by transcript deregulation.Objective:We sought to identify microRNAs associated with synaptic processes that may contribute to synaptic dysfunction and degeneration in synucleinopathies.Methods:We performed small RNA-sequencing of midbrain from 6-month-old transgenic mice expressing A30P mutant aSyn, followed by comparative expression analysis. We then used real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) for validation. Functional analysis was performed in primary neurons by biochemical assays and imaging.Results:We found several deregulated biological processes linked to the synapse. miR-101a-3p was validated as a synaptic miRNA upregulated in aSyn Tg mice and in the cortex of dementia with Lewy bodies patients. Mice and primary cultured neurons overexpressing miR-101a-3p showed downregulation of postsynaptic proteins GABA Ab2 and SAPAP3 and altered dendritic morphology resembling synaptic plasticity impairments and/or synaptic damage. Interestingly, primary cultured neuron exposure to recombinant wild-type aSyn species efficiently increased miR-101a-3p levels. Finally, a dynamic role of miR-101a-3p in synapse plasticity was shown by identifying downregulation of miR-101a-3p in a condition of enhanced synaptic plasticity modelled in Wt animals housed in enriched environment.Conclusion:To conclude, we correlated pathologic aSyn with high levels of miR-101a-3p and a novel dynamic role of the miRNA in synaptic plasticity.",36744345,PMC10041420,10.3233/JPD-225055,4,Journal of Parkinson's disease,101567362,5.52,0.8045595288276672,0.22742474916387959,0.4882943143812709,0.6258795300056305
The Multifarious Hippocampal Functions of MicroRNA-137,"MicroRNAs (miRs) have emerged as a powerful class of endogenous noncoding RNAs involved in posttranscriptional gene expression regulation. miR-137 has repeatedly been associated with schizophrenia and intellectual disability. Recent studies describe the mechanisms of miR-137 in mediating basic synaptic transmission and plasticity in the hippocampus. A picture is emerging in which miR-137 acts as a potent player in regulating glutamatergic synaptic transmission in the hippocampus by controlling the translation of functionally critical genes at spatially opposite ends of the synapse, contributing to the pathogenesis of cognitive impairments as seen in neurodevelopmental disorders.",26396150,,10.1177/1073858415608356,5,"The Neuroscientist : a review journal bringing neurobiology, neurology and",9504819,7.235,0.79739910364151,0.2909698996655518,0.7023411371237458,0.6771016695427655
MicroRNAs in Neurocognitive Dysfunctions: New Molecular Targets for Pharmacological Treatments?,"Background:Neurodegenerative and cognitive disorders are multifactorial diseases (i.e., involving neurodevelopmental, genetic, age or environmental factors) characterized by an abnormal development that affects neuronal function and integrity. Recently, an increasing number of studies revealed that the dysregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) may be involved in the etiology of cognitive disorders as Alzheimer, Parkinson, and Huntington's diseases, Schizophrenia and Autism spectrum disorders.Methods:From an extensive search in bibliographic databases of peer-reviewed research literature, we identified relevant published studies related to specific key words such as memory, cognition, neurodegenerative disorders, neurogenesis and miRNA. We then analysed, evaluated and summerized scientific evidences derived from these studies.Results:We first briefly summarize the basic molecular events involved in memory, a process inherent to cognitive disease, and then describe the role of miRNAs in neurodevelopment, synaptic plasticity and memory. Secondly, we provide an overview of the impact of miRNA dysregulation in the pathogenesis of different neurocognitive disorders, and lastly discuss the feasibility of miRNA-based therapeutics in the treatment of these disorders.Conclusion:This review highlights the molecular basis of neurodegenerative and cognitive disorders by focusing on the impact of miRNAs dysregulation in these pathological phenotypes. Altogether, the published reports suggest that miRNAs-based therapy could be a viable therapeutic alternative to current treatment options in the future.",27396304,PMC5412695,10.2174/1570159x14666160709001441,28,Current neuropharmacology,101157239,7.708,0.7954992651939392,0.7625418060200669,0.7692307692307693,0.7836540741665308
miRNA-34c Overexpression Causes Dendritic Loss and Memory Decline,"Microribonucleic acids (miRNAs) play a pivotal role in numerous aspects of the nervous system and are increasingly recognized as key regulators in neurodegenerative diseases. This study hypothesized that miR-34c, a miRNA expressed in mammalian hippocampi whose expression level can alter the hippocampal dendritic spine density, could induce memory impairment akin to that of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) in mice. In this study, we showed that miR-34c overexpression in hippocampal neurons negatively regulated dendritic length and spine density. Hippocampal neurons transfected with miR-34c had shorter dendrites on average and fewer filopodia and spines than those not transfected with miR-34c (control mice). Because dendrites and synapses are key sites for signal transduction and fundamental structures for memory formation and storage, disrupted dendrites can contribute to AD. Therefore, we supposed that miR-34c, through its effects on dendritic spine density, influences synaptic plasticity and plays a key role in AD pathogenesis.",30096777,PMC6121231,10.3390/ijms19082323,14,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,6.208,0.7947037816047668,0.5551839464882943,0.5819397993311036,0.7042470181267397
MiRNA Biogenesis and Regulation of Diseases: An Overview,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small RNA molecules, with their role in gene silencing and translational repression by binding to target mRNAs. Since it was discovered in 1993, miRNA are found in all eukaryotic cells conserved across the species. In recent years, regulation of miRNAs are extensively studied for their role in biological processes as well as in development and progression of various human diseases including retinal disorder, neurodegenerative diseases, cardiovascular disease and cancer. This chapter summarises miRNA biogenesis and explores their potential roles in a variety of diseases. miRNAs holds huge potential for diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, and as predictors of drug response.",27826912,,10.1007/978-1-4939-6524-3_1,323,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,0.0,0.7902066707611084,0.9966555183946488,0.0,0.6734551061355948
The Impact of Dysregulated microRNA Biogenesis Machinery and microRNA Sorting on Neurodegenerative Diseases,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are 22-nucleotide noncoding RNAs involved in the differentiation, development, and function of cells in the body by targeting the 3'- untranslated regions (UTR) of mRNAs for degradation or translational inhibition. miRNAs not only affect gene expression inside the cells but also, when sorted into exosomes, systemically mediate the communication between different types of cells. Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) are age-associated, chronic neurological diseases characterized by the aggregation of misfolded proteins, which results in the progressive degeneration of selected neuronal population(s). The dysregulation of biogenesis and/or sorting of miRNAs into exosomes was reported in several NDs, including Huntington's disease (HD), Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Many studies support the possible roles of dysregulated miRNAs in NDs as biomarkers and therapeutic treatments. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the dysregulated miRNAs in NDs is therefore timely and important for the development of diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. In this review, we focus on the dysregulated miRNA machinery and the role of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) in NDs. The tools that are available to identify the target miRNA-mRNA axes in NDs in an unbiased manner are also discussed.",36834853,PMC9959302,10.3390/ijms24043443,4,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,6.208,0.7900447249412537,0.23076923076923078,0.5852842809364549,0.6372375373058894
miRNAs: Key Players in Neurodegenerative Disorders and Epilepsy,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous, â¼22 nucleotide, non-coding RNA molecules that function as post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression. miRNA dysregulation has been observed in cancer and in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's diseases, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and the neurological disorder, epilepsy. Neuronal degradation and death are important hallmarks of neurodegenerative disorders. Additionally, abnormalities in metabolism, synapsis and axonal transport have been associated with Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and frontotemporal dementia. A number of recently published studies have demonstrated the importance of miRNAs in the nervous system and have contributed to the growing body of evidence on miRNA dysregulation in neurological disorders. Knowledge of the expressions and activities of such miRNAs may aid in the development of novel therapeutics. In this review, we discuss the significance of miRNA dysregulation in the development of neurodegenerative disorders and the use of miRNAs as targets for therapeutic intervention.",26402105,PMC5187980,10.3233/JAD-150395,57,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,4.16,0.783326268196106,0.9096989966555183,0.3076923076923077,0.7134740217872289
The Brain-Enriched MicroRNA miR-9-3p Regulates Synaptic Plasticity and Memory,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, noncoding RNAs that posttranscriptionally regulate gene expression in many tissues. Although a number of brain-enriched miRNAs have been identified, only a few specific miRNAs have been revealed as critical regulators of synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory. miR-9-5p/3p are brain-enriched miRNAs known to regulate development and their changes have been implicated in several neurological disorders, yet their role in mature neurons in mice is largely unknown. Here, we report that inhibition of miR-9-3p, but not miR-9-5p, impaired hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) without affecting basal synaptic transmission. Moreover, inhibition of miR-9-3p in the hippocampus resulted in learning and memory deficits. Furthermore, miR-9-3p inhibition increased the expression of the LTP-related genes Dmd and SAP97, the expression levels of which are negatively correlated with LTP. These results suggest that miR-9-3p-mediated gene regulation plays important roles in synaptic plasticity and hippocampus-dependent memory.Significance statement:Despite the abundant expression of the brain-specific microRNA miR-9-5p/3p in both proliferating and postmitotic neurons, most functional studies have focused on their role in neuronal development. Here, we examined the role of miR-9-5p/3p in adult brain and found that miR-9-3p, but not miR-9-5p, has a critical role in hippocampal synaptic plasticity and memory. Moreover, we identified in vivo binding targets of miR-9-3p that are involved in the regulation of long-term potentiation. Our study provides the very first evidence for the critical role of miR-9-3p in synaptic plasticity and memory in the adult mouse.",27535911,PMC6601897,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0630-16.2016,53,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for,8102140,6.709,0.7718434929847717,0.8996655518394648,0.6588628762541806,0.7748117814095922
"Role of MicroRNAs, Aptamers in Neuroinflammation and Neurodegenerative Disorders","Exploring the microRNAs and aptamers for their therapeutic role as biological drugs has expanded the horizon of its applicability against various human diseases, explicitly targeting the genetic materials. RNA-based therapeutics are widely being explored for the treatment and diagnosis of multiple diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders (NDD). Latter includes microRNA, aptamers, ribozymes, and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), which control the gene expression mainly at the transcriptional strata. One RNA transcript translates into different protein types; hence, therapies targeted at the transcriptional sphere may have prominent and more extensive effects than alternative therapeutics. Unlike conventional gene therapy, RNAs, upon delivery, can either altogether abolish or alter the synthesis of the protein of interest, therefore, regulating their activities in a controlled and diverse manner. NDDs like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, multiple sclerosis, Prion disease, and others are characterized by deposition of misfolded protein such as amyloid-Ã, tau, Î±-synuclein, huntingtin and prion proteins. Neuroinflammation, one of the perquisites for neurodegeneration, is induced during neurodegenerative pathogenesis. In this review, we discuss microRNAs and aptamers' role as two different RNA-based approaches for their unique ability to regulate protein production at the transcription level, hence offering many advantages over other biologicals. The microRNA acts either by alleviating the malfunctioning RNA expression or by working as a replacement to lost microRNA. On the contrary, aptamer act as a chemical antibody and forms an aptamer-target complex.",33934227,,10.1007/s10571-021-01093-4,19,Cellular and molecular neurobiology,8200709,4.231,0.7711548805236816,0.6354515050167224,0.32441471571906355,0.6546661724613662
Environmental control of microRNAs in the nervous system: Implications in plasticity and behavior,"The discovery of microRNAs (miRNAs) a little over 20 years ago was revolutionary given that miRNAs are essential to numerous physiological and physiopathological processes. Currently, several aspects of the biogenic process of miRNAs and of the translational repression mechanism exerted on their targets mRNAs are known in detail. In fact, the development of bioinformatics tools for predicting miRNA targets has established that miRNAs have the potential to regulate almost all known biological processes. Therefore, the identification of the signals and molecular mechanisms that regulate miRNA function is relevant to understanding the role of miRNAs in both pathological and adaptive processes. Recently, a series of studies has focused on miRNA expression in the brain, establishing that their levels are altered in response to various environmental factors (EFs), such as light, sound, odorants, nutrients, drugs and stress. In this review, we discuss how exposure to various EFs modulates the expression and function of several miRNAs in the nervous system and how this control determines adaptation to their environment, behavior and disease state.",26593111,,10.1016/j.neubiorev.2015.10.010,12,Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews,7806090,9.052,0.7706374526023865,0.5284280936454849,0.7993311036789298,0.7279343110263149
"MicroRNA Alteration, Application as Biomarkers, and Therapeutic Approaches in Neurodegenerative Diseases","MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are essential post-transcriptional gene regulators involved in various neuronal and non-neuronal cell functions and play a key role in pathological conditions. Numerous studies have demonstrated that miRNAs are dysregulated in major neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Huntington's disease. Hence, in the present work, we constructed a comprehensive overview of individual microRNA alterations in various models of the above neurodegenerative diseases. We also provided evidence of miRNAs as promising biomarkers for prognostic and diagnostic approaches. In addition, we summarized data from the literature about miRNA-based therapeutic applications via inhibiting or promoting miRNA expression. We finally identified the overlapping miRNA signature across the diseases, including miR-128, miR-140-5p, miR-206, miR-326, and miR-155, associated with multiple etiological cellular mechanisms. However, it remains to be established whether and to what extent miRNA-based therapies could be safely exploited in the future as effective symptomatic or disease-modifying approaches in the different human neurodegenerative disorders.",35563107,PMC9104163,10.3390/ijms23094718,21,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,6.208,0.7654179930686951,0.6622073578595318,0.5886287625418061,0.7094180199214846
Mir324 knockout regulates the structure of dendritic spines and impairs hippocampal long-term potentiation,"MicroRNAs are an emerging class of synaptic regulators. These small noncoding RNAs post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression, thereby altering neuronal pathways and shaping cell-to-cell communication. Their ability to rapidly alter gene expression and target multiple pathways makes them interesting candidates in the study of synaptic plasticity. Here, we demonstrate that the proconvulsive microRNA miR-324-5p regulates excitatory synapse structure and function in the hippocampus of mice. Both Mir324 knockout (KO) and miR-324-5p antagomir treatment significantly reduce dendritic spine density in the hippocampal CA1 subregion, and Mir324 KO, but not miR-324-5p antagomir treatment, shift dendritic spine morphology, reducing the proportion of thin, ""unstable"" spines. Western blot and quantitative Real-Time PCR revealed changes in protein and mRNA levels for potassium channels, cytoskeletal components, and synaptic markers, including MAP2 and Kv4.2, which are important for long-term potentiation (LTP). In line with these findings, slice electrophysiology revealed that LTP is severely impaired in Mir324 KO mice, while neurotransmitter release probability remains unchanged. Overall, this study demonstrates that miR-324-5p regulates dendritic spine density, morphology, and plasticity in the hippocampus, potentially via multiple cytoskeletal and synaptic modulators.",38082035,PMC10713680,10.1038/s41598-023-49134-w,1,Scientific reports,101563288,4.996,0.7624240517616272,0.0903010033444816,0.4013377926421405,0.5557821902543008
microRNA-425 loss mediates amyloid plaque microenvironment heterogeneity and promotes neurodegenerative pathologies,"Different cellular and molecular changes underlie the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Among these, neuron-specific dysregulation is a necessary event for accumulation of classic pathologies including amyloid plaques. Here, we show that AD-associated pathophysiology including neuronal cell death, inflammatory signaling, and endolysosomal dysfunction is spatially colocalized to amyloid plaques in regions with abnormal microRNA-425 (miR-425) levels and this change leads to focal brain microenvironment heterogeneity, that is, an amyloid plaque-associated microenvironment (APAM). APAM consists of multiple specific neurodegenerative signature pathologies associated with senile plaques that contribute to the heterogeneity and complexity of AD. Remarkably, miR-425, a neuronal-specific regulator decreased in AD brain, maintains a normal spatial transcriptome within brain neurons. We tested the hypothesis that miR-425 loss correlates with enhanced levels of mRNA targets downstream, supporting APAM and AD progression. A miR-425-deficient mouse model has enhanced APP amyloidogenic processing, neuroinflammation, neuron loss, and cognitive impairment. In the APP/PS1 mouse model, intervening with miR-425 supplementation ameliorated APAM changes and memory deficits. This study reveals a novel mechanism of dysregulation of spatial transcriptomic changes in AD brain, identifying a probable neuronal-specific microRNA regulator capable of staving off amyloid pathogenesis. Moreover, our findings provide new insights for developing AD treatment strategies with miRNA oligonucleotide(s).",34510683,PMC8520725,10.1111/acel.13454,6,Aging cell,101130839,11.005,0.7595822811126709,0.33444816053511706,0.862876254180602,0.6952142516107462
A meta-analysis of gene expression data highlights synaptic dysfunction in the hippocampus of brains with Alzheimer's disease,"Since the world population is ageing, dementia is going to be a growing concern. Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia. The pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease is extensively studied, yet unknown remains. Therefore, we aimed to extract new knowledge from existing data. We analysed about 2700 upregulated genes and 2200 downregulated genes from three studies on the CA1 of the hippocampus of brains with Alzheimer's disease. We found that only the calcium signalling pathway enriched by 48 downregulated genes was consistent between all three studies. We predicted miR-129 to target nine out of 48 genes. Then, we validated miR-129 to regulate six out of nine genes in HEK cells. We noticed that four out of six genes play a role in synaptic plasticity. Finally, we confirmed the upregulation of miR-129 in the hippocampus of brains of rats with scopolamine-induced amnesia as a model of Alzheimer's disease. We suggest that future research should investigate the possible role of miR-129 in synaptic plasticity and Alzheimer's disease. This paper presents a novel framework to gain insight into potential biomarkers and targets for diagnosis and treatment of diseases.",32433480,PMC7239885,10.1038/s41598-020-64452-z,10,Scientific reports,101563288,4.996,0.7585106492042542,0.4916387959866221,0.40468227424749165,0.6343706035693752
A New Player in Depression: MiRNAs as Modulators of Altered Synaptic Plasticity,"Depression is a psychiatric disorder that presents with a persistent depressed mood as the main clinical feature and is accompanied by cognitive impairment. Changes in neuroplasticity and neurogenesis greatly affect depression. Without genetic changes, epigenetic mechanisms have been shown to function by regulating gene expression during the body's adaptation to stress. Studies in recent years have shown that as important regulatory factors in epigenetic mechanisms, microRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in the development and progression of depression through the regulation of protein expression. Herein, we review the mechanisms of miRNA-mediated neuroplasticity in depression and discus synaptic structural plasticity, synaptic functional plasticity, and neurogenesis. Furthermore, we found that miRNAs regulate neuroplasticity through several signalling pathways to affect cognitive functions. However, these pathways do not work independently. Therefore, we try to identify synergistic correlations between miRNAs and multiple signalling pathways to broaden the potential pathogenesis of depression. In addition, in the future, dual-function miRNAs (protection/injury) are promising candidate biomarkers for the diagnosis of depression, and their regulated genes can potentially be used as target genes for the treatment of depression.",35562946,PMC9101307,10.3390/ijms23094555,10,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,6.208,0.7570766806602478,0.49498327759197325,0.5919732441471572,0.6716373127439749
"Expression of microRNA-34a in Alzheimer's disease brain targets genes linked to synaptic plasticity, energy metabolism, and resting state network activity","Polygenetic risk factors and reduced expression of many genes in late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) impedes identification of a target(s) for disease-modifying therapies. We identified a single microRNA, miR-34a that is over expressed in specific brain regions of AD patients as well as in the 3xTg-AD mouse model. Specifically, increased miR-34a expression in the temporal cortex region compared to age matched healthy control correlates with severity of AD pathology. miR-34a over expression in patient's tissue and forced expression in primary neuronal culture correlates with concurrent repression of its target genes involved in synaptic plasticity, oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis. The repression of oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis related proteins correlates with reduced ATP production and glycolytic capacity, respectively. We also found that miR-34a overexpressed neurons secrete miR-34a containing exosomes that are taken up by neighboring neurons. Furthermore, miR-34a targets dozens of genes whose expressions are known to be correlated with synchronous activity in resting state functional networks. Our analysis of human genomic sequences from the tentative promoter of miR-34a gene shows the presence of NFÎºB, STAT1, c-Fos, CREB and p53 response elements. Together, our results raise the possibilities that pathophysiology-induced activation of specific transcription factor may lead to increased expression of miR-34a gene and miR-34a mediated concurrent repression of its target genes in neural networks may result in dysfunction of synaptic plasticity, energy metabolism, and resting state network activity. Thus, our results provide insights into polygenetic AD mechanisms and disclose miR-34a as a potential therapeutic target for AD.",27235866,PMC4975975,10.1016/j.brainres.2016.05.026,90,Brain research,45503,3.61,0.7563575506210327,0.9531772575250836,0.2408026755852843,0.6926105169946932
Down-regulated expression of microRNA-338-5p contributes to neuropathology in Alzheimer's disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a leading cause of dementia. However, the mechanisms responsible for development of AD, especially for the sporadic variant, are still not clear. In our previous study, we discovered that a small noncoding RNA (miR-188-3p) targeting Î²-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme (BACE)-1, a key enzyme responsible for AÎ² formation, plays an important role in the development of neuropathology in AD. In the present study, we identified that miR-338-5p, a new miRNA that also targets BACE1, contributes to AD neuropathology. We observed that expression of miR-338-5p was significantly down-regulated in the hippocampus of patients with AD and 5XFAD transgenic (TG) mice, an animal model of AD. Overexpression of miR-338-5p in the hippocampus of TG mice reduced BACE1 expression, AÎ² formation, and neuroinflammation. Overexpression of miR-338-5p functionally prevented impairments in long-term synaptic plasticity, learning ability, and memory retention in TG mice. In addition, we provide evidence that down-regulated expression of miR-338-5p in AD is regulated through the NF-ÎºB signaling pathway.

MicroRNA in neurodegenerative drug discovery: the way forward?,"Neurodegenerative diseases occur when neuronal cells in the brain or spinal cord progressively lose function and eventually die. Pathological analysis of these tissues reveals changes that include the loss of synapses, tangles of misfolded protein and immune cell activation, even during very early stages of disease well before debilitating clinical signs are apparent. This suggests that if neurodegeneration is treated early enough, drugs designed to delay the progress of these diseases by either repairing the early damage and loss of neurons, or protecting neuron functionality from further insult, may be efficacious. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that can post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression. They are particularly numerous within neurons where many are expressed with high specificity, which suggests that they have important roles in the healthy brain. Indeed, miRNAs are essential for the post-mitotic survival of neurons, implying a crucial role in survival and neuroprotection. This has focused attention on exploring the use of miRNA-based drugs as a means to correct cellular abnormalities and maintain neuronal function in neurodegenerative diseases. These efforts are spurred on by the rapid progress to clinical trials for a number of miRNA-based therapies for other diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, fibrosis and cancer.",25405898,,10.1517/17460441.2015.981254,10,Expert opinion on drug discovery,101295755,7.05,0.7527403235435486,0.4983277591973244,0.68561872909699,0.6884334917849919
microRNA dysregulation in neurodegenerative diseases: A systematic review,"While the root causes for individual neurodegenerative diseases are distinct, many shared pathological features and mechanisms contribute to neurodegeneration across diseases. Altered levels of microRNAs, small non-coding RNAs involved in post transcriptional regulation of gene expression, are reported for numerous neurodegenerative diseases. Yet, comparison between diseases to uncover commonly dysregulated microRNAs during neurodegeneration in general is lagging. We performed a systematic review of peer-reviewed publications describing differential microRNA expression in neurodegenerative diseases and related animal models. We compiled the results from studies covering the prevalent neurodegenerative diseases in the literature: Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, age-related macular degeneration, ataxia, dementia, myotonic dystrophy, epilepsy, glaucoma, Huntington's disease, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and prion disorders. MicroRNAs which were dysregulated most often in these diseases and their models included miR-9-5p, miR-21-5p, the miR-29 family, miR-132-3p, miR-124-3p, miR-146a-5p, miR-155-5p, and miR-223-3p. Common pathways targeted by these predominant miRNAs were identified and revealed great functional overlap across diseases. We also identified a strong role for each microRNA in both the neural and immune components of diseases. microRNAs regulate broad networks of genes and identifying microRNAs commonly dysregulated across neurodegenerative diseases could cultivate novel hypotheses related to common molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration.",31356849,,10.1016/j.pneurobio.2019.101664,170,Progress in neurobiology,370121,10.885,0.7514657974243164,0.9899665551839465,0.8461538461538461,0.8181035587221483
Emerging role of microRNAs in major depressive disorder and its implication on diagnosis and therapeutic response,"Background:Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a serious and common psychiatric disorder with a high prevalence in the population. Although great advances have been made, its pathogenesis is still unclear and a validated biomarker for diagnosis or therapeutic response remains unidentified. This review aims at summarizing the functional role of miRNAs in MDD pathogenesis and their potential as biomarkers for MDD diagnosis and antidepressant response.Methods:We performed a bibliographic research on the main databases (PubMed, Google Scholar and Web of Science) using the terms ""microRNAs"", ""major depressive disorder"", ""synaptic plasticity"", ""biomarker"", ""antidepressant treatment"", in order to find studies that propose the role of microRNAs in MDD pathogenesis and their potential as biomarkers for MDD diagnosis and antidepressant response.Results:microRNAs (miRNAs), a class of small noncoding RNAs, act as key regulators of synaptic plasticity in MDD pathogenesis. Growing researches provide the evidence for peripheral miRNAs as potential biomarkers for MDD diagnosis and antidepressant response. These results suggest that targeting miRNAs directly could be therapeutically beneficial for MDD and miRNAs are potential biomarkers of MDD and its treatment.Limitations:The role of miRNAs in MDD pathogenesis needs further investigation. Whether miRNAs in peripheral tissues truly represent brain-derived miRNAs is still unclear at the present time. Moreover, only a few blood miRNAs alterations are consistent across studies.Conclusions:Overall, miRNAs act key regulators of synaptic plasticity in MDD pathogenesis and hold significant promise as biomarkers or therapeutic targets for MDD, but further research is still needed.",33714174,,10.1016/j.jad.2021.02.063,21,Journal of affective disorders,7906073,6.533,0.7503699064254761,0.6655518394648829,0.6421404682274248,0.7117604053937472

MicroRNAs underlying memory deficits in neurodegenerative disorders,"Neurodegenerative disorders are defined by neuronal loss and often associated with dementia. Understanding the multifactorial nature of cognitive decline is of particular interest. Cell loss is certainly a possibility but also an early imbalance in the complex gene networks involved in learning and memory. The small (~22nt) non-coding microRNAs play a major role in gene expression regulation and have been linked to neuronal survival and cognition. Interestingly, changes in microRNA signatures are associated with neurodegenerative disorders. In this review, we explore the role of three microRNAs, namely miR-132, miR-124 and miR-34, which are dysregulated in major neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease. Interestingly, these microRNAs have been associated with both memory impairment and neuronal survival, providing a potential common molecular mechanism contributing to dementia.",27117821,,10.1016/j.pnpbp.2016.04.011,39,Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry,8211617,5.201,0.7440989017486572,0.8294314381270903,0.451505016722408,0.7026466320190939
Novel microRNA revealed by systematic analysis of the microRNA transcriptome in dentate gyrus granule cells,"Post-transcriptional control of gene expression by microRNAs provides an important regulatory system within neurons, allowing co-ordinate and fine-tuned expression of plasticity-related proteins. Indeed, specific microRNAs have been shown to be regulated by synaptic activity in the dentate gyrus, and contribute to the regulated gene expression that underlies the persistence of long-term potentiation (LTP), a model of memory. To fully explore the contribution of microRNAs in synaptic plasticity, it is important to characterize the complete microRNA transcriptome in regions such as the dentate gyrus. Accordingly we used deep sequencing and miRDeep* analysis to search for novel microRNAs expressed in the dentate gyrus granule cell layer. Drawing on combined sequencing and bioinformatics analyses, including hairpin stability and patterns of precursor microRNA processing, we identified nine putative novel microRNAs. We did not find evidence of differential expression of any of these putative microRNAs following LTP at perforant path-granule cell synapses in awake rats (5 h post-tetanus; p > 0.05). Focusing on novel_miR-1, the most abundant novel miRNA, we showed that this sequence could be amplified from RNA extracted from dentate gyrus granule cells by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Further, by computationally predicting mRNA targets of this microRNA, we found that this novel microRNA likely contributes to the regulation of proteins that function at synapses.",27612590,,10.1016/j.neulet.2016.09.003,3,Neuroscience letters,7600130,3.197,0.7412996292114258,0.18394648829431437,0.20735785953177258,0.5230406470920729
The MicroRNA Centrism in the Orchestration of Neuroinflammation in Neurodegenerative Diseases,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs with a unique ability to regulate the transcriptomic profile by binding to complementary regulatory RNA sequences. The ability of miRNAs to enhance (proinflammatory miRNAs) or restrict (anti-inflammatory miRNAs) inflammatory signalling within the central nervous system is an area of ongoing research, particularly in the context of disorders that feature neuroinflammation, including neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs). Furthermore, the discovery of competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) has led to an increase in the complexity of miRNA-mediated gene regulation, with a paradigm shift from a unidirectional to a bidirectional regulation, where miRNA acts as both a regulator and is regulated by ceRNAs. Increasing evidence has revealed that ceRNAs, including long non-coding RNAs, circular RNAs, and pseudogenes, can act as miRNA sponges to regulate neuroinflammation in NDDs within complex cross-talk regulatory machinery, which is referred to as ceRNA network (ceRNET). In this review, we discuss the role of miRNAs in neuroinflammatory regulation and the manner in which cellular and vesicular ceRNETs could influence neuroinflammatory dynamics in complex multifactorial diseases, such as NDDs.",31581723,PMC6829202,10.3390/cells8101193,16,Cells,101600052,7.666,0.7405498623847961,0.6020066889632107,0.7357859531772575,0.7118884458589714
MicroRNAs in Extracellular Vesicles of Alzheimer's Disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease with dysfunction of memory, language and thinking. More than 55 million people were diagnosed with AD or other dementia around the world in 2020. The pathology of AD is still unclear and there are no applicable therapies for AD. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play key roles in AD pathology and have great potential for the diagnosis and treatment of AD. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) widely exist in body fluids such as blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and contain miRNAs that are involved in cell-to-cell communication. We summarized the dysregulated miRNAs in EVs derived from the different body fluids of AD patients, as well as their potential function and application in AD. We also compared these dysregulated miRNAs in EVs to those in the brain tissues of AD patients aiming to provide a comprehensive view of miRNAs in AD. After careful comparisons, we found that miR-125b-5p and miR-132-3p were upregulated and downregulated in several different brain tissues of AD and EVs of AD, respectively, suggesting their value in AD diagnosis based on EV miRNAs. Furthermore, miR-9-5p was dysregulated in EVs and different brain tissues of AD patients and had also been tested as a potential therapy for AD in mice and human cell models, suggesting that miR-9-5p could be used to design new therapies for AD.",37408212,PMC10216432,10.3390/cells12101378,5,Cells,101600052,7.666,0.7324004769325256,0.29431438127090304,0.7391304347826086,0.6461292493702177
The promise of microRNA-based therapies in Alzheimer's disease: challenges and perspectives,"Multi-pathway approaches for the treatment of complex polygenic disorders are emerging as alternatives to classical monotarget therapies and microRNAs are of particular interest in that regard. MicroRNA research has come a long way from their initial discovery to the cumulative appreciation of their regulatory potential in healthy and diseased brain. However, systematic interrogation of putative therapeutic or toxic effects of microRNAs in (models of) Alzheimer's disease is currently missing and fundamental research findings are yet to be translated into clinical applications.

Interplay of RNA-Binding Proteins and microRNAs in Neurodegenerative Diseases,"The number of patients with neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) is increasing, along with the growing number of older adults. This escalation threatens to create a medical and social crisis. NDs include a large spectrum of heterogeneous and multifactorial pathologies, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal dementia, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease and multiple system atrophy, and the formation of inclusion bodies resulting from protein misfolding and aggregation is a hallmark of these disorders. The proteinaceous components of the pathological inclusions include several RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), which play important roles in splicing, stability, transcription and translation. In addition, RBPs were shown to play a critical role in regulating miRNA biogenesis and metabolism. The dysfunction of both RBPs and miRNAs is often observed in several NDs. Thus, the data about the interplay among RBPs and miRNAs and their cooperation in brain functions would be important to know for better understanding NDs and the development of effective therapeutics. In this review, we focused on the connection between miRNAs, RBPs and neurodegenerative diseases.",34069857,PMC8157344,10.3390/ijms22105292,21,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,6.208,0.729616105556488,0.6688963210702341,0.5953177257525084,0.6906124726984413
Role of microRNA (miRNA) and Viroids in Lethal Diseases of Plants and Animals. Potential Contribution to Human Neurodegenerative Disorders,"Both plants and animals have adopted a common strategy of using ~18-25-nucleotide small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs), known as microRNAs (miRNAs), to transmit DNA-based epigenetic information. miRNAs (i) shape the total transcriptional output of individual cells; (ii) regulate and fine-tune gene expression profiles of cell clusters, and (iii) modulate cell phenotype in response to environmental stimuli and stressors. These miRNAs, the smallest known carriers of gene-encoded post-transcriptional regulatory information, not only regulate cellular function in healthy cells but also act as important mediators in the development of plant and animal diseases. Plants possess their own specific miRNAs; at least 32 plant species have been found to carry infectious sncRNAs called viroids, whose mechanisms of generation and functions are strikingly similar to those of miRNAs. This review highlights recent remarkable and sometimes controversial findings in miRNA signaling in plants and animals. Special attention is given to the intriguing possibility that dietary miRNAs and/or sncRNAs can function as mobile epigenetic and/or evolutionary linkers between different species and contribute to both intra- and interkingdom signaling. Wherever possible, emphasis has been placed on the relevance of these miRNAs to the development of human neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease. Based on the current available data, we suggest that such xeno-miRNAs may (i) contribute to the beneficial properties of medicinal plants, (ii) contribute to the negative properties of disease-causing or poisonous plants, and (iii) provide cross-species communication between kingdoms of living organisms involving multiple epigenetic and/or potentially pathogenic mechanisms associated with the onset and pathogenesis of various diseases.",30472940,,10.1134/S0006297918090031,7,Biochemistry.

microRNAs and Fragile X Syndrome,"Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is one of the major causes for autism and mental retardation in humans. The etiology of FXS is linked to the expansion of the CGG trinucleotide repeats, r(CGG), suppressing the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene on the X chromosome, resulting in a loss of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) expression, which is required for regulating normal neuronal connectivity and plasticity. Recent studies have further identified that microRNAs are involved in the mechanisms underlying FXS pathogenesis at three different developmental stages. During early embryogenesis before the blastocyst stage, an embryonic stem cell (ESC)-specific microRNA, miR-302, interferes with FMR1 mRNA translation to maintain the stem cell status and inhibit neural development. After blastocyst, the downregulation of miR-302 releases FMRP synthesis and subsequently leads to neuronal development; yet, in FXS, certain r(CGG)-derived microRNAs, such as miR-fmr1s, are expressed and accumulated and then induce DNA hypermethylation on the FMR1 gene promoter regions, resulting in transcriptional inactivation of the FMR1 gene and the loss of FMRP. In normal neuronal development, FMRP is an RNA-binding protein responsible for interacting with miR-125 and miR-132 to regulate the signaling of Group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR1) and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), respectively, and consequently affecting synaptic plasticity. As a result, the loss of FMRP impairs these signaling controls and eventually causes FXS-associated disorders, such as autism and mental retardation. Based on these current findings, this chapter will summarize the etiological causes of FXS and further provides significant insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying microRNA-mediated FXS pathogenesis and the related therapy development.",26663181,,10.1007/978-3-319-22671-2_7,9,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,121103,3.65,0.7250649929046631,0.4414715719063545,0.2508361204013378,0.5735005342043363
[Research progress on bidirectional effect of microRNA on Alzheimer's disease and intervention with traditional Chinese medicine],"Alzheimer's disease(AD) is a chronic progressive neurodegenerative disease with recent memory impairment as the main clinical manifestation and senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles as the main pathological changes. In recent years, the effect of microRNAs on AD has attracted widespread attention. Patients with AD have abnormal expression of miRNA, which is closed related to regulation of AD pathophysiology-related genes. Therefore, this paper first elaborated neuroprotective and toxic effects of microRNA in AD, and then explored relevant traditional Chinese medicines that can regulate miRNA in the treatment of AD, so as to provide basis for revealing the pathogenesis relationship between miRNA and AD and provide ideas for further development of anti-AD traditional Chinese medicine.",33982478,,10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20201201.601,1,Zhongguo Zhong yao za zhi = Zhongguo zhongyao zazhi = China journal of Chinese,8913656,0.0,0.7242856025695801,0.09364548494983277,0.0033444816053511705,0.4539693548527849
MicroRNA-34a Acutely Regulates Synaptic Efficacy in the Adult Dentate Gyrus In Vivo,"Activity-dependent synaptic plasticity involves rapid regulation of neuronal protein synthesis on a time-scale of minutes. miRNA function in synaptic plasticity and memory formation has been elucidated by stable experimental manipulation of miRNA expression and activity using transgenic approaches and viral vectors. However, the impact of rapid miRNA modulation on synaptic efficacy is unknown. Here, we examined the effect of acute (12 min), intrahippocampal infusion of a miR-34a antagonist (antimiR) on medial perforant path-evoked synaptic transmission in the dentate gyrus of adult anesthetised rats. AntimiR-34a infusion acutely depressed medial perforant path-evoked field excitatory post-synaptic potentials (fEPSPs). The fEPSP decrease was detected within 9 min of infusion, lasted for hours, and was associated with knockdown of antimiR-34a levels. AntimiR-34a-induced synaptic depression was sequence-specific; no changes were elicited by infusion of scrambled or mismatch control. The rapid modulation suggests that a target, or set of targets, is regulated by miR-34a. Western blot analysis of dentate gyrus lysates revealed enhanced expression of Arc, a known miR-34a target, and four novel predicted targets (Ctip2, PKI-1Î±, TCF4 and Ube2g1). Remarkably, antimiR-34a had no effect when infused during the maintenance phase of long-term potentiation. We conclude that miR-34a regulates basal synaptic efficacy in the adult dentate gyrus in vivo. To our knowledge, these in vivo findings are the first to demonstrate acute (< 9 min) regulation of synaptic efficacy in the adult brain by a miRNA.",31754996,,10.1007/s12035-019-01816-1,8,Molecular neurobiology,8900963,5.682,0.7239930033683777,0.411371237458194,0.5050167224080268,0.6176733939942707
The Relation of the Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor with MicroRNAs in Neurodegenerative Diseases and Ischemic Stroke,"Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a member of the neurotrophin family of growth factors that plays a crucial role in the development of the nervous system while supporting the survival of existing neurons and instigating neurogenesis. Altered levels of BDNF, both in the circulation and in the central nervous system (CNS), have been reported to be involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Huntington's disease (HD), multiple sclerosis (MS), and ischemic stroke. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of non-coding RNAs found in body fluids such as peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid. Several different miRNAs, and their target genes, are recognized to be involved in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative and neurovascular diseases. Thus, they present as promising biomarkers and a novel treatment approach for CNS disorders. Currently, limited studies provide viable evidence of miRNA-mediated post-transcriptional regulation of BDNF. The aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive assessment of the current knowledge regarding the potential diagnostic and prognostic values of miRNAs affecting BDNF expression and its role as a CNS disorders and neurovascular disease biomarker. Moreover, a novel therapeutic approach in neurodegenerative diseases and ischemic stroke targeting miRNAs associated with BDNF will be discussed.",32944919,PMC7695657,10.1007/s12035-020-02101-2,45,Molecular neurobiology,8900963,5.682,0.7227227091789246,0.8561872909698997,0.5083612040133779,0.7065433245040103
Regulatory roles of the miR-200 family in neurodegenerative diseases,"Neurodegenerative diseases are chronic and progressive disorders which are not effectively treated through adopting conventional therapies. For this unmet medical need, alternative therapeutic methods including gene-based therapies are emphasized. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs which can regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. In recent years, dysregulated miRNAs have been indicated to be implicated in the occurrence and development of neurodegenerative diseases. They are investigated as candidates for diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, as well as therapeutic targets. The miR-200 family consists of miR-200a, -200b, -200c, -141, and -429. Numerous studies have found that miR-200 family members are associated with the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. It is reported that miR-200 family members are aberrantly expressed in several neurodegenerative diseases, participating in various cellular processes including beta-amyloid (AÎ²) secretion, alpha-synuclein aggregation and DNA repair, etc. In the present review, we summarize the recent progress in the roles of miR-200 family in neurodegenerative diseases.",31518873,,10.1016/j.biopha.2019.109409,16,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,8213295,7.419,0.7222332954406738,0.6053511705685619,0.7090301003344481,0.6962162314450062
Role of Dicer and the miRNA system in neuronal plasticity and brain function,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small regulatory non-coding RNAs that contribute to fine-tuning regulation of gene expression by mRNA destabilization and/or translational repression. Their abundance in the nervous system, their temporally and spatially regulated expression and their ability to respond in an activity-dependent manner make miRNAs ideal candidates for the regulation of complex processes in the brain, including neuronal plasticity, memory formation and neural development. The conditional ablation of the RNase III Dicer, which is essential for the maturation of most miRNAs, is a useful model to investigate the effect of the loss of the miRNA system, as a whole, in different tissues and cellular types. In this review, we first provide an overview of Dicer function and structure, and discuss outstanding questions concerning the role of miRNAs in the regulation of gene expression and neuronal function, to later focus on the insight derived from studies in which the genetic ablation of Dicer was used to determine the role of the miRNA system in the nervous system. In particular, we highlight the collective role of miRNAs fine-tuning plasticity-related gene expression and providing robustness to neuronal gene expression networks.",27163737,,10.1016/j.nlm.2016.05.001,25,Neurobiology of learning and memory,9508166,3.109,0.7209580540657043,0.7324414715719063,0.15384615384615385,0.6098323575230347
Current Status of microRNA-Based Therapeutic Approaches in Neurodegenerative Disorders,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a key gene regulator and play essential roles in several biological and pathological mechanisms in the human system. In recent years, plenty of miRNAs have been identified to be involved in the development of neurodegenerative disorders (NDDs), thus making them an attractive option for therapeutic approaches. Hence, in this review, we provide an overview of the current research of miRNA-based therapeutics for a selected set of NDDs, either for their high prevalence or lethality, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, Friedreich's Ataxia, Spinal Muscular Atrophy, and Frontotemporal Dementia.

MicroRNA-335-5p modulates spatial memory and hippocampal synaptic plasticity,"MicroRNAs are endogenous, noncoding RNAs crucial for the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. In this study, we investigated the role of miR-335-5p in spatial learning and synaptic plasticity. To this end we first showed spatial learning induced down-regulation of miR-335-5p. Next we found impairment in long-term memory and reduction in hippocampal long-term potentiation by exogenous administration of the miRNA.

Pathogenetic and therapeutic applications of microRNAs in major depressive disorder,"As a class of noncoding RNAs, microRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression by inhibiting translation of messenger RNAs. These miRNAs have been shown to play a critical role in higher brain functioning and actively participate in synaptic plasticity. Pre-clinical evidence demonstrates that expression of miRNAs is differentially altered during stress. On the other hand, depressed individuals show marked changes in miRNA expression in brain. MiRNAs are also target of antidepressants and electroconvulsive therapy. Moreover, these miRNAs are present in circulating blood and can be easily detected. Profiling of miRNAs in blood plasma/serum provides evidence that determination of miRNAs in blood can be used as possible diagnostic and therapeutic tool. In this review article, these aspects are critically reviewed and the role of miRNAs in possible etiopathogenesis and therapeutic implications in the context of major depressive disorder is discussed.",25689819,PMC4537399,10.1016/j.pnpbp.2015.02.003,33,Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry,8211617,5.201,0.7146279811859131,0.7892976588628763,0.45484949832775917,0.677606220149675
Environment and Neurodegenerative Diseases: An Update on miRNA Role,"Introduction:The importance of neurodegenerative diseases on the management of public health is growing and the real role of the environment and miRNA in their occurrence is still unclear. miRNA can significantly affect the regulatory network. The complex variety and gene-regulatory capacity of miRNAs are particularly valuable in the brain, being a very complex organ with a functional specialization of neurons highly adaptable to environmental stimuli. In particular, an miRNAs role is demonstrated in neurological diseases as an effect to toxic and mutagenic substances exposure by the environment.Objective:The focus was on the three most important neurodegenerative diseases: Alzheimer, Parkinson and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.Materials and methods:A brief critical review on scientific papers of the last ten years using PuBMED, Scopus, Web of Science and Cochrane databases was carried out.Results:Several studies have shown that miRNAs may contribute to neurodegeneration process in response to environmental risks. The miRNAs are known to play a dynamic role in many biochemical pathways of mammalian's brain, including neuroplasticity, stress responses, cellular signaling, etc. miRNAs have a role in neurodegenerative phenotype of AD, PD and ALS. The environmental chemicals such as metals and pesticides and then behavior can cause miRNA alterations via increasing oxidative stress and/or triggering inflammatory responses.Conclusion:A discussion with theoretical and possible future research directions is provided and it is clear that the need is not only of longitudinal population studies and of better knowledge of epigenetics markers but, especially, of environmental policy interventions based on the green economy.",28799488,,10.2174/2211536606666170811151503,42,"MicroRNA (Shariqah, United Arab Emirates)",101631045,0.0,0.7120319604873657,0.8461538461538461,0.006688963210702341,0.5977877381653292
Understanding the roles and regulation of mitochondrial microRNAs (MitomiRs) in neurodegenerative diseases: Current status and advances,"MicroRNAs (miRNA) are a class of small non-coding RNA, roughly 21-22 nucleotides in length, which are master gene regulators. These miRNAs bind to the mRNA's 3' - untranslated region and regulate post-transcriptional gene regulation, thereby influencing various physiological and cellular processes. Another class of miRNAs known as mitochondrial miRNA (MitomiRs) has been found to either originate from the mitochondrial genome or be translocated directly into the mitochondria. Although the role of nuclear DNA encoded miRNA in the progression of various neurological diseases such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, etc. is well known, accumulating evidence suggests the possible role of deregulated mitomiRs in the progression of various neurodegenerative diseases with unknown mechanism. We have attempted to outline the current state of mitomiRs role in controlling mitochondrial gene expression and function through this review, paying particular attention to their contribution to neurological processes, their etiology, and their potential therapeutic use.",37329989,,10.1016/j.mad.2023.111838,1,Mechanisms of ageing and development,347227,5.498,0.7106282711029053,0.09698996655518395,0.4816053511705686,0.5420960262068937
[Research Progress of microRNA-7/124/155 in Parkinson's Disease],"Parkinson's disease(PD)is the second most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer's disease,with high morbidity and high disability rate.Since the early symptoms of PD are not typical and often similar to those of normal aging or other diseases.It is easy to missed diagnosis and misdiagnosis,which seriously affects the diagnosis and treatment of this disease and aggravetes the burden on the patients' life.MicroRNAs(miRNA)are a class of endogenous non-coding RNAs that are involved in post-transcriptional regulation by binding to target messenger RNAs(mRNA).They are highly conserved,short,easy to obtain,and can stably exist in peripheral body fluids.They have been used as biomarkers for a variety of diseases.Recent studies have demonstrated that miRNA play an important role in the development of PD.This paper reviews the recent research progress of miR-7/124/155,three mature miRNA in PD,aiming to provide reference for clarifying the pathogenesis and guiding the diagnosis and treatment of PD.",37407538,,10.3881/j.issn.1000-503X.15244,0,Zhongguo yi xue ke xue yuan xue bao.

Targeting MicroRNAs Involved in the BDNF Signaling Impairment in Neurodegenerative Diseases,"Neurodegenerative diseases are becoming an ever-increasing problem in aging populations. Low levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) have previously been associated with the pathogenesis of numerous neurodegenerative diseases. Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) have been proposed as potential novel therapeutic targets for treating various diseases of the central nervous system (CNS), and interestingly, few studies have reported several miRNAs that downregulate the expression levels of BDNF. However, substantial challenges exist when attempting to translate these findings into practical anti-miRNA therapeutics, especially when the targets remain inside the CNS. Thus, in this review, we summarize the specific molecular mechanisms by which several miRNAs negatively modulate the expressions of BDNF, address the potential clinical difficulties that can be faced during the development of anti-miRNA-based therapeutics and propose strategies to overcome these challenges.",27209362,,10.1007/s12017-016-8407-9,4,Neuromolecular medicine,101135365,4.103,0.7073035836219788,0.23411371237458195,0.2976588628762542,0.5307366652233545
Role of miR-219a-5p in regulating NMDAR in nonylphenol-induced synaptic plasticity damage,"Nonylphenol (NP) is a typical environmental endocrine disruptor with estrogenic effects. It serves as an emulsifier and as the main ingredient of detergents and has become an increasingly common pollutant in both fresh and salt water, vegetables, and fruits. This study aimed to clarify whether NP exposure could lead to cognitive dysfunction and synaptic plasticity impairment, and also explore the mechanism of microRNA (miR)- 219a-5p regulation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) in NP-induced synaptic plasticity impairment in vivo and in vitro. In vivo, 30 male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 2 groups: blank control group (pure corn oil) and NP-exposed group [NP 80 mg/(kgÂ·d)], with 15 rats in each group. In vitro, the extracted hippocampal neurons were divided into 6 groups: blank control group, mimics NC group, miR-219 mimics group, NP group (70 Î¼mol/L NP), NP + mimics NC group, and NP + miR-219 mimics group. In vivo, the content of NP in hippocampal tissues after 90 days of NP exposure was significantly higher in the NP-stained group than in the blank control group. NP exposure could lead to a decrease in the ability to learn and memory, ability to remember, and space spatial memory ability in rats. The dendrites in the NP-stained group were disordered, with few dendritic spines and significantly decreased dendritic spine density. The postsynaptic densities were loosely arranged, the thickness and length of the postsynaptic densities shortened, and the length and width of the synaptic gap increased. Glutamine (Glu) and Î³-aminobutyric acid (GABA) contents in hippocampal tissues decreased in the NP-stained group. The expression of miR-219a-5p mRNA decreased in the NP-stained group after 3 months of NP exposure. The expression of NMDAR1, NMDAR2A, NMDAR2B, nerve growth-associated protein (GAP-43), and Ca/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) mRNA/proteins decreased in the NP-stained group. In vitro, NMDAR protein expression decreased, while GAP-43 and CaMKII protein expression increased in the miR-219 mimics group compared with the control group. The expression levels of NMDAR and GAP-43 and CaMKII proteins were higher in the NP + miR-219 mimics group compared with the NP group. The levels of neurotransmitters Glu and GABA decreased in the NP and NP + mimics NC groups compared with the blank group. Shortened synaptic active band length, decreased thickness of postsynaptic densities, and shortened length of postsynaptic densities were observed in the NP, NP + mimics NC, and NP + miR-219 mimics groups compared with the blank control group. In vivo, NP exposure reduced learning memory capacity and neurotransmitter content in rats and caused a decrease in dendritic spine density and synaptic number density and a decrease in miR-219a-5p expression. In vitro, high expression of miR-219a-5p inhibited the expression of NMDAR, thus reducing the effect of NP on synaptic plasticity impairment in hippocampal neurons. Our study provided a scientific basis for the prevention of cognitive impairment owing to NP exposure and the development of targeted drug treatment strategies.",36736231,,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2023.114576,2,Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,7805381,7.129,0.7038548588752747,0.13377926421404682,0.6956521739130435,0.5881992029505828
"microRNAs as neuroregulators, biomarkers and therapeutic agents in neurodegenerative diseases","The last decade has experienced the emergence of microRNAs as a key molecular tool for the diagnosis and prognosis of human diseases. Although the focus has mostly been on cancer, neurodegenerative diseases present an exciting, yet less explored, platform for microRNA research. Several studies have highlighted the significance of microRNAs in neurogenesis and neurodegeneration, and pre-clinical studies have shown the potential of microRNAs as biomarkers. Despite this, no bona fide microRNAs have been identified as true diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers for neurodegenerative disease. This is mainly due to the lack of precisely defined patient cohorts and the variability within and between individual cohorts. However, the discovery that microRNAs exist as stable molecules at detectable levels in body fluids has opened up new avenues for microRNAs as potential biomarker candidates. Furthermore, technological developments in microRNA biology have contributed to the possible design of microRNA-mediated disease intervention strategies. The combination of these advancements, with the availability of well-defined longitudinal patient cohort, promises to not only assist in developing invaluable diagnostic tools for clinicians, but also to increase our overall understanding of the underlying heterogeneity of neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we present a comprehensive overview of the existing knowledge of microRNAs in neurodegeneration and provide a perspective of the applicability of microRNAs as a basis for future therapeutic intervention strategies.",26608596,PMC11108480,10.1007/s00018-015-2093-x,51,Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS,9705402,9.207,0.6999726891517639,0.8896321070234113,0.8160535117056856,0.7611207372368777
NMDAR-dependent Argonaute 2 phosphorylation regulates miRNA activity and dendritic spine plasticity,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) repress translation of target mRNAs by associating with Argonaute (Ago) proteins to form the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), underpinning a powerful mechanism for fine-tuning protein expression. Specific miRNAs are required for NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-dependent synaptic plasticity by modulating the translation of proteins involved in dendritic spine morphogenesis or synaptic transmission. However, it is unknown how NMDAR stimulation stimulates RISC activity to rapidly repress translation of synaptic proteins. We show that NMDAR stimulation transiently increases Akt-dependent phosphorylation of Ago2 at S387, which causes an increase in binding to GW182 and a rapid increase in translational repression ofLIMK1via miR-134. Furthermore, NMDAR-dependent down-regulation of endogenous LIMK1 translation in dendrites and dendritic spine shrinkage requires phospho-regulation of Ago2 at S387. AMPAR trafficking and hippocampal LTD do not involve S387 phosphorylation, defining this mechanism as a specific pathway for structural plasticity. This work defines a novel mechanism for the rapid transduction of NMDAR stimulation into miRNA-mediated translational repression to control dendritic spine morphology.",29712715,PMC5983126,10.15252/embj.201797943,20,The EMBO journal,8208664,14.012,0.6972997784614563,0.6521739130434783,0.9230769230769231,0.7334300343009541
Repressor Element-1 Binding Transcription Factor (REST) as a Possible Epigenetic Regulator of Neurodegeneration and MicroRNA-Based Therapeutic Strategies,"Neurodegenerative disorders (NDD) have grabbed significant scientific consideration due to their fast increase in prevalence worldwide. The specific pathophysiology of the disease and the amazing changes in the brain that take place as it advances are still the top issues of contemporary research. Transcription factors play a decisive role in integrating various signal transduction pathways to ensure homeostasis. Disruptions in the regulation of transcription can result in various pathologies, including NDD. Numerous microRNAs and epigenetic transcription factors have emerged as candidates for determining the precise etiology of NDD. Consequently, understanding by what means transcription factors are regulated and how the deregulation of transcription factors contributes to neurological dysfunction is important to the therapeutic targeting of pathways that they modulate. RE1-silencing transcription factor (REST) also named neuron-restrictive silencer factor (NRSF) has been studied in the pathophysiology of NDD. REST was realized to be a part of a neuroprotective element with the ability to be tuned and influenced by numerous microRNAs, such as microRNAs 124, 132, and 9 implicated in NDD. This article looks at the role of REST and the influence of various microRNAs in controlling REST function in the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and Huntington's disease (HD) disease. Furthermore, to therapeutically exploit the possibility of targeting various microRNAs, we bring forth an overview of drug-delivery systems to modulate the microRNAs regulating REST in NDD.",37326903,PMC10471693,10.1007/s12035-023-03437-1,2,Molecular neurobiology,8900963,5.682,0.6968874335289001,0.13712374581939799,0.5117056856187291,0.5478983464049655
Evidence linking microRNA suppression of essential prosurvival genes with hippocampal cell death after traumatic brain injury,"The underlying molecular mechanisms of how dysregulated microRNAs (miRNAs) cause neurodegeneration after traumatic brain injury (TBI) remain elusive. Here we analyzed the biological roles of approximately 600 genes - we previously found these dysregulated in dying and surviving rat hippocampal neurons - that are targeted by ten TBI-altered miRNAs. Bioinformatic analysis suggests that neurodegeneration results from a global miRNA-mediated suppression of genes essential for maintaining proteostasis; many are hub genes - involved in RNA processing, cytoskeletal metabolism, intracellular trafficking, cell cycle progression, repair/maintenance, bioenergetics and cell-cell signaling - whose disrupted expression is linked to human disease. Notably, dysregulation of these essential genes would significantly impair synaptic function and functional brain connectivity. In surviving neurons, upregulated miRNA target genes are co-regulated members of prosurvival pathways associated with cellular regeneration, neural plasticity, and development. This study captures the diversity of miRNA-regulated genes that may be essential for cell repair and survival responses after TBI.",28751711,PMC5532254,10.1038/s41598-017-06341-6,15,Scientific reports,101563288,4.996,0.6954414248466492,0.5819397993311036,0.4080267558528428,0.6152581659447789
Astrocytic MicroRNAs and Transcription Factors in Alzheimer's Disease and Therapeutic Interventions,"Astrocytes are important for maintaining cholesterol metabolism, glutamate uptake, and neurotransmission. Indeed, inflammatory processes and neurodegeneration contribute to the altered morphology, gene expression, and function of astrocytes. Astrocytes, in collaboration with numerous microRNAs, regulate brain cholesterol levels as well as glutamatergic and inflammatory signaling, all of which contribute to general brain homeostasis. Neural electrical activity, synaptic plasticity processes, learning, and memory are dependent on the astrocyte-neuron crosstalk. Here, we review the involvement of astrocytic microRNAs that potentially regulate cholesterol metabolism, glutamate uptake, and inflammation in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The interaction between astrocytic microRNAs and long non-coding RNA and transcription factors specific to astrocytes also contributes to the pathogenesis of AD. Thus, astrocytic microRNAs arise as a promising target, as AD conditions are a worldwide public health problem. This review examines novel therapeutic strategies to target astrocyte dysfunction in AD, such as lipid nanodiscs, engineered G protein-coupled receptors, extracellular vesicles, and nanoparticles.",36552875,PMC9776935,10.3390/cells11244111,3,Cells,101600052,7.666,0.6952345967292786,0.18729096989966554,0.745819397993311,0.6037628316161625
Nrf2 Pathway in Age-Related Neurological Disorders: Insights into MicroRNAs,"A general hallmark of neurological diseases is the loss of redox homeostasis that triggers oxidative damages to biomolecules compromising neuronal function. Under physiological conditions the steady-state concentrations of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) are finely regulated for proper cellular functions. Reduced surveillance of endogenous antioxidant defenses and/or increased ROS/RNS production leads to oxidative stress with consequent alteration of physiological processes. Neuronal cells are particularly susceptible to ROS/RNS due to their biochemical composition. Overwhelming evidences indicate that nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2)-linked pathways are involved in protective mechanisms against oxidative stress by regulating antioxidant and phase II detoxifying genes. As such, Nrf2 deregulation has been linked to both aging and pathogenesis of many human chronic diseases, including neurodegenerative ones such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Nrf2 activity is tightly regulated by a fine balance between positive and negative modulators. A better understanding of the regulatory mechanisms underlying Nrf2 activity could help to develop novel therapeutic interventions to prevent, slow down or possibly reverse various pathological states. To this end, microRNAs (miRs) are attractive candidates because they are linked to intracellular redox status being regulated and, post-transcriptionally, regulating key components of ROS/RNS pathways, including Nrf2.",29969760,,10.1159/000491465,45,Cellular physiology and biochemistry : international journal of experimental,9113221,0.0,0.6947170495986938,0.8595317725752508,0.013377926421404682,0.5914121695585475
MicroRNA miR124 is required for the expression of homeostatic synaptic plasticity,"Homeostatic synaptic plasticity is a compensatory response to alterations in neuronal activity. Chronic deprivation of neuronal activity results in an increase in synaptic AMPA receptors (AMPARs) and postsynaptic currents. The biogenesis of GluA2-lacking, calcium-permeable AMPARs (CP-AMPARs) plays a crucial role in the homeostatic response; however, the mechanisms leading to CP-AMPAR formation remain unclear. Here we show that the microRNA, miR124, is required for the generation of CP-AMPARs and homeostatic plasticity. miR124 suppresses GluA2 expression via targeting its 3'-UTR, leading to the formation of CP-AMPARs. Blockade of miR124 function abolishes the homeostatic response, whereas miR124 overexpression leads to earlier induction of homeostatic plasticity. miR124 transcription is controlled by an inhibitory transcription factor EVI1, acting by association with the deacetylase HDAC1. Our data support a cellular cascade in which inactivity relieves EVI1/HDAC-mediated inhibition of miR124 gene transcription, resulting in enhanced miR124 expression, formation of CP-AMPARs and subsequent induction of homeostatic synaptic plasticity.",26620774,PMC4686673,10.1038/ncomms10045,51,Nature communications,101528555,17.694,0.6933691501617432,0.8929765886287625,0.9565217391304348,0.7859211556488853
A Review of Molecular Interplay between Neurotrophins and miRNAs in Neuropsychological Disorders,"Various neurotrophins (NTs), including nerve growth factor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, neurotrophin-3, and neurotrophin-4, promote cellular differentiation, survival, and maintenance, as well as synaptic plasticity, in the peripheral and central nervous system. The function of microRNAs (miRNAs) and other small non-coding RNAs, as regulators of gene expression, is pivotal for the appropriate control of cell growth and differentiation. There are positive and negative loops between NTs and miRNAs, which exert modulatory effects on different signaling pathways. The interplay between NTs and miRNAs plays a crucial role in the regulation of several physiological and pathological brain procedures. Emerging evidence suggests the diagnostic and therapeutic roles of the interactions between NTs and miRNAs in several neuropsychological disorders, including epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, schizophrenia, anxiety disorders, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, bipolar disorder, and drug abuse. Here, we review current data regarding the regulatory interactions between NTs and miRNAs in neuropsychological disorders, for which novel diagnostic and/or therapeutic strategies are emerging. Targeting NTs-miRNAs interactions for diagnostic or therapeutic approaches needs to be validated by future clinical studies.",35916975,PMC9463196,10.1007/s12035-022-02966-5,9,Molecular neurobiology,8900963,5.682,0.6906633973121643,0.44481605351170567,0.5150501672240803,0.6063712825344558
miR-34a regulates silent synapse and synaptic plasticity in mature hippocampus,"AMPAR-lacking silent synapses are prevailed and essential for synaptic refinement and synaptic plasticity in developing brains. In mature brain, they are sparse but could be induced under several pathological conditions. How they are regulated molecularly is far from clear. miR-34a is a highly conserved and brain-enriched microRNA with age-dependent upregulated expression profile. Its neuronal function in mature brain remains to be revealed. Here by analyzing synaptic properties of the heterozygous miR-34a knock out mice (34a_ht), we have discovered that mature but not juvenile 34a_ht mice have more silent synapses in the hippocampus accompanied with enhanced synaptic NMDAR but not AMPAR function and increased spine density. As a result, 34a_ht mice display enhanced long-term potentiation (LTP) in the Schaffer collateral synapses and better spatial learning and memory. We further found that Creb1 is a direct target of miR-34a, whose upregulation and activation may mediate the silent synapse increment in 34a_ht mice. Hence, we reveal a novel physiological role of miR-34a in mature brains and provide a molecular mechanism underlying silent synapse regulation.",36642095,,10.1016/j.pneurobio.2023.102404,0,Progress in neurobiology,370121,10.885,0.685528576374054,0.010033444816053512,0.8494983277591973,0.5832235003394826
MicroRNAs and psychiatric disorders: From aetiology to treatment,"The emergence of psychiatric disorders relies on the interaction between genetic vulnerability and environmental adversities. Several studies have demonstrated a crucial role for epigenetics (e.g. DNA methylation, post-translational histone modifications and microRNA-mediated post-transcriptional regulation) in the translation of environmental cues into adult behavioural outcome, which can prove to be harmful thus increasing the risk to develop psychopathology. Within this frame, non-coding RNAs, especially microRNAs, came to light as pivotal regulators of many biological processes occurring in the Central Nervous System, both during the neuronal development as well as in the regulation of adult function, including learning, memory and neuronal plasticity. On these basis, in recent years it has been hypothesised a central role for microRNA modulation and expression regulation in many brain disorders, including neurodegenerative disorders and mental illnesses. Indeed, the aim of the present review is to present the most recent state of the art regarding microRNA involvement in psychiatric disorders. We will first describe the mechanisms that regulate microRNA biogenesis and we will report evidences of microRNA dysregulation in peripheral body fluids, in postmortem brain tissues from patients suffering from psychopathology as well as in animal models. Last, we will discuss the potential to consider microRNAs as putative target for pharmacological intervention, using common psychotropic drugs or more specific tools, with the aim to normalize functions that are disrupted in different psychiatric conditions.",27452338,,10.1016/j.pharmthera.2016.07.006,22,Pharmacology & therapeutics,7905840,13.4,0.6831024885177612,0.6956521739130435,0.903010033444816,0.7295939345822287
Role of MicroRNAs in Anxiety and Anxiety-Related Disorders,"MicroRNAs as critical regulators of gene expression important for functions including neuronal development, synapse formation, and synaptic plasticity have been linked with the regulation of neurobiological systems that underlie anxiety processing in the brain. In this chapter, we give an update on associative evidence linking regulation of microRNAs with anxiety- and trauma-related disorders. Moving beyond correlative research, functional studies have emerged recently that explore causal relationships between microRNA expression and anxiety-like behavior. It has been demonstrated that experimental up- or downregulation of the candidate microRNAs in important nodes of the anxiety neurocircuitry can indeed modulate anxiety-related behavior in animal models. Improved methodologies for assessing microRNA-mediated modulation have aided such functional studies, revealing a number of anxiety-regulating microRNAs including miR-15a, miR-17-92, miR-34, miR-101, miR-124, miR-135, and miR-155. Important functional target genes of these identified microRNAs are associated with specific neurotransmitter/neuromodulator signaling, neurotrophin (e.g., BDNF) expression and other aspects of synaptic plasticity, as well as with stress-regulatory/hypothalamic-pituitary-axis function. Furthermore, microRNAs have been revealed that are regulated in distinct brain regions following various anxiety-attenuating strategies. These include pharmacological treatments such as antidepressants and other drugs, as well as non-pharmacological interventions such as fear extinction/exposure therapy or positive stimuli such as exposure to environmental enrichment. These are first indications for a role for microRNAs in the mechanism of action of anxiolytic treatments. As research continues, there is much hope that a deeper understanding of the microRNA-mediated mechanisms underlying anxiety-related disorders could open up possibilities for future novel biomarker and treatment strategies.",31485988,,10.1007/7854_2019_109,20,Current topics in behavioral neurosciences,101535383,0.0,0.6803479194641113,0.6555183946488294,0.016722408026755852,0.5426569122135839
miR-204 downregulates EphB2 in aging mouse hippocampal neurons,"Hippocampal synaptic function and plasticity deteriorate with age, often resulting in learning and memory deficits. As MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important regulators of neuronal protein expression, we examined whether miRNAs may contribute to this age-associated decline in hippocampal function. We first compared the small RNA transcriptome of hippocampal tissues from young and old mice. Among 269 hippocampal miRNAs, 80 were differentially expressed (â¥ twofold) among the age groups. We focused on 36 miRNAs upregulated in the old mice compared with those in the young mice. The potential targets of these 36 miRNAs included 11 critical Eph/Ephrin synaptic signaling components. The expression levels of several genes in the Eph/Ephrin pathway, including EphB2, were significantly downregulated in the aged hippocampus. EphB2 is a known regulator of synaptic plasticity in hippocampal neurons, in part by regulating the surface expression of the NMDA receptor NR1 subunit. We found that EphB2 is a direct target of miR-204 among miRNAs that were upregulated with age. The transfection of primary hippocampal neurons with a miR-204 mimic suppressed both EphB2 mRNA and protein expression and reduced the surface expression of NR1. Transfection of miR-204 also decreased the total expression of NR1. miR-204 induces senescence-like phenotype in fully matured neurons as evidenced by an increase in p16-positive cells. We suggest that aging is accompanied by the upregulation of miR-204 in the hippocampus, which downregulates EphB2 and results in reduced surface and total NR1 expression. This mechanism may contribute to age-associated decline in hippocampal synaptic plasticity and the related cognitive functions.",26799631,PMC4783348,10.1111/acel.12444,24,Aging cell,101130839,11.005,0.6786465048789978,0.7190635451505016,0.8662207357859532,0.7242447591146897
MicroRNA-22 Gates Long-Term Heterosynaptic Plasticity in Aplysia through Presynaptic Regulation of CPEB and Downstream Targets,"The maintenance phase of memory-related long-term facilitation (LTF) of synapses between sensory and motor neurons of the gill-withdrawal reflex of Aplysia depends on a serotonin (5-HT)-triggered presynaptic upregulation of CPEB, a functional prion that regulates local protein synthesis at the synapse. The mechanisms whereby serotonin regulates CPEB levels in presynaptic sensory neurons are not known. Here, we describe a sensory neuron-specific microRNA 22 (miR-22) that has multiple binding sites on the mRNA of CPEB and inhibits it in the basal state. Serotonin triggers MAPK/Erk-dependent downregulation of miR-22, thereby upregulating the expression of CPEB, which in turn regulates, through functional CPE elements, the presynaptic expression of atypical PKC (aPKC), another candidate regulator of memory maintenance. Our findings support a model in which the neurotransmitter-triggered downregulation of miR-22 coordinates the regulation of genes contributing synergistically to the long-term maintenance of memory-related synaptic plasticity.",26095361,,10.1016/j.celrep.2015.05.034,36,Cell reports,101573691,9.995,0.6785399913787842,0.8193979933110368,0.8294314381270903,0.736889881114896
MicroRNAs in Schizophrenia: Implications for Synaptic Plasticity and Dopamine-Glutamate Interaction at the Postsynaptic Density. New Avenues for Antipsychotic Treatment Under a Theranostic Perspective,"Despite dopamine-glutamate aberrant interaction that has long been considered a relevant landmark of psychosis pathophysiology, several aspects of these two neurotransmitters reciprocal interaction remain to be defined. The emerging role of postsynaptic density (PSD) proteins at glutamate synapse as a molecular ""lego"" making a functional hub where different signals converge may add a new piece of information to understand how dopamine-glutamate interaction may work with regard to schizophrenia pathophysiology and treatment. More recently, compelling evidence suggests a relevant role for microRNA (miRNA) as a new class of dopamine and glutamate modulators with regulatory functions in the reciprocal interaction of these two neurotransmitters. Here, we aimed at addressing the following issues: (i) Do miRNAs have a role in schizophrenia pathophysiology in the context of dopamine-glutamate aberrant interaction? (ii) If miRNAs are relevant for dopamine-glutamate interaction, at what level this modulation takes place? (iii) Finally, will this knowledge open the door to innovative diagnostic and therapeutic tools? The biogenesis of miRNAs and their role in synaptic plasticity with relevance to schizophrenia will be considered in the context of dopamine-glutamate interaction, with special focus on miRNA interaction with PSD elements. From this framework, implications both for biomarkers identification and potential innovative interventions will be considered.",25394379,,10.1007/s12035-014-8962-8,8,Molecular neurobiology,8900963,5.682,0.6782203912734985,0.41471571906354515,0.5183946488294314,0.5935543083426944
The Potential Role of MicroRNA-124 in Cerebral Ischemia Injury,"Cerebral ischemia injury, the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, initiates sequential molecular and cellular pathologies that underlie ischemic encephalopathy (IE), such as ischemic stroke, Alzheimer disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), epilepsy, etc. Targeted therapeutic treatments are urgently needed to tackle the pathological processes implicated in these neurological diseases. Recently, accumulating studies demonstrate that microRNA-124 (miR-124), the most abundant miRNA in brain tissue, is aberrant in peripheral blood and brain vascular endothelial cells following cerebral ischemia. Importantly, miR-124 regulates a variety of pathophysiological processes that are involved in the pathogenesis of age-related IE. However, the role of miR-124 has not been systematically illustrated. Paradoxically, miR-124 exerts beneficial effects in the age-related IE via regulating autophagy, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, neuronal excitability, neurodifferentiation, AÎ² deposition, and hyperphosphorylation of tau protein, while it may play a dual role via regulating apoptosis and exerts detrimental effects on synaptic plasticity and axonal growth. In the present review, we thus focus on the paradoxical roles of miR-124 in age-related IE, as well as the underlying mechanisms. A great understanding of the effects of miR-124 on the hypoxic-ischemic brain will open new avenues for therapeutic approaches to protect against cerebral ischemia injury.",31878035,PMC6981583,10.3390/ijms21010120,38,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,6.208,0.6758716106414795,0.8260869565217391,0.5986622073578596,0.6904727991608075
New insights into the role of microRNAs and long noncoding RNAs in most common neurodegenerative diseases,"Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) are a diversity of neurological disorders characterized by the progressive degeneration of the structure and function of the central nervous system (CNS). The most common NDs are Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and Huntington's disease (HD). Recently, many studies have investigated associations between common NDs with noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) molecules. ncRNAs are regulatory molecules in the normal functioning of the CNS. Two of the most important ncRNAs are microRNAs (miRNAs) and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). These types of ncRNAs are involved in different biological processes including brain development, maturation, differentiation, neuronal cell specification, neurogenesis, and neurotransmission. Increasing data has demonstrated that miRNAs and lncRNAs have strong correlations with the development of NDs, particularly gene expression. Besides, ncRNAs can be introduced as new biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis of NDs. Hence, in this review, we summarized the involvement of various miRNAs and lncRNAs in most common NDs followed by a correlation of ncRNAs dysregulation with the AD, PD, and HD.",30663117,,10.1002/jcb.28361,18,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,4.48,0.6731916666030884,0.6254180602006689,0.36789297658862874,0.6025772073197126
Sex Differences and Estrous Cycle Changes in Synaptic Plasticity-related microRNA in the Rat Medial Amygdala,"The posterodorsal medial amygdala (MePD) is a sex steroid-sensitive and sexually dimorphic subcortical area that dynamically modulates social behaviors in rats. As different microRNA (miRNA) can act as post-transcriptional regulators of synaptic processing, we addressed changes that occur in miRNA expression in the MePD of males and females along the estrous cycle. The expression of miR25-3p, miR132-3p, miR138-5p, miR181a-5p, miR195-5p, and miR199a-5p, involved in neuronal cytoskeleton remodeling and synaptic plasticity, were evaluated by RT-qPCR. We found that the expression of miR138-5p was higher in males than in females along the different phases of the estrous cycle. Males also showed higher levels of miR-181a when compared to females in diestrus and estrus. On the other hand, when compared to females in proestrus, males presented lower levels of miR132-3p and miR199a-5p. The expression of miR25-3p was higher in diestrus females than in proestrus females. In addition, diestrus females showed higher values of miR25-3p, miR181a-5p, and miR195-5p when compared to estrus females. These miRNA expression profiles indicate a variable and fine-tuned protein regulation in the adult MePD. It is likely that these miRNA can be involved in structural and functional synaptic features and plasticity characteristic of males and cycling females and for the MePD regulation of mammalian reproduction.",29604381,,10.1016/j.neuroscience.2018.03.035,10,Neuroscience,7605074,3.708,0.6656279563903809,0.5016722408026756,0.26755852842809363,0.5532229276803824
MicroRNAs: Key Players in Microglia and Astrocyte Mediated Inflammation in CNS Pathologies,"The significance of microglia and astrocytes in neural development, in maintaining synaptic connections and homeostasis in the healthy brain is well established. Microglia are dynamic immune cells of the brain that elicit an immune response during brain damage and also participate in tissue repair and regeneration, while astrocytes contribute to the local inflammatory response by producing proinflammatory cytokines and resolving neuronal damage through production of anti-inflammatory cytokines and neurotrophic factors. Recent efforts have focused on elucidating the epigenetic mechanisms which regulate glial cell behavior in normal and pathologic states. An important class of epigenetic regulators is microRNAs (miRNAs) which are small non-coding RNA molecules that regulate gene expression posttranscriptionally. Certain dysregulated miRNAs contribute to chronic microglial inflammation in the brain, thereby leading to progression of neurological diseases like Alzheimer's disease, traumatic injury, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and stroke. Further, several miRNAs are differentially expressed in astrocytes after ischemia and spinal cord injury. Despite knowledge about miRNAs in neuroinflammation, little is known about effective delivery routes and pharmacokinetic data for miRNA based therapeutics. This review summarizes the current research on the role of miRNAs in promoting and inhibiting inflammatory response of microglia and astrocytes in a disease-specific manner. In addition, miRNA delivery as a therapeutic strategy to treat neuroinflammation is discussed.",27528056,,10.2174/0929867323666160814001040,46,Current medicinal chemistry,9440157,4.74,0.6615949869155884,0.8729096989966555,0.3879598662207358,0.6491309051928313
Alzheimer's genetic risk factor FERMT2 (Kindlin-2) controls axonal growth and synaptic plasticity in an APP-dependent manner,"Although APP metabolism is being intensively investigated, a large fraction of its modulators is yet to be characterized. In this context, we combined two genome-wide high-content screenings to assess the functional impact of miRNAs and genes on APP metabolism and the signaling pathways involved. This approach highlighted the involvement of FERMT2 (or Kindlin-2), a genetic risk factor of Alzheimer's disease (AD), as a potential key modulator of axon guidance, a neuronal process that depends on the regulation of APP metabolism. We found that FERMT2 directly interacts with APP to modulate its metabolism, and that FERMT2 underexpression impacts axonal growth, synaptic connectivity, and long-term potentiation in an APP-dependent manner. Last, the rs7143400-T allele, which is associated with an increased AD risk and localized within the 3'UTR of FERMT2, induced a downregulation of FERMT2 expression through binding of miR-4504 among others. This miRNA is mainly expressed in neurons and significantly overexpressed in AD brains compared to controls. Altogether, our data provide strong evidence for a detrimental effect of FERMT2 underexpression in neurons and insight into how this may influence AD pathogenesis.",33144711,PMC8758496,10.1038/s41380-020-00926-w,19,Molecular psychiatry,9607835,13.437,0.6613763570785522,0.6387959866220736,0.9096989966555183,0.7065248109026497
From reversible to irreversible bistable switches via bifurcations in a gene regulatory network,"The interplay of small, noncoding microRNAs (miRNAs), mRNAs and proteins plays crucial roles in almost all cellular processes. MiR-124, widely known as a memory-related miRNA, can regulate LTM by binding to the mRNA of CREB1 stimulated with 5-HT. In this paper, we establish a regulatory network model of CREB1 and miR-124 stimulated by 5-HT, in which miR-124 inhibits CREB1, which in turn enhances miR-124. Our model validates three protocols based on 5-HT in experiments on the induction of LTM in Aplysia. A steady-state analysis and numerical bifurcations of the abstracted system beyond memory formation, when the fast reaction has been in the equilibrium, can facilitate more abundant dynamical behaviors such as bistability and oscillation. The original system also exhibits bistability under appropriate feedback strengths, which is relevant to the mechanism of LTM formation. Furthermore, we specifically show a change in the transition from a reversible switch to an irreversible switch via bifurcations of the negative regulation of miR-124 on CREB1, which eventually maintains a high phosphorylated CREB1 level after initially elevated by 5-HT. These findings indicate that miR-124 provides an inhibitory constraint on long-term synaptic plasticity through the regulation of CREB1.",32126536,,10.1088/1478-3975/ab7bf5,1,Physical biology,101197454,2.959,0.6555565595626831,0.10033444816053512,0.14046822742474915,0.4414944708546667
Environmental enrichment prevents AÎ² oligomer-induced synaptic dysfunction through mirna-132 and hdac3 signaling pathways,"As the most common cause of progressive cognitive decline in humans, Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been intensively studied, but the mechanisms underlying its profound synaptic dysfunction remain unclear. Here we confirm that exposing wild-type mice to an enriched environment (EE) facilitates signaling in the hippocampus that promotes long-term potentiation (LTP). Exposing the hippocampus of mice kept in standard housing to soluble AÎ² oligomers impairs LTP, but EE can fully prevent this. Mechanistically, the key molecular features of the EE benefit are an upregulation of miRNA-132 and an inhibition of histone deacetylase (HDAC) signaling. Specifically, soluble AÎ² oligomers decreased miR-132 expression and increased HDAC3 levels in cultured primary neurons. Further, we provide evidence that HDAC3 is a direct target of miR-132. Overexpressing miR-132 or injecting an HDAC3 inhibitor into mice in standard housing mimics the benefits of EE in enhancing hippocampal LTP and preventing hippocampal impairment by AÎ² oligomers in vivo. We conclude that EE enhances hippocampal synaptic plasticity by upregulating miRNA-132 and reducing HDAC3 signaling in a way that counteracts the synaptotoxicity of human AÎ² oligomers. Our findings provide a rationale for prolonged exposure to cognitive novelty and/or epigenetic modulation to lessen the progressive effects of AÎ² accumulation during human brain aging.",31669733,PMC7243177,10.1016/j.nbd.2019.104617,24,Neurobiology of disease,9500169,7.046,0.6520198583602905,0.7224080267558528,0.6822742474916388,0.6721483698656726
Mechanisms of microRNA-132 in central neurodegenerative diseases: A comprehensive review,"MicroRNA-132 (miR-132) is a highly conserved molecule that plays a crucial regulatory role in central nervous system (CNS) disorders. The expression levels of miR-132 exhibit variability in various neurological disorders and have been closely linked to disease onset and progression. The expression level of miR-132 in the CNS is regulated by a diverse range of stimuli and signaling pathways, including neuronal migration and integration, dendritic outgrowth, and complexity, synaptogenesis, synaptic plasticity, as well as inflammation and apoptosis activation. The aberrant expression of miR-132 in various central neurodegenerative diseases has garnered widespread attention. Clinical studies have revealed altered miR-132 expression levels in both chronic and acute CNS diseases, positioning miR-132 as a potential biomarker or therapeutic target. An in-depth exploration of miR-132 holds the promise of enhancing our understanding of the mechanisms underlying CNS diseases, thereby offering novel insights and strategies for disease diagnosis and treatment. It is anticipated that this review will assist researchers in recognizing the potential value of miR-132 and in generating innovative ideas for clinical trials related to CNS degenerative diseases.",38128185,,10.1016/j.biopha.2023.116029,0,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,8213295,7.419,0.6520198583602905,0.013377926421404682,0.7123745819397993,0.5363624166884151
Regulation of microRNAs by IRE1Î± in apoptosis: implications for the pathomechanism of neurodegenerative diseases,"Although there are large differences in clinical and pathological features, age-related neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) share common pathogenetic mechanisms involving aggregation and deposition of misfolded proteins, which leads to progressive dysfunction and death of neurons. Up to now, it seems that apoptosis is one major form of neuronal cell death. This review provides an overview of recent progress in unfolded protein response (UPR) during apoptosis induced by abnormal protein aggregation and emphasizes on the potential role of inositol requiring enzyme 1 alpha (IRE1Î±)-microRNAs (miRNAs) mediated apoptosis in NDs, which will provide new insights in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases and novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of NDs.",32070174,,10.1080/00207454.2020.1730833,2,The International journal of neuroscience,270707,2.59,0.6516874432563782,0.14046822742474915,0.10033444816053512,0.43917300107088375
Panoramic Visualization of Circulating MicroRNAs Across Neurodegenerative Diseases in Humans,"Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and dementia pose one of the greatest health challenges this century. Although these NDs have been looked at as single entities, the underlying molecular mechanisms have never been collectively visualized to date. With the advent of high-throughput genomic and proteomic technologies, we now have the opportunity to visualize these diseases in a whole new perspective, which will provide a clear understanding of the primary and secondary events vital in achieving the final resolution of these diseases guiding us to new treatment strategies to possibly treat these diseases together. We created a knowledge base of all microRNAs known to be differentially expressed in various body fluids of ND patients. We then used several bioinformatic methods to understand the functional intersections and differences between AD, PD, ALS, and MS. These results provide a unique panoramic view of possible functional intersections between AD, PD, MS, and ALS at the level of microRNA and their cognate genes and pathways, along with the entities that unify and separate them. While the microRNA signatures were apparent for each ND, the unique observation in our study was that hsa-miR-30b-5p overlapped between all four NDS, and has significant functional roles described across NDs. Furthermore, our results also show the evidence of functional convergence of miRNAs which was associated with the regulation of their cognate genes represented in pathways that included fatty acid synthesis and metabolism, ECM receptor interactions, prion diseases, and several signaling pathways critical to neuron differentiation and survival, underpinning their relevance in NDs. Envisioning this group of NDs together has allowed us to propose new ways of utilizing circulating miRNAs as biomarkers and in visualizing diverse NDs more holistically . The critical molecular insights gained through the discovery of ND-associated miRNAs, overlapping miRNAs, and the functional convergence of microRNAs on vital pathways strongly implicated in neurodegenerative processes can prove immensely valuable in the identifying new generation of biomarkers, along with the development of miRNAs into therapeutics.",31037649,PMC6815273,10.1007/s12035-019-1615-1,26,Molecular neurobiology,8900963,5.682,0.6501341462135315,0.7491638795986622,0.5217391304347826,0.6442610897348079
MicroRNA-7 Protects Against Neurodegeneration Induced by Î±-Synuclein Preformed Fibrils in the Mouse Brain,"Î±-Synuclein is a key protein in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease as it accumulates in fibrillar form in affected brain regions. Misfolded Î±-synuclein seeds recruit monomeric Î±-synuclein to form aggregates, which can spread to anatomically connected brain regions, a phenomenon that correlates with clinical disease progression. Thus, downregulating Î±-synuclein levels could reduce seeding and inhibit aggregate formation and propagation. We previously reported that microRNA-7 (miR-7) protects neuronal cells by downregulating Î±-synuclein expression through its effect on the 3'-untranslated region of SNCA mRNA; however, whether miR-7 blocks Î±-synuclein seeding and propagation in vivo remains unknown. Here, we induced miR-7 overexpression in the mouse striatum unilaterally by infusing adeno-associated virus 1 (AAV-miR-7) followed by inoculation with recombinant Î±-synuclein preformed fibrils (PFF) a month later. Compared with control mice injected with non-targeting AAV-miR-NT followed by PFF, AAV-miR-7 pre-injected mice exhibited lower levels of monomeric and high-molecular-weight Î±-synuclein species in the striatum, and reduced amount of phosphorylated Î±-synuclein in the striatum and in nigral dopamine neurons. Accordingly, AAV-miR-7-injected mice had less pronounced degeneration of the nigrostriatal pathway and better behavioral performance. The neuroinflammatory reaction to Î±-synuclein PFF inoculation was also significantly attenuated. These data suggest that miR-7 inhibits the formation and propagation of pathological Î±-synuclein and protects against neurodegeneration induced by PFF. Collectively, these findings support the potential of miR-7 as a disease modifying biologic agent for Parkinson's disease and related Î±-synucleinopathies.",34697773,PMC8804150,10.1007/s13311-021-01130-6,9,Neurotherapeutics : the journal of the American Society for Experimental,101290381,6.088,0.6500230431556702,0.44816053511705684,0.5719063545150501,0.5940272038198235
Temporospatial guidance of activity-dependent gene expression by microRNA: mechanisms and functional implications for neural plasticity,"MicroRNA are major regulators of neuronal gene expression at the post-transcriptional and translational levels. This layer of control is critical for spatially and temporally restricted gene expression, facilitating highly dynamic changes to cellular structure and function associated with neural plasticity. Investigation of microRNA function in the neural system, however, is at an early stage, and many aspects of the mechanisms employing these small non-coding RNAs remain unclear. In this article, we critically review current knowledge pertaining to microRNA function in neural activity, with emphasis on mechanisms of microRNA repression, their subcellular remodelling and functional impacts on neural plasticity and behavioural phenotypes.",30535081,PMC6344879,10.1093/nar/gky1235,15,Nucleic acids research,411011,19.16,0.6482437252998352,0.5852842809364549,0.979933110367893,0.7019897134407708
MicroRNA-137 Controls AMPA-Receptor-Mediated Transmission and mGluR-Dependent LTD,"Mutations affecting the levels of microRNA miR-137 are associated with intellectual disability and schizophrenia. However, the pathophysiological role of miR-137 remains poorly understood. Here, we describe a highly conserved miR-137-binding site within the mRNA encoding the GluA1 subunit of AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) and confirm that GluA1 is a direct target of miR-137. Postsynaptic downregulation of miR-137 at the CA3-CA1 hippocampal synapse selectively enhances AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission and converts silent synapses to active synapses. Conversely, miR-137 overexpression selectively reduces AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission and silences active synapses. In addition, we find that miR-137 is transiently upregulated in response to metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5), but not mGluR1 activation. Consequently, acute interference with miR-137 function impedes mGluR-LTD expression. Our findings suggest that miR-137 is a key factor in the control of synaptic efficacy and mGluR-dependent synaptic plasticity, supporting the notion that glutamatergic dysfunction contributes to the pathogenesis of miR-137-linked cognitive impairments.",26095359,,10.1016/j.celrep.2015.05.040,50,Cell reports,101573691,9.995,0.6459020972251892,0.8862876254180602,0.8327759197324415,0.7313539673652139
Understanding the Involvement of microRNAs in Mitochondrial Dysfunction and Their Role as Potential Biomarkers and Therapeutic Targets in Parkinson's Disease,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, affecting the elderly worldwide and causing significant movement impairments. The goal of PD treatment is to restore dopamine levels in the striatum and regulate movement symptoms. The lack of specific biomarkers for early diagnosis, as well as medication aimed at addressing the pathogenic mechanisms to decelerate the progression of dopaminergic neurodegeneration, are key roadblocks in the management of PD. Various pathogenic processes have been identified to be involved in the progression of PD, with mitochondrial dysfunction being a major contributor to the disease's pathogenesis. The regulation of mitochondrial functions is influenced by a variety of factors, including epigenetics. microRNAs (miRNAs) are epigenetic modulators involved in the regulation of gene expression and regulate a variety of proteins that essential for proper mitochondrial functioning. They are found to be dysregulated in PD, as evidenced by biological samples from PD patients and in vitro and in vivo research. In this article, we attempt to provide an overview of several miRNAs linked to mitochondrial dysfunction and their potential as diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets in PD.",35848027,PMC10473154,10.3233/JAD-220449,5,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,4.16,0.6456786394119263,0.2976588628762542,0.3110367892976589,0.5091463140819383
The nuclear matrix protein Matr3 regulates processing of the synaptic microRNA-138-5p,"microRNA-dependent post-transcriptional control represents an important gene-regulatory layer in post-mitotic neuronal development and synaptic plasticity. We recently identified the brain-enriched miR-138 as a negative regulator of dendritic spine morphogenesis in rat hippocampal neurons. A potential involvement of miR-138 in cognition is further supported by a recent GWAS study on memory performance in a cohort of aged (>60 years) individuals. The expression of miR-138, which is encoded in two independent genomic loci (miR-138-1 and -2), is subject to both cell-type and developmental stage-specific regulation, the underlying molecular mechanisms however are poorly understood. Here, we show that miR-138-2 is the primary source of mature miR-138 in developing rat hippocampal neurons. Furthermore, we obtained evidence for the regulation of miR-138-2 biogenesis at the level of primary miRNA processing. Using biochemical pull-down assays, we identified the nuclear matrix protein Matrin-3 as pri/pre-miR-138 interacting protein and mapped the interaction to the pri/pre-miR-138-2 loop region. Matrin-3 loss-of-function experiments in HEK293 cells and primary neurons together with protein localization studies suggest an inhibitory function of Matrin-3 in nuclear pri-miR-138-2 processing. Together, our experiments unravel a new mechanism of miR-138 regulation in neurons, with important implications for miR-138 regulation during neuronal development, synaptic plasticity and memory-related processes.",30790622,,10.1016/j.nlm.2019.02.008,10,Neurobiology of learning and memory,9508166,3.109,0.6452316641807556,0.5050167224080268,0.1605351170568562,0.5202493664014299
"Timing mechanisms in neuronal pathfinding, synaptic reorganization, and neuronal regeneration","Precise temporal control of neuro differentiation and post-differentiation events are necessary for the creation of appropriate wiring diagram in the brain. To make advances in the treatment of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders, and traumatic brain injury, it is important to understand these mechanisms. Caenorhabditis elegans has emerged as a revolutionary tool for the study of neural circuits due to its genetic homology to vertebrates and ease of genetic manipulation. microRNA (miRNA), a ubiquitous class of small non-coding RNA, that inhibits the expression of target genes, has emerged as an important timing control molecule through research conducted on C. elegans. This review will focus on the temporal control of neurodifferentiation and post-differentiation events exerted by two conserved miRNAs, lin-4 and let-7. We summarize recent findings on the role of lin-4 as a timing regulator controlling transition of sequential events in neuronal pathfinding and synaptic remodeling, and the role of let-7 as a timing regulator that limits the regeneration potential of post-differentiated AVM neurons as they age.",26748770,PMC4732896,10.1111/dgd.12259,3,"Development, growth & differentiation",356504,3.063,0.6452316641807556,0.19063545150501673,0.1505016722408027,0.4553664232576173
Micro-RNAs in cognition and cognitive disorders: Potential for novel biomarkers and therapeutics,"Micro-RNAs (miRNAs) are small regulatory non-coding RNAs involved in the regulation of many biological functions. In the brain, they have distinct expression patterns depending on region, cell-type and developmental stage. Their expression profile is altered by neuronal activation in response to behavioral training or chemical/electrical stimulation. The dynamic changes in miRNA level regulate the expression of genes required for cognitive processes such as learning and memory. In addition, in cognitive dysfunctions such as dementias, expression levels of many miRNAs are perturbed, not only in brain areas affected by the pathology, but also in peripheral body fluids such as serum and cerebrospinal fluid. This presents an opportunity to utilize miRNAs as biomarkers for early detection and assessment of cognitive dysfunctions. Further, since miRNAs target many genes and pathways, they may represent key molecular signatures that can help understand the mechanisms of cognitive disorders and the development of potential therapeutic agents.",26626188,,10.1016/j.bcp.2015.11.021,23,Biochemical pharmacology,101032,6.1,0.6450081467628479,0.7090301003344481,0.5785953177257525,0.6445299716697488
MicroRNA-Directed Neuronal Reprogramming as a Therapeutic Strategy for Neurological Diseases,"The loss of neurons due to injury and disease results in a wide spectrum of highly disabling neurological and neurodegenerative conditions, given the apparent limited capacity of endogenous repair of the adult central nervous system (CNS). Therefore, it is important to develop technologies that can promote de novo neural stem cell and neuron generation. Current insights in CNS development and cellular reprogramming have provided the knowledge to finely modulate lineage-restricted transcription factors and microRNAs (miRNA) to elicit correct neurogenesis. Here, we discuss the current knowledge on the direct reprogramming of somatic non-neuronal cells into neural stem cells or subtype specific neurons in vitro and in vivo focusing on miRNA driven reprogramming. miRNA can allow rapid and efficient direct phenotype conversion by modulating gene networks active during development, which promote global shifts in the epigenetic landscape pivoting cell fate decisions. Furthermore, we critically present state-of-the-art and recent advances on miRNA therapeutics that can be applied to the diseased CNS. Together, the advances in our understanding of miRNA role in CNS development and disease, recent progress in miRNA-based therapeutic strategies, and innovative drug delivery methods create novel perspectives for meaningful therapies for neurodegenerative disorders.",28664454,,10.1007/s12035-017-0671-7,8,Molecular neurobiology,8900963,5.682,0.6381590962409973,0.4180602006688963,0.5250836120401338,0.5715242202864044
"Inflammatory Cytokine, IL-1Î², Regulates Glial Glutamate Transporter via microRNA-181a in vitro","Glutamate overload triggers synaptic and neuronal loss that potentially contributes to neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Glutamate clearance and regulation at synaptic clefts is primarily mediated by glial glutamate transporter 1 (GLT-1). We determined that inflammatory cytokines significantly upregulated GLT-1 through microRNA-181a-mediated post-transcriptional modifications. Unveiling the key underlying mechanisms modulating GLT-1 helps better understand its physiological and pathological interactions with cytokines. Primary murine astrocyte and neuron co-culture received 20 ng/mL IL-1Î², TNF-Î±, or IL-6 for 48 h. Soluble proteins or total RNA were extracted after treatment for further analyses. Treatment with inflammatory cytokines, IL-1Î² and TNF-Î±, but not IL-6, significantly increased GLT-1 steady-state levels (pâ¤0.05) without affecting mRNA levels, suggesting the cytokine-induced GLT-1 was regulated through post-transcriptional modifications. Among the candidate microRNAs predicted to modulate GLT-1, only microRNA-181a was significantly decreased following the IL-1Î² treatment (pâ¤0.05). Co-treatment of microRNA-181a mimic in IL-1Î²-treated primary astrocytes and neurons effectively blocked the IL-1Î²-induced upregulation of GLT-1. Lastly, we attempted to determine the link between GLT-1 and microRNA-181a in human AD brains. A significant reduction of GLT-1 was found in AD hippocampus tissues, and the ratio of mature microRNA-181a over primary microRNA-181a had an increasing tendency in AD. MicroRNA-181a controls rapid modifications of GLT-1 levels in astrocytes. Cytokine-induced inhibition of microRNA-181a and subsequent upregulation of GLT-1 may have physiological implications in synaptic plasticity while aberrant maturation of microRNA-181a may be involved in pathological consequences in AD.",29710703,PMC7325598,10.3233/JAD-170828,12,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,4.16,0.6378207206726074,0.5317725752508361,0.31438127090301005,0.5519232016343336
MicroRNA mediators of early life stress vulnerability to depression and suicidal behavior,"Childhood environment can have a profound impact on brain structure and function. Epigenetic mechanisms have been shown to play a critical role in adaptive and maladaptive processes by regulating gene expression without changing the genome. Over the past few years, early life stress (ELS) has been established as a major risk factor for major depression and suicidal behavior along with other psychiatric illnesses in adulthood. In recent years, the emergence of small noncoding RNAs as a mega controller of gene expression has gained attention for their role in various disease processes. Among various noncoding RNAs, microRNAs (miRNAs) are the most studied and well characterized and have emerged as a major regulator of neural plasticity and higher brain functioning. More recently, although limited in number, studies are focusing on how miRNAs can play a role in the maladaptive processes associated with ELS both at adolescent and adult age and whether these processes are critical in developing depression and suicidal behavior. In this review, we critically evaluate how postnatal ELS relates to abnormalities in miRNA expression and functions from both animal and human literature and draw connections from these findings to depression and suicidal behavior later in life.",31740756,PMC6974433,10.1038/s41380-019-0597-8,53,Molecular psychiatry,9607835,13.437,0.6343168616294861,0.903010033444816,0.9130434782608695,0.7438008193188288
Regulatory non-coding RNAs in nervous system development and disease,"Recent evidence demonstrates that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate the expression of multiple genes in an epigenetic, transcriptional, or post-transcriptional manner. They are involved in various cellular phenomena, such as the recruitment of transcription factors, epigenetic chaperoning, control of alternative splicing, mRNA stability and translational activity, as well as acting as decoys against microRNAs. In this review, we summarize the pivotal roles of lncRNAs in regulation of the gene expression involved in neural cell differentiation, synaptogenesis and synaptic plasticity in the central nervous system (CNS). We also describe the aberrant expression of multiple lncRNAs involved in the pathogenesis of neurological diseases. The abnormal expression of lncRNAs leads to altered expression levels of target genes, which contributes to neurodegenerative diseases, such as in Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, and to the formation of tumors, such as glioma. Accordingly, we discuss recent findings for the modes of action of lncRNAs in normal CNS development and for aberrant lncRNA actions in the pathogenesis of neuronal diseases.",31136976,,10.2741/4776,9,Frontiers in bioscience (Landmark edition),101612996,3.115,0.633976936340332,0.451505016722408,0.18394648829431437,0.5074764628075437
An Emerging Role of miRNAs in Neurodegenerative Diseases: Mechanisms and Perspectives onmiR146a,"Significance:Advancements in and access to health care have led to unprecedented improvements in the quality of life and increased lifespan of human beings in the past century. However, aging is a significant risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases (NDs). Hence, improved life expectancy has led to an increased incidence of NDs. Despite intense research, effective treatments for NDs remain elusive. The future of neurotherapeutics development depends on effective disease modification strategies centered on carefully scrutinized targets.Recent Advances:As a promising new direction, recent evidence has demonstrated that epigenetic processes modify diverse biochemical pathways, including those related to NDs. Small non-coding RNAs, known as microRNAs (miRNAs), are components of the epigenetic system that alter the expression of target genes at the post-transcriptional level.Critical Issues:miRNAs are expressed abundantly in the central nervous system and are critical for the normal functioning and survival of neurons. Here, we review recent advances in elucidating miRNAs' roles in NDs and discuss their potential as therapeutic targets. In particular, neuroinflammation is a major pathological hallmark of NDs andmiR146ais a crucial regulator of inflammation.Future Directions:Finally, we explore the possibilities of developingmiR146aas a potential biomarker and therapeutic target where additional research may help facilitate the detection and amelioration of neuroinflammation in NDs.Antioxid.

RNA-Dependent Intergenerational Inheritance of Enhanced Synaptic Plasticity after Environmental Enrichment,"Physical exercise in combination with cognitive training is known to enhance synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory and lower the risk for various complex diseases including Alzheimer's disease. Here, we show that exposure of adult male mice to an environmental enrichment paradigm leads to enhancement of synaptic plasticity and cognition also in the next generation. We show that this effect is mediated through sperm RNA and especially miRs 212/132.

Role of MicroRNA Let-7 in Modulating Multifactorial Aspect of Neurodegenerative Diseases: an Overview,"The multifactorial aspect of neurodegenerative diseases has posed challenges in terms of understanding various mechanistic cues behind these ailments. The fact that single microRNA (miRNA) molecules can regulate multiple genes and associated pathways makes these molecules interesting for studies within the area of age-associated neurodegenerative diseases. miRNAs are endogenous, evolutionarily conserved, 20-23 nucleotide non-coding RNAs, which were first discovered in Caenorhabditis elegans. They play a key role in gene regulation and are known to be deregulated in many disease conditions. Steady regulations of miRNAs are required for normal biological processes. One of the crucial miRNA molecules let-7 is highly conserved and is known to be required for development and viability. It acts as a regulator for oncogenes and insulin-PI3K-mTOR pathway genes. Upregulation of let-7 impairs glucose homeostasis and results in degeneration of neurons, while its downregulation leads to cancer. Maturation of let-7 in cancer subjects is inhibited by lin-28, an RNA-binding protein inhibitor. This highlights the importance of let-7 miRNAs in various diseases and developmental processes.

Human microRNA-4433 (hsa-miR-4443) Targets 18 Genes to be a Risk Factor of Neurodegenerative Diseases,"Background:Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease patients (AD), Huntington's disease (HD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), are common causes of morbidity, mortality, and cognitive impairment in older adults.Objective:We aimed to understand the transcriptome characteristics of the cortex of neurodegenerative diseases and to provide an insight into the target genes of differently expressed microRNAs in the occurrence and development of neurodegenerative diseases.Methods:The Limma package of R software was used to analyze GSE33000, GSE157239, GSE64977 and GSE72962 datasets to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and microRNAs in the cortex of neurodegenerative diseases. Bioinformatics methods, such as GO enrichment analysis, KEGG enrichment analysis and gene interaction network analysis, were used to explore the biological functions of DEGs. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to cluster DEGs into modules. RNA22, miRDB, miRNet 2.0 and TargetScan7 databases were performed to predict the target genes of microRNAs.Results:Among 310 Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, 157 Huntington's disease (HD) patients and 157 non-demented control (Con) individuals, 214 co-DEGs were identified. Those co-DEGs were filtered into 2 different interaction network complexes, representing immune-related genes and synapserelated genes. The WGCNA results identified five modules: yellow, blue, green, turquoise, and brown. Most of the co-DEGs were clustered into the turquoise module and blue module, which respectively regulated synapse-related function and immune-related function. In addition, human microRNA-4433 (hsa-miR-4443), which targets 18 co-DEGs, was the only 1 co-up-regulated microRNA identified in the cortex of neurodegenerative diseases.Conclusion:214 DEGs and 5 modules regulate the immune-related and synapse-related function of the cortex in neurodegenerative diseases.

New insights on the role of microglia in synaptic pruning in health and disease,"Recent genome-wide association studies implicate microglia in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis; however, their biological significance remains poorly understood. Synapse loss is a significant correlate of cognitive decline that serves as a critical hallmark of AD and other neurodegenerative diseases; however, mechanisms underlying synaptic vulnerability remain elusive. Emerging research on microglia function in the healthy brain is providing new insight into fundamental roles of microglia and immune molecules in brain wiring. Among their many roles, microglia prune developing synapses and regulate synaptic plasticity and function. Here, we review and discuss how this emerging work may provide new insight into how disruptions in microglia-synapse interactions could contribute to synapse loss and dysfunction, and consequently cognitive impairment, in AD.",26745839,PMC5479435,10.1016/j.conb.2015.12.004,272,Current opinion in neurobiology,9111376,7.07,0.6126573085784912,0.9933110367892977,0.6923076923076923,0.7047181309664927
MicroRNAs Regulating Autophagy in Neurodegeneration,"Social and economic impacts of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) become more prominent in our constantly aging population. Currently, due to the lack of knowledge about the aetiology of most NDs, only symptomatic treatment is available for patients. Hence, researchers and clinicians are in need of solid studies on pathological mechanisms of NDs. Autophagy promotes degradation of pathogenic proteins in NDs, while microRNAs post-transcriptionally regulate multiple signalling networks including autophagy. This chapter will critically discuss current research advancements in the area of microRNAs regulating autophagy in NDs. Moreover, we will introduce basic strategies and techniques used in microRNA research. Delineation of the mechanisms contributing to NDs will result in development of better approaches for their early diagnosis and effective treatment.",34260028,,10.1007/978-981-16-2830-6_11,0,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,121103,3.65,0.6125414371490479,0.016722408026755852,0.25418060200668896,0.42170546429611766
Shared Molecular Pathways in Glaucoma and Other Neurodegenerative Diseases: Insights from RNA-Seq Analysis and miRNA Regulation for Promising Therapeutic Avenues,"Advances in RNA-sequencing technologies have led to the identification of molecular biomarkers for several diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's diseases and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. Despite the nature of glaucoma as a neurodegenerative disorder with several similarities with the other above-mentioned diseases, transcriptional data about this disease are still scarce. microRNAs are small molecules (~17-25 nucleotides) that have been found to be specifically expressed in the CNS as major components of the system regulating the development signatures of neurodegenerative diseases and the homeostasis of the brain. In this review, we sought to identify similarities between the functional mechanisms and the activated pathways of the most common neurodegenerative diseases, as well as to discuss how those mechanisms are regulated by miRNAs, using RNA-Seq as an approach to compare them. We also discuss therapeutically suitable applications for these disease hallmarks in clinical future studies.",37681887,PMC10486375,10.3390/cells12172155,0,Cells,101600052,7.666,0.612367570400238,0.020066889632107024,0.7491638795986622,0.5212666960862966
MicroRNA-186-5p controls GluA2 surface expression and synaptic scaling in hippocampal neurons,"Homeostatic synaptic scaling is a negative feedback response to fluctuations in synaptic strength induced by developmental or learning-related processes, which maintains neuronal activity stable. Although several components of the synaptic scaling apparatus have been characterized, the intrinsic regulatory mechanisms promoting scaling remain largely unknown. MicroRNAs may contribute to posttranscriptional control of mRNAs implicated in different stages of synaptic scaling, but their role in these mechanisms is still undervalued. Here, we report that chronic blockade of glutamate receptors of the AMPA and NMDA types in hippocampal neurons in culture induces changes in the neuronal mRNA and miRNA transcriptomes, leading to synaptic upscaling. Specifically, we show that synaptic activity blockade persistently down-regulates miR-186-5p. Moreover, we describe a conserved miR-186-5p-binding site within the 3'UTR of the mRNA encoding the AMPA receptor GluA2 subunit, and demonstrate that GluA2 is a direct target of miR-186-5p. Overexpression of miR-186 decreased GluA2 surface levels, increased synaptic expression of GluA2-lacking AMPA receptors, and blocked synaptic scaling, whereas inhibition of miR-186-5p increased GluA2 surface levels and the amplitude and frequency of AMPA receptor-mediated currents, and mimicked excitatory synaptic scaling induced by synaptic inactivity. Our findings elucidate an activity-dependent miRNA-mediated mechanism for regulation of AMPA receptor expression.",30808806,PMC6431224,10.1073/pnas.1900338116,20,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,12.779,0.6087103486061096,0.6588628762541806,0.8963210702341137,0.6762629984613245
Hypothesis: Regulation of neuroplasticity may involve I-motif and G-quadruplex DNA formation modulated by epigenetic mechanisms,"Recent studies demonstrated the existence in vivo of various functional DNA structures that differ from the double helix. The G-quadruplex (G4) and intercalated motif (I-motif or IM) DNA structures are formed as knots where, correspondingly, guanines or cytosines on the same strand of DNA bind to each other. There are grounds to believe that G4 and IM sequences play a significant role in regulating gene expression considering their tendency to be found in or near regulatory sites (such as promoters, enhancers, and telomeres) as well as the correlation between the prevalence of G4 or IM conformations and specific phases of cell cycle. Notably, G4 and IM capable sequences tend to be found on the opposite strands of the same DNA site with at most one of the two structures formed at any given time. The recent evidence that K+, Mg2+concentrations directly affect IM formation (and likely G4 formation indirectly) lead us to believe that these structures may play a major role in synaptic plasticity of neurons, and, therefore, in a variety of central nervous system (CNS) functions including memory, learning, habitual behaviors, pain perception and others. Furthermore, epigenetic mechanisms, which have an important role in synaptic plasticity and memory formation, were also shown to influence formation and stability of G4s and IMs. Our hypothesis is that non-canonical DNA and RNA structures could be an integral part of neuroplasticity control via gene expression regulation at the level of transcription, translation and splicing. We propose that the regulatory activity of DNA IM and G4 structures is modulated by DNA methylation/demethylation of the IM and/or G4 sequences, which facilitates the switch between canonical and non-canonical conformation. Other neuronal mechanisms interacting with the formation and regulatory activity of non-canonical DNA and RNA structures, particularly G4, IM and triplexes, may involve microRNAs as well as ion and proton fluxes. We are proposing experiments in acute brain slices and in vivo to test our hypothesis. The proposed studies would provide new insights into fundamental neuronal mechanisms in health and disease and potentially open new avenues for treating mental health disorders.",31088636,,10.1016/j.mehy.2019.04.003,2,Medical hypotheses,7505668,4.411,0.6079540848731995,0.14381270903010032,0.34782608695652173,0.4631002101212441
Silencing miR-20a-5p inhibits axonal growth and neuronal branching and prevents epileptogenesis through RGMa-RhoA-mediated synaptic plasticity,"Epileptogenesis is a potential process. Mossy fibre sprouting (MFS) and synaptic plasticity promote epileptogenesis. Overexpression of repulsive guidance molecule a (RGMa) prevents epileptogenesis by inhibiting MFS. However, other aspects underlying the RGMa regulatory process of epileptogenesis have not been elucidated. We studied whether RGMa could be modulated by microRNAs and regulated RhoA in epileptogenesis. Using microRNA databases, we selected four miRNAs as potential candidates. We further experimentally confirmed miR-20a-5p as a RGMa upstream regulator. Then, in vitro, by manipulating miR-20a-5p and RGMa, we investigated the regulatory relationship between miR-20a-5p, RGMa and RhoA, and the effects of this pathway on neuronal morphology. Finally, in the epilepsy animal model, we determined whether the miR-20a-5p-RGMa-RhoA pathway influenced MFS and synaptic plasticity and then modified epileptogenesis. Our results showed that miR-20a-5p regulated RGMa and that RGMa regulated RhoA in vitro. Furthermore, in primary hippocampal neurons, the miR-20a-5p-RGMa-RhoA pathway regulated axonal growth and neuronal branching; in the PTZ-induced epilepsy model, silencing miR-20a-5p prevented epileptogenesis through RGMa-RhoA-mediated synaptic plasticity but did not change MFS. Overall, we concluded that silencing miR-20a-5p inhibits axonal growth and neuronal branching and prevents epileptogenesis through RGMa-RhoA-mediated synaptic plasticity in the PTZ-induced epilepsy model, thereby providing a possible strategy to prevent epileptogenesis.",32779334,PMC7521253,10.1111/jcmm.15677,14,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,101083777,5.295,0.6075467467308044,0.5585284280936454,0.4782608695652174,0.5718859075702551
An Enriched Environment Leads to Increased Synaptic Plasticity-Associated miRNA Levels after Experimental Subarachnoid Hemorrhage,"Background and purpose:In subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), impairments in motor and cognitive functions may occur and continue in later periods. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that can directly or indirectly affect synaptic reconstruction. mir-132, mir-134, and mir-138 are the leading miRNAs that can be effective on some neurological functions through its effects on synaptic plasticity in the relevant brain areas. In our study, it was aimed to determine the levels of miRNAs in the hippocampus and frontal lobe of rats exposed to different environmental conditions after the experimental SAH.Methods:SAH was created using the cisterna magna double blood-injection method. Brain tissues were collected at different times after the last blood injection. Rats were grouped according to the different environmental conditions in which they were kept. Expression levels of miRNAs were performed by qPCR and ultrastructural changes in samples were determined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM).Results:After SAH, miR-132, miR-134, and miR-138 expressions in the frontal lobes of rats increased in impoverished environment on the 7th day and in the enriched environment on the 14th day. It was observed that the myelin and microtubule structures in the axons that were disrupted after SAH were more organized and stable in the enriched environment.Conclusions:After SAH, different environmental conditions may affect the miRNA levels associated with synaptic plasticity and microtubule organization in the frontal lobe, and this might have some effects especially on cognitive and motor functions related to this brain area.",33866227,,10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2021.105766,2,Journal of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases : the official journal of National,9111633,2.677,0.6069644689559937,0.14715719063545152,0.11036789297658862,0.41568369809600425
GSK3 and miRNA in neural tissue: From brain development to neurodegenerative diseases,"MicroRNAs (miRs) are small RNAs modulating gene expression and creating intricate regulatory networks that are dysregulated in many pathological states, including neurodegenerative disorders. In silico analyses denote a multifunctional kinase glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) as a putative target of numerous miRs identified in neural tissue. GSK3 is engaged in almost all aspects of neuronal development and functioning. Moreover, there is an autoregulatory feedback between GSK3 and miRNAs as the kinase can influence biogenesis of miRs. Members of the miR-GSK3 axes might thus represent convenient therapeutic targets in neuropathologies that display its abnormal regulation. This review summarizes the present knowledge about direct interactions of GSK3 and miRs in brain, and their putative roles in pathogenesis of neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders.

Dysregulation of miRNAs Levels in Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3Î² Overexpressing Mice and the Role of miR-221-5p in Synaptic Function,"Glycogen synthase kinase-3Î² (GSK-3Î²) is a highly expressed kinase in the brain, where it has an important role in synaptic plasticity. Aberrant activity of GSK-3Î² leads to synaptic dysfunction which results in the development of several neuropsychiatric and neurological diseases. Notably, overexpression of constitutively active form of GSK-3Î² (GSK-3Î²[S9A]) in mice recapitulates the cognitive and structural defects characteristic for neurological and psychiatric disorders. However, the mechanisms by which GSK-3Î² regulates synaptic functions are not clearly known. Here, we investigate the effects of GSK-3Î² overactivity on neuronal miRNA expression in the mouse hippocampus. We found that GSK-3Î² overactivity downregulates miRNA network with a potent effect on miR-221-5p (miR-221*). Next, characterization of miR-221* function in primary hippocampal cell culture transfected by miR-221* inhibitor, showed no structural changes in dendritic spine shape and density. Using electrophysiological methods, we found that downregulation of miR-221* increases excitatory synaptic transmission in hippocampal neurons, probably via postsynaptic mechanisms. Thus, our data reveal potential mechanism by which GSK-3Î² and miRNAs might regulate synaptic function and therefore also synaptic plasticity.",35331845,,10.1016/j.neuroscience.2022.03.024,2,Neuroscience,7605074,3.708,0.6060321927070618,0.1505016722408027,0.2709030100334448,0.44790025207908657
miRNAs in NMDA receptor-dependent synaptic plasticity and psychiatric disorders,"The identification and functional delineation of miRNAs (a class of small non-coding RNAs) have added a new layer of complexity to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying synaptic plasticity. Genome-wide association studies in conjunction with investigations in cellular and animal models, moreover, provide evidence that miRNAs are involved in psychiatric disorders. In the present review, we examine the current knowledge about the roles played by miRNAs in NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor-dependent synaptic plasticity and psychiatric disorders.",27252401,PMC5582542,10.1042/CS20160046,10,"Clinical science (London, England : 1979)",7905731,6.876,0.6052742004394531,0.5083612040133779,0.6755852842809364,0.5999538179225348
The microRNA cluster miR-183/96/182 contributes to long-term memory in a protein phosphatase 1-dependent manner,"Memory formation is a complex cognitive function regulated by coordinated synaptic and nuclear processes in neurons. In mammals, it is controlled by multiple molecular activators and suppressors, including the key signalling regulator, protein phosphatase 1 (PP1). Here, we show that memory control by PP1 involves the miR-183/96/182 cluster and its selective regulation during memory formation. Inhibiting nuclear PP1 in the mouse brain, or training on an object recognition task similarly increases miR-183/96/182 expression in the hippocampus. Mimicking this increase by miR-183/96/182 overexpression enhances object memory, while knocking-down endogenous miR-183/96/182 impairs it. This effect involves the modulation of several plasticity-related genes, with HDAC9 identified as an important functional target. Further, PP1 controls miR-183/96/182 in a transcription-independent manner through the processing of their precursors. These findings provide novel evidence for a role of miRNAs in memory formation and suggest the implication of PP1 in miRNAs processing in the adult brain.",27558292,PMC5007330,10.1038/ncomms12594,29,Nature communications,101528555,17.694,0.6018860936164856,0.7759197324414716,0.959866220735786,0.7082888468053429
MicroRNAs in the hypothalamus,"The brain is considered a major site for microRNA (miRNA) expression; as evidenced by several studies reporting microarray data of different brain substructures. The hypothalamus is among the brain regions that plays a crucial role in integrating signals from other brain nuclei as well as environmental, hormonal, metabolic and neuronal signals from the periphery in order to deliver an adequate response. The hypothalamus controls vital functions such as reproduction, energy homeostasis, water balance, circadian rhythm and stress. These functions need a high neuronal plasticity to adequately respond to physiological, environmental and psychological stimuli that could be limited to a specific temporal period during life or are cyclic events. In this context, miRNAs constitute major regulators and coordinators of gene expression. Indeed, in response to specific stimuli, changes in miRNA expression profiles finely tune specific mRNA targets to adequately fit to the immediate needs through mainly the modulation of neuronal plasticity.",27923457,,10.1016/j.beem.2016.11.006,7,Best practice & research.

"MicroRNAs: Biomarkers, Diagnostics, and Therapeutics","MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs (21-23 nucleotides in length) that regulate gene expression at translational or posttranslational levels. The major regulatory mechanisms include translational repression or mRNA degradation (Filipowicz et al., Curr Opin Struct Biol 15:331-341, 2005).Aberrant expression of miRNAs has been found to be associated with a variety of human diseases such as cancers/tumors, diabetes, viral infections, cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, and other diseases (Wang et al., J Cell Physiol 23:25-30, 2016; Lawrie, MicroRNAs in medicine, 2013). The expression of miRNAs is tissue specific and can be used to identify tumor type and its origin (Mishra and Merlino, J Clin Invest 119:2119-2123, 2009). Many investigations suggest that the miRNA-expression profiles are novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for multiple human diseases.

MicroRNA machinery in Parkinson's disease: a platform for neurodegenerative diseases,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are noncoding RNAs that recognize their protein-coding target genes and whereby subjugate them after transcription. Despite the infancy of this field of science, the role of miRNAs in neurodegeneration is well-acknowledged. This review was conducted to indicate that Parkinson's disease (PD) is not excluded from this rule. To this end, we evaluated the existing literature and arranged PD-associated miRNAs according to their mechanism of action, particularly apoptosis, autophagy, inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress. According to this arrangement, a majority of PD-associated miRNAs were indicated to influence autophagic/apoptotic pathways. We also categorized PD-associated miRNAs according to that they could exert detrimental or beneficial or both into three sets, activator, inhibitor, and double-edged, correspondingly. Considering this criterion, a majority of PD-associated miRNAs were included in the activator category. In addition, evidences from genetic association studies investigating genetic variants of or related to miRNAs in PD patients are presented. Finally, possible applications of the miRNA machinery in PD, including mechanistic networks, diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic potentials, are discussed. But there may be additional miRNAs involved in the pathogenesis of PD which have hitherto remained unknown and thus further studies are needed to explore the issue and to extend this platform.",26574782,,10.1586/14737175.2015.1114886,6,Expert review of neurotherapeutics,101129944,4.287,0.5961980819702148,0.3411371237458194,0.3311036789297659,0.49216700971724603
miR-34a deficiency in APP/PS1 mice promotes cognitive function by increasing synaptic plasticity via AMPA and NMDA receptors,"MicroRNA (miR)-34a was recently determined to contribute to the pathological development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). miR-34a deficiency significantly attenuates cognitive deficits in amyloid precursor protein (APP)/presenilin 1 (PS1) mice; however, its role in early AD pathology and the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we confirmed that the increase of miR-34a expression in APP/PS1 mice was earlier than the relevant AD pathological characteristics, such as amyloid-Î² production, amyloid plaque deposition, and cognitive deficits. Furthermore, because predicted miR-34a target genes were broadly linked to Î±-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) and N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, we evaluated synaptic plasticity by investigating high-frequency conditioning tetanus-induced excitatory postsynaptic potential, which revealed that synaptic plasticity was promoted in miR-34a knockout/APP/PS1 mice. Therefore, we assessed the expression of the presynaptic components synaptophysin and postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95) and found that synaptophysin and PSD95 were not altered by miR-34a deficiency. Additionally, the synaptic strength (vesicular fusion, vesicular docking, and transporting) was either not significantly changed. We also evaluated the levels of AMPA and NMDA receptors, which showed that the expression of AMPA and NMDA receptors was markedly upregulated in APP/PS1 mice with miR-34a deficiency. We conclude that miR-34a is involved in synaptic deficits in AD pathological development, which was, at least in part, due to the inhibition of NMDA (by miR-34a-5p) and AMPA (by miR-34a-3p) receptor expression.",29378298,,10.1016/j.neulet.2018.01.045,30,Neuroscience letters,7600130,3.197,0.594904363155365,0.782608695652174,0.21070234113712374,0.5556048252510786
Synaptic plasticity modulation by circulating peptides and metaplasticity: Involvement in Alzheimer's disease,"Synaptic plasticity is a cellular process involved in learning and memory whose alteration in its two main forms (Long Term Depression (LTD) and Long Term Potentiation (LTP)), is observed in most brain pathologies, including neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). In humans, AD is associated at the cellular level with neuropathological lesions composed of extracellular deposits of Î²-amyloid (AÎ²) protein aggregates and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles, cellular loss, neuroinflammation and a general brain homeostasis dysregulation. Thus, a dramatic synaptic environment perturbation is observed in AD patients, involving changes in brain neuropeptides, cytokines, growth factors or chemokines concentration and diffusion. Studies performed in animal models demonstrate that these circulating peptides strongly affect synaptic functions and in particular synaptic plasticity. Besides this neuromodulatory action of circulating peptides, other synaptic plasticity regulation mechanisms such as metaplasticity are altered in AD animal models. Here, we will review new insights into the study of synaptic plasticity regulatory/modulatory mechanisms which could influence the process of synaptic plasticity in the context of AD with a particular attention to the role of metaplasticity and peptide dependent neuromodulation.",29425728,,10.1016/j.phrs.2018.01.018,21,Pharmacological research,8907422,10.334,0.5939037203788757,0.6722408026755853,0.842809364548495,0.6593522656721414
Applications of Acupuncture Therapy in Modulating the Plasticity of Neurodegenerative Disease and Depression: Do MicroRNA and Neurotrophin BDNF Shed Light on the Underlying Mechanism?,"As the global population ages, the incidence of neurodegenerative diseases has risen. Furthermore, it has been suggested that depression, especially in elderly people, may also be an indication of latent neurodegeneration. Stroke, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Parkinson's disease (PD) are usually accompanied by depression. The urgent challenge is further enforced by psychiatric comorbid conditions, particularly the feeling of despair in these patients. Fortunately, as our understanding of the neurobiological substrates of maladies affecting the central nervous system (CNS) has increased, more therapeutic options and novel potential biological mechanisms have been presented: (1) Neurodegenerative diseases share some similarities in their pathological characteristics, including changes in neuron structure or function and neuronal plasticity. (2) MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that contribute to the pathogenesis of diverse neurological disease. (3) One ubiquitous neurotrophin, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), is crucial for the development of the nervous system. Accumulating data have indicated that miRNAs not only are related to BDNF regulation but also can directly bind with the 3'-UTR of BDNF to regulate BDNF and participate in neuroplasticity. In this short review, we present evidence of shared biological substrates among stroke, AD, PD, and depression and summarize the possible influencing mechanisms of acupuncture on the neuroplasticity of these diseases. We discuss neuroplasticity underscored by the roles of miRNAs and BDNF, which might further reveal the potential biological mechanism of neurodegenerative diseases and depression by acupuncture.",33029119,PMC7527896,10.1155/2020/8850653,6,Neural plasticity,100883417,3.144,0.5868188142776489,0.34448160535117056,0.19063545150501673,0.45911469993782683
Increased miR-34c mediates synaptic deficits by targeting synaptotagmin 1 through ROS-JNK-p53 pathway in Alzheimer's Disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cancer have inverse relationship in many aspects. Some tumor suppressors, including miR-34c, are decreased in cancer but increased in AD. The upstream regulatory pathways and the downstream mechanisms of miR-34c in AD remain to be investigated. The expression of miR-34c was detected by RT-qPCR in oxidative stressed neurons, hippocampus of SAMP8 mice, or serum of patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). Dual luciferase assay was performed to confirm the binding sites of miR-34c in its target mRNA. The Morris water maze (MWM) was used to evaluate learning and memory in SAMP8 mice administrated with miR-34c antagomir (AM34c). Golgi staining was used to evaluate the synaptic function and structure. The dramatically increased miR-34c was mediated by ROS-JNK-p53 pathway and negatively regulated synaptotagmin 1 (SYT1) expression by targeting the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of syt1 in AD. The expression of SYT1 protein was reduced by over expression of miR-34c in the HT-22 cells and vice versa. Administration of AM34c by the third ventricle injection or intranasal delivery markedly increased the brain levels of SYT1 and ameliorated the cognitive function in SAMP8 mice. The serum miR-34c was significantly increased in patients with aMCI and might be a predictive biomarker for diagnosis of aMCI. These results indicated that increased miR-34c mediated synaptic and memory deficits by targeting SYT1 through ROS-JNK-p53 pathway and the miR-34c/SYT1 pathway could be considered as a promising novel therapeutic target for patients with AD.",32092796,PMC7059146,10.1111/acel.13125,48,Aging cell,101130839,11.005,0.5835593938827515,0.8762541806020067,0.8695652173913043,0.6992995159283131
Wnt-5a-regulated miR-101b controls COX2 expression in hippocampal neurons,"Background:Wnt-5a is a member of the WNT family of secreted lipoglycoproteins, whose expression increases during development; moreover, Wnt-5a plays a key role in synaptic structure and function in the adult nervous system. However, the mechanism underlying these effects is still elusive. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a family of small non-coding RNAs that control the gene expression of their targets through hybridization with complementary sequences in the 3' UTR, thereby inhibiting the translation of the target proteins. Several evidences indicate that the miRNAs are actively involved in the regulation of neuronal function.Results:In the present study, we examined whether Wnt-5a modulates the levels of miRNAs in hippocampal neurons. Using PCR arrays, we identified a set of miRNAs that respond to Wnt-5a treatment. One of the most affected miRNAs was miR-101b, which targets cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2), an inducible enzyme that converts arachidonic acid to prostanoids, and has been involved in the injury/inflammatory response, and more recently in neuronal plasticity. Consistent with the Wnt-5a regulation of miR-101b, this Wnt ligand regulates COX2 expression in a time-dependent manner in cultured hippocampal neurons.Conclusion:The biological processes induced by Wnt-5a in hippocampal neurons, involve the regulation of several miRNAs including miR-101b, which has the capacity to regulate several targets, including COX-2 in the central nervous system.",26895946,PMC4759731,10.1186/s40659-016-0071-x,9,Biological research,9308271,7.634,0.583025336265564,0.45484949832775917,0.725752508361204,0.5859356030971311
MicroRNA target prediction in glaucoma,"Glaucoma is a progressive optic neuropathy and is one of the leading causes of blindness in the industrialized countries. The aim of this study is to investigate microRNA (miRNA) regulation in glaucoma and other neurodegenerative diseases, that share similar pathways, by means of in silico approaches such as bibliographic search and access to bioinformatic resources. First of all, data mining was carried out on Human miRNA Disease Database (HMDD) and miR2Disease databases. Then, predictions of deregulated miRNAs were carried out accessing to microrna.org database. Finally, the potential combinatorial effect of miRNAs, on regulation of biochemical pathways, was studied by an enrichment analysis performed by DIANA-miRPath v.2.0. We found, from literature search, 8 deregulated miRNAs in glaucoma and 9 and 23 in age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), respectively. One miRNA is commonly deregulated in glaucoma and AMD (miR-23a). Two miRNAs (miR-29a, miR-29b) are common to glaucoma and AD, and four miRNAs were identified to be commonly deregulated in AMD and AD (miR-9, miR-21, miR-34a, miR-146a). The match of the miRNA common to glaucoma and the other two neurodegenerative diseases (AMD and AD) did not generate any output. Enrichment of information has been reached through miRNAs prediction: 88 predicted miRNAs are common to glaucoma and AMD, 19 are common to glaucoma and AD, and 9 are common to AMD and AD. Indeed, predicted miRNAs common to the three neurodegenerative diseases are nine (miR-107, miR-137, miR-146a, miR-181c, miR-197, miR-21, miR-22, miR-590, miR-9). DIANA-miRPath predicted that those nine miRNAs might regulate pathways involved in inflammation. The findings hereby obtained provide a valuable hint to assess deregulation of specific miRNA, as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets, in glaucoma and other neurodegenerative diseases by means of preclinical and clinical studies.",26497793,,10.1016/bs.pbr.2015.04.013,24,Progress in brain research,376441,2.624,0.5809465050697327,0.725752508361204,0.10367892976588629,0.5144541906672576
Age-Dependent and Pathway-Specific Bimodal Action of Nicotine on Synaptic Plasticity in the Hippocampus of Mice Lacking the miR-132/212 Genes,"Nicotine addiction develops predominantly during human adolescence through smoking. Self-administration experiments in rodents verify this biological preponderance to adolescence, suggesting evolutionary-conserved and age-defined mechanisms which influence the susceptibility to nicotine addiction. The hippocampus, a brain region linked to drug-related memory storage, undergoes major morpho-functional restructuring during adolescence and is strongly affected by nicotine stimulation. However, the signaling mechanisms shaping the effects of nicotine in young vs. adult brains remain unclear. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) emerged recently as modulators of brain neuroplasticity, learning and memory, and addiction. Nevertheless, the age-dependent interplay between miRNAs regulation and hippocampal nicotinergic signaling remains poorly explored. We here combined biophysical and pharmacological methods to examine the impact of miRNA-132/212 gene-deletion (miRNA-132/212-/-) and nicotine stimulation on synaptic functions in adolescent and mature adult mice at two hippocampal synaptic circuits: the medial perforant pathway (MPP) to dentate yrus (DG) synapses (MPP-DG) and CA3 Schaffer collaterals to CA1 synapses (CA3-CA1). Basal synaptic transmission and short-term (paired-pulse-induced) synaptic plasticity was unaltered in adolescent and adult miRNA-132/212-/-mice hippocampi, compared with wild-type controls. However, nicotine stimulation promoted CA3-CA1 synaptic potentiation in mature adult (not adolescent) wild-type and suppressed MPP-DG synaptic potentiation in miRNA-132/212-/-mice. Altered levels of CREB, Phospho-CREB, and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) expression were further detected in adult miRNA-132/212-/-mice hippocampi. These observations propose miRNAs as age-sensitive bimodal regulators of hippocampal nicotinergic signaling and, given the relevance of the hippocampus for drug-related memory storage, encourage further research on the influence of miRNAs 132 and 212 in nicotine addiction in the young and the adult brain.",35053378,PMC8774101,10.3390/cells11020261,4,Cells,101600052,7.666,0.5752301216125488,0.23745819397993312,0.7525083612040134,0.5431313840043186
Distinct miRNA expression in dorsal striatal subregions is associated with risk for addiction in rats,"Recently, we published data using an animal model that allowed us to characterize animals into two groups, addiction vulnerable and addiction resilient, where we identified that addiction/relapse vulnerability was associated with deficits in synaptic plasticity-associated gene expression in the dorsal striatum (DS). Notable was the strong reduction in expression for activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc) considered a master regulator of synaptic plasticity. In the present study, we confirmed that Arc messenger RNA was significantly decreased in the DS, but importantly, we identified that this reduction was restricted to the dorsomedial (DMS) and not dorsolateral striatum (DLS). There is recent evidence of microRNA (miRNA)-associated posttranscriptional suppression of Arc and animal models of addiction have identified a key role for miRNA in the regulation of addiction-relevant genes. In further support of this link, we identified several differentially expressed miRNA with the potential to influence addiction-relevant plasticity genes, including Arc. A key study recently reported that miR-212 expression is protective against compulsive cocaine-seeking. Supporting this hypothesis, we found that miR-212 expression was significantly reduced in the DMS but not DLS of addiction-vulnerable animals. Together, our data provide strong evidence that miRNA promote ongoing plasticity deficits in the DS of addiction-vulnerable animals.",25646592,PMC4445746,10.1038/tp.2014.144,19,Translational psychiatry,101562664,7.989,0.5739769339561462,0.6421404682274248,0.782608695652174,0.6293359931496074
Precision Medicine in Neurodegenerative Diseases: Some Promising Tips Coming from the microRNAs' World,":Novel insights in the development of a precision medicine approach for treating the neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) are provided by emerging advances in the field of pharmacoepigenomics. In this context, microRNAs (miRNAs) have been extensively studied because of their implication in several disorders related to the central nervous system, as well as for their potential role as biomarkers of diagnosis, prognosis, and response to treatment. Recent studies in the field of neurodegeneration reported evidence that drug response and efficacy can be modulated by miRNA-mediated mechanisms. In fact, miRNAs seem to regulate the expression of pharmacology target genes, while approved (conventional and non-conventional) therapies can restore altered miRNAs observed in NDDs. The knowledge of miRNA pharmacoepigenomics may offers new clues to develop more effective treatments by providing novel insights into interindividual variability in drug disposition and response. Recently, the therapeutic potential of miRNAs is gaining increasing attention, and miRNA-based drugs (for cancer) have been under observation in clinical trials. However, the effective use of miRNAs as therapeutic target still needs to be investigated. Here, we report a brief review of representative studies in which miRNAs related to therapeutic effects have been investigated in NDDs, providing exciting potential prospects of miRNAs in pharmacoepigenomics and translational medicine.",31892254,PMC7017296,10.3390/cells9010075,5,Cells,101600052,7.666,0.5706304907798767,0.30434782608695654,0.7558528428093646,0.5544184282471902
Research Progress of Aging-related MicroRNAs,"Senescence refers to the irreversible state in which cells enter cell cycle arrest due to internal or external stimuli. The accumulation of senescent cells can lead to many age-related diseases, such as neurodegenerative diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and cancers. MicroRNAs are short non-coding RNAs that bind to target mRNA to regulate gene expression after transcription and play an important regulatory role in the aging process. From nematodes to humans, a variety of miRNAs have been confirmed to alter and affect the aging process. Studying the regulatory mechanisms of miRNAs in aging can further deepen our understanding of cell and body aging and provide a new perspective for the diagnosis and treatment of aging-related diseases. In this review, we illustrate the current research status of miRNAs in aging and discuss the possible prospects for clinical applications of targeting miRNAs in senile diseases.",36892029,,10.2174/1574888X18666230308111043,1,Current stem cell research & therapy,101272517,3.758,0.5693738460540771,0.10702341137123746,0.2809364548494983,0.4192162808765934
Neurotransmitters in Prevention and Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most frequent cause of cognitive impairment in middle-aged and older populations. There is a lack of drugs that demonstrate significant efficacy in AD, so the study of the pathogenesis of AD is of great importance. More efficacious interventions are needed, as reflected by our population's fast aging. Synaptic plasticity is the capacity of neurons to adjust their connections, and it is strongly tied to learning and memory, cognitive function, and brain injury recovery. Changes in synaptic strength, such as long-term potentiation (LTP) or inhibition (LTD), are thought to represent the biological foundation of the early stages of learning and memory. The results of numerous studies confirm that neurotransmitters and their receptors play an important role in the regulation of synaptic plasticity. However, so far, there is no definite correlation between the function of neurotransmitters in aberrant neural oscillation and AD-related cognitive impairment. We summarized the AD process to understand the impact of neurotransmitters in the progression and pathogenesis of AD, including the current status of neurotransmitter target drugs, and the latest evidence of neurotransmitters' function and changes in the AD process.",36835251,PMC9966535,10.3390/ijms24043841,5,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,6.208,0.5610344409942627,0.3076923076923077,0.6053511705685619,0.5192293602487316
MicroRNA predicts cognitive performance in healthy older adults,"The expression of microRNA (miRNA) is influenced by ongoing biological processes, including aging, and has begun to play a role in the measurement of neurodegenerative processes in central nervous system. The purpose of this study is to utilize machine learning approaches to determine whether miRNA can be utilized as a blood-based biomarker of cognitive aging. A random forest regression combining miRNA with biological (brain volume), clinical (comorbid conditions), and demographic variables in 115 typically aging older adults explained the greatest level of variance in cognitive performance compared to the other machine learning models explored. Three miRNA (miR-140-5p, miR-197-3p, and miR-501-3p) were top-ranked predictors of multiple cognitive outcomes (Fluid, Crystallized, and Overall Cognition) and past studies of these miRNA link them to cellular senescence, inflammatory signals for atherosclerotic formation, and potential development of neurodegenerative disorders (e.g., Alzheimer's disease). Several novel miRNAs were also linked to age and multiple cognitive functions, findings which together warrant further exploration linking these miRNAs to brain-derived metrics of neurodegeneration in typically aging older adults.",32846274,PMC7606424,10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2020.07.023,21,Neurobiology of aging,8100437,5.133,0.5606436133384705,0.6755852842809364,0.43478260869565216,0.5584597465984
miRNA-132/212 Deficiency Disrupts Selective Corticosterone Modulation of Dorsal vs. Ventral Hippocampal Metaplasticity,"Cortisol is a potent human steroid hormone that plays key roles in the central nervous system, influencing processes such as brain neuronal synaptic plasticity and regulating the expression of emotional and behavioral responses. The relevance of cortisol stands out in the disease, as its dysregulation is associated with debilitating conditions such as Alzheimer's Disease, chronic stress, anxiety and depression. Among other brain regions, cortisol importantly influences the function of the hippocampus, a structure central for memory and emotional information processing. The mechanisms fine-tuning the different synaptic responses of the hippocampus to steroid hormone signaling remain, however, poorly understood. Using ex vivo electrophysiology and wild type (WT) and miR-132/miR-212 microRNAs knockout (miRNA-132/212-/-) mice, we examined the effects of corticosterone (the rodent's equivalent to cortisol in humans) on the synaptic properties of the dorsal and ventral hippocampus. In WT mice, corticosterone predominantly inhibited metaplasticity in the dorsal WT hippocampi, whereas it significantly dysregulated both synaptic transmission and metaplasticity at dorsal and ventral regions of miR-132/212-/-hippocampi. Western blotting further revealed significantly augmented levels of endogenous CREB and a significant CREB reduction in response to corticosterone only in miR-132/212-/-hippocampi. Sirt1 levels were also endogenously enhanced in the miR-132/212-/-hippocampi but unaltered by corticosterone, whereas the levels of phospo-MSK1 were only reduced by corticosterone in WT, not in miR-132/212-/-hippocampi. In behavioral studies using the elevated plus maze, miRNA-132/212-/-mice further showed reduced anxiety-like behavior. These observations propose miRNA-132/212 as potential region-selective regulators of the effects of steroid hormones on hippocampal functions, thus likely fine-tuning hippocampus-dependent memory and emotional processing.",37298523,PMC10253409,10.3390/ijms24119565,0,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,6.208,0.5576345324516296,0.023411371237458192,0.6086956521739131,0.461002124153252
Upregulation of miR-19b-3p exacerbates chronic stress-induced changes in synaptic plasticity and cognition by targeting Drebrin,"Chronic stress is associated with impairment of synapse plasticity in hippocampus and cognitive dysfunction in rodent and human. Notably, corticosterone (CORT) is believed to take responsibility for dendritic atrophy and reduction of spine number induced by chronic stress in hippocampus. But little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying CORT induced abnormal synapse plasticity and cognitive dysfunction. Drebrin is an F-actin binding protein that modulates memory formation and maintenance by controlling the genesis and morphology of dendritic spines. In addition, miRNAs have been reported to participate in the negative regulation of protein-coding genes. In this study, five miRNAs capable of targeting Drebrin were selected by searching miRNA databases. One of these miRNAs, miR-19b-3p, was found to be upregulated in the hippocampal neurons of mice with chronic restraint stress (CRS). Luciferase reporter assay and Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) were employed to identify the interaction between miR-19b-3p and Drebrin. In addition, silencing miR-19b-3p expression in vivo using an antagomir or in vitro using an inhibitor increased Drebrin expression, ameliorated the abnormal dendritic structure and upregulated the spine density in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons of CRS mice and primary hippocampal neurons cultured under CORT stimulation, respectively. Electrophysiological analysis revealed that inhibition of miR-19b-3p rescued the limited synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity in hippocampal neurons. Moreover, blocking miR-19b-3p drastically protected against cognitive deficits in CRS mice. These in vivo and in vitro findings indicate that the upregulation of miR-19b-3p exacerbates CRS-induced abnormal synaptic plasticity and cognitive impairment by targeting Drebrin.",35041806,,10.1016/j.neuropharm.2022.108951,4,Neuropharmacology,236217,5.273,0.5551639199256897,0.2408026755852843,0.4682274247491639,0.47490437202230346
Unravelling of molecular biomarkers in synaptic plasticity of Alzheimer's disease: Critical role of the restoration of neuronal circuits,"Learning and memory storage are the fundamental activities of the brain. Aberrant expression of synaptic molecular markers has been linked to memory impairment in AD. Aging is one of the risk factors linked to gradual memory loss. It is estimated that approximately 13 million people worldwide will have AD by 2050. A massive amount of oxidative stress is kept under control by a complex network of antioxidants, which occasionally fails and results in neuronal oxidative stress. Increasing evidence suggests that ROS may affect many pathological aspects of AD, including AÎ² accumulation, tau hyperphosphorylation, synaptic plasticity, and mitochondrial dysfunction, which may collectively result in neurodegeneration in the brain. Further investigation into the relationship between oxidative stress and AD may provide an avenue for effective preservation and pharmacological treatment of this neurodegenerative disease. In this review, we briefly summarize the cellular mechanism underlying AÎ² induced synaptic dysfunction. Since oxidative stress is common in the elderly and may contribute to the pathogenesis of AD, we also shed light on the role of antioxidant and inflammatory pathways in oxidative stress adaptation, which has a potential therapeutic target in neurodegenerative diseases.",37696304,,10.1016/j.arr.2023.102069,1,Ageing research reviews,101128963,11.788,0.5532639026641846,0.11036789297658862,0.8896321070234113,0.5319583415985107
An integrated proteomics approach shows synaptic plasticity changes in an APP/PS1 Alzheimer's mouse model,"The aim of this study was to elucidate the molecular signature of Alzheimer's disease-associated amyloid pathology.We used the double APPswe/PS1ÎE9 mouse, a widely used model of cerebral amyloidosis, to compare changes in proteome, including global phosphorylation and sialylated N-linked glycosylation patterns, pathway-focused transcriptome and neurological disease-associated miRNAome with age-matched controls in neocortex, hippocampus, olfactory bulb and brainstem. We report that signalling pathways related to synaptic functions associated with dendritic spine morphology, neurite outgrowth, long-term potentiation, CREB signalling and cytoskeletal dynamics were altered in 12 month old APPswe/PS1ÎE9 mice, particularly in the neocortex and olfactory bulb. This was associated with cerebral amyloidosis as well as formation of argyrophilic tangle-like structures and microglial clustering in all brain regions, except for brainstem. These responses may be epigenetically modulated by the interaction with a number of miRNAs regulating spine restructuring, AÎ² expression and neuroinflammation.We suggest that these changes could be associated with development of cognitive dysfunction in early disease states in patients with Alzheimer's disease.",27144524,PMC5085108,10.18632/oncotarget.9092,21,Oncotarget,101532965,0.0,0.5488548874855042,0.6789297658862876,0.030100334448160536,0.4711189525581922
Prospective Role of MicroRNAs in Depression,"Background:Depression is a debilitating disease that is affecting a growing number of patients, both physically and mentally. In addition to mood changes, depression results in cognitive impairment. Although depression studies have been going on for decades, the underlying mechanism still remains unclear. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a type of small non-coding RNAs, predominantly control the expression of their target mRNAs to exert their functions. Some evidences have revealed the importance of miRNAs in the mechanism of depression,however, these studies are still in their infancy. Alterations in brain regions, synaptic plasticity, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, changes in the levels of serotonin and glucocorticoids, together with stress response have been proven to be involved in depression. These alterations can influence cognition, learning and memory, with recent evidences demonstrating the involvement of miRNAs in several aspects of stress response, neural plasticity and neurogenesis as well as pathogenesis of depression.Objective:In light of these theories of depression, this review was aimed at elucidating the role of miRNAs in the underlying mechanisms of depression resulting in cognitive, learning and memory impairments.Method/results:Both PubMed and Scopus databases were employed in scouring for research reports pertaining to this area of study. A total of 180 articles were obtained from these two databases.Conclusion:With the probing of classical theories of depression as well as the connection between miRNAs and depression, more studies,nevertheless, are needed to ascertain the full mechanism of depression along with its resultant cognitive, learning and memory impediments.",28714388,,10.2174/0929867324666170714112620,9,Current medicinal chemistry,9440157,4.74,0.5474942922592163,0.45819397993311034,0.391304347826087,0.4983962409073692
TREM2 and Microglia Contribute to the Synaptic Plasticity: from Physiology to Pathology,"Synapses are bridges for information transmission in the central nervous system (CNS), and synaptic plasticity is fundamental for the normal function of synapses, contributing substantially to learning and memory. Numerous studies have proven that microglia can participate in the occurrence and progression of neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), by regulating synaptic plasticity. In this review, we summarize the main characteristics of synapses and synaptic plasticity under physiological and pathological conditions. We elaborate the origin and development of microglia and the two well-known microglial signaling pathways that regulate synaptic plasticity. We also highlight the unique role of triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) in microglia-mediated regulation of synaptic plasticity and its relationship with AD. Finally, we propose four possible ways in which TREM2 is involved in regulating synaptic plasticity. This review will help researchers understand how NDDs develop from the perspective of synaptic plasticity.",36318443,,10.1007/s12035-022-03100-1,6,Molecular neurobiology,8900963,5.682,0.5441656112670898,0.34782608695652173,0.5317725752508361,0.5024190992017254
Hippocampal stem cells promotes synaptic resistance to the dysfunctional impact of amyloid beta oligomers via secreted exosomes,"Background:Adult hippocampal neurogenesis plays an important role in synaptic plasticity and cogntive function. We reported that higher numbers of neural stem cells (NSC) in the hippocampus of cognitively-intact individuals with high Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology (plaques and tangles) is associated with decreased synaptic amyloid beta oligomers (AÎ²Î¿), an event linked to onset of dementia in AD. While these findings suggest a link between NSC and synaptic resistance to AÎ²Î¿, the involved mechanism remains to be determined. With this goal in mind, here we investigated the ability of exosomes secreted from hippocampal NSC to promote synaptic resilience to AÎ²o.Methods:Exosomes isolated from media of hippocampus NSC (NSC-exo) or mature hippocampal neuronal (MN-exo) cultures were delivered intracerebroventricularly (ICV) to mice before assessment of AÎ²Î¿-induced suppression of hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and memory deficits. AÎ²Î¿ binding to synapses was assessed in cultured hippocampal neurons and on synaptosomes isolated from hippocampal slices from wild type mice and from an inducible mouse model of NSC ablation (Nestin-Î´-HSV-TK mice) treated with exosomes. Expression of CaMKII and of AMPA and NMDA glutamate receptor subunits in synaptosomes was measured by western blot. Small RNA Deep sequencing was performed to identify microRNAs enriched in NSC-exo as compared to MN-exo. Mimics of select miRNAs were injected ICV.Results:NSC-exo, but not MN-exo, abolished AÎ²o-induced suppression of LTP and subsequent memory deficits. Furthermore, in hippocampal slices and cultured neurons, NSC-exo significantly decreased AÎ²o binding to the synapse. Similarly, transgenic ablation of endogenous NSC increased synaptic AÎ²o binding, which was reversed by exogenous NSC-exo. Phosphorylation of synaptic CaMKII was increased by NSC-exo, while AMPA and NMDA receptors were not affected. Lastly, we identified a set of miRNAs enriched in NSC-exo that, when injected ICV, protected the synapses from AÎ²o-binding and AÎ²o-induced LTP inhibition.Conclusions:These results identify a novel mechanism linking NSC-exo and synaptic susceptibility to AÎ²o that may underscore cognitive resilience of certain individuals with increased neurogenesis in spite of AD neuropathology and unmask a novel target for the development of a new treatment concept for AD centered on promoting synaptic resilience to toxic amyloid proteins.",31200742,PMC6570890,10.1186/s13024-019-0322-8,28,Molecular neurodegeneration,101266600,18.879,0.5435296297073364,0.7692307692307693,0.9698996655518395,0.6739438647809235
The emerging role of noncoding RNAs in neuroinflammation: Implications in pathogenesis and therapeutic approaches,"Noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) are important regulators of gene expression in different cell processes. Due to their ability in monitoring neural development genes, these transcripts confer neurons with the potential to exert broad control over the expression of genes for performing neurobiological functions. Although the change of ncRNA expression in different neurodegenerative diseases has been reviewed elsewhere, only recent evidence drove our attention to unravel the involvement of these molecules in neuroinflammation within these devastating disorders. Remarkably, the interactions between ncRNAs and inflammatory pathways are not fully recognized. Therefore, this review has focused on the interplay between diverse inflammatory pathways and the related ncRNAs, including microRNAs, long noncoding RNAs, and competing endogenous RNAs in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's diseases, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Huntington's disease, and prion diseases. Providing novel insights in the field of combining biomarkers is a critical step for using them as diagnostic tools and therapeutic targets in clinical settings.",34724212,,10.1002/jcp.30624,2,Journal of cellular physiology,50222,6.513,0.540620744228363,0.15384615384615385,0.6387959866220736,0.4829008746306632
MiR-137: an important player in neural development and neoplastic transformation,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) represent an important class of small regulatory RNAs that control gene expression posttranscriptionally by targeting mRNAs for degradation or translation inhibition. Early studies have revealed a complex role for miRNAs in major biological processes such as development, differentiation, growth and metabolism. MiR-137 in particular, has been of great interest due to its critical role in brain function and putative involvement in the etiology of both neuropsychiatric disorders and cancer. Several lines of evidence suggest that development, differentiation and maturation of the nervous system is strongly linked to the expression of miR-137 and its regulation of a large number of downstream target genes in various pathways. Dysregulation of this molecule has also been implicated in major mental illnesses through its position in a variant allele highly associated with schizophrenia in the largest mega genome-wide association studies. Interestingly, miR-137 has also been shown to act as a tumor suppressor, with numerous studies finding reduced expression in neoplasia including brain tumor. Restoration of miR-137 expression has also been shown to inhibit cell proliferation, migration and metastasis, and induce cell cycle arrest, differentiation and apoptosis. These properties of miR-137 propose its potential for prognosis, diagnosis and as a therapeutic target for treatment of several human neurological and neoplastic disorders. In this review, we provide details on the discovery, targets, function, regulation and disease involvement of miR-137 with a broad look at recent discovery in this area.",27620842,PMC5414082,10.1038/mp.2016.150,95,Molecular psychiatry,9607835,13.437,0.5363128781318665,0.9565217391304348,0.9163879598662207,0.6963696666784509
Rapid reversal of translational silencing: Emerging role of microRNA degradation pathways in neuronal plasticity,"As microRNAs silence translation, rapid reversal of this process has emerged as an attractive mechanism for driving de novo protein synthesis mediating neuronal plasticity. Herein, we summarize recent studies identifying neuronal stimuli that trigger rapid decreases in microRNA levels and reverse translational silencing of plasticity transcripts. Although these findings indicate that neuronal stimulation elicits rapid degradation of selected microRNAs, we are only beginning to decipher the molecular pathways involved. Accordingly, we present an overview of several molecular pathways implicated in mediating microRNA degradation: Lin-28, translin/trax, and MCPIP1. As these degradation pathways target distinct subsets of microRNAs, they enable neurons to reverse silencing rapidly, yet selectively.",27107971,PMC4987230,10.1016/j.nlm.2016.04.006,9,Neurobiology of learning and memory,9508166,3.109,0.5323947668075562,0.46153846153846156,0.16387959866220736,0.4445204721246675
The Role of miR-128 in Neurodegenerative Diseases,"Several neurodegenerative disorders are characterized by the accumulation of misfolded proteins and are collectively known as proteinopathies. Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and Huntington's disease (HD) represent some of the most common neurodegenerative disorders whose steady increase in prevalence is having a major socio-economic impact on our society. Multiple laboratories have reported hundreds of changes in gene expression in selective brain regions of AD, PD, and HD brains. While the mechanisms underlying these changes remain an active area of investigation, alterations in the expression of noncoding RNAs, which are common in AD, PD, and HD, may account for some of the changes in gene expression in proteinopathies. In this review, we discuss the role of miR-128, which is highly expressed in mammalian brains, in AD, PD, and HD. We highlight how alterations in miR-128 may account, at least in part, for the gene expression changes associated with proteinopathies. Indeed, miR-128 is involved, among other things, in the regulation of neuronal plasticity, cytoskeletal organization, and neuronal death, events linked to various proteinopathies. For example, reducing the expression of miR-128 in a mouse model of AD ameliorates cognitive deficits and reduces neuropathology. Overall, the data in the literature suggest that targeting miR-128 might be beneficial to mitigate the behavioral phenotype associated with these diseases.",37046996,PMC10093830,10.3390/ijms24076024,2,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,6.208,0.5310270190238953,0.15719063545150502,0.6120401337792643,0.472462365260491
Regulatory mechanism of circular RNAs in neurodegenerative diseases,"Background:Neurodegenerative disease is a collective term for a category of diseases that are caused by neuronal dysfunction, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a class of non-coding RNAs without the 3' cap and 5' poly(A) and are linked by covalent bonds. CircRNAs are highly expressed in brain neurons and can regulate the pathological process of neurodegenerative diseases by affecting the levels of various deposition proteins.Aims:This review is aiming to suggest that the majority of circRNAs influence neurodegenerative pathologies mainly by affecting the abnormal deposition of proteins in neurodegenerative diseases.Methods:We systematically summarized the pathological features of neurodegenerative diseases and the regulatory mechanisms of circRNAs in various types of neurodegenerative diseases.Results:Neurodegenerative disease main features include intercellular ubiquitin-proteasome system abnormalities, changes in cytoskeletal proteins, and the continuous deposition of insoluble protein fragments and inclusion bodies in the cytoplasm or nucleus, resulting in impairment of the normal physiological processes of the neuronal system. CircRNAs have multiple mechanisms, such as acting as microRNA sponges, binding to proteins, and regulating transcription. CircRNAs, which are highly stable molecules, are expected to be potential biomarkers for the pathological detection of neurodegenerative diseases such as AD and PD.Conclusions:In this review, we describe the regulatory roles and mechanisms of circRNAs in neurodegenerative diseases and aim to employ circRNAs as biomarkers for the diagnosis and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.",37864389,PMC11017410,10.1111/cns.14499,0,CNS neuroscience & therapeutics,101473265,7.035,0.5257493257522583,0.026755852842809364,0.6789297658862876,0.4565867191971744
Partial loss of psychiatric risk gene Mir137 in mice causes repetitive behavior and impairs sociability and learning via increased Pde10a,"Genetic analyses have linked microRNA-137 (MIR137) to neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder. miR-137 plays important roles in neurogenesis and neuronal maturation, but the impact of miR-137 loss-of-function in vivo remains unclear. Here we show the complete loss of miR-137 in the mouse germline knockout or nervous system knockout (cKO) leads to postnatal lethality, while heterozygous germline knockout and cKO mice remain viable. Partial loss of miR-137 in heterozygous cKO mice results in dysregulated synaptic plasticity, repetitive behavior, and impaired learning and social behavior. Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses revealed that the miR-137 mRNA target, phosphodiesterase 10a (Pde10a), is elevated in heterozygous knockout mice. Treatment with the Pde10a inhibitor papaverine or knockdown of Pde10a ameliorates the deficits observed in the heterozygous cKO mice. Collectively, our results suggest that MIR137 plays essential roles in postnatal neurodevelopment and that dysregulation of miR-137 potentially contributes to neuropsychiatric disorders in humans.",30397325,PMC6261680,10.1038/s41593-018-0261-7,81,Nature neuroscience,9809671,28.771,0.5253079533576965,0.9464882943143813,0.9866220735785953,0.7018068455932133
miR-132 Regulates Dendritic Spine Structure by Direct Targeting of Matrix Metalloproteinase 9 mRNA,"Mir-132 is a neuronal activity-regulated microRNA that controls the morphology of dendritic spines and neuronal transmission. Similar activities have recently been attributed to matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), an extrasynaptic protease. In the present study, we provide evidence that miR-132 directly regulates MMP-9 mRNA in neurons to modulate synaptic plasticity. With the use of luciferase reporter system, we show that miR-132 binds to the 3'UTR of MMP-9 mRNA to regulate its expression in neurons. The overexpression of miR-132 in neurons reduces the level of endogenous MMP-9 protein secretion. In synaptoneurosomes, metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR)-induced signaling stimulates the dissociation of miR-132 from polyribosomal fractions and shifts it towards the messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP)-containing fraction. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the overexpression of miR-132 in the cultured hippocampal neurons from Fmr1 KO mice that have increased synaptic MMP-9 level provokes enlargement of the dendritic spine heads, a process previously implicated in enhanced synaptic plasticity. We propose that activity-dependent miR-132 regulates structural plasticity of dendritic spines through matrix metalloproteinase 9.",26319558,PMC4965491,10.1007/s12035-015-9383-z,39,Molecular neurobiology,8900963,5.682,0.5251709222793579,0.8327759197324415,0.5351170568561873,0.5886811486853405
Circular RNA circ_0005835 promotes promoted neural stem cells proliferation and differentiate to neuron and inhibits inflammatory cytokines levels through miR-576-3p in Alzheimer's disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most frequent neurodegenerative disease and it is difficult to have an effective and simple method for AD early diagnosis. CircRNAs (circular RNAs) are novel discovered non-coding endogenous RNAs that affect cell apoptosis, differentiation, growth, metabolism, and metastasis. Recently, it has reported that circ_0005835 was one upregulated circRNA in the AD patients. However, the function role of circ_0005835 remains unknown. In our study, we found that circ_0005835 was upregulated in AD patients and cell models. Knockdown of circ_0005835 could downregulate neuroinflammation in BV2 cells. Moreover, knockdown of circ_0005835 promoted neural stem cells (NSC) proliferation and differentiate to neuron. These data mean that circ_0005835 plays important role in the development of AD. The miR-576-3p expression in serum was downregulated in the AD group compared to the health control group. Consistently, the level of circ_0005835 was overexpressed in the AÎ²-treated in both SH-SY5Y and BV2 cells. Moreover, the expression of miR-576-3p was negatively correlated with circ_0005835 in AD patients. In addition, we performed the rescued experiments to show that knockdown of circ_0005835 could downregulate neuroinflammation through sponging miR-576-3p in BV2 cells. Inhibition of circ_0005835 promoted NSC proliferation and differentiate to neuron via sponging miR-576-3p. These data suggested that circ_0005835 promoted AD development through regulating miR-576-3p expression.",35060046,,10.1007/s11356-021-17478-3,9,Environmental science and pollution research international,9441769,5.19,0.5239227414131165,0.46488294314381273,0.44816053511705684,0.4969623405000438
Potential of microRNAs as novel targets in the alleviation of pathological fear,"The current treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), phobias and other anxiety disorders, remains insufficient particularly in producing long-lasting full symptom control. Dysfunctional fear processing is common in these disorders, including a deficiency in fear-inhibitory mechanisms and impairment in the ability to discriminate between safety and danger cues. Research has aimed to elucidate brain circuitries, neurotransmitters and downstream signaling pathways important in the alleviation of aberrant fear, with a specific focus on mechanisms modulating fear memory and its behavioral expression. MicroRNAs (miRNA) as ""fine tuners"" of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level have emerged as critical regulators of such mechanisms important in both, the generation and the inhibition of fear memories. Along these lines, abnormal expression of miRNAs has been associated with different fear-related disorders. After providing an updated overview on the involvement of miRNAs in fear learning mechanisms, we summarize and discuss in particular those studies in which the implication of miRNAs in successful inhibition of fear has been explored. For a better overview, we dissociate the different modes of fear alleviation investigated in this regard and present studies in rodents demonstrating that specific miRNAs are involved in the destabilization of fear by interfering with consolidation/reconsolidation mechanisms or that they are associated with the generation of fear extinction or safety learning. Finally, we discuss the potential of miRNAs as biomarkers and novel therapeutic targets, as well as the challenges involved in applying the discovered mechanisms in the development of improved treatments of fear- and trauma-related disorders.",29028150,,10.1111/gbb.12427,8,"Genes, brain, and behavior",101129617,3.708,0.5235878229141235,0.4214046822742475,0.27424749163879597,0.4532831285310828
In silico identification and in vivo validation of miR-495 as a novel regulator of motivation for cocaine that targets multiple addiction-related networks in the nucleus accumbens,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression and are implicated in the etiology of several neuropsychiatric disorders, including substance use disorders (SUDs). Using in silico genome-wide sequence analyses, we identified miR-495 as a miRNA whose predicted targets are significantly enriched in the Knowledgebase for Addiction Related Genes (ARG) database (KARG; http://karg.cbi.pku.edu.cn). This small non-coding RNA is also highly expressed within the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a pivotal brain region underlying reward and motivation. Using luciferase reporter assays, we found that miR-495 directly targeted the 3'UTRs of Bdnf, Camk2a and Arc. Furthermore, we measured miR-495 expression in response to acute cocaine in mice and found that it is downregulated rapidly and selectively in the NAc, along with concomitant increases in ARG expression. Lentiviral-mediated miR-495 overexpression in the NAc shell (NAcsh) not only reversed these cocaine-induced effects but also downregulated multiple ARG mRNAs in specific SUD-related biological pathways, including those that regulate synaptic plasticity. miR-495 expression was also downregulated in the NAcsh of rats following cocaine self-administration. Most importantly, we found that NAcsh miR-495 overexpression suppressed the motivation to self-administer and seek cocaine across progressive ratio, extinction and reinstatement testing, but had no effect on food reinforcement, suggesting that miR-495 selectively affects addiction-related behaviors. Overall, our in silico search for post-transcriptional regulators identified miR-495 as a novel regulator of multiple ARGs that have a role in modulating motivation for cocaine.",28044061,PMC5495632,10.1038/mp.2016.238,35,Molecular psychiatry,9607835,13.437,0.5223240256309509,0.8093645484949833,0.919732441471572,0.6592138133718816
Metabotropic Glutamate Receptors in Alzheimer's Disease Synaptic Dysfunction: Therapeutic Opportunities and Hope for the Future,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the presence of neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. The impaired synaptic plasticity and dendritic loss at the synaptic level is an early event associated with the AD pathogenesis. The abnormal accumulation of soluble oligomeric amyloid-Î² (AÎ²), the major toxic component in amyloid plaques, is viewed to trigger synaptic dysfunctions through binding to several presynaptic and postsynaptic partners and thus to disrupt synaptic transmission. Over time, the abnormalities in neural transmission will result in cognitive deficits, which are commonly manifested as memory loss in AD patients. Synaptic plasticity is regulated through glutamate transmission, which is mediated by various glutamate receptors. Here we review recent progresses in the study of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) in AD cognition. We will discuss the role of mGluRs in synaptic plasticity and their modulation as a possible strategy for AD cognitive improvement.",33325389,PMC8439550,10.3233/JAD-201146,19,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,4.16,0.5215016007423401,0.6454849498327759,0.3177257525083612,0.5055431009136314
miR-124-dependent tagging of synapses by synaptopodin enables input-specific homeostatic plasticity,"Homeostatic synaptic plasticity is a process by which neurons adjust their synaptic strength to compensate for perturbations in neuronal activity. Whether the highly diverse synapses on a neuron respond uniformly to the same perturbation remains unclear. Moreover, the molecular determinants that underlie synapse-specific homeostatic synaptic plasticity are unknown. Here, we report a synaptic tagging mechanism in which the ability of individual synapses to increase their strength in response to activity deprivation depends on the local expression of the spine-apparatus protein synaptopodin under the regulation of miR-124. Using genetic manipulations to alter synaptopodin expression or regulation by miR-124, we show that synaptopodin behaves as a ""postsynaptic tag"" whose translation is derepressed in a subpopulation of synapses and allows for nonuniform homeostatic strengthening and synaptic AMPA receptor stabilization. By genetically silencing individual connections in pairs of neurons, we demonstrate that this process operates in an input-specific manner. Overall, our study shifts the current view that homeostatic synaptic plasticity affects all synapses uniformly to a more complex paradigm where the ability of individual synapses to undergo homeostatic changes depends on their own functional and biochemical state.",35875872,PMC9574720,10.15252/embj.2021109012,7,The EMBO journal,8208664,14.012,0.5209532976150513,0.38127090301003347,0.9264214046822743,0.5741104401074922
The role of microglia heterogeneity in synaptic plasticity and brain disorders: Will sequencing shed light on the discovery of new therapeutic targets?,"Microglia play a crucial role in interacting with neuronal synapses and modulating synaptic plasticity. This function is particularly significant during postnatal development, as microglia are responsible for removing excessive synapses to prevent neurodevelopmental deficits. Dysregulation of microglial synaptic function has been well-documented in various pathological conditions, notably Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis. The recent application of RNA sequencing has provided a powerful and unbiased means to decipher spatial and temporal microglial heterogeneity. By identifying microglia with varying gene expression profiles, researchers have defined multiple subgroups of microglia associated with specific pathological states, including disease-associated microglia, interferon-responsive microglia, proliferating microglia, and inflamed microglia in multiple sclerosis, among others. However, the functional roles of these distinct subgroups remain inadequately characterized. This review aims to refine our current understanding of the potential roles of heterogeneous microglia in regulating synaptic plasticity and their implications for various brain disorders, drawing from recent sequencing research and functional studies. This knowledge may aid in the identification of pathogenetic biomarkers and potential factors contributing to pathogenesis, shedding new light on the discovery of novel drug targets. The field of sequencing-based data mining is evolving toward a multi-omics approach. With advances in viral tools for precise microglial regulation and the development of brain organoid models, we are poised to elucidate the functional roles of microglial subgroups detected through sequencing analysis, ultimately identifying valuable therapeutic targets.",38346477,,10.1016/j.pharmthera.2024.108606,0,Pharmacology & therapeutics,7905840,13.4,0.5149796009063721,0.030100334448160536,0.9063545150501672,0.49627873044348875
Over-expression of miR-34a induces rapid cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease-like pathology,"Autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease (AD) is caused by rare mutations in one of three specific genes. This is in contrast to idiopathic, late-onset AD (LOAD), which has a more polygenetic risk profile and represents more than 95% of cases. Previously, we have demonstrated that increased expression of microRNA (miRNA)-34a (miR-34a) in AD brain targets genes linked to synaptic plasticity, energy metabolism, and resting state network activity. Here we report the generation of a heterozygous, conditional miR-34a overexpression mouse (miR-34a+/-(TetR-TetO-miR-34a) Transgenic Mice). Doxycycline-treated mice of either sex exhibited profound behavioral impairment compared to untreated groups with only 1-2 months of over-expression of miR-34a. Cognitive impairment of individual mice in T- and Y-maze tasks correlated with elevated miR-34a expression in many parts of the brain including the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, regions which are known to be involved in this task and implicated in LOAD dysfunction. Immunocytochemistry of brain sections from mice show high amyloid Î² and phosphorylated tau-specific staining in the hippocampus and cortex. Analysis of protein samples from these mice revealed that miR-34a targets specific genes involved in memory formation, amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism and phosphorylation-dephosphorylation of tau. Thus, our results suggest that the polygenetic dysfunction caused by miR-34a may occur in LOAD and disclose miR-34a as a potential therapeutic target. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Late-onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD) is associated with multiple gene alleles, a polygenetic profile of risk factors that is difficult to model in animals. Our approach to modeling LOAD was to produce a conditional over-expressing, miR-34a mouse using doxycycline-induction to activate expression. We observed that miR-34a over-expression results in a rapid cognitive impairment, associated with accumulation of intracellular AÎ² and tau hyperphosphorylation in multiple brain regions. Targets for miR-34a, including ADAM10, NMDAR 2B, and SIRT1 RNAs, were profoundly reduced by miR-34a over-expression. Collectively, these results indicate that a rapid, profound cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease neuropathology can be induced with miR-34a over-expression, suggesting that this animal model may represent a polygenetic risk factor model for LOAD.",31295467,PMC7014559,10.1016/j.brainres.2019.146327,26,Brain research,45503,3.61,0.5103363394737244,0.7525083612040134,0.24414715719063546,0.5055329073631645
Prolonged Induction of miR-212/132 and REST Expression in Rat Striatum Following Cocaine Self-Administration,"Chronic exposure to cocaine in vivo induces long-term synaptic plasticity associated with the brain's circuitry that underlies development of repetitive and automatic behaviors called habits. In fact, prolonged drug consumption results in aberrant expression of protein-coding genes and small regulatory RNAs, including miRNAs that are involved in synaptic plasticity and neuroadaptations. However, the mechanisms mediating cocaine use disorder are still not fully understood. The present study is designed to examine the expression of miR-124, miR-132, miR-134, and miR-212, as well as the levels of the Ago2, Pum2, and REST mRNAs and proteins implicated in their regulation. We applied rat cocaine self-administration (SA) and extinction training procedures with a yoked triad to assess the changes in the levels of four miRNAs and three protein-coding genes and corresponding proteins in the dorsal striatum. We demonstrated that elevated expression of mature miR-212 and miR-132 is long-lasting and persists in the drug-free period (till 10-day abstinence). Moreover, mRNA and protein of REST, a regulator of neuronal transcription, was raised selectively in cocaine self-administering rats and Ago2 transcript decreased after cocaine treatment. Unexpectedly, the expression level of Ago2 and Pum2 proteins changed only in the active cocaine-receiving animals. These results point out the important aspects of long-lasting alterations in microRNAs, genes, and protein expressions involved in the control of synaptic plasticity associated with reward and motivation learning related to cocaine addiction.",26944283,PMC5355523,10.1007/s12035-016-9817-2,21,Molecular neurobiology,8900963,5.682,0.5079949498176575,0.6822742474916388,0.5384615384615384,0.5489441270812299
The emerging role of miRNA-132/212 cluster in neurologic and cardiovascular diseases: Neuroprotective role in cells with prolonged longevity,"miRNA-132/212 are small regulators of gene expression with a function that fulfills a vital function in diverse biological processes including neuroprotection of cells with prolonged longevity in neurons and the cardiovascular system. In neurons, miRNA-132 appears to be essential for controlling differentiation, development, and neural functioning. Indeed, it also universally promotes axon evolution, nervous migration, plasticity as well, it is suggested to be neuroprotective against neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, miRNA-132/212 disorder leads to neural developmental perturbation, and the development of degenerative disorders covering Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and epilepsy's along with psychiatric perturbations including schizophrenia. Furthermore, the cellular mechanisms of the miRNA-132/212 have additionally been explored in cardiovascular diseases models. Also, the miRNA-132/212 family modulates cardiac hypertrophy and autophagy in cardiomyocytes. The protective and effective clinical promise of miRNA-132/212 in these systems is discussed in this review. To sum up, the current progress in innovative miRNA-based therapies for human pathologies seems of extreme concern and reveals promising novel therapeutic strategies.",34517022,,10.1016/j.mad.2021.111566,4,Mechanisms of ageing and development,347227,5.498,0.505847692489624,0.24414715719063546,0.48494983277591974,0.44932801348708545
MiR-218 targets MeCP2 and inhibits heroin seeking behavior,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of evolutionarily conserved, 18-25 nucleotide non-coding sequences that post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression. Recent studies implicated their roles in the regulation of neuronal functions, such as learning, cognition and memory formation. Here we report that miR-218 inhibits heroin-induced behavioral plasticity. First, network propagation-based method was used to predict candidate miRNAs that played potential key roles in regulating drug addiction-related genes. Microarray screening was also carried out to identify miRNAs responding to chronic heroin administration in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Among the collapsed miRNAs, top-ranked miR-218 was decreased after chronic exposure to heroin. Lentiviral overexpression of miR-218 in NAc could inhibit heroin-induced reinforcement in both conditioned place preference (CPP) test and heroin self-administration experiments. Luciferase activity assay indicated that miR-218 could regulate 3' untranslated regions (3' UTR) of multiple neuroplasticity-related genes and directly target methyl CpG binding protein 2 (Mecp2). Consistently, Mecp2308/ymice exhibited reduced heroin seeking behavior in CPP test. These data reveal a functional role of miR-218 and its target, MeCP2, in the regulation of heroin-induced behavioral plasticity.",28074855,PMC5225456,10.1038/srep40413,33,Scientific reports,101563288,4.996,0.5007195472717285,0.7926421404682275,0.411371237458194,0.5412344039483215
miR-145a-5p/SIK1/cAMP-dependent alteration of synaptic structural plasticity drives cognitive impairment induced by coke oven emissions,"Exposure to fine particulate matter (PM) is associated with the neurodegenerative diseases. Coke oven emissions (COEs) in occupational environment are important sources of PM. However, its neurotoxicity is still unclear. Therefore, evaluating the toxicological effects of COE on the nervous system is necessary. In the present study, we constructed mouse models of COE exposure by tracheal instillation. Mice exposed to COE showed signs of cognitive impairment. This was accompanied by a decrease in miR-145a-5p and an increase in SIK1 expression in the hippocampus, along with synaptic structural damage. Our results demonstrated that COE-induced miR-145a-5p downregulation could increase the expression of SIK1 and phosphorylated SIK1, inhibiting the cAMP/PKA/CREB pathway by activating PDE4D, which was associated with reduced synaptic structural plasticity. Furthermore, restoring of miR-145a-5p expression based on COE exposure in HT22 cells could partially reversed the negative effects of COE exposure through the SIK1/PDE4D/cAMP axis. Collectively, our findings link epigenetic regulation with COE-induced neurotoxicity and imply that miR-145a-5p could be an early diagnostic marker for neurological diseases in patients with COE occupational exposure.",38677069,,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2024.116401,0,Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,7805381,7.129,0.4990406036376953,0.033444816053511704,0.6989966555183946,0.4459126564969985

Some miRs, including miR-22, play an essential role in regulating neurological disorders. MiR-22 is a brain-enriched regulatory element involved in angiogenesis, energy supply, adjustment of ionic channels, and suppression of malignant cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. This article discusses the protective and therapeutic effects of miR-22 on neurological diseases and injuries, including cerebral ischemia, neurodegenerative diseases, epilepsy, and brain malignancies.

Non-coding RNAs: New players in mitophagy and neurodegeneration,"Mitophagy controls mitochondrial quality to maintain cellular homeostasis, while aberrations in this process are responsible for neurodegenerative diseases. Mitophagy is initiated through the recruitment of autophagosomes in a ubiquitin-dependent or ubiquitin-independent manner under different stress conditions. Although the detailed molecular mechanisms of how mitophagy processes influence neurodegeneration remain largely uncharacterized, there is mounting evidence indicating that non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), a variety of endogenous regulators, including microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs, extensively participate in mitophagy processes and play pivotal roles in the aging process and neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we reviewed the major mitophagy pathways modulated by some classical and newly found ncRNAs and summarized the diverse mechanisms in a regulatory network. We also discussed the generalizability of ncRNAs in the development of common neurodegenerative diseases related to proteotoxicity and the importance of mitophagy in the pathogenesis of these diseases. In summary, we propose that ncRNAs act as linkers between mitophagy and neurodegeneration, showing the potential therapeutic application of mitophagy regulation mediated by ncRNAs in neurodegenerative diseases.",34864089,,10.1016/j.neuint.2021.105253,3,Neurochemistry international,8006959,4.297,0.49485793709754944,0.19732441471571907,0.33444816053511706,0.40326927730869694
Molecular Factors Mediating Neural Cell Plasticity Changes in Dementia Brain Diseases,"Neural plasticity-the ability to alter a neuronal response to environmental stimuli-is an important factor in learning and memory. Short-term synaptic plasticity and long-term synaptic plasticity, including long-term potentiation and long-term depression, are the most-characterized models of learning and memory at the molecular and cellular level. These processes are often disrupted by neurodegeneration-induced dementias. Alzheimer's disease (AD) accounts for 50% of cases of dementia. Vascular dementia (VaD), Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) constitute much of the remaining cases. While vascular lesions are the principal cause of VaD, neurodegenerative processes have been established as etiological agents of many dementia diseases. Chief among such processes is the deposition of pathological protein aggregatesin vivoincludingÎ²-amyloid deposition in AD, the formation of neurofibrillary tangles in AD and FTD, and the accumulation of Lewy bodies composed ofÎ±-synuclein aggregates in DLB and PDD. The main symptoms of dementia are cognitive decline and memory and learning impairment. Nonetheless, accurate diagnoses of neurodegenerative diseases can be difficult due to overlapping clinical symptoms and the diverse locations of cortical lesions. Still, new neuroimaging and molecular biomarkers have improved clinicians' diagnostic capabilities in the context of dementia and may lead to the development of more effective treatments. Both genetic and environmental factors may lead to the aggregation of pathological proteins and altered levels of cytokines, such that can trigger the formation of proinflammatory immunological phenotypes. This cascade of pathological changes provides fertile ground for the development of neural plasticity disorders and dementias. Available pharmacotherapy and disease-modifying therapies currently in clinical trials may modulate synaptic plasticity to mitigate the effects neuropathological changes have on cognitive function, memory, and learning. In this article, we review the neural plasticity changes seen in common neurodegenerative diseases from pathophysiological and clinical points of view and highlight potential molecular targets of disease-modifying therapies.",33854544,PMC8021472,10.1155/2021/8834645,7,Neural plasticity,100883417,3.144,0.4902966022491455,0.38461538461538464,0.1939799331103679,0.40989702489463775
Intracranial Self-Stimulation Modulates Levels of SIRT1 Protein and Neural Plasticity-Related microRNAs,"Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of reward system brain areas, such as the medial forebrain bundle (MFB), by means of intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS), facilitates learning and memory in rodents. MFB-ICSS has been found capable of modifying different plasticity-related proteins, but its underlying molecular mechanisms require further elucidation. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) and the longevity-associated SIRT1 protein have emerged as important regulatory molecules implicated in neural plasticity. Thus, we aimed to analyze the effects of MFB-ICSS on miRNAs expression and SIRT1 protein levels in hippocampal subfields and serum. We used OpenArray to select miRNA candidates differentially expressed in the dentate gyrus (DG) of ICSS-treated (3 sessions, 45' session/day) and sham rats. We further analyzed the expression of these miRNAs, together with candidates selected after bibliographic screening (miR-132-3p, miR-134-5p, miR-146a-5p, miR-181c-5p) in DG, CA1, and CA3, as well as in serum, by qRT-PCR. We also assessed tissue and serum SIRT1 protein levels by Western Blot and ELISA, respectively. Expression of miR-132-3p, miR-181c-5p, miR-495-3p, and SIRT1 protein was upregulated in DG of ICSS rats (P < 0.05). None of the analyzed molecules was regulated in CA3, while miR-132-3p was also increased in CA1 (P = 0.011) and serum (P = 0.048). This work shows for the first time that a DBS procedure, specifically MFB-ICSS, modulates the levels of plasticity-related miRNAs and SIRT1 in specific hippocampal subfields. The mechanistic role of these molecules could be key to the improvement of memory by MFB-ICSS. Moreover, regarding the proposed clinical applicability of DBS, serum miR-132 is suggested as a potential treatment biomarker.",32219698,,10.1007/s12035-020-01901-w,9,Molecular neurobiology,8900963,5.682,0.487528532743454,0.4682274247491639,0.5451505016722408,0.49519270493035333
MicroRNA-99a is a Potential Target for Regulating Hypothalamic Synaptic Plasticity in the Peri/Postmenopausal Depression Model,"Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that there is a growing trend of menopausal women suffering from depression. However, the pathogenesis of menopausal depression still remains unclear. Hence, this paper aims to reveal the pathological mechanisms involved in postmenopausal depression by using a novel peri- to postmenopausal depression model induced by a two-step ovariectomy plus chronic mild stress (CMS). The results of metabolic chambers and serum hormone/cytokine determination revealed that peri/postmenopausal depressive mice exhibited endocrine and metabolic disorders. Electrophysiological recordings indicated that the hippocampal synaptic transmission was compromised. Compared to the sham group, the microRNA-99a (miR-99a) level decreased significantly in the hypothalamus, and its target FK506-binding protein 51 (FKBP51) enormously increased; in contrast, the nuclear translocation of the progesterone receptor (PR) decreased in hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) in the peri/postmenopausal depression mouse model. Additionally, synaptic proteins, including postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) and synaptophysin (SYN), showed a similar decrease in the hypothalamus. Accordingly, the present work suggests that miR-99a may be involved in the regulation of hypothalamic synaptic plasticity and that it might be a potential therapeutic target for peri/postmenopausal depression.",31540304,PMC6769887,10.3390/cells8091081,6,Cells,101600052,7.666,0.4871397018432617,0.3511705685618729,0.7591973244147158,0.5143573997012748
Distinct temporal expression of the GW182 paralog TNRC6A in neurons regulates dendritic arborization,"Precise development of the dendritic architecture is a critical determinant of mature neuronal circuitry. MicroRNA (miRNA)-mediated regulation of protein synthesis plays a crucial role in dendritic morphogenesis, but the role of miRNA-induced silencing complex (miRISC) protein components in this process is less studied. Here, we show an important role of a key miRISC protein, the GW182 paralog TNRC6A, in the regulation of dendritic growth. We identified a distinct brain region-specific spatiotemporal expression pattern of GW182 during rat postnatal development. We found that the window of peak GW182 expression coincides with the period of extensive dendritic growth, both in the hippocampus and cerebellum. Perturbation of GW182 function during a specific temporal window resulted in reduced dendritic growth of cultured hippocampal neurons. Mechanistically, we show that GW182 modulates dendritic growth by regulating global somatodendritic translation and actin cytoskeletal dynamics of developing neurons. Furthermore, we found that GW182 affects dendritic architecture by regulating the expression of actin modulator LIMK1. Taken together, our data reveal a previously undescribed neurodevelopmental expression pattern of GW182 and its role in dendritic morphogenesis, which involves both translational control and actin cytoskeletal rearrangement. This article has an associated First Person interview with the first author of the paper.",34328181,,10.1242/jcs.258465,2,Journal of cell science,52457,5.235,0.48708629608154297,0.1605351170568562,0.45819397993311034,0.4159975970469191
Mir125b-2 imprinted in human but not mouse brain regulates hippocampal function and circuit in mice,"Genomic imprinting predominantly occurs in the placenta and brain. Few imprinted microRNAs have been identified in the brain, and their functional roles in the brain are not clear. Here we show paternal, but not maternal, expression of MIR125B2 in human but not mouse brain. Moreover, Mir125b-2m-/p-mice showed impaired learning and memory, and anxiety, whose functions were hippocampus-dependent. Hippocampal granule cells from Mir125b-2m-/p-mice displayed increased neuronal excitability, increased excitatory synaptic transmission, and decreased inhibitory synaptic transmission. Glutamate ionotropic receptor NMDA type subunit 2A (Grin2a), a key regulator of synaptic plasticity, was physically bound by miR-125b-2 and upregulated in the hippocampus of Mir125b-2m-/p-mice. Taken together, our findings demonstrate MIR125B2 imprinted in human but not mouse brain, mediated learning, memory, and anxiety, regulated excitability and synaptic transmission in hippocampal granule cells, and affected hippocampal expression of Grin2a. Our work provides functional mechanisms of a species-specific imprinted microRNA in the brain.",36918719,PMC10014956,10.1038/s42003-023-04655-y,0,Communications biology,101719179,6.548,0.486301064491272,0.03678929765886288,0.6488294314381271,0.42890438451416113
Î²-Amyloid triggers aberrant over-scaling of homeostatic synaptic plasticity,"The over-production of Î²-amyloid (AÎ²) has been strongly correlated to neuronal dysfunction and altered synaptic plasticity in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Accordingly, it has been proposed that disrupted synaptic transmission and neuronal network instability underlie memory failure that is evident in the early phases of AD. Homeostatic synaptic plasticity (HSP) serves to restrain neuronal activity within a physiological range. Therefore a disruption of this mechanism may lead to destabilization in synaptic and neural circuit function. Here, we report that during HSP by neuronal activity deprivation, application of AÎ² results in an aberrant over-response of the up-regulation of AMPA receptor (AMPAR)-mediated synaptic currents and cell-surface AMPAR expression. In the visual cortex, in vivo HSP induced by visual deprivation shows a similar over-response following an AÎ² local injection. AÎ² increases the expression of GluA2-lacking, calcium permeable AMPARs (CP-AMPARs), which are required for the initiation, but not maintenance of HSP. Both GluA2-lacking and GluA2-containing AMPARs contribute to the AÎ²-mediated over-scaling of HSP. We also find that AÎ² induces the dissociation of HDAC1 from the miR124 transcription factor EVI1, leading to an up-regulation of miR124 expression and increased amount of CP-AMPARs. Thus, via aberrant stimulation of miR124 expression and biogenesis of CP-AMPARs, AÎ² is able to induce an over response in HSP. This AÎ²-mediated dysregulation in homeostatic plasticity may play an important role in the pathogenesis of altered neural function and memory deficits in the early stages of AD.",27955702,PMC5154098,10.1186/s40478-016-0398-0,22,Acta neuropathologica communications,101610673,7.578,0.4853099584579468,0.7023411371237458,0.7224080267558528,0.5761358078506877
Exploiting Circulating MicroRNAs as Biomarkers in Psychiatric Disorders,"Non-invasive peripheral biomarkers play a significant role in both disease diagnosis and progression. In the past few years, microRNA (miRNA) expression changes in circulating peripheral tissues have been found to be correlative with changes in neuronal tissues from patients with neuropsychiatric disorders. This is a notable quality of a biomolecule to be considered as a biomarker for both prognosis and diagnosis of disease. miRNAs, members of the small non-coding RNA family, have recently gained significant attention due to their ability to epigenetically influence almost every aspect of brain functioning. Empirical evidence suggests that miRNA-associated changes in the brain are often translated into behavioral changes. Current clinical understanding further implicates their role in the management of major psychiatric conditions, including major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BD), and schizophrenia (SZ). This review aims to critically evaluate the potential advantages and disadvantages of miRNAs as diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers in psychiatric disorders as well as in treatment response.",32304043,PMC7269874,10.1007/s40291-020-00464-9,29,Molecular diagnosis & therapy,101264260,4.476,0.48492124676704407,0.7792642140468228,0.36454849498327757,0.5197152898662465

RNA metabolism in neurodegenerative disease,"Aging-related neurodegenerative diseases are progressive and fatal neurological diseases that are characterized by irreversible neuron loss and gliosis. With a growing population of aging individuals, there is a pressing need to better understand the basic biology underlying these diseases. Although diverse disease mechanisms have been implicated in neurodegeneration, a common theme of altered RNA processing has emerged as a unifying contributing factor to neurodegenerative disease. RNA processing includes a series of distinct processes, including RNA splicing, transport and stability, as well as the biogenesis of non-coding RNAs. Here, we highlight how some of these mechanisms are altered in neurodegenerative disease, including the mislocalization of RNA-binding proteins and their sequestration induced by microsatellite repeats, microRNA biogenesis alterations and defective tRNA biogenesis, as well as changes to long-intergenic non-coding RNAs. We also highlight potential therapeutic interventions for each of these mechanisms.",28468937,PMC5451173,10.1242/dmm.028613,71,Disease models & mechanisms,101483332,5.732,0.4803415536880493,0.9264214046822743,0.5551839464882943,0.5845260024469433
Non-coding RNA in alcohol use disorder by affecting synaptic plasticity,"Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is one of the most serious public health problems worldwide. AUD is a complex disorder, and there is ample evidence that genetic predisposition is critical to its development. Recent studies have shown that genetic predisposition leads to the onset of AUD, and alcohol metabolism can affect epigenetic inheritance, which in turn affects synaptic plasticity, alters brain function, and leads to more severe addictive behaviors. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), especially microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), play an important role in alcohol addiction. This paper reviews the regulatory role of ncRNAs. ncRNAs are involved in enzyme and neurotransmitter reaction systems during alcohol use disorder. Alcohol consumption regulates the expression of ncRNAs that mediate epigenetic modification and synaptic plasticity, which play an important role in the development of chronic AUD. ncRNAs may be used not only as predictors of therapeutic responses but also as therapeutic targets of AUD. Chronic alcoholism is more likely to lead to neuroimmune disorders, including permanent brain dysfunction. AUD induced by long-term alcoholism greatly alters the expression of genes in the human genome, especially the expression of ncRNAs. Alcohol can cause a series of pathological changes by interfering with gene expression, such as through disordered miRNA-mRNA expression networks, epigenetic modifications, disordered metabolism, and even synaptic remodeling. ncRNAs are involved in the transition from moderate drinking to alcohol dependence.",35028694,,10.1007/s00221-022-06305-x,7,Experimental brain research,43312,2.064,0.47982358932495117,0.3879598662207358,0.08695652173913043,0.38287743118694395
Role of Nrf2 in Synaptic Plasticity and Memory in Alzheimer's Disease,"Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is an important transcription factor that reduces oxidative stress. When reactive oxygen species (ROS) or reactive nitrogen species (RNS) are detected, Nrf2 translocates from the cytoplasm into the nucleus and binds to the antioxidant response element (ARE), which regulates the expression of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory genes. Nrf2 impairments are observed in the majority of neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). The classic hallmarks of AD include Î²-amyloid (AÎ²) plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Oxidative stress is observed early in AD and is a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of AD. The nuclear translocation of Nrf2 is impaired in AD compared to controls. Increased oxidative stress is associated with impaired memory and synaptic plasticity. The administration of Nrf2 activators reverses memory and synaptic plasticity impairments in rodent models of AD. Therefore, Nrf2 activators are a potential novel therapeutic for neurodegenerative disorders including AD.",34440653,PMC8391447,10.3390/cells10081884,25,Cells,101600052,7.666,0.479031503200531,0.7391304347826086,0.7625418060200669,0.5877533500808536
The role of DSCAM in the regulation of synaptic plasticity: possible involvement in neuropsychiatric disorders,"Synaptic plasticity simply put, is the activityâdependent modification of the strength or efficacy of synaptic transmission in the network of synapses in the brain. The role of synaptic plasticity in disease is an active area of research. Changes in plasticity translate to the release of neurotransmitters at the synapse and subsequently, the way humans see the world. It is known that neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are related to pathological changes in dynamic processes in synapses, dialogue between neurons, and finally, changes in overall plasticity. To find a cure for these plasticity related diseases, it is imperative that we understand the precise mechanisms that perturb the homeostatic balance leading to the disease state. The aim of this review is to present what is currently known about DSCAM (Down Syndrome Cell Adhesion Molecule) a protein that is directly connected to pathological changes in synaptic plasticity. The review will present information on DSCAM and how it is connected to glutamate (Glu) and Î³âAminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmission pathways. Finally, the review throws some light on the possible involvement of DSCAM in a spectrum of psychiatric disorders apart from Down syndrome (DS).",30295678,,,7,Acta neurobiologiae experimentalis,1246675,1.269,0.4783613085746765,0.391304347826087,0.0802675585284281,0.3813311664157089
Nicotine abolishes memory-related synaptic strengthening and promotes synaptic depression in the neurogenic dentate gyrus of miR-132/212 knockout mice,"Micro-RNAs (miRNAs) are highly evolutionarily conserved short-length/noncoding RNA molecules that modulate a wide range of cellular functions in many cell types by regulating the expression of a variety of targeted genes. miRNAs have also recently emerged as key regulators of neuronal genes mediating the effects of psychostimulant drugs and memory-related neuroplasticity processes. Smoking is a predominant addictive behaviour associated with millions of deaths worldwide, and nicotine is a potent natural psychoactive agonist of cholinergic receptors, highly abundant in cigarettes. The influence of miRNAs modulation on cholinergic signalling in the nervous system remains however poorly explored. Using miRNA knockout mice and biochemical, electrophysiological and pharmacological approaches, we examined the effects of miR-132/212 gene disruption on the levels of hippocampal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, total ERK and phosphorylated ERK (pERK) and MeCP2 protein levels, and studied the impact of nicotine stimulation on hippocampal synaptic transmission and synaptic depression and strengthening. miR-132/212 deletion significantly altered Î±7-nAChR and pERK protein levels, but not total ERK or MeCP2, and resulted in both exacerbated synaptic depression and virtually abolished memory-related synaptic strengthening upon nicotine stimulation. These observations reveal a functional miRNAs/nicotinergic signalling interplay critical for nicotinic-receptor expression and neuroplasticity in brain structures relevant for drug addiction and learning and memory functions.",32293776,PMC7988623,10.1111/adb.12905,4,Addiction biology,9604935,4.093,0.47682324051856995,0.24749163879598662,0.28762541806020064,0.39311735568237943
Exosomal microRNAs as diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic applications in neurodegenerative diseases,"Originating from slow irreversible and progressive loss and dysfunction of neurons and synapses in the nervous system, neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) affect millions of people worldwide. Common NDDs include Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease multiple sclerosis, Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Currently, no sensitive biomarkers are available to monitor the progression and treatment response of NDDs or to predict their prognosis. Exosomes (EXOs) are small bilipid layer-enclosed extracellular vesicles containing numerous biomolecules, including proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids. Recent evidence indicates that EXOs are pathogenic participants in the spread of neurodegenerative diseases, contributing to disease progression and spread. EXOs are also important tools for diagnosis and treatment. Recently, studies have proposed exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs) as the targets for therapies or biomarkers of NDDs. In this review, we outline the latest research on the roles of exosomal miRNAs in NDDs and their applications as potential diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers, targets, and drugs for NDDs.",36184105,,10.1080/01616412.2022.2129768,3,Neurological research,7905298,2.529,0.4763055741786957,0.20066889632107024,0.09364548494983277,0.344646220761398
MicroRNA-26a-3p rescues depression-like behaviors in male rats via preventing hippocampal neuronal anomalies,"Depression is a neuropsychiatric disease associated with neuronal anomalies within specific brain regions. In the present study, we screened microRNA (miRNA) expression profiles in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus and found that miR-26a-3p was markedly downregulated in a rat model of depression, whereas upregulation of miR-26a-3p within DG regions rescued the neuronal deterioration and depression-like phenotypes resulting from stress exposure, effects that appear to be mediated by the PTEN pathway. The knockdown of miR-26a-3p in DG regions of normal control rats induced depression-like behaviors, effects that were accompanied by activation of the PTEN/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and neuronal deterioration via suppression of autophagy, impairments in synaptic plasticity, and promotion of neuronal apoptosis. In conclusion, these results suggest that miR-26a-3p deficits within the hippocampal DG mediated the neuronal anomalies contributing to the display of depression-like behaviors. This miRNA may serve as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of depression.",34228643,PMC8363293,10.1172/JCI148853,24,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,19.456,0.472379207611084,0.7290969899665551,0.9832775919732442,0.6259024409546102
Synaptic dysfunction and septin protein family members in neurodegenerative diseases,"Cognitive decline and disease progression in different neurodegenerative diseases typically involves synaptic dysfunction preceding the neuronal loss. The synaptic dysfunction is suggested to be caused by imbalanced synaptic plasticity i.e. enhanced induction of long-term depression and concomitantly decreased long-term potentiation accompanied with excess stimulation of extrasynaptic N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors due to various disturbances in pre- and postsynaptic sites. Recent research has identified neurodegenerative disease-related changes in protein accumulation and aggregation, gene expression, and protein functions, which may contribute to imbalanced synaptic function. Nevertheless, a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms regulating synaptic plasticity in health and disease is still lacking and therefore characterization of new candidates involved in these mechanisms is needed. Septins, a highly conserved group of guanosine-5'-triphosphate (GTP)-binding proteins, show high neuronal expression and are implicated in the regulation of synaptic vesicle trafficking and neurotransmitter release. In this review, we first summarize the evidence how synaptic dysfunction is related to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's disease and frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Then, we discuss different aspects of the potential involvement of the septin family members in the regulation of synaptic function in relation to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases.",25888325,PMC4391194,10.1186/s13024-015-0013-z,49,Molecular neurodegeneration,101266600,18.879,0.4716034531593323,0.8795986622073578,0.9732441471571907,0.6535306337685091
miR-34a/TAN1/CREB Axis Engages in Alleviating Oligodendrocyte Trophic Factor-Induced Myelin Repair Function and Astrocyte-Dependent Neuroinflammation in the Early Stages of Alzheimer's Disease: The Anti-Neurodegenerative Effect of Treadmill Exercise,"Reduced myelin stability observed in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease leads to spatial learning and memory impairment. Exercise has been shown to protect nerves, reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease, and strengthen synaptic connectivity. However, the underlying mechanisms of how exercise can promote myelin repair and coordinate inflammation and proliferation are still uncertain. In this study, we conducted histological and biochemical assays of cortical lysates after behavioral testing to detect pathological changes, myelin sheath thickness, and mRNA and protein levels. It is notable that D-galactose model mice exhibited elevated miRNA-34a levels, overactive astrocytes, decreased myelin staining scores, increased apoptosis, and decreased synaptic plasticity in the brain. Significantly, after eight weeks of exercise, we observed improvements in LFB scores, NeuN( +) neuron counts, and myelin basic protein (MBP) expression. Additionally, exercise promoted the expression of oligodendrocyte markers Olig2 and PDFGR-Î± associated with brain proliferation, and improved spatial cognitive function. Furthermore, it decreased the inflammation caused by astrocyte secretions (TNF-Î±, Cox-2, CXCL2). Interestingly, we also observed downregulation of miR-34a and activation of the TAN1/PI3K/CREB signaling pathway. Our data shed light on a previously unsuspected mechanism by which exercise reduces miR-34a levels and protects neuronal function and survival by preventing excessive demyelination and inflammatory infiltration in the CNS.",38289520,,10.1007/s11064-024-04108-w,0,Neurochemical research,7613461,4.414,0.4701283872127533,0.043478260869565216,0.35451505016722407,0.3616756945350098
A Sex Perspective in Neurodegenerative Diseases: microRNAs as Possible Peripheral Biomarkers,"Sex is a significant variable in the prevalence and incidence of neurological disorders. Sex differences exist in neurodegenerative disorders (NDs), where sex dimorphisms play important roles in the development and progression of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In the last few years, some sex specific biomarkers for the identification of NDs have been described and recent studies have suggested that microRNA (miRNA) could be included among these, as influenced by the hormonal and genetic background. Failing to consider the possible differences between males and females in miRNA evaluation could introduce a sex bias in studies by not considering some of these sex-related biomarkers. In this review, we recapitulate what is known about the sex-specific differences in peripheral miRNA levels in neurodegenerative diseases. Several studies have reported sex-linked disparities, and from the literature analysis miR-206 particularly has been shown to have a sex-specific involvement. Hopefully, in the near future, patient stratification will provide important additional clues in diagnosis, prognosis, and tailoring of the best therapeutic approaches for each patient. Sex-specific biomarkers, such as miRNAs, could represent a useful tool for characterizing subgroups of patients.",33922607,PMC8122918,10.3390/ijms22094423,23,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,6.208,0.4695506691932678,0.7123745819397993,0.6153846153846154,0.5472822409808435
Effects of transcranial magnetic stimulation on neurobiological changes in Alzheimer's disease (Review),"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline and brain neuronal loss. A pioneering field of research in AD is brain stimulation via electromagnetic fields (EMFs), which may produce clinical benefits. Noninvasive brain stimulation techniques, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), have been developed to treat neurological and psychiatric disorders. The purpose of the present review is to identify neurobiological changes, including inflammatory, neurodegenerative, apoptotic, neuroprotective and genetic changes, which are associated with repetitive TMS (rTMS) treatment in patients with AD. Furthermore, it aims to evaluate the effect of TMS treatment in patients with AD and to identify the associated mechanisms. The present review highlights the changes in inflammatory and apoptotic mechanisms, mitochondrial enzymatic activities, and modulation of gene expression (microRNA expression profiles) associated with rTMS or sham procedures. At the molecular level, it has been suggested that EMFs generated by TMS may affect the cell redox status and amyloidogenic processes. TMS may also modulate gene expression by acting on both transcriptional and postâtranscriptional regulatory mechanisms. TMS may increase brain cortical excitability, induce specific potentiation phenomena, and promote synaptic plasticity and recovery of impaired functions; thus, it may reâestablish cognitive performance in patients with AD.",35119081,PMC8845030,10.3892/mmr.2022.12625,4,Molecular medicine reports,101475259,3.423,0.468030720949173,0.2508361204013378,0.23076923076923078,0.3771395028036175
Alcohol induced impairment/abnormalities in brain: Role of MicroRNAs,"Alcohol is a highly toxic substance and has teratogenic properties that can lead to a wide range of developmental disorders. Excessive use of alcohol can change the structural and functional aspects of developed brain and other organs. Which can further lead to significant health, social and economic implications in many countries of the world. Convincing evidence support the involvement of microRNAs (miRNAs) as important post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression in neurodevelopment and maintenance. They also show differential expression following an injury. MiRNAs are the special class of small non coding RNAs that can modify the gene by targeting the mRNA and fine tune the development of cells to organs. Numerous pieces of evidences have shown the relationship between miRNA, alcohol and brain damage. These studies also show how miRNA controls different cellular mechanisms involved in the development of alcohol use disorder. With the increasing number of research studies, the roles of miRNAs following alcohol-induced injury could help researchers to recognize alternative therapeutic methods to treat/cure alcohol-induced brain damage. The present review summarizes the available data and brings together the important miRNAs, that play a crucial role in alcohol-induced brain damage, which will help in better understanding complex mechanisms. Identifying these miRNAs will not only expand the current knowledge but can lead to the identification of better targets for the development of novel therapeutic interventions.",34478768,,10.1016/j.neuro.2021.08.013,5,Neurotoxicology,7905589,4.398,0.468030720949173,0.3110367892976589,0.3377926421404682,0.4105843188571292
"Knockdown of heterochromatin protein 1 binding protein 3 recapitulates phenotypic, cellular, and molecular features of aging","Identifying genetic factors that modify an individual's susceptibility to cognitive decline in aging is critical to understanding biological processes involved and mitigating risk associated with a number of age-related disorders. Recently, heterochromatin protein 1 binding protein 3 (Hp1bp3) was identified as a mediator of cognitive aging. Here, we provide a mechanistic explanation for these findings and show that targeted knockdown of Hp1bp3 in the hippocampus by 50%-75% is sufficient to induce cognitive deficits and transcriptional changes reminiscent of those observed in aging and Alzheimer's disease brains. Specifically, neuroinflammatory-related pathways become activated following Hp1bp3 knockdown in combination with a robust decrease in genes involved in synaptic activity and neuronal function. To test the hypothesis that Hp1bp3 mediates susceptibility to cognitive deficits via a role in neuronal excitability, we performed slice electrophysiology demonstrate transcriptional changes after Hp1bp3 knockdown manifest functionally as a reduction in hippocampal neuronal intrinsic excitability and synaptic plasticity. In addition, as Hp1bp3 is a known mediator of miRNA biogenesis, here we profile the miRNA transcriptome and identify mir-223 as a putative regulator of a portion of observed mRNA changes, particularly those that are inflammatory-related. In summary, work here identifies Hp1bp3 as a critical mediator of aging-related changes at the phenotypic, cellular, and molecular level and will help inform the development of therapeutics designed to target either Hp1bp3 or its downstream effectors in order to promote cognitive longevity.",30549219,PMC6351847,10.1111/acel.12886,9,Aging cell,101130839,11.005,0.4677571952342987,0.47157190635451507,0.8729096989966555,0.5495506382108133
Inhibition of microRNA-124-3p as a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of Gulf War Illness: Evaluation in a rat model,"Gulf War Illness (GWI) is a chronic, multisymptom illness that continues to affect up to 30% of veterans deployed to the Persian Gulf during the 1990-1991 Gulf War. After nearly 30 years, useful treatments for GWI are lacking and underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in its pathobiology remain poorly understood, although exposures to pyridostigmine bromide (PB) and pesticides are consistently identified to be among the strongest risk factors. Alleviation of the broad range of symptoms manifested in GWI, which involve the central nervous system, the neuroendocrine system, and the immune system likely requires therapies that are able to activate and inactivate a large set of orchestrated genes. Previous work in our laboratory using an established rat model of GWI identified persistent elevation of microRNA-124-3p (miR-124) levels in the hippocampus whose numerous gene targets are involved in cognition-associated pathways and neuroendocrine function. This study aimed to investigate the broad effects of miR-124 inhibition in the brain 9 months after completion of a 28-day exposure regimen of PB, DEET (N,N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide), permethrin, and mild stress by profiling the hippocampal expression of genes known to play a critical role in synaptic plasticity, glucocorticoid signaling, and neurogenesis. We determined that intracerebroventricular infusion of a miR-124 antisense oligonucleotide (miR-124 inhibitor; 0.05-0.5 nmol/day/28 days), but not a negative control oligonucleotide, into the lateral ventricle of the brain caused increased protein expression of multiple validated miR-124 targets and increased expression of downstream target genes important for cognition and neuroendocrine signaling in the hippocampus. Off-target cardiotoxic effects were revealed in GWI rats receiving 0.1 nmol/day as indicated by the detection in plasma of 5 highly elevated protein cardiac injury markers and 6 upregulated cardiac-enriched miRNAs in plasma exosomes determined by next-generation sequencing. Results from this study suggest that in vivo inhibition of miR-124 function in the hippocampus is a promising, novel therapeutic approach to improve cognition and neuroendocrine dysfunction in GWI. Additional preclinical studies in animal models to assess feasibility and safety by developing a practical, noninvasive drug delivery system to the brain and exploring potential adverse toxicologic effects of miR-124 inhibition are warranted.",30503814,,10.1016/j.neuro.2018.11.008,5,Neurotoxicology,7905589,4.398,0.4577426314353943,0.31438127090301005,0.3411371237458194,0.40574925779100246
"Synaptic Plasticity, Dementia and Alzheimer Disease","Neuroplasticity is not only shaped by learning and memory but is also a mediator of responses to neuron attrition and injury (compensatory plasticity). As an ongoing process it reacts to neuronal cell activity and injury, death, and genesis, which encompasses the modulation of structural and functional processes of axons, dendrites, and synapses. The range of structural elements that comprise plasticity includes long-term potentiation (a cellular correlate of learning and memory), synaptic efficacy and remodelling, synaptogenesis, axonal sprouting and dendritic remodelling, and neurogenesis and recruitment. Degenerative diseases of the human brain continue to pose one of biomedicine's most intractable problems. Research on human neurodegeneration is now moving from descriptive to mechanistic analyses. At the same time, it is increasing apparently that morphological lesions traditionally used by neuropathologists to confirm post-mortem clinical diagnosis might furnish us with an experimentally tractable handle to understand causative pathways. Consider the aging-dependent neurodegenerative disorder Alzheimer's disease (AD) which is characterised at the neuropathological level by deposits of insoluble amyloid Î²-peptide (AÎ²) in extracellular plaques and aggregated tau protein, which is found largely in the intracellular neurofibrillary tangles. We now appreciate that mild cognitive impairment in early AD may be due to synaptic dysfunction caused by accumulation of non-fibrillar, oligomeric AÎ², occurring well in advance of evident widespread synaptic loss and neurodegeneration. Soluble AÎ² oligomers can adversely affect synaptic structure and plasticity at extremely low concentrations, although the molecular substrates by which synaptic memory mechanisms are disrupted remain to be fully elucidated. The dendritic spine constitutes a primary locus of excitatory synaptic transmission in the mammalian central nervous system. These structures protruding from dendritic shafts undergo dynamic changes in number, size and shape in response to variations in hormonal status, developmental stage, and changes in afferent input. It is perhaps not unexpected that loss of spine density may be linked to cognitive and memory impairment in AD, although the underlying mechanism(s) remain uncertain. This article aims to present a critical overview of current knowledge on the bases of synaptic dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases, with a focus on AD, and will cover amyloid- and nonamyloid- driven mechanisms. We will consider also emerging data dealing with potential therapeutic approaches for ameliorating the cognitive and memory deficits associated with these disorders.",28088900,,10.2174/1871527316666170113120853,68,CNS & neurological disorders drug targets,101269155,2.824,0.4535341262817383,0.919732441471572,0.12709030100334448,0.48148502426402623
ceRNA Network Analysis Reveals AP-1 Transcription Factor Components as Potential Biomarkers for Alzheimerâs Disease,"Background:Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease affecting the elderly, characterized by decreased cognitive function. Non-coding RNAs contribute to AD pathogenesis.Objective:To identify potential therapeutic targets for AD, competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks were constructed using the hippocampus of 6-month-old amyloid precursor protein/ presenilin 1 double transgenic (APP/PS1) and wild-type mice.Methods:RNA-seq data (GSE158995), generated from the hippocampus of APP/PS1 and wild-type mice, were analyzed with the limma R package to identify significantly differentially expressed mRNAs and circRNAs (DEMs and DECs, respectively). DEM Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses were performed using Enrichr (https://maayanlab.cloud/Enrichr/). Correlations between DEMs and DECs were determined using the ggcorrplot R package. Main clusters and hub DEMs were selected using the STRING database and Cytoscape software. ceRNA interactions were predicted with the miRTarbase and Starbase tools and constructed with the ggalluvial R package and Cytoscape software. ceRNA networks were validated using the quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blot.Results:198 DEMs and 90 DECs were differentially expressed in APP/PS1 vs. wild-type hippocampus. DEM GO analysis revealed significant enrichment in transcription regulation, which was subdivided into three main clusters: transcription regulation, synaptic plasticity, and protein refolding. Within the transcription regulation cluster, AP-1 transcription factor components serve as hub genes. The mmu_circ_0001787(circGLCE)/miR-339-5p/Junb and mmu_circ_0001899(circFAM120C)/ miR-181a-5p/Egr1 ceRNA networks were established based on qRT-PCR and Western blot analysis.Conclusion:Two AP-1 transcription factor component-related ceRNA networks, circGLCE/miR- 339-5p/Junb and circFAM120C/miR-181a-5p/Egr1, were constructed using a mouse model of AD. These ceRNA networks may contribute to transcription regulation in AD and provide potential biomarkers for AD diagnosis and treatment.",35702791,,10.2174/1567205019666220613142303,3,Current Alzheimer research,101208441,3.04,0.45177996158599854,0.2040133779264214,0.14715719063545152,0.3413020906639737

In particular, this review highlights current knowledge and progress in the field of manufacturing, recovery, isolation, purification, and analysis of these therapeutic oligonucleotides. Finally, the available miRNA delivery systems are reviewed and an analysis is presented in what concerns to the current challenges that have to be addressed to ensure their specificity and efficacy.

Genomics and the future of psychopharmacology: MicroRNAs offer novel therapeutics,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short, noncoding RNAs functioning as regulators of the transcription of protein-coding genes in eukaryotes. During the last two decades, studies on miRNAs indicate that they have potential as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for a wide range of cancers. Research interest in miRNAs has moved to embrace further medical disciplines, including neuropsychiatric disorders, comparing miRNA expression and mRNA targets between patient and control blood samples and postmortem brain tissues, as well as in animal models of neuropsychiatric disorders. This manuscript reviews recent findings on miRNAs implicated in the pathology of mood disorders, schizophrenia, and autism, as well as their diagnostic potential, and their potential as tentative targets for future therapeutics.

Epigenetic mechanisms related to cognitive decline during aging,"Cognitive decline is a hallmark of the aging nervous system, characterized by increasing memory loss and a deterioration of mental capacity, which in turn creates a favorable context for the development of neurodegenerative diseases. One of the most detrimental alterations that occur at the molecular level in the brain during aging is the modification of the epigenetic mechanisms that control gene expression. As a result of these epigenetic-driven changes in the transcriptome most of the functions of the brain including synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory decline with aging. The epigenetic mechanisms altered during aging include DNA methylation, histone modifications, nucleosome remodeling, and microRNA-mediated gene regulation. In this review, we examine the current evidence concerning the changes of epigenetic modifications together with the molecular mechanisms underlying impaired neuronal gene transcription during aging. Herein, we discuss the alterations of DNA methylation pattern that occur in old neurons. We will also describe the most prominent age-related histone posttranslational modifications in the brain since changes in acetylation and methylation of specific lysine residues on H3 and H4 are associated to functional decline in the old. In addition, we discuss the role that changes in the levels of certain miRNAs would play in cognitive decline with aging. Finally, we provide an overview about the mechanisms either extrinsic or intrinsic that would trigger epigenetic changes in the aging brain, and the consequences of these changes, i.e., altered transcriptional profile and reactivation of transposable elements in old brain.",31045277,,10.1002/jnr.24436,32,Journal of neuroscience research,7600111,4.433,0.4493624269962311,0.7859531772575251,0.35785953177257523,0.49837999800375876
MiR-29 coordinates age-dependent plasticity brakes in the adult visual cortex,"Visual cortical circuits show profound plasticity during early life and are later stabilized by molecular ""brakes"" limiting excessive rewiring beyond a critical period. The mechanisms coordinating the expression of these factors during the transition from development to adulthood remain unknown. We found that miR-29a expression in the visual cortex dramatically increases with age, but it is not experience-dependent. Precocious high levels of miR-29a blocked ocular dominance plasticity and caused an early appearance of perineuronal nets. Conversely, inhibition of miR-29a in adult mice using LNA antagomirs activated ocular dominance plasticity, reduced perineuronal nets, and restored their juvenile chemical composition. Activated adult plasticity had the typical functional and proteomic signature of critical period plasticity. Transcriptomic and proteomic studies indicated that miR-29a manipulation regulates the expression of plasticity brakes in specific cortical circuits. These data indicate that miR-29a is a regulator of the plasticity brakes promoting age-dependent stabilization of visual cortical connections.",33026181,PMC7645255,10.15252/embr.202050431,11,EMBO reports,100963049,9.071,0.4462231993675232,0.5217391304347826,0.8060200668896321,0.5332857590853969
Revisiting the miR-200 Family: A Clan of Five Siblings with Essential Roles in Development and Disease,"Over two decades of studies on small noncoding RNA molecules illustrate the significance of microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) in controlling multiple physiological and pathological functions through post-transcriptional and spatiotemporal gene expression. Among the plethora of miRs that are essential during animal embryonic development, in this review, we elaborate the indispensable role of the miR-200 family (comprising miR-200a, -200b, 200c, -141, and -429) in governing the cellular functions associated with epithelial homeostasis, such as epithelial differentiation and neurogenesis. Additionally, in pathological contexts, miR-200 family members are primarily involved in tumor-suppressive roles, including the reversal of the cancer-associated epithelial-mesenchymal transition dedifferentiation process, and are dysregulated during organ fibrosis. Moreover, recent eminent studies have elucidated the crucial roles of miR-200s in the pathophysiology of multiple neurodegenerative diseases and tissue fibrosis. Lastly, we summarize the key studies that have recognized the potential use of miR-200 members as biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of cancers, elaborating the application of these small biomolecules in aiding early cancer detection and intervention.",35740906,PMC9221129,10.3390/biom12060781,5,Biomolecules,101596414,6.064,0.4455898106098175,0.3177257525083612,0.568561872909699,0.44461141144950256
Electroacupuncture Regulates Hippocampal Synaptic Plasticity via miR-134-Mediated LIMK1 Function in Rats with Ischemic Stroke,"MircoRNAs (miRs) have been implicated in learning and memory, by regulating LIM domain kinase (LIMK1) to induce synaptic-dendritic plasticity. The study aimed to investigate whether miRNAs/LIMK1 signaling was involved in electroacupuncture- (EA-) mediated synaptic-dendritic plasticity in a rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion induced cognitive deficit (MICD). Compared to untreatment or non-acupoint-EA treatment, EA at DU20 and DU24 acupoints could shorten escape latency and increase the frequency of crossing platform in Morris water maze test. T2-weighted imaging showed that the MICD rat brain lesions were located in cortex, hippocampus, corpus striatum, and thalamus regions and injured volumes were reduced after EA. Furthermore, we found that the density of dendritic spine and the number of synapses in the hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells were obviously reduced at Day 14 after MICD. However, synaptic-dendritic loss could be rescued after EA. Moreover, the synaptic-dendritic plasticity was associated with increases of the total LIMK1 and phospho-LIMK1 levels in hippocampal CA1 region, wherein EA decreased the expression of miR-134, negatively regulating LIMK1 to enhance synaptic-dendritic plasticity. Therefore, miR-134-mediated LIMK1 was involved in EA-induced hippocampal synaptic plasticity, which served as a contributor to improving learning and memory during the recovery stage of ischemic stroke.",28116173,PMC5237739,10.1155/2017/9545646,28,Neural plasticity,100883417,3.144,0.4441729784011841,0.7725752508361204,0.19732441471571907,0.4604837201510784
Loss of motoneuron-specific microRNA-218 causes systemic neuromuscular failure,"Dysfunction of microRNA (miRNA) metabolism is thought to underlie diseases affecting motoneurons. One miRNA, miR-218, is abundantly and selectively expressed by developing and mature motoneurons. Here we show that mutant mice lacking miR-218 die neonatally and exhibit neuromuscular junction defects, motoneuron hyperexcitability, and progressive motoneuron cell loss, all of which are hallmarks of motoneuron diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and spinal muscular atrophy. Gene profiling reveals that miR-218 modestly represses a cohort of hundreds of genes that are neuronally enriched but are not specific to a single neuron subpopulation. Thus, the set of messenger RNAs targeted by miR-218, designated TARGET(218), defines a neuronal gene network that is selectively tuned down in motoneurons to prevent neuromuscular failure and neurodegeneration.",26680198,PMC4913787,10.1126/science.aad2509,75,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",404511,63.714,0.4405595362186432,0.9331103678929766,0.9966555183946488,0.650288898988711
A review of highly sensitive electrochemical genosensors for microRNA detection: A novel diagnostic platform for neurodegenerative diseases diagnostics,"The significant role of microRNAs in regulating gene expression and in disease tracking has handed the possibility of robust and accurate diagnosis of various diseases. Measurement of these biomarkers has also had a significant impact on the preparation of natural samples. Discovery of miRNAs is a major challenge due to their small size in the real sample and their short length, which is generally measured by complex and expensive methods. Electrochemical nanobiosensors have made significant progress in this field. Due to the delicate nature of nerve tissue repair and the significance of rapid-fire feature of neurodegenerative conditions, these biosensors can be reliably promising. This review presents advances in the field of neurodegenerative diseases diagnostics. At the same time, there are still numerous openings in this field that are a bright prospect for researchers in the rapid-fire opinion of neurological diseases and indeed nerve tissue repair.",36445196,,10.1002/bab.2419,1,Biotechnology and applied biochemistry,8609465,2.724,0.4392662048339844,0.11371237458193979,0.11371237458193979,0.3090446727331665
Discovering novel microRNAs and age-related nonlinear changes in rat brains using deep sequencing,"Elucidating the molecular mechanisms of brain aging remains a significant challenge for biogerontologists. The discovery of gene regulation by microRNAs (miRNAs) has added a new dimension for examining this process; however, the full complement of miRNAs involved in brain aging is still not known. In this study, miRNA profiles of young, adult, and old rats were obtained to evaluate molecular changes during aging. High-throughput deep sequencing revealed 547 known and 171 candidate novel miRNAs that were differentially expressed among groups. Unexpectedly, miRNA expression did not decline progressively with advancing age; moreover, genes targeted by age-associated miRNAs were predicted to be involved in biological processes linked to aging and neurodegenerative diseases.

Role of non-coding RNAs in non-aging-related neurological disorders,"Protein coding sequences represent only 2% of the human genome. Recent advances have demonstrated that a significant portion of the genome is actively transcribed as non-coding RNA molecules. These non-coding RNAs are emerging as key players in the regulation of biological processes, and act as ""fine-tuners"" of gene expression. Neurological disorders are caused by a wide range of genetic mutations, epigenetic and environmental factors, and the exact pathophysiology of many of these conditions is still unknown. It is currently recognized that dysregulations in the expression of non-coding RNAs are present in many neurological disorders and may be relevant in the mechanisms leading to disease. In addition, circulating non-coding RNAs are emerging as potential biomarkers with great potential impact in clinical practice. In this review, we discuss mainly the role of microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs in several neurological disorders, such as epilepsy, Huntington disease, fragile X-associated ataxia, spinocerebellar ataxias, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and pain. In addition, we give information about the conditions where microRNAs have demonstrated to be potential biomarkers such as in epilepsy, pain, and ALS.",29898036,PMC6002137,10.1590/1414-431X20187566,8,Brazilian journal of medical and biological research = Revista brasileira de,8112917,2.904,0.43572142720222473,0.42474916387959866,0.13712374581939799,0.37380743826113416
Exercise as a model to identify microRNAs linked to human cognition: a role for microRNA-409 and microRNA-501,"MicroRNAs have been linked to synaptic plasticity and memory function and are emerging as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for cognitive diseases. Most of these data stem from the analysis of model systems or postmortem tissue from patients which mainly represents an advanced stage of pathology. Due to the in-accessibility of human brain tissue upon experimental manipulation, it is still challenging to identify microRNAs relevant to human cognition, which is however a key step for future translational studies. Here, we employ exercise as an experimental model for memory enhancement in healthy humans with the aim to identify microRNAs linked to memory function. By analyzing the circulating smallRNAome we find a cluster of 18 microRNAs that are highly correlated to cognition. MicroRNA-409-5p and microRNA-501-3p were the most significantly regulated candidates. Functional analysis revealed that the two microRNAs are important for neuronal integrity, synaptic plasticity, and morphology.

Diagnostic and Therapeutic Potential of Exosomal MicroRNAs for Neurodegenerative Diseases,"Neurodegenerative disorders (NDs) are characterized by a gradual loss of neurons and functions that eventually leads to progressive neurological impairment. In view of the heavy burden on the healthcare system, efficient and reliable biomarkers for early diagnosis and therapeutic treatments to reverse the progression of NDs are in urgent need. There has been an increasing interest in using exosomal miRNAs as biomarkers or targeted therapies for neurological diseases recently. In this review, we overviewed the updated studies on exosomal miRNAs as biomarkers and potential therapeutic approaches in NDs, as well as their association with the pathophysiology of this group of disorders, especially Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Huntington's disease (HD). The exosomal miRNAs that are commonly dysregulated across different NDs or are commonly used as therapeutic candidates were also identified and summarized. In summary, the feasibility of exosomal miRNAs as biomarkers and potential targeted therapy for NDs has been verified. However, due to the limitations of existing studies and the discrepancies across different studies, high quality laboratory and clinical investigations are still required.",34054944,PMC8143892,10.1155/2021/8884642,9,Neural plasticity,100883417,3.144,0.4321233332157135,0.47491638795986624,0.20066889632107024,0.3943910567856154
The schizophrenia risk gene product miR-137 alters presynaptic plasticity,"Noncoding variants in the human MIR137 gene locus increase schizophrenia risk with genome-wide significance. However, the functional consequence of these risk alleles is unknown. Here we examined induced human neurons harboring the minor alleles of four disease-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms in MIR137. We observed increased MIR137 levels compared to those in major allele-carrying cells. microRNA-137 gain of function caused downregulation of the presynaptic target genes complexin-1 (Cplx1), Nsf and synaptotagmin-1 (Syt1), leading to impaired vesicle release. In vivo, miR-137 gain of function resulted in changes in synaptic vesicle pool distribution, impaired induction of mossy fiber long-term potentiation and deficits in hippocampus-dependent learning and memory. By sequestering endogenous miR-137, we were able to ameliorate the synaptic phenotypes. Moreover, reinstatement of Syt1 expression partially restored synaptic plasticity, demonstrating the importance of Syt1 as a miR-137 target. Our data provide new insight into the mechanism by which miR-137 dysregulation can impair synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus.",26005852,PMC4506960,10.1038/nn.4023,112,Nature neuroscience,9809671,28.771,0.4317638576030731,0.9832775919732442,0.9899665551839465,0.653707143993282

Recent studies have shown that the Wnt pathway plays one of the key roles in the processes of synaptic plasticity and memory formation. In this review there are evidences of the Wnt cascade involvement in the modulation of synaptic efficacy at both pre- and postsynaptic levels.

Peptide KED: Molecular-Genetic Aspects of Neurogenesis Regulation in Alzheimer's Disease,"Neuroprotective peptides are promising candidate molecules for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Oral application of KED (Lys-Glu-Asp) improved memory and attention in elderly individuals with functional CNS disorders. Peptide KED also restores synaptic plasticity in in vitro model of AD. This review is focused on the analysis of the influence of KED peptide on the expression of genes and synthesis of proteins regulating apoptosis, aging, neurogenesis, and involved in AD pathogenesis. Analysis of published reports and our experimental findings suggests that KED regulates the expression of genes of cell aging and apoptosis (Ñ16, Ñ21), genes (NES, GAP43) and proteins (nestin, GAP43) of the neuronal differentiation, and genes involved in AD pathogenesis (SUMO, APOE, and IGF1).

Mir-132/212 is required for maturation of binocular matching of orientation preference and depth perception,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are known to mediate post-transcriptional gene regulation, but their role in postnatal brain development is still poorly explored. We show that the expression of many miRNAs is dramatically regulated during functional maturation of the mouse visual cortex with miR-132/212 family being one of the top upregulated miRNAs. Age-downregulated transcripts are significantly enriched in miR-132/miR-212 putative targets and in genes upregulated in miR-132/212 null mice. At a functional level, miR-132/212 deletion affects development of receptive fields of cortical neurons determining a specific impairment of binocular matching of orientation preference, but leaving orientation and direction selectivity unaltered. This deficit is associated with reduced depth perception in the visual cliff test. Deletion of miR-132/212 from forebrain excitatory neurons replicates the binocular matching deficits. Thus, miR-132/212 family shapes the age-dependent transcriptome of the visual cortex during a specific developmental window resulting in maturation of binocular cortical cells and depth perception.",28534484,PMC5457514,10.1038/ncomms15488,22,Nature communications,101528555,17.694,0.42304083704948425,0.705685618729097,0.9632107023411371,0.5876037664437374
Biomarkers of Activity-Dependent Plasticity and Persistent Enhancement of Synaptic Transmission in Alzheimer Disease: A Review of the Current Status,"Alzheimer disease (AD) is a chronic and heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder characterized by complex pathological processes involving neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration, and synaptic dysfunction. Understanding the exact neurobiological mechanisms underlying AD pathology may help to provide a biomarker for early diagnosis or at least for assessment of vulnerability to dementia development. Neural plasticity is defined as a capability of the brain to respond to alterations including aging, injury, or learning, with a crucial role of synaptic elements. Long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) are important in regulating synaptic connections between neural cells in functional plasticity. Synaptic loss and impairment of the brain's plasticity in AD leads to cognitive impairment, and one of important roles of synaptic biomarkers is monitoring synaptic dysfunction, response to treatment, and predicting future development of AD. Synaptic biomarkers are undoubtedly very promising in developing novel approach to AD treatment and control, especially in the era of aging of societies, which is one of the most common risk factor of AD. Implementing a widespread measurement of synaptic biomarkers of AD will probably be crucial in early diagnosis of AD, early therapeutic intervention, monitoring progression of the disease, or response to treatment. One of the most important challenges is finding a biomarker whose blood concentration correlates with its level in the central nervous system (CNS). This review aims to present the current status of biomarkers of activity-dependent plasticity and persistent enhancement of synaptic transmission in Alzheimer disease.",36600577,PMC9832729,10.12659/MSM.938826,3,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and,9609063,3.386,0.41644060611724854,0.20735785953177258,0.22742474916387959,0.3368208854094796
Effects of post-learning REM sleep deprivation on hippocampal plasticity-related genes and microRNA in mice,"Sleep is essential for memory consolidation that stabilizes a memory trace. Memory consolidation includes waves of new gene expression and protein synthesis. Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as critical regulators of memory processes. Previous studies demonstrated that rapid eye movement (REM) sleep deprivation (REM SD) during specific time windows after training in the Morris water maze (MWM) task impairs memory consolidation. Here, we showed that the post-learning REM sleep, extending from 3 to 6 h after last training, is critical for spatial learning in the MWM task. Further, we found that the REM SD after training significantly changes the hippocampal expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA; however, it causes minimal difference in the hippocampal expressions of calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CAMKII) and cAMP response-element-binding (CREB). In addition, it considerably affected the hippocampal expressions of miR-132, miR-182, and miR-124. In conclusion, after the MWM task, the post-learning REM sleep during specific time windows can modulate spatial memory consolidation, and its deprivation can impact the hippocampal transcriptional processes including memory-related miRNAs and mRNAs.",30594545,,10.1016/j.bbr.2018.12.045,12,Behavioural brain research,8004872,3.352,0.4137139916419983,0.5351170568561873,0.22408026755852842,0.40006785986814214
Modulating Effect of Cytokines on Mechanisms of Synaptic Plasticity in the Brain,"After accumulation of data showing that resident brain cells (neurons, astrocytes, and microglia) produce mediators of the immune system, such as cytokines and their receptors under normal physiological conditions, a critical need emerged for investigating the role of these mediators in cognitive processes. The major problem for understanding the functional role of cytokines in the mechanisms of synaptic plasticity, de novo neurogenesis, and learning and memory is the small number of investigated cytokines. Existing concepts are based on data from just three proinflammatory cytokines: interleukin-1 beta, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. The amount of information in the literature on the functional role of antiinflammatory cytokines in the mechanisms of synaptic plasticity and cognitive functions of mature mammalian brain is dismally low. However, they are of principle importance for understanding the mechanisms of local information processing in the brain, since they modulate the activity of individual cells and local neural networks, being able to reconstruct the processes of synaptic plasticity and intercellular communication, in general, depending on the local ratio of the levels of different cytokines in certain areas of the brain. Understanding the functional role of cytokines in cellular mechanisms of information processing and storage in the brain would allow developing preventive and therapeutic means for the treatment of neuropathologies related to impairment of these mechanisms.",28320267,,10.1134/S000629791703004X,39,Biochemistry.

Synapse organizers as molecular codes for synaptic plasticity,"Synapse organizing proteins are multifaceted molecules that coordinate the complex processes of brain development and plasticity at the level of individual synapses. Their importance is demonstrated by the major brain disorders that emerge when their function is compromised. The mechanisms whereby the various families of organizers govern synapses are diverse, but converge on the structure, function, and plasticity of synapses. Therefore, synapse organizers regulate how synapses adapt to ongoing activity, a process central for determining the developmental trajectory of the brain and critical to all forms of cognition. Here, we explore how synapse organizers set the conditions for synaptic plasticity and the associated molecular events, which eventually link to behavioral features of neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders. We also propose central questions on how synapse organizers influence network function through integrating nanoscale and circuit-level organization of the brain.",37652840,,10.1016/j.tins.2023.08.001,4,Trends in neurosciences,7808616,16.978,0.406744122505188,0.2608695652173913,0.9431438127090301,0.4848491490883971
Pervasive compartment-specific regulation of gene expression during homeostatic synaptic scaling,"Synaptic scaling is a form of homeostatic plasticity which allows neurons to adjust their action potential firing rate in response to chronic alterations in neural activity. Synaptic scaling requires profound changes in gene expression, but the relative contribution of local and cell-wide mechanisms is controversial. Here we perform a comprehensive multi-omics characterization of the somatic and process compartments of primary rat hippocampal neurons during synaptic scaling. We uncover both highly compartment-specific and correlating changes in the neuronal transcriptome and proteome. Whereas downregulation of crucial regulators of neuronal excitability occurs primarily in the somatic compartment, structural components of excitatory postsynapses are mostly downregulated in processes. Local inhibition of protein synthesis in processes during scaling is confirmed for candidate synaptic proteins. Motif analysis further suggests an important role for trans-acting post-transcriptional regulators, including RNA-binding proteins and microRNAs, in the local regulation of the corresponding mRNAs. Altogether, our study indicates that, during synaptic scaling, compartmentalized gene expression changes might co-exist with neuron-wide mechanisms to allow synaptic computation and homeostasis.",34396684,PMC8490987,10.15252/embr.202052094,7,EMBO reports,100963049,9.071,0.40221595764160156,0.39464882943143814,0.8093645484949833,0.48213225017024525
MicroRNA-132 is involved in morphine dependence via modifying the structural plasticity of the dentate gyrus neurons in rats,"Repeated morphine exposure has been shown to induce neuronal plasticity in reward-related areas of the brain. miR-132, a CREB-induced and activation-dependent microRNA, has been suggested to be involved in the neuronal plasticity by increasing neuronal dendritic branches and spinogenesis. However, it is still unclear whether miR-132 is related to morphine dependence. Here, we investigate whether miR-132 is involved in morphine dependence and whether it is related to the structural plasticity of the dentate gyrus (DG) neurons. Sprague-Dawley rats are treated with increasing doses of morphine injection for six consecutive days to develop morphine dependence. Our results show that dendritic branching and spinogenesis of the DG neurons of morphine dependent rats are increased. Morphine treatment (24 h) promotes the differentiation of N2a cells stably expressing Î¼-opioid receptor by up-regulating miR-132 expression. Moreover, inhibiting miR-132 3p (but not 5p) of the DG neurons can reverse the structural plasticity and disrupt the formation of morphine dependence in rats. These findings indicate that miR-132 in the DG neurons is involved in morphine dependence via modifying the neuronal plasticity.",34382313,,10.1111/adb.13086,6,Addiction biology,9604935,4.093,0.4007493853569031,0.35451505016722407,0.2909698996655518,0.36954662118069703
An Overview of Mesenchymal Stem Cell-based Therapy Mediated by Noncoding RNAs in the Treatment of Neurodegenerative Diseases,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have become a promising tool for neurorestorative therapy of neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), which are mainly characterized by the progressive and irreversible loss of neuronal structure and function in the central or peripheral nervous system. Recently, studies have reported that genetic manipulation mediated by noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) can increase survival and neural regeneration of transplanted MSCs, offering a new strategy for clinical translation. In this review, we summarize the potential role and regulatory mechanism of two major types of ncRNAs, including microRNAs (miRNAs) and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), during the neurogenesis of MSCs with gene expression profile analyses. We also overview the realization of MSC-based therapy mediated by ncRNAs in the treatment of spinal cord injury, stroke, Alzheimer's disease and peripheral nerve injury. It is expected that ncRNAs will become promising therapeutic targets for NDD on stem cells, while the underlying mechanisms require further exploration.",34347272,,10.1007/s12015-021-10206-x,2,Stem cell reviews and reports,101752767,6.692,0.39992883801460266,0.16387959866220736,0.6555183946488294,0.40383690147096896
IL-33/ST2 Signaling Regulates Synaptic Plasticity and Homeostasis in the Adult Hippocampal Circuitry,"In response to neuronal activity changes, the adult hippocampal circuits undergo continuous synaptic remodeling, which is essential for information processing, learning, and memory encoding. Glial cells, including astrocytes and microglia, actively regulate hippocampal synaptic plasticity by coordinating the neuronal activity-induced synaptic changes at the circuit level. Emerging evidence suggests that the crosstalk between neurons and glia in the adult hippocampus is region specific and that the mechanisms controlling this process are critically dependent on secreted factors. Interleukin-33 (IL-33), a cytokine of the IL-1 family, is a key factor that modulates such glia-driven neuromodulations in two distinct hippocampal circuits. The activation of IL-33 and its receptor complex is important for maintaining the excitatory synaptic activity in the cornu ammonis 1 subregion and the remodeling of dentate gyrus synapses through activity-dependent astrocyte-synapse and microglia-synapse interactions, respectively. Meanwhile, the dysregulation of this signaling is implicated in multiple neurological disorders, especially Alzheimer's disease. Further investigations of how IL-33/ST2 signaling is regulated in a region-specific manner as well as its diverse functions in glia-synapse communications in the adult hippocampal circuitry will provide insights into the nature of hippocampal synaptic plasticity and homeostasis in health and disease.",34297618,,10.1089/dna.2021.0491,2,DNA and cell biology,9004522,3.55,0.39858201146125793,0.16722408026755853,0.23411371237458195,0.3194167654051828
Far from the nuclear crowd: Cytoplasmic lncRNA and their implications in synaptic plasticity and memory,"A striking proportion of long non-coding RNAs are expressed specifically in the mammalian brain. Advances in genome-wide sequencing detected widespread diversity in neuronal lncRNAs based on their expression pattern, localization and function. A growing body of literature proposes that localization of lncRNAs is a critical determinant of their function. A rising number of recent findings documented distinct cytoplasmic functions of lncRNAs that are linked to activity-induced control of synaptic plasticity. However, the comprehensive role of cytoplasmic lncRNAs in neuronal functions is less understood. This review surveys our current understanding of lncRNAs that regulate the cytoplasmic life of mRNAs. We discuss the necessity of subcellular localization of lncRNAs in neuronal dendrites and the impact of their compartmentalized positioning on localized translation at the synapse. We have highlighted how lncRNAs modify a functional compartment to meet the demand for input-specific control of synaptic plasticity and memory.",34547434,,10.1016/j.nlm.2021.107522,5,Neurobiology of learning and memory,9508166,3.109,0.39828944206237793,0.32441471571906355,0.16722408026755853,0.33730142443475114
The enriched environment ameliorates chronic unpredictable mild stress-induced depressive-like behaviors and cognitive impairment by activating the SIRT1/miR-134 signaling pathway in hippocampus,"Background:Chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) is an important risk factor for depression and cognitive deficits in humans. Enriched environment (EE) showed a beneficial effect on depression and cognition by enhancing brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression and synaptic plasticity. However, it is still not clearly understood whether an epigenetic mechanism is involved in the BDNF modulation and synaptic plasticity that occurs after EE treatment for the depressive-like behaviors and cognitive deficits elicited by CUMS. In this study, we investigated the possible mechanism of the neuroprotective effect of EE.Methods:All rats were exposed to the 5-week CUMS procedure except the control group. After CUMS procedure, some rats were stereotaxically injected with SIRT1 pharmacologic inhibitor EX527 or SIRT1 knocking down lentivirus (sh-SIRT1) in the hippocampus followed by EE treatment for 3 weeks. Other rats were directly subjected to EE treatment without stereotaxic injection. Behavioral tests were used to appraise depression and cognition after EE treatment. Then epigenetic molecules, synaptic proteins, dendritic spine density and branches, and synaptic morphology of the dorsal hippocampus were determined.Results:We found that CUMS induced depressive-like behaviors including decreased sucrose preference ratio, prolonged immobility and reduced locomotor and exploratory activity; cognitive deficits including spatial learning and memory impairment; reduced dendritic spine density and number of branches; thinned postsynaptic density; downregulated SIRT1/microRNA-134 pathway, decreased BDNF and synaptic proteins including synaptophysin (SYN) and postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95) expression in the hippocampus. However, the CUMS-induced depressive-like behaviors, cognitive deficits, dendritic spine density and branch number reduction, postsynaptic density thinning, SIRT1/microRNA-134 pathway downregulation, BDNF and synaptic proteins reduction, including synaptophysin (SYN) and postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95), were reversed by EE treatment. However, depressive-like behaviors and cognitive deficits were observed again in rats subjected to stereotaxic injection with EX527 or sh-SIRT1. Furthermore, this study also found that SIRT1/microRNA-134 regulates the downstream molecules BDNF, and the synaptic proteins SYN and PSD95 in primary cultured hippocampal neurons.Conclusions:This study provides evidence for the neuroprotective role of EE on depression and cognitive deficits by activating the SIRT1/microRNA-134 pathway, which accounts for the regulation of synaptic proteins, including BDNF, PSD95 and SYN, dendritic remodeling and ultrastructure changes of synapses in the hippocampus.",30716615,,10.1016/j.jad.2019.01.031,39,Journal of affective disorders,7906073,6.533,0.3965938985347748,0.8394648829431438,0.6454849498327759,0.5349463056760488
Plasma MicroRNA as a novel diagnostic,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, single-stranded, endogenous, non-coding RNAs necessary for proper gene expression. Their mechanism of action controls translation by base-pairing with target messenger RNA (mRNAs) thus leading to translation blockage or mRNA degradation. Many studies have shown that miRNAs play pivotal roles in cancer, cardiovascular disease and neurodegenerative disorders. The lack of blood-derived biomarkers and those markers of poor specificity and sensitivity significantly impact the ability to diagnose in general and at early disease stage specifically. As such, new, non-invasive and quantifiable biomarkers are needed. As post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression, miRNAs have been confirmed to be notably stable in cells, tissues and body fluids. These and other advantages make miRNAs ideal candidates as potential biomarkers and early experimental findings support this finding. This review examines the use of miRNAs as biomarkers in cancer, neurodegenerative, cardiovascular and liver disease and viral infection.",31499022,,10.1016/j.cca.2019.09.005,25,Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry,1302422,6.314,0.39647698402404785,0.7424749163879598,0.6321070234113713,0.5128025783742949
Extracellular vesicles--Their role in the packaging and spread of misfolded proteins associated with neurodegenerative diseases,"Many cell types, including neurons, are known to release small membranous vesicles known as exosomes. In addition to their protein content these vesicles have recently been shown to contain messenger RNA (mRNA) and micro RNA (miRNA) species. Roles for these vesicles include cell-cell signalling, removal of unwanted proteins, and transfer of pathogens (including prion-like misfolded proteins) between cells, such as infectious prions. Prions are the infectious particles that are responsible for transmissible neurodegenerative diseases such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) of humans or bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) of cattle. Exosomes are also involved in processing the amyloid precursor protein (APP), which is associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). As exosomes can be isolated from circulating fluids such as serum, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), they provide a potential source of biomarkers for neurological conditions. Here, we review the roles these vesicles play in neurodegenerative disease and highlight their potential in diagnosing these disorders through analysis of their RNA content.",25704308,,10.1016/j.semcdb.2015.02.007,115,Seminars in cell & developmental biology,9607332,7.499,0.39350154995918274,0.9866220735785953,0.7190635451505016,0.5772380537213291
"Extracellular Vesicles, Stem Cells and the Role of miRNAs in Neurodegeneration","There are different modalities of intercellular communication governed by cellular homeostasis. In this review, we will explore one of these forms of communication called extracellular vesicles (EVs). These vesicles are released by all cells in the body and are heterogeneous in nature. The primary function of EVs is to share information through their cargo consisting of proteins, lipids and nucleic acids (mRNA, miRNA, dsDNA etc.) with other cells, which have a direct consequence on their microenvironment. We will focus on the role of EVs of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in the nervous system and how these participate in intercellular communication to maintain physiological function and provide neuroprotection. However, deregulation of this same communication system could play a role in several neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, prion disease and Huntington's disease. The release of EVs from a cell provides crucial information to what is happening inside the cell and thus could be used in diagnostics and therapy. We will discuss and explore new avenues for the clinical applications of using engineered MSC-EVs and their potential therapeutic benefit in treating neurodegenerative diseases.",34414870,PMC9881087,10.2174/1570159X19666210817150141,4,Current neuropharmacology,101157239,7.708,0.3905920386314392,0.26421404682274247,0.7725752508361204,0.44171308271063614
Regulation of miR-128 in the nucleus accumbens affects methamphetamine-induced behavioral sensitization by modulating proteins involved in neuroplasticity,"Methamphetamine (METH) -induced behavioral sensitization depends on long-term neuroplasticity in the mesolimbic dopamine system, especially in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). miR-128, a brain enriched miRNA, was found to have abilities in regulating neuronal excitability and formation of fear-extinction memory. Here, we aim to identify the role of miR-128 on METH-induced locomotor sensitization of male mice. We identified a significant increase of miR-128 in the NAc of mice upon repeated-intermittent METH exposure but not acute METH administration. Microinjection of adeno-associated virus (AAV)-miR-128 over-expression and inhibition constructs into the NAc of mice resulted in enhanced METH-induced locomotor sensitization and attenuated effects of METH respectively. Isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) technology and ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) were carried out to uncover the potential molecular mechanisms underlying miR-128-regulated METH sensitization. Differentially expressed proteins, including 25 potential targets for miR-128 were annotated in regulatory pathways that modulate dendritic spines, synaptic transmission and neuritogenesis. Of which, Arf6, Cpeb3 and Nlgn1, were found to be participating in miR-128-regulated METH sensitization. Consistently, METH-induced abnormal changes of Arf6, Cpeb3 and Nlgn1 in the NAc of mice were also detected by qPCR and validated by western blot analysis. Thus, miR-128 may contribute to METH sensitization through controlling neuroplasticity. Our study suggested miR-128 was an important regulator of METH- induced sensitization and also provided the potential molecular networks of miR-128 in regulating METH-induced sensitization.",32058631,,10.1111/adb.12881,13,Addiction biology,9604935,4.093,0.38803812861442566,0.5418060200668896,0.29431438127090304,0.4000469574362139
"Competing Endogenous RNAs, Non-Coding RNAs and Diseases: An Intertwined Story","MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a class of small non-coding RNA molecules, are responsible for RNA silencing and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. They can mediate a fine-tuned crosstalk among coding and non-coding RNA molecules sharing miRNA response elements (MREs). In a suitable environment, both coding and non-coding RNA molecules can be targeted by the same miRNAs and can indirectly regulate each other by competing for them. These RNAs, otherwise known as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs), lead to an additional post-transcriptional regulatory layer, where non-coding RNAs can find new significance. The miRNA-mediated interplay among different types of RNA molecules has been observed in many different contexts. The analyses of ceRNA networks in cancer and other pathologies, as well as in other physiological conditions, provide new opportunities for interpretingomicsdata for the field of personalized medicine. The development of novel computational tools, providing putative predictions of ceRNA interactions, is a rapidly growing field of interest. In this review, I discuss and present the current knowledge of the ceRNA mechanism and its implications in a broad spectrum of different pathologies, such as cardiovascular or autoimmune diseases, cancers and neurodegenerative disorders.",32605220,PMC7407898,10.3390/cells9071574,64,Cells,101600052,7.666,0.3854903280735016,0.9130434782608695,0.7658862876254181,0.5670801500213585
Circulating MicroRNA as Potential Source for Neurodegenerative Diseases Biomarkers,"An increasing number of circulating micro-ribonucleic acids (microRNAs, miRNAs) have been discovered its potential as biomarkers to diagnose neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) by many researchers. However, there were obvious inconsistencies among previous studies, and thus we performed this meta-analysis to evaluate whether miRNA is an effective biomarker with high accuracy to diagnose the NDs. PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and other related databases were used to search eligible articles. The data of sensitivity and specificity were employed to plot the summary receiver operator characteristic (SROC) curve and calculate the area under the SROC curve (AUC). I (2) test were used to estimate the heterogeneity among different studies. In addition, the possible sources of heterogeneity were further explored by subgroup analyses and meta-regression. All analyses were performed by STATA 12.0 software. In this meta-analysis, eight publications with 459 NDs patients and 340 healthy controls were included to investigate the diagnostic performance of circulating miRNAs for NDs. The overall sensitivity and specificity, positive likelihood ratio (PLR), negative likelihood ration (NLR), and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) were 0.83 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.77-0.88), 0.87 (95% CI 0.83-0.89), 6.2 (95% CI 4.9-7.9), 0.19 (95% CI 0.14-0.27), 33 (95% CI 20-52), and 0.91 (95% CI: 0.88-0.93), respectively. The overall SROC curve was plotted with AUC of 0.91 (95% CI 0.88-0.93), which indicated an excellent diagnostic performance of circulating miRNA for NDs. Subgroup analysis based on miRNA profile demonstrated that multiple-miRNA assay had higher diagnostic accuracy for NDs when compared with single-miRNA assay. In conclusion, the circulating miRNAs may be the potential biomarkers in the clinical diagnosis of NDs, and the diagnostic accuracy would be better by using multiple-miRNA assay. However, large-scale studies are still needed to explore the relation between the circulating miRNA dysregulation and the pathological mechanism of NDs.",25367880,,10.1007/s12035-014-8944-x,7,Molecular neurobiology,8900963,5.682,0.38375675678253174,0.3979933110367893,0.5484949832775919,0.4195517129323953
Mechanisms of microglia-mediated synapse turnover and synaptogenesis,"Microglia shape synaptic connections among neurons of the central nervous system (CNS) during development and adulthood. In this review, the actions by which they facilitate pruning, refinement, and new synaptic development throughout the lifespan are considered, along with the molecular mechanisms by which neurons and microglia communicate to guide these actions. Microglia survey neuronal activity and selectively modify synaptic connections at the level of individual dendrites and synapses. This is important given that microglia are necessary for a healthy nervous system capable of learning and other neural phenomena based on synaptic modifications and can also cause pathological synaptic disfunctions in immunologically driven neurodegenerative diseases. Understanding how microglia directly shape synaptic connections between neurons yields a more complete understanding of normal neuroplasticity and provides new routes for understanding disease states.",35940391,,10.1016/j.pneurobio.2022.102336,7,Progress in neurobiology,370121,10.885,0.3830641508102417,0.4013377926421405,0.8528428093645485,0.48067461088748276
Heightened Hippocampal Î²-Adrenergic Receptor Function Drives Synaptic Potentiation and Supports Learning and Memory in the TgF344-AD Rat Model during Prodromal Alzheimer's Disease,"The central noradrenergic (NA) system is critical for the maintenance of attention, behavioral flexibility, spatial navigation, and learning and memory, those cognitive functions lost first in early Alzheimer's disease (AD). In fact, the locus coeruleus (LC), the sole source of norepinephrine (NE) for >90% of the brain, is the first site of pathologic tau accumulation in human AD with axon loss throughout forebrain, including hippocampus. The dentate gyrus is heavily innervated by LC-NA axons, where released NE acts on Î²-adrenergic receptors (ARs) at excitatory synapses from entorhinal cortex to facilitate long-term synaptic plasticity and memory formation. These synapses experience dysfunction in early AD before cognitive impairment. In the TgF344-AD rat model of AD, degeneration of LC-NA axons in hippocampus recapitulates human AD, providing a preclinical model to investigate synaptic and behavioral consequences. Using immunohistochemistry, Western blot analysis, and brain slice electrophysiology in 6- to 9-month-old wild-type and TgF344-AD rats, we discovered that the loss of LC-NA axons coincides with the heightened Î²-AR function at medial perforant path-dentate granule cell synapses that is responsible for the increase in LTP magnitude at these synapses. Furthermore, novel object recognition is facilitated in TgF344-AD rats that requires Î²-ARs, and pharmacological blockade of Î²-ARs unmasks a deficit in extinction learning only in TgF344-AD rats, indicating a greater reliance on Î²-ARs in both behaviors. Thus, a compensatory increase in Î²-AR function during prodromal AD in TgF344-AD rats heightens synaptic plasticity and preserves some forms of learning and memory.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe locus coeruleus (LC), a brain region located in the brainstem which is responsible for attention and arousal, is damaged first by Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. The LC sends axons to hippocampus where released norepinephrine (NE) modulates synaptic function required for learning and memory. How degeneration of LC axons and loss of NE in hippocampus in early AD impacts synaptic function and learning and memory is not well understood despite the importance of LC in cognitive function. We used a transgenic AD rat model with LC axon degeneration mimicking human AD and found that heightened function of Î²-adrenergic receptors in the dentate gyrus increased synaptic plasticity and preserved learning and memory in early stages of the disease.",33952633,PMC8244969,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0119-21.2021,23,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for,8102140,6.709,0.38202613592147827,0.7157190635451505,0.6622073578595318,0.5048009658338234
"Nrf2 improves hippocampal synaptic plasticity, learning and memory through the circ-Vps41/miR-26a-5p/CaMKIV regulatory network","Antioxidant response transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2/Nfe2l2) is a neuroprotective agent in learning and memory impairment. This study provides a new perspective to explore the regulatory mechanisms of Nrf2. Here, we found that Nrf2 regulated circular RNA circ-Vps41 to increase hippocampal synaptic plasticity; Nrf2 bound the Vps41 promoter to activate transcription of the Vps41 gene and promote expression of circ-Vps41; circ-Vps41 positively correlated with Nrf2, synaptic plasticity, and learning and memory but negatively correlated with reactive oxygen species; and Nrf2 promoted CaMKIV expression by increasing levels of circ-Vps41, which can absorb miR-26a-5p that targets CaMKIV. Our findings revealed a new circRNA-based regulatory network regulated by Nrf2 and provided novel insights into the potential mechanism involved in the improvement of learning and memory impairment.",35143833,,10.1016/j.expneurol.2022.113998,6,Experimental neurology,370712,5.62,0.3805287182331085,0.35785953177257523,0.4916387959866221,0.39821689649170455
Early life stress enhances the susceptibility to depression and interferes with neuroplasticity in the hippocampus of adolescent mice via regulating miR-34c-5p/SYT1 axis,"Early life events are major risk factors for the onset of depression and have long-term effects on the neurobiological changes and behavioral development of rodents. However, little is known about the specific mechanisms of early life adversity in the susceptibility to subsequent stress exposure in adolescence. This study characterized the effect of maternal separation (MS), an animal model of early life adversity, on the behavioral responses to restraint stress in mice during adolescence and investigated the molecular mechanism underlying behavioral vulnerability to chronic stress induced by MS. Our results showed that MS exposure could further reinforce the depressive vulnerability to restraint stress in adolescent mice. In addition, miR-34c-5p expression was obviously up-regulated in the hippocampi of MS mice at postnatal day (P) 14 and P42. Further, synaptotagmin-1 (SYT1) was deemed as a target gene candidate of miR-34c-5p on the basis of dual luciferase assay. It was found that the downregulation of miR-34c-5p expression in the hippocampi of MS mice could ameliorate dysfunction of synaptic plasticity by targeting molecule SYT1, effects which were accompanied by alleviation of depressive and anxious behaviors in these mice. The results demonstrated that the miR-34c-5p/SYT1 pathway was involved in the susceptibility to depression induced by MS via regulating neuroplasticity in the hippocampi of mice.",38181539,,10.1016/j.jpsychires.2023.12.030,0,Journal of psychiatric research,376331,5.25,0.37926343083381653,0.046822742474916385,0.46153846153846156,0.32923029930296555
NMDARs in prefrontal cortex - Regulation of synaptic transmission and plasticity,"In this review we consider the various roles played by N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) located on pyramidal neurones in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). We focus on recent data from our lab that has investigated how NMDARs contribute to ongoing synaptic transmission in a frequency dependent manner, the plasticity of NMDARs and how this impacts their contribution to synaptic transmission, and finally consider how NMDARs contribute to plasticity induced by synchronous activation of two separate inputs to mPFC.",34022178,,10.1016/j.neuropharm.2021.108614,2,Neuropharmacology,236217,5.273,0.3788611888885498,0.1705685618729097,0.47157190635451507,0.3557448069786148
Presenilins regulate synaptic plasticity and mitochondrial calcium homeostasis in the hippocampal mossy fiber pathway,"Background:Presenilins play a major role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, in which the hippocampus is particularly vulnerable. Previous studies of Presenilin function in the synapse, however, focused exclusively on the hippocampal Schaffer collateral (SC) pathway. Whether Presenilins play similar or distinct roles in other hippocampal synapses is unknown.Methods:To investigate the role of Presenilins at mossy fiber (MF) synapses we performed field and whole-cell electrophysiological recordings and Ca2+imaging using acute hippocampal slices of postnatal forebrain-restricted Presenilin conditional double knockout (PS cDKO) and control mice at 2 months of age. We also performed quantitative electron microscopy (EM) analysis to determine whether mitochondrial content is affected at presynaptic MF boutons of PS cDKO mice. We further conducted behavioral analysis to assess spatial learning and memory of PS cDKO and control mice at 2 months in the Morris water maze.Results:We found that long-term potentiation and short-term plasticity, such as paired-pulse and frequency facilitation, are impaired at MF synapses of PS cDKO mice. Moreover, post-tetanic potentiation (PTP), another form of short-term plasticity, is also impaired at MF synapses of PS cDKO mice. Furthermore, blockade of mitochondrial Ca2+efflux mimics and occludes the PTP deficits at MF synapses of PS cDKO mice, suggesting that mitochondrial Ca2+homeostasis is impaired in the absence of PS. Quantitative EM analysis showed normal number and area of mitochondria at presynaptic MF boutons of PS cDKO mice, indicating unchanged mitochondrial content. Ca2+imaging of dentate gyrus granule neurons further revealed that cytosolic Ca2+increases induced by tetanic stimulation are reduced in PS cDKO granule neurons in acute hippocampal slices, and that inhibition of mitochondrial Ca2+release during high frequency stimulation mimics and occludes the Ca2+defects observed in PS cDKO neurons. Consistent with synaptic plasticity impairment observed at MF and SC synapses in acute PS cDKO hippocampal slices, PS cDKO mice exhibit profound spatial learning and memory deficits in the Morris water maze.Conclusions:Our findings demonstrate the importance of PS in the regulation of synaptic plasticity and mitochondrial Ca2+homeostasis in the hippocampal MF pathway.",28619096,PMC5472971,10.1186/s13024-017-0189-5,15,Molecular neurodegeneration,101266600,18.879,0.37536293268203735,0.5919732441471572,0.9765886287625418,0.5389301341911622

This paper reviews ""Yin/Yang"" features of neurotrophic factors in the anabolism, receptor regulation, functional aspects, and their related role in pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases.

Circular RNAs: the Emerging Class of Non-coding RNAs and Their Potential Role in Human Neurodegenerative Diseases,"The exciting world of research with RNAs has to its credit some breakthrough findings that led to newer insights on multiple problems including that of human diseases. After the advent of siRNA, microRNA, and lncRNA, exciting novel molecules called circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been recently described. circRNAs are a class of non-coding RNAs, which are produced by scrambling of exons at the time of splicing. They are primarily produced in the brain region and are naturally present inside the cell. The best known ones so far include a particular type of circRNA namely ""circular RNA sponge for miR-7"" (ciRS-7 and CDR1as) which is the inhibitor of miR-7 microRNA-known to regulate various diseases like, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, diabetes, and atherosclerosis. Similarly, another circRNA molecule called circmbl modulates the ratio of linear mRNA by competing with linear muscleblind gene through which it is synthesized. Considering the complex association of these molecules with critical microRNAs and gene families, circRNAs might have important roles in the cause and progression of human diseases. In particular, the multi-factorial nature of neurodegenerative diseases does warrant studies employing novel approaches towards identifying underlying root causes of these ailments. The non-coding RNAs, like circRNAs and microRNAs, could well present a common genetic trigger to multiple factors associated with neurodegenerative diseases. A specific fingerprint of a combination of various marker circRNAs could be explored for early diagnostic purpose as well. Herein, we review the possibility of exploring the role of circRNAs in the context of the central nervous system (CNS) and age-associated neurodegenerative diseases.",27796758,,10.1007/s12035-016-0213-8,87,Molecular neurobiology,8900963,5.682,0.37170660495758057,0.9498327759197325,0.5518394648829431,0.5233584111350835
Circular RNAs in Brain Physiology and Disease,"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are endogenously expressed non-coding RNAs discovered in the early 1990s as a transcriptional by-product of little importance. It was only recently that they were identified as a key player in regulating the gene expression by targeting and modulating the functions of microRNA, a process known as microRNA sponging. They are distributed throughout the system in a tissue-specific manner showing abundant enrichment in neuronal tissue. Their physiological functions in the brain such as neuronal maturation, differentiation, etc. as well as their implications in numerous brain-related disorders have made its entry into the spotlight. Yet the wider scope and molecular mechanism of circRNAs still remain elusive. In this chapter, we describe in detail the functional aspects and importance of circRNAs in the human brain and how it is associated with various neurological diseases.",30259370,,10.1007/978-981-13-1426-1_18,6,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,121103,3.65,0.3701115548610687,0.3612040133779264,0.25752508361204013,0.34581275231463454
MicroRNA super-resolution imaging in blood for Alzheimer's disease,"We propose a novel blood biomarker detection method that uses miRNA super-resolution imaging to enable the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we report a singlemolecule detection method for visualizing disease-specific miRNA in tissue from an AD mice model, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from AD patients. Using optimized Magnified Analysis of Proteome (MAPs), we confirmed that five miRNAs contribute to neurodegenerative disease in the brain hippocampi of 5XFAD and wild-type mice. We also assessed PBMCs isolated from the whole blood of AD patients and a healthy control group, and subsequently analyzed those samples using miRNA super-resolution imaging. We detected more miR-200a-3p expression in the cornu ammonis 1 and dentate gyrus regions of 3 month-old 5XFAD mice than in wild-type mice. Additionally, miRNA super-resolution imaging of blood provides AD diagnosis platform for studying miRNA regulation inside cells at the single molecule level.

Computational insights into mRNA and protein dynamics underlying synaptic plasticity rules,"Recent advances in experimental techniques provide an unprecedented peek into the intricate molecular dynamics inside synapses and dendrites. The experimental insights into the molecular turnover revealed that such processes as diffusion, active transport, spine uptake, and local protein synthesis could dynamically modulate the copy numbers of plasticity-related molecules in synapses. Subsequently, theoretical models were designed to understand the interaction of these processes better and to explain how local synaptic plasticity cues can up or down-regulate the molecular copy numbers across synapses. In this review, we discuss the recent advances in experimental techniques and computational models to highlight how these complementary approaches can provide insight into molecular cross-talk across synapses, ultimately allowing us to develop biologically-inspired neural network models to understand brain function.",36963534,PMC10274545,10.1016/j.mcn.2023.103846,0,Molecular and cellular neurosciences,9100095,4.626,0.36274343729019165,0.05351170568561873,0.3712374581939799,0.3025958951500347
RNA granules in neuronal plasticity and disease,"RNA granules are dynamic entities controlling the spatiotemporal distribution and translation of RNA molecules. In neurons, a variety of RNA granules exist both in the soma and in cellular processes. They contain transcripts encoding signaling and synaptic proteins as well as RNA-binding proteins causally linked to several neurological disorders. In this review, we highlight that neuronal RNA granules exhibit properties of biomolecular condensates that are regulated upon maturation and physiological aging and how they are reversibly remodeled in response to neuronal activity to control local protein synthesis and ultimately synaptic plasticity. Moreover, we propose a framework of how neuronal RNA granules mature over time in healthy conditions and how they transition into pathological inclusions in the context of late-onset neurodegenerative diseases.",37202301,,10.1016/j.tins.2023.04.004,4,Trends in neurosciences,7808616,16.978,0.3608268201351166,0.26755852842809363,0.9464882943143813,0.4593054566295649
Minireview: Food for thought: regulation of synaptic function by metabolic hormones,"The peripheral actions of the metabolic hormones, leptin and insulin, are well documented. However, the functions of these hormones are not restricted to the periphery because evidence is growing that both leptin and insulin can readily cross the blood-brain barrier and have widespread central actions. The hippocampus in particular expresses high levels of both insulin and leptin receptors as well as key components of their associated signaling cascades. Moreover, recent studies indicate that both hormones are potential cognitive enhancers. Indeed, it has been demonstrated that both leptin and insulin markedly influence key cellular events that underlie hippocampal learning and memory including activity-dependent synaptic plasticity and the trafficking of glutamate receptors to and away from hippocampal synapses. The hippocampal formation is also a prime site for the neurodegenerative processes that occur during Alzheimer's disease, and impairments in either leptin or insulin function have been linked to central nervous system-driven diseases like Alzheimer's disease. Thus, the capacity of the metabolic hormones, leptin and insulin, to regulate hippocampal synaptic function has significant implications for normal brain function and also central nervous system-driven disease.",25470238,PMC5414767,10.1210/me.2014-1328,14,"Molecular endocrinology (Baltimore, Md.)",8801431,0.0,0.36060163378715515,0.5652173913043478,0.04013377926421405,0.33743121438600543
Beta-amyloid pore linked to controlled calcium influx into the cell: A new paradigm for Alzheimer's Disease,"Despite tremendous worldwide efforts, clinical trials assessing Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related therapeutics have been relentlessly unsuccessful. Hence, there is an urgent need to challenge old hypotheses with novel paradigms. An emerging concept is that the amyloid-beta (AÎ²) peptide, which was until recently deemed a major player in the cause of AD, may instead modulate synaptic plasticity and protect against excitotoxicity. The link between AÎ²-mediated synaptic plasticity and AÎ² trafficking is central for understanding AD pathogenesis and remains a perplexing relationship. The crossover between AÎ² pathological and physiological roles is subtle and remains controversial. Based on existing literature, as a signaling molecule, AÎ² is proposed to modulate its own turnover and synaptic plasticity through what is currently believed to be the cause of AD: the transient formation of pore-like oligomers. A change of perspective regarding how AÎ² pores exert a protective function will unavoidably revolutionize the entire field of anti-amyloid drug development.",34051062,PMC9290490,10.1002/alz.12373,9,Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association,101231978,16.655,0.3603765070438385,0.4782608695652174,0.9364548494983278,0.4991690480390121
Regulation of AMPAR trafficking in synaptic plasticity by BDNF and the impact of neurodegenerative disease,"Research demonstrates that the neural mechanisms underlying synaptic plasticity and learning and memory involve mobilization of AMPA-type neurotransmitter receptors at glutamatergic synaptic contacts, and that these mechanisms are targeted during neurodegenerative disease. Strengthening neural transmission occurs with insertion of Î±-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs) into synapses while weakening results from receptor withdrawal. A key player in the trafficking of AMPARs during plasticity and learning is the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling system. BDNF is a neurotrophic factor that supports neuronal growth and is required for learning and memory. Significantly, a primary feature of many neurodegenerative diseases is a reduction in BDNF protein as well as disrupted neuronal surface expression of synaptic AMPARs. The resulting weakening of synaptic contacts leads to synapse loss and neuronal degeneration that underlies the cognitive impairment and dementia observed in patients with progressive neurodegenerative disease such as Alzheimer's. In the face of these data, one therapeutic approach is to increase BDNF bioavailability in brain. While this has been met with significant challenges, the results of the research have been promising. In spite of this, there are currently no clinical trials to test many of these findings on patients. Here, research showing that BDNF drives AMPARs to synapses, AMPAR trafficking is essential for synaptic plasticity and learning, and that neurodegenerative disease results in a significant decline in BDNF will be reviewed. The aim is to draw attention to the need for increasing patient-directed clinical studies to test the possible benefits of increasing levels of neurotrophins, specifically BDNF, to treat brain disorders. Much is known about the cellular mechanisms that underlie learning and memory in brain. It can be concluded that signaling by neurotrophins like BDNF and AMPA-type glutamate receptor synaptic trafficking are fundamental to these processes. Data from animal models and patients reveal that these mechanisms are adversely targeted during neurodegenerative disease and results in memory loss and cognitive decline. A brief summary of our understanding of these mechanisms indicates that it is time to apply this knowledge base directly to development of therapeutic treatments that enhance neurotrophins for brain disorders in patient populations.",35128708,,10.1002/jnr.25022,17,Journal of neuroscience research,7600111,4.433,0.35711899399757385,0.6120401337792643,0.3612040133779264,0.40892022582998244
Up-regulated spinal microRNAs induce aggregation of superoxide dismutase 1 protein in canine degenerative myelopathy,"Canine degenerative myelopathy (DM) is a fatal progressive neurodegenerative disease. Mutations in the superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) gene have been shown to be the major risk factor for DM, and it is hypothesized that neural degeneration is caused by a ""gain of toxic function"" of mutant SOD1. In this study, the spinal cord microRNA (miRNA) profiles of DM-affected dogs were investigated to elucidate the pathomechanisms of DM. Quantification of 277 miRNAs identified three up-regulated miRNAs and 18 down-regulated miRNAs in the spinal cords of DM-affected dogs. Based on gene ontology analysis, the target cluster of up-regulated miRNAs was associated with protein expression or modification and cellular response, and that of down-regulated miRNAs was associated with tissue development. In these clusters, we focused on the mechanism of protein ubiquitination. Polyubiquitination assay demonstrated that canine SOD1 proteins were polyubiquitinated and degraded by proteasomes. Immunohistochemistry of the spinal cords of DM-affected dogs showed that mutant SOD1 aggregations were not ubiquitin immunopositive. Using cultured cells, co-transfection of canine SOD1 and up-regulated miRNA in DM-affected dogs demonstrated that miR-23a, miR-142 and miR-221 significantly increased the proportion of cells with mutant SOD1 aggregation. These results suggested that up-regulated miRNAs in the spinal cords of DM-affected dogs may inhibit ubiquitination of misfolded SOD1 protein and induce mutant SOD1 aggregations, leading to further progression of degenerative processes in the DM pathology.",33261827,,10.1016/j.rvsc.2020.11.018,1,Research in veterinary science,401300,2.554,0.3567827641963959,0.12374581939799331,0.09698996655518395,0.25821681570847294
Metal ions influx is a double edged sword for the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common form of dementia in aged people, which is defined by two pathological characteristics: Î²-amyloid protein (AÎ²) deposition and tau hyperphosphorylation. Although the mechanisms of AD development are still being debated, a series of evidence supports the idea that metals, such as copper, iron, zinc, magnesium and aluminium, are involved in the pathogenesis of the disease. In particular, the processes of AÎ² deposition in senile plaques (SP) and the inclusion of phosphorylated tau in neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) are markedly influenced by alterations in the homeostasis of the aforementioned metal ions. Moreover, the mechanisms of oxidative stress, synaptic plasticity, neurotoxicity, autophagy and apoptosis mediate the effects of metal ions-induced the aggregation state of AÎ² and phosphorylated tau on AD development. More importantly, imbalance of these mechanisms finally caused cognitive decline in different experiment models. Collectively, reconstructing the signaling network that regulates AD progression by metal ions may provide novel insights for developing chelators specific for metal ions to combat AD.",27829171,,10.1016/j.arr.2016.10.003,44,Ageing research reviews,101128963,11.788,0.35398629307746887,0.8528428093645485,0.8929765886287625,0.5615556554451435
CircRNAs in the brain,"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are highly abundant and evolutionarily conserved non-coding RNAs produced by circularization of specific exons. Since their re-discovery as potential regulators of gene expression, thousands of circRNAs were detected in different tissues and cell types across most organisms. Accumulating data suggest key roles for them in the central nervous system. Neuronal-expressed RNAs are diverted to yield highly enriched CircRNAs in human, mouse, pig and flies, with many of them enriched in neuronal tissues. CircRNA levels are dynamically modulated in neurons, both during differentiation and following bursts of electrical activity, and accumulate with age, and many of them are enriched in synapses. Together, available data suggest that circRNAs have important roles in synaptic plasticity and neuronal function.

Synaptic plasticity in Alzheimer's disease and healthy aging,"The strength and efficiency of synaptic connections are affected by the environment or the experience of the individual. This property, called synaptic plasticity, is directly related to memory and learning processes and has been modeled at the cellular level. These types of cellular memory and learning models include specific stimulation protocols that generate a long-term strengthening of the synapses, called long-term potentiation, or a weakening of the said long-term synapses, called long-term depression. Although, for decades, researchers have believed that the main cause of the cognitive deficit that characterizes Alzheimer's disease (AD) and aging was the loss of neurons, the hypothesis of an imbalance in the cellular and molecular mechanisms of synaptic plasticity underlying this deficit is currently widely accepted. An understanding of the molecular and cellular changes underlying the process of synaptic plasticity during the development of AD and aging will direct future studies to specific targets, resulting in the development of much more efficient and specific therapeutic strategies. In this review, we classify, discuss, and describe the main findings related to changes in the neurophysiological mechanisms of synaptic plasticity in excitatory synapses underlying AD and aging. In addition, we suggest possible mechanisms in which aging can become a high-risk factor for the development of AD and how its development could be prevented or slowed.",32250284,,10.1515/revneuro-2019-0058,33,Reviews in the neurosciences,8711016,4.703,0.35253605246543884,0.7959866220735786,0.38127090301003347,0.44697313649598575
Glia and TRPM2 Channels in Plasticity of Central Nervous System and Alzheimer's Diseases,"Synaptic plasticity refers to the ability of neurons to strengthen or weaken synaptic efficacy in response to activity and is the basis for learning and memory. Glial cells communicate with neurons and in this way contribute in part to plasticity in the CNS and to the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disease in which impaired synaptic plasticity is causally implicated. The transient receptor potential melastatin member 2 (TRPM2) channel is a nonselective Ca(2+)-permeable channel expressed in both glial cells (microglia and astrocytes) and neurons. Recent studies indicated that TRPM2 regulates synaptic plasticity as well as the activation of glial cells. TRPM2 also modulates oxidative stress and inflammation through interaction with glial cells. As both oxidative stress and inflammation have been implicated in AD pathology, this suggests a possible contribution of TRPM2 to disease processes. Through modulating the homeostasis of glutathione, TRPM2 is involved in the process of aging which is a risk factor of AD. These results potentially point TRPM2 channel to be involved in AD through glial cells.

Uniting homeostatic plasticity and exosome biology: A revision of the conceptual framework for drug discovery in neurodegenerative diseases?,"Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) are in need of new drug discovery approaches. Our previous systematic analyses of Huntington's Disease (HD) literature for protein-protein interactors (PPIs) and modifiers of mutant Huntingtin-driven phenotypes revealed enrichment for PPIs of genes required for homeostatic synaptic plasticity (HSP) and exosome (EV) function and exosomal proteins, which in turn highly overlapped each other and with PPIs of genes associated with other NDDs. We proposed that HSP and EVs are linked to each other and are also involved in NDD pathophysiology. Recent studies showed that HSP is indeed altered in HD and AD, and that presynaptic homeostatic plasticity in motoneurons compensates for ALS pathology. Eliminating it causes earlier degeneration and death. If this holds true in other NDDs, drug discovery in animal models should then include elucidation of homeostatic compensation that either masks phenotypes of physiologically expressed mutant genes or are overridden by their overexpression. In this new conceptual framework, enhancing such underlying homeostatic compensation forms the basis for novel therapeutic strategies to slow progression of NDDs. Moreover, if EVs are linked to HSP, then their ability to penetrate the brain, target cell types, deliver miRNA and other molecules can be leveraged to develop attractive drug modalities. Testing this new framework is posed as four questions on model development and mechanistic studies progressing from higher throughput platforms to mouse models. Similar approaches may apply to other CNS disorders including schizophrenia, autism, Rett and Fragile X syndromes due to potential links of their susceptibility genes to HSP and EVs.",33706937,,10.1016/bs.apha.2020.10.002,0,"Advances in pharmacology (San Diego, Calif.)",9015397,0.0,0.3510885536670685,0.056856187290969896,0.043478260869565216,0.2307200218323481
Understanding Alzheimer's disease by global quantification of protein phosphorylation and sialylated N-linked glycosylation profiles: A chance for new biomarkers in neuroproteomics?,"Phosphorylation and glycosylation are important protein modifications in the mammalian brain acting as drivers of neural development, neurotransmission signalling and neurite elongation as well as synaptic morphology. Despite their important functional roles in the brain, only a few studies have elucidated them in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Here, we comprehensively review Alzheimer's pathology in relation to protein phosphorylation and glycosylation on synaptic plasticity from neuroproteomics data. Moreover, we highlight several mass spectrometry-based sample processing technologies including an in-house developed TiO2-SIMAC-TiO2-based enrichment protocol to isolate and enrich phosphorylated and glycosylated peptides enabling to elucidate hopefully new early disease biomarkers.",28396268,,10.1016/j.jprot.2017.04.003,10,Journal of proteomics,101475056,3.855,0.35064372420310974,0.5150501672240803,0.2842809364548495,0.3702524552576518
Synaptic dysfunction in early phases of Alzheimer's Disease,"The synapse is the locus of plasticity where short-term alterations in synaptic strength are converted to long-lasting memories. In addition to the presynaptic terminal and the postsynaptic compartment, a more holistic view of the synapse includes the astrocytes and the extracellular matrix to form a tetrapartite synapse. All these four elements contribute to synapse health and are crucial for synaptic plasticity events and, thereby, for learning and memory processes. Synaptic dysfunction is a common pathogenic trait of several brain disorders. In Alzheimer's Disease, the degeneration of synapses can be detected at the early stages of pathology progression before neuronal degeneration, supporting the hypothesis that synaptic failure is a major determinant of the disease. The synapse is the place where amyloid-Î² peptides are generated and is the target of the toxic amyloid-Î² oligomers. All the elements constituting the tetrapartite synapse are altered in Alzheimer's Disease and can synergistically contribute to synaptic dysfunction. Moreover, the two main hallmarks of Alzheimer's Disease, i.e., amyloid-Î² and tau, act in concert to cause synaptic deficits. Deciphering the mechanisms underlying synaptic dysfunction is relevant for the development of the next-generation therapeutic strategies aimed at modifying the disease progression.",35034752,,10.1016/B978-0-12-819410-2.00022-9,19,Handbook of clinical neurology,166161,0.0,0.34997692704200745,0.6488294314381271,0.046822742474916385,0.34911659100781317
MiR-134 modulates chronic stress-induced structural plasticity and depression-like behaviors via downregulation of Limk1/cofilin signaling in rats,"Increasing evidence has suggested that depression is a neuropsychiatric condition associated with neuroplasticity within specific brain regions. However, the mechanisms by which neuroplasticity exerts its effects in depression remain largely uncharacterized. In the present study we show that chronic stress effectively induces depression-like behaviors in rats, an effect which was associated with structural changes in dendritic spines and synapse abnormalities within neurons of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). Moreover, unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) exposure significantly increased the expression of miR-134 within the vmPFC, an effect which was paralleled with a decrease in the levels of expression and phosphorylation of the synapse-associated proteins, LIM-domain kinase 1 (Limk1) and cofilin. An intracerebral infusion of the adenovirus associated virus (AAV)-miR-134-sponge into the vmPFC of stressed rats, which blocks mir-134 function, significantly ameliorated neuronal structural abnormalities, biochemical changes and depression-like behaviors. Chronic administration of ginsenoside Rg1 (40 mg/kg, 5 weeks), a potential neuroprotective agent extracted from ginseng, significantly ameliorated the behavioral and biochemical changes induced by UCMS exposure. These results suggest that miR-134-mediated dysregulation of structural plasticity may be related to the display of depression-like behaviors in stressed rats. The neuroprotective effects of ginsenoside Rg1, which produces an antidepressant like effect in this model of depression, appears to result from modulation of the miR-134 signaling pathway within the vmPFC.",29329879,,10.1016/j.neuropharm.2018.01.009,33,Neuropharmacology,236217,5.273,0.3472050130367279,0.7993311036789298,0.47491638795986624,0.463172506149796
"Amyloid, APP, and Electrical Activity of the Brain","The Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) is infamous for its proposed pivotal role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Much research on APP focusses on potential contributions to neurodegeneration, mostly based on mouse models with altered expression or mutated forms of APP. However, cumulative evidence from recent years indicates the indispensability of APP and its metabolites for normal brain physiology. APP contributes to the regulation of synaptic transmission, plasticity, and calcium homeostasis. It plays an important role during development and it exerts neuroprotective effects. Of particular importance is the soluble secreted fragment APPsÎ± which mediates many of its physiological actions, often counteracting the effects of the small APP-derived peptide AÎ². Understanding the contribution of APP for normal functions of the nervous system is of high importance, both from a basic science perspective and also as a basis for generating new pathophysiological concepts and therapeutic approaches in AD. In this article, we review the physiological functions of APP and its metabolites, focusing on synaptic transmission, plasticity, calcium signaling, and neuronal network activity.",31779518,PMC7222965,10.1177/1073858419882619,21,"The Neuroscientist : a review journal bringing neurobiology, neurology and",9504819,7.235,0.3464307188987732,0.68561872909699,0.705685618729097,0.4861193009044813
Mitochondrial support and local translation of mitochondrial proteins in synaptic plasticity and function,"Complex neural and brain functions are executed through structural and functional alterations of synapses and neurons. Neuronal compartmentalization requires neurons to allocate mitochondria and proteins in a spatiotemporal manner to allow their plasticity, function and homeostasis. Importantly, mitochondria are known to interact with and modulate synaptic activities through their ATP supply, calcium buffering and signaling abilities. Over the years, mitochondrial support and local translation (including mitochondrial proteins) at neuronal sub-compartments and their synaptic specializations have been considered critical for maintaining synaptic plasticity and function. Recently, evidence has shown that late endosomes can serve as sites for local translation of mRNAs crucial for mitochondrial integrity and mitochondrial compartments can fuel plasticity-induced local translation. Indeed, failed mitochondrial homeostasis and subsequent synaptic dysfunction are often intricately linked in the malfunction of the central nervous system in synaptic aging and diseases. In this review, I will discuss the critical role of local translation (including mitochondrial proteins) in dendrites, axons and synapses on neuronal/synaptic plasticity and function.",34032272,,10.14670/HH-18-345,2,Histology and histopathology,8609357,2.13,0.3460991382598877,0.17391304347826086,0.0903010033444816,0.26050229232048105
Basic mechanisms of plasticity and learning,"The last century was characterized by a significant scientific effort aimed at unveiling the neurobiological basis of learning and memory. Thanks to the characterization of the mechanisms regulating the long-term changes of neuronal synaptic connections, it was possible to understand how specific neural networks shape themselves during the acquisition of memory traces or complex motor tasks. In this chapter, we will summarize the mechanisms underlying the main forms of synaptic plasticity taking advantage of the studies performed in the hippocampus and in the nucleus striatum, key brain structures that play a crucial role in cognition. Moreover, we will discuss how the molecular pathways involved in the induction of physiologic synaptic long-term changes could be disrupted during neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory disorders, highlighting the translational relevance of this intriguing research field.",35034736,,10.1016/B978-0-12-819410-2.00002-3,7,Handbook of clinical neurology,166161,0.0,0.34576770663261414,0.40468227424749165,0.05016722408026756,0.2984305236451203
In Vivo Two-Photon Imaging of Microglial Synapse Contacts,"Microglia are traditionally known as immune sentinels of the brain and as key player in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson disease, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Recently, they were also identified as synaptic organizer, promoting formation and maturation of synapses as well as modifying synaptic activity. Interestingly, microglia-mediated synaptic pruning and microglia-mediated changes in synaptic plasticity were observed both during brain development and in neurodegenerative diseases, stressing the key role of microglia-synapse interaction in these processes. Here we descried a technique for noninvasive in vivo monitoring of microglia-synapse interactions by means of two-photon microscopy.",31392692,,10.1007/978-1-4939-9658-2_20,5,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,0.0,0.34521564841270447,0.3277591973244147,0.05351170568561873,0.28338356964962935
"Development of a reliable microRNA based electrochemical genosensor for monitoring of miR-146a, as key regulatory agent of neurodegenerative disease","A MicroRNA (miR) based electrochemical method for quantification of miR-146a, a known biomarker for neurodegenerative disease, was developed. In this bioassay, the capture microRNA (C-miR) was self-assembled on the gold surface and used for quantification of target microRNA (T-miR) of miR-146a. For this purpose, an optimized concentration of C-miR was immobilized on the surface of gold electrode and used for capture of target analyte (T-miR). All of preparation steps were characterized by electrochemical techniques (cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). At the optimized conditions, the linear dynamic range, limit of quantification and relative standard deviation of the proposed bioassay were obtained as 10 pM to 1 Î¼M, 10 pM and 1.59%, respectively. The unprocessed human serum sample was used as a real sample and the results fully confirm that the designed microRNA based biosensor is capable for detection of miR-146a as neurodegenerative disease biomarker.

Control of hippocampal synaptic plasticity by microglia-dendrite interactions depends on genetic context in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease,"Introduction:Human data suggest susceptibility and resilience to features of Alzheimer's disease (AD) such as microglia activation and synaptic dysfunction are under genetic control. However, causal relationships between these processes, and how genomic diversity modulates them remain systemically underexplored in mouse models.Methods:AD-vulnerable hippocampal neurons were virally labeled in inbred (C57BL/6J) and wild-derived (PWK/PhJ) APP/PS1 and wild-type mice, and brain microglia depleted from 4 to 8 months of age. Dendrites were assessed for synapse plasticity changes by evaluating spine densities and morphologies.Results:In C57BL/6J, microglia depletion blocked amyloid-induced synaptic density and morphology changes. At a finer scale, synaptic morphology on individual branches was dependent on microglia-dendrite physical interactions. Conversely, synapses from PWK/PhJ mice showed remarkable stability in response to amyloid, and no evidence of microglia contact-dependent changes on dendrites.Discussion:These results demonstrate that microglia-dependent synaptic alterations in specific AD-vulnerable projection pathways are differentially controlled by genetic context.",37753835,PMC10840883,10.1002/alz.13440,3,Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association,101231978,16.655,0.3447742760181427,0.21070234113712374,0.939799331103679,0.4369649000590462
Modulation of synaptic plasticity by exercise,"Synaptic plasticity is an experience-dependent process that results in long-lasting changes in synaptic communication. This phenomenon stimulates structural, molecular, and genetic changes in the brain and is the leading biological model for learning and memory processes. Synapses are able to show persistent increases in synaptic strength, or long-term potentiation (LTP), as well as persistent decreases in synaptic strength, known as long-term depression (LTD). Understanding the complex interactions that regulate these activity-dependent processes can provide insight for the development of strategies to improve cognitive function. Twenty years ago, we provided the first evidence indicating that aerobic exercise can reliably enhance LTP, and went on to show that it can also regulate some of the mechanisms involved in LTD induction. Since then, several laboratories have confirmed and expanded these findings, helping to identify different molecular mechanisms involved in exercise-mediated changes in synaptic efficacy. This chapter reviews this material and shows how these experimental findings may prove valuable for alleviating the burden of neurodegenerative diseases in an aging population.",31607359,,10.1016/bs.irn.2019.07.002,18,International review of neurobiology,374740,4.28,0.343892365694046,0.6287625418060201,0.3277591973244147,0.3976397672425146
Role of Wnt signaling in synaptic plasticity and memory,"Ever since their discoveries, the Wnt pathways have been consistently associated with key features of cellular development, including metabolism, structure and cell fate. The three known pathways (the canonical Wnt/Î²-catenin and the two non-canonical Wnt/Ca++and Wnt/JNK/PCP pathways) participate in complex networks of interaction with a wide range of regulators of cell function, such as GSK-3Î², AKT, PKC and mTOR, among others. These proteins are known to be involved in the formation and maintenance of memory. Currently, studies with Wnt and memory have shown that the canonical and non-canonical pathways play key roles in different processes associated with memory. So, in this review we briefly summarize the different roles that Wnt signaling can play in neurons and in memory, as well as in Alzheimer's disease, focusing towards animal studies. We start with the molecular characterization of the family and its receptors, as well as the most commonly used drugs for pharmacological manipulations. Next, we describe its role in synaptic plasticity and memory, and how the regulations of these pathways affect crucial features of neuronal function. Furthermore, we succinctly present the current knowledge on how the Wnt pathways are implicated in Alzheimer's disease, and how studies are seeing them as a potential candidate for effective treatments. Lastly, we point toward challenges of Wnt research, and how knowledge on these pathways can lead towards a better understanding of neurobiological and pathological processes.",34808336,,10.1016/j.nlm.2021.107558,11,Neurobiology of learning and memory,9508166,3.109,0.34356194734573364,0.5250836120401338,0.1705685618729097,0.3452676031900489
Molecular mechanism linking BDNF/TrkB signaling with the NMDA receptor in memory: the role of Girdin in the CNS,"It is well known that synaptic plasticity is the cellular mechanism underlying learning and memory. Activity-dependent synaptic changes in electrical properties and morphology, including synaptogenesis, lead to alterations of synaptic strength, which is associated with long-term potentiation (LTP). Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)/tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) signaling is involved in learning and memory formation by regulating synaptic plasticity. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K)/Akt pathway is one of the key signaling cascades downstream BDNF/TrkB and is believed to modulate N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated synaptic plasticity. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the connection between these two key players in synaptic plasticity remains largely unknown. Girders of actin filament (Girdin), an Akt substrate that directly binds to actin filaments, has been shown to play a role in neuronal migration and neuronal development. Recently, we identified Girdin as a key molecule involved in regulating long-term memory. It was demonstrated that phosphorylation of Girdin by Akt contributed to the maintenance of LTP by linking the BDNF/TrkB signaling pathway with NMDA receptor activity. These findings indicate that Girdin plays a pivotal role in a variety of processes in the CNS. Here, we review recent advances in our understanding about the roles of Girdin in the CNS and focus particularly on neuronal migration and memory.",26927219,,10.1515/revneuro-2015-0072,9,Reviews in the neurosciences,8711016,4.703,0.3418021500110626,0.4816053511705686,0.38461538461538464,0.3783254371638282
Group I Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor Interacting Proteins: Fine-Tuning Receptor Functions in Health and Disease,"Group I metabotropic glutamate receptors mediate slow excitatory neurotransmission in the central nervous system and are critical to activity-dependent synaptic plasticity, a cellular substrate of learning and memory. Dysregulated receptor signaling is implicated in neuropsychiatric conditions ranging from neurodevelopmental to neurodegenerative disorders. Importantly, group I metabotropic glutamate receptor signaling functions can be modulated by interacting proteins that mediate receptor trafficking, expression and coupling efficiency to signaling effectors.

Trax: A versatile signaling protein plays key roles in synaptic plasticity and DNA repair,"Translin-associated protein X (TSNAX), also called trax, was first identified as a protein that interacts with translin. Subsequent studies demonstrated that these proteins form a heteromeric RNase complex that mediates degradation of microRNAs, a pivotal finding that has stimulated interest in understanding the role of translin and trax in cell signaling. Recent studies addressing this question have revealed that trax plays key roles in both synaptic plasticity and DNA repair signaling pathways. In the context of synaptic plasticity, trax works together with its partner protein, translin, to degrade a subset of microRNAs. Activation of the translin/trax RNase complex reverses microRNA-mediated translational silencing to trigger dendritic protein synthesis critical for synaptic plasticity. In the context of DNA repair, trax binds to and activates ATM, a central component of the double-stranded DNA repair process. Thus, these studies focus attention on trax as a critical signaling protein that interacts with multiple partners to impact diverse signaling pathways. To stimulate interest in deciphering the multifaceted role of trax in cell signaling, we summarize the current understanding of trax biology and highlight gaps in our knowledge about this protean protein.",30017897,PMC6329659,10.1016/j.nlm.2018.07.003,4,Neurobiology of learning and memory,9508166,3.109,0.34092390537261963,0.2709030100334448,0.17391304347826086,0.2935175539259129
Plasticity-Related Gene Expression During Eszopiclone-Induced Sleep,"Study objectives:Experimental evidence suggests that restorative processes depend on synaptic plasticity changes in the brain during sleep. We used the expression of plasticity-related genes to assess synaptic plasticity changes during drug-induced sleep.Methods:We first characterized sleep induced by eszopiclone in mice during baseline conditions and during the recovery from sleep deprivation. We then compared the expression of 18 genes and two miRNAs critically involved in synaptic plasticity in these mice. Gene expression was assessed in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus by the TaqMan reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and correlated with sleep parameters.Results:Eszopiclone reduced the latency to nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and increased NREM sleep amounts. Eszopiclone had no effect on slow wave activity (SWA) during baseline conditions but reduced the SWA increase during recovery sleep (RS) after sleep deprivation. Gene expression analyses revealed three distinct patterns: (1) four genes had higher expression either in the cortex or hippocampus in the group of mice with increased amounts of wakefulness; (2) a large proportion of plasticity-related genes (7 out of 18 genes) had higher expression during RS in the cortex but not in the hippocampus; and (3) six genes and the two miRNAs showed no significant changes across conditions. Even at a relatively high dose (20 mg/kg), eszopiclone did not reduce the expression of plasticity-related genes during RS period in the cortex.Conclusions:These results indicate that gene expression associated with synaptic plasticity occurs in the cortex in the presence of a hypnotic medication.",28605546,PMC6075206,10.1093/sleep/zsx098,4,Sleep,7809084,6.313,0.3394990861415863,0.27424749163879597,0.6287625418060201,0.384301458373915
Dysregulation of Astrocyte-Neuronal Communication in Alzheimer's Disease,"Recent studies implicate astrocytes in Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, their role in pathogenesis is poorly understood. Astrocytes have well-established functions in supportive functions such as extracellular ionic homeostasis, structural support, and neurovascular coupling. However, emerging research on astrocytic function in the healthy brain also indicates their role in regulating synaptic plasticity and neuronal excitability via the release of neuroactive substances named gliotransmitters. Here, we review how this ""active"" role of astrocytes at synapses could contribute to synaptic and neuronal network dysfunction and cognitive impairment in AD.",34360652,PMC8346080,10.3390/ijms22157887,14,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,6.208,0.3391706645488739,0.5719063545150501,0.6187290969899666,0.4416294890303277
Bipolar-associated miR-499-5p controls neuroplasticity by downregulating the Cav1.2 subunit CACNB2,"Bipolar disorder (BD) is a chronic mood disorder characterized by manic and depressive episodes. Dysregulation of neuroplasticity and calcium homeostasis are frequently observed in BD patients, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. Here, we show that miR-499-5p regulates dendritogenesis and cognitive function by downregulating the BD risk gene CACNB2. miR-499-5p expression is increased in peripheral blood of BD patients, as well as in the hippocampus of rats which underwent juvenile social isolation. In rat hippocampal neurons, miR-499-5p impairs dendritogenesis and reduces surface expression and activity of the L-type calcium channel Cav1.2. We further identified CACNB2, which encodes a regulatory Î²-subunit of Cav1.2, as a direct functional target of miR-499-5p in neurons. miR-499-5p overexpression in the hippocampus in vivo induces short-term memory impairments selectively in rats haploinsufficient for the Cav1.2 pore forming subunit Cacna1c. In humans, miR-499-5p expression is negatively associated with gray matter volumes of the left superior temporal gyrus, a region implicated in auditory and emotional processing. We propose that stress-induced miR-499-5p overexpression contributes to dendritic impairments, deregulated calcium homeostasis, and neurocognitive dysfunction in BD.",35969184,PMC9535808,10.15252/embr.202154420,4,EMBO reports,100963049,9.071,0.3378586173057556,0.27759197324414714,0.8127090301003345,0.42077537105234974
Locus coeruleus in memory formation and Alzheimer's disease,"Catecholamine neurons of the locus coeruleus (LC) in the dorsal pontine tegmentum innervate the entire neuroaxis, with signaling actions implicated in the regulation of attention, arousal, sleep-wake cycle, learning, memory, anxiety, pain, mood, and brain metabolism. The co-release of norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA) from LC terminals in the hippocampus plays a role in all stages of hippocampal-memory processing. This catecholaminergic regulation modulates the encoding, consolidation, retrieval, and reversal of hippocampus-based memory. LC neurons in awake animals have two distinct firing modes: tonic firing (explorative) and phasic firing (exploitative). These two firing modes exert different modulatory effects on post-synaptic dendritic spines. In the hippocampus, the firing modes regulate long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression, which differentially regulate the mRNA expression and transcription of plasticity-related proteins (PRPs). These proteins aid in structural alterations of dendritic spines, that is, structural long-term potentiation (sLTP), via expansion and structural long-term depression (sLTD) via contraction of post-synaptic dendritic spines. Given the LC's role in all phases of memory processing, the degeneration of 50% of the LC neuron population occurring in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a clinically relevant aspect of disease pathology. The loss of catecholaminergic regulation contributes to dysfunction in memory processes along with impaired functions associated with attention and task completion. The multifaceted role of the LC in memory and general task performance and the close correlation of LC degeneration with neurodegenerative disease progression together implicate it as a target for new clinical assessment tools.",33190318,PMC8121900,10.1111/ejn.15045,17,The European journal of neuroscience,8918110,3.698,0.3375310003757477,0.6153846153846154,0.2608695652173913,0.37776943634585

Long-term potentiation-based screening identifies neuronal PYGM as a synaptic plasticity regulator participating in Alzheimer's disease,"Synaptic dysfunction is an important pathological hallmark and cause of Alzheimer's disease (AD). High-frequency stimulation (HFS)-induced long-term potentiation (LTP) has been widely used to study synaptic plasticity, with impaired LTP found to be associated with AD. However, the exact molecular mechanism underlying synaptic plasticity has yet to be completely elucidated. Whether genes regulating synaptic plasticity are altered in AD and contribute to disease onset also remains unclear. Herein, we induced LTP in the hippocampal CA1 region of wild-type (WT) and AD model mice by administering HFS to the CA3 region and then studied transcriptome changes in the CA1 region. We identified 89 genes that may participate in normal synaptic plasticity by screening HFS-induced differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in mice with normal LTP, and 43 genes that may contribute to synaptic dysfunction in AD by comparing HFS-induced DEGs in mice with normal LTP and AD mice with impaired LTP. We further refined the 43 genes down to 14 by screening for genes with altered expression in pathological-stage AD mice without HFS induction. Among them, we found that the expression ofPygm, which catabolizes glycogen, was also decreased in AD patients. We further demonstrated that down-regulation of PYGM in neurons impaired synaptic plasticity and cognition in WT mice, while its overexpression attenuated synaptic dysfunction and cognitive deficits in AD mice. Moreover, we showed that PYGM directly regulated energy generation in neurons. Our study not only indicates that PYGM-mediated energy production in neurons plays an important role in synaptic function, but also provides a novel LTP-based strategy to systematically identify genes regulating synaptic plasticity under physiological and pathological conditions.",37537141,PMC10559100,10.24272/j.issn.2095-8137.2023.123,0,Zoological research,101697192,0.0,0.33350321650505066,0.06354515050167224,0.056856187290969896,0.22418219746155882
The potential role of miR-124-3p in tumorigenesis and other related diseases,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of single-stranded noncoding and endogenous RNA molecules with a length of 18-25 nucleotides. Previous work has shown that miR-124-3p leads to malignant progression of cancer including cell apoptosis, migration, invasion, drug resistance, and also recovers neural function, affects adipogenic differentiation, facilitates wound healing through control of various target genes. miR-124-3p has been mainly previously characterized as a tumor suppressor regulating tumorigenesis and progression in several cancers, such as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), gastric cancer (GC), bladder cancer, ovarian cancer (OC), and leukemia, as a tumor promotor in breast cancer (BC), and it has been also widely studied in a variety of neurological diseases, like Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD), and cardiovascular diseases, ulcerative colitis (UC), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). To lay the groundwork for future therapeutic strategies, in this review we mainly focus on the most recent years of literature on the functions of miR-124-3p in related major cancers, as well as its downstream target genes. Although current work as yet provides an incomplete picture, miR-124-3p is still worthy of more attention as a practical and effective clinical biomarker.",33877528,,10.1007/s11033-021-06347-4,9,Molecular biology reports,403234,2.742,0.33296075463294983,0.48494983277591974,0.12040133779264214,0.3208466868934822
"A role for tau in learning, memory and synaptic plasticity","Tau plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders: mutations in the gene encoding for tau (MAPT) are linked to Fronto-temporal Dementia (FTD) and hyper-phosphorylated aggregates of tau forming neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) that constitute a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer disease (AD) and FTD. Accordingly, tau is a favored therapeutic target for the treatment of these diseases. Given the criticality of tau to dementia's pathogenesis and therapy, it is important to understand the physiological function of tau in the central nervous system. Analysis of Mapt knock out (Mapt-/-) mice has yielded inconsistent results. Some studies have shown that tau deletion does not alter memory while others have described synaptic plasticity and memory alterations in Mapt-/-mice. To help clarifying these contrasting results, we analyzed a distinct Mapt-/-model on a B6129PF3/J genetic background. We found that tau deletion leads to aging-dependent short-term memory deficits, hyperactivity and synaptic plasticity defects. In contrast, Mapt+/-mice only showed a mild short memory deficit in the novel object recognition task. Thus, while tau is important for normal neuronal functions underlying learning and memory, partial reduction of tau expression may have fractional deleterious effects.",29453339,PMC5816660,10.1038/s41598-018-21596-3,55,Scientific reports,101563288,4.996,0.33274388313293457,0.9063545150501672,0.41471571906354515,0.46386037670250324
miR-146a/KLF4 axis in epileptic mice: A novel regulator of synaptic plasticity involving STAT3 signaling,"Objective:This study is aimed to investigate the mechanism of miR-146a/KLF4 axis regarding epilepsy seizure and synaptic plasticity.Methods:Pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-kindling mouse model of epilepsy was established and evaluated by Racine's scale. PTZ-treated mice were subjected to stereotactic injection of miR-146a antagomir and pre-KLF4 to verify the role of miR-146a and KLF4 in mice. Primary hippocampal neurons from fetal mouse were isolated and identified through immunofluorescence for microtubule-associated protein (MAP)-2. Cellular models of epilepsy were prepared using magnesium-free extracellular fluid and then the neurons were transfected with miR-146a antagomir, miR-146a agomir, miR-146a agomir + pre-KLF4, AG490 (an inhibitor of STAT3 signal pathway) or miR-146a agomir + AG490. The binding site between miR-146a and KLF4 was predicted and identified. The expression levels of miR-146a, KLF4, CREB, Synaptotagmin-11 (SYT11), and STAT3-related proteins were measured in addition to the morphology of neurons and length of neurite. The severity of synaptic plasticity was assessed according to the levels of CREB and SYT11.Results:The expression of miR-146a was elevated and KLF4 expression was decreased in epileptic mice. Stereotactic injection of miR-146a antagomir and pre-KLF4 reduced the seizure scores of epileptic mice. Transfection of miR-146a antagomir or pre-KLF4 could attenuate synaptic plasticity in epileptic mice and epileptic cellular models. miR-146a can negatively regulate KLF4 in epileptic cellular models to mediate synaptic plasticity. Epilepsy was attenuated in AG490 and miR-146a agomir + AG490 groups compared with that in Model group.Conclusion:miR-146a inhibits KLF4 to activate STAT3, thus promoting synaptic plasticity in epileptic mice.",35728661,,10.1016/j.brainres.2022.147988,3,Brain research,45503,3.61,0.3306873142719269,0.2140468227424749,0.24749163879598662,0.29072008087084844
Adaptive responses of neuronal mitochondria to bioenergetic challenges: Roles in neuroplasticity and disease resistance,"An important concept in neurobiology is ""neurons that fire together, wire together"" which means that the formation and maintenance of synapses is promoted by activation of those synapses. Very similar to the effects of the stress of exercise on muscle cells, emerging findings suggest that neurons respond to activity by activating signaling pathways (e.g., Ca2+, CREB, PGC-1Î±, NF-ÎºB) that stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis and cellular stress resistance. These pathways are also activated by aerobic exercise and food deprivation, two bioenergetic challenges of fundamental importance in the evolution of the brains of all mammals, including humans. The metabolic 'switch' in fuel source from liver glycogen store-derived glucose to adipose cell-derived fatty acids and their ketone metabolites during fasting and sustained exercise, appears to be a pivotal trigger of both brain-intrinsic and peripheral organ-derived signals that enhance learning and memory and underlying synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis. Brain-intrinsic extracellular signals include the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate and the neurotrophic factor BDNF, and peripheral signals may include the liver-derived ketone 3-hydroxybutyrate and the muscle cell-derived protein irisin. Emerging findings suggest that fasting, exercise and an intellectually challenging lifestyle can protect neurons against the dysfunction and degeneration that they would otherwise suffer in acute brain injuries (stroke and head trauma) and neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's disease. Among the prominent intracellular responses of neurons to these bioenergetic challenges are up-regulation of antioxidant defenses, autophagy/mitophagy and DNA repair. A better understanding of such fundamental hormesis-based adaptive neuronal response mechanisms is expected to result in the development and implementation of novel interventions to promote optimal brain function and healthy brain aging.",27908782,PMC5209274,10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2016.11.045,98,Free radical biology & medicine,8709159,8.101,0.3298233151435852,0.959866220735786,0.7926421404682275,0.5483956613269538
Circulating microRNAs as potential biomarkers for psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders,"Circulating microRNAs (cimiRNAs) are a class of non-encoding RNAs found in bodily fluids such as blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and tears. CimiRNAs have been implicated as promising biomarkers for central nervous system (CNS) disorders because they are actively secreted as messengers and are profoundly involved in fine-tuning of developmental and differentiation processes. Furthermore, they are attractive biomarkers because they are extremely stable, tissue enriched and can be determined in a quantitative manner. This review aims to provide a comprehensive assessment on the current progress regarding the potential value of cimiRNAs as CNS biomarkers. Within this framework five CNS disorders are explored which share a common pathological hallmark namely cognitive impairment. The CNS disorders include Major depression disorder (MDD), Bipolar disorder (BD), Schizophrenia (SZ), Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson disease (PD). The similarities and differences between altered cimiRNAs in the different disorders are described. The miR-29 family, miR-34a-5p and miR-132-3p are discussed as common dysregulated cimiRNAs found in the CNS disorders. Furthermore, it is shown that the type of bodily fluid used for measuring cimiRNAs is important as inconsistencies in cimiRNAs expression directions are found when comparing CSF, blood cell-free and blood cell-bound samples.",31816349,,10.1016/j.pneurobio.2019.101732,104,Progress in neurobiology,370121,10.885,0.3278834819793701,0.9765886287625418,0.8561872909698997,0.5632852731341104
Emerging pathways driving early synaptic pathology in Alzheimer's disease,"The current state of the AD research field is highly dynamic is some respects, while seemingly stagnant in others. Regarding the former, our current lack of understanding of initiating disease mechanisms, the absence of effective treatment options, and the looming escalation of AD patients is energizing new research directions including a much-needed re-focusing on early pathogenic mechanisms, validating novel targets, and investigating relevant biomarkers, among other exciting new efforts to curb disease progression and foremost, preserve memory function. With regard to the latter, the recent disappointing series of failed Phase III clinical trials targeting AÎ² and APP processing, in concert with poor association between brain AÎ² levels and cognitive function, have led many to call for a re-evaluation of the primacy of the amyloid cascade hypothesis. In this review, we integrate new insights into one of the earliest described signaling abnormalities in AD pathogenesis, namely intracellular Ca2+signaling disruptions, and focus on its role in driving synaptic deficits - which is the feature that does correlate with AD-associated memory loss. Excess Ca2+release from intracellular stores such as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) has been well-described in cellular and animal models of AD, as well as human patients, and here we expand upon recent developments in ER-localized release channels such as the IP3R and RyR, and the recent emphasis on RyR2. Consistent with ER Ca2+mishandling in AD are recent findings implicating aspects of SOCE, such as STIM2 function, and TRPC3 and TRPC6 levels. Other Ca2+-regulated organelles important in signaling and protein handling are brought into the discussion, with new perspectives on lysosomal regulation. These early signaling abnormalities are discussed in the context of synaptic pathophysiology and disruptions in synaptic plasticity with a particular emphasis on short-term plasticity deficits. Overall, we aim to update and expand the list of early neuronal signaling abnormalities implicated in AD pathogenesis, identify specific channels and organelles involved, and link these to proximal synaptic impairments driving the memory loss in AD. This is all within the broader goal of identifying novel therapeutic targets to preserve cognitive function in AD.",27659710,PMC5303639,10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.09.088,49,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,372516,3.322,0.32723817229270935,0.882943143812709,0.22073578595317725,0.4170786893288028
A mechanistic hypothesis for the impairment of synaptic plasticity by soluble AÎ² oligomers from Alzheimer's brain,"It is increasingly accepted that early cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease results in considerable part from synaptic dysfunction caused by the accumulation of a range of oligomeric assemblies of amyloid Î²-protein (AÎ²). Most studies have used synthetic AÎ² peptides to explore the mechanisms of memory deficits in rodent models, but recent work suggests that AÎ² assemblies isolated from human (AD) brain tissue are far more potent and disease-relevant. Although reductionist experiments show AÎ² oligomers to impair synaptic plasticity and neuronal viability, the responsible mechanisms are only partly understood. Glutamatergic receptors, GABAergic receptors, nicotinic receptors, insulin receptors, the cellular prion protein, inflammatory mediators, and diverse signaling pathways have all been suggested. Studies using AD brain-derived soluble AÎ² oligomers suggest that only certain bioactive forms (principally small, diffusible oligomers) can disrupt synaptic plasticity, including by binding to plasma membranes and changing excitatory-inhibitory balance, perturbing mGluR, PrP, and other neuronal surface proteins, down-regulating glutamate transporters, causing glutamate spillover, and activating extrasynaptic GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors. We synthesize these emerging data into a mechanistic hypothesis for synaptic failure in Alzheimer's disease that can be modified as new knowledge is added and specific therapeutics are developed.",32180217,PMC7487043,10.1111/jnc.15007,101,Journal of neurochemistry,2985190R,0.0,0.3254133462905884,0.9698996655518395,0.06020066889632107,0.4012680746639852

Xuefu Zhuyu decoction promotes synaptic plasticity by targeting miR-191a-5p/BDNF-TrkB axis in severe traumatic brain injury,"Background:Xuefu Zhuyu decoction (XFZYD) is a traditional Chinese herbal formula known for its ability to eliminate blood stasis and improve blood circulation, providing neuroprotection against severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI). However, the underlying mechanism is still unclear.Purpose:We aim to investigate the neuroprotective effects of XFZYD in sTBI from a novel mechanistic perspective of miRNA-mRNA. Additionally, we sought to elucidate a potential specific mechanism by integrating transcriptomics, bioinformatics, and conducting both in vitro and in vivo experiments.Methods:The sTBI rat model was established, and the rats were treated with XFZYD for 14 days. The neuroprotective effects of XFZYD were evaluated using a modified neurological severity score, hematoxylin and eosin staining, as well as Nissl staining. The anti-inflammatory effects of XFZYD were explored using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), Western blot analysis, and immunofluorescence. Next, miRNA sequencing of the hippocampus was performed to determine which miRNAs were differentially expressed. Subsequently, qRT-PCR was used to validate the differentially expressed miRNAs. Target core mRNAs were determined using various methods, including miRNA prediction targets, mRNA sequencing, miRNA-mRNA network, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis. The miRNA/mRNA regulatory axis were verified through qRT-PCR or Western blot analysis. Finally, morphological changes in the neural synapses were observed using transmission electron microscopy and immunofluorescence.Results:XFZYD exhibited significant neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects on subacute sTBI rats' hippocampus. The analyses of miRNA/mRNA sequences combined with the PPI network revealed that the therapeutic effects of XFZYD on sTBI were associated with the regulation of the rno-miR-191a-5p/BDNF axis. Subsequently, qRT-PCR and Western blot analysis confirmed XFZYD reversed the decrease of BDNF and TrkB in the hippocampus caused by sTBI. Additionally, XFZYD treatment potentially increased the number of synaptic connections, and the expression of the synapse-related protein PSD95, axon-related protein GAP43 and neuron-specific protein TUBB3.Conclusions:XFZYD exerts neuroprotective effects by promoting hippocampal synaptic remodeling and improving cognition during the subacute phase of sTBI through downregulating of rno-miR-191a-5p/BDNF axis, further activating BDNF-TrkB signaling.",38565001,,10.1016/j.phymed.2024.155566,0,Phytomedicine : international journal of phytotherapy and phytopharmacology,9438794,6.656,0.3228461444377899,0.07023411371237458,0.6521739130434783,0.3381892920138445
Systematic Identification of circRNAs in Alzheimer's Disease,"Mammalian circRNAs are covalently closed circular RNAs often generated through backsplicing of precursor linear RNAs. Although their functions are largely unknown, they have been found to influence gene expression at different levels and in a wide range of biological processes. Here, we investigated if some circRNAs may be differentially abundant in Alzheimer's Disease (AD). We identified and analyzed publicly available RNA-sequencing data from the frontal lobe, temporal cortex, hippocampus, and plasma samples reported from persons with AD and persons who were cognitively normal, focusing on circRNAs shared across these datasets. We identified an overlap of significantly changed circRNAs among AD individuals in the various brain datasets, including circRNAs originating from genes strongly linked to AD pathology such asDOCK1,NTRK2,APC(implicated in synaptic plasticity and neuronal survival) andDGL1/SAP97,TRAPPC9, andKIF1B(implicated in vesicular traffic). We further predicted the presence of circRNA isoforms in AD using specialized statistical analysis packages to create approximations of entire circRNAs. We propose that the catalog of differentially abundant circRNAs can guide future investigation on the expression and splicing of the host transcripts, as well as the possible roles of these circRNAs in AD pathogenesis.",34440432,PMC8391980,10.3390/genes12081258,8,Genes,101551097,4.141,0.32007700204849243,0.4280936454849498,0.30434782608695654,0.3385344955434767
Is there a role for microRNAs in epilepsy diagnostics?,"Introduction:Epilepsy is a disease group that encompasses numerous brain pathologies, all leading to spontaneous seizures. Several diagnostic needs in the area of epilepsy diagnostics remain unmet. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as potential biomarkers of disease.Areas covered:We review clinical trials in epilepsy patients that investigated circulating miRNAs (CmiRNAs) as diagnostic biomarkers.Expert opinion:The surveyed trial results are highly discordant and do not confidently support the identification of definite diagnostic biomarkers yet. Important progress comes from studies that identified measures to increase the discriminatory power of CmiRNAs, such as an investigation of specific miRNA compartments (e.g. exosomal vs. Argonaute-bound) or a study that developed point-of-care detection devices for CmiRNAs. No sufficient data elucidating the validity of CmiRNAs as biomarkers for monitoring disease status, the responses to treatment, the likelihood of treatment effects, prognosis, or safety or susceptibility are available. Further studies should adopt standardized designs and in-depth phenotyping to improve their validity. One of the most important and promising future research topics will be the identification of biomarkers for epileptogenesis in humans.",32188279,,10.1080/14737159.2020.1745065,4,Expert review of molecular diagnostics,101120777,5.67,0.31668615341186523,0.2809364548494983,0.49498327759197325,0.34519563853541346
"Distinctin vivoroles of secreted APP ectodomain variants APPsÎ± and APPsÎ² in regulation of spine density, synaptic plasticity, and cognition","Increasing evidence suggests that synaptic functions of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), which is key to Alzheimer pathogenesis, may be carried out by its secreted ectodomain (APPs). The specific roles of APPsÎ± and APPsÎ² fragments, generated by non-amyloidogenic or amyloidogenic APP processing, respectively, remain however unclear. Here, we expressed APPsÎ± or APPsÎ² in the adult brain of conditional double knockout mice (cDKO) lacking APP and the related APLP2. APPsÎ± efficiently rescued deficits in spine density, synaptic plasticity (LTP and PPF), and spatial reference memory of cDKO mice. In contrast, APPsÎ² failed to show any detectable effects on synaptic plasticity and spine density. The C-terminal 16 amino acids of APPsÎ± (lacking in APPsÎ²) proved sufficient to facilitate LTP in a mechanism that depends on functional nicotinic Î±7-nAChRs. Further, APPsÎ± showed high-affinity, allosteric potentiation of heterologously expressed Î±7-nAChRs in oocytes. Collectively, we identified Î±7-nAChRs as a crucial physiological receptor specific for APPsÎ± and show distinctin vivoroles for APPsÎ± versus APPsÎ². This implies that reduced levels of APPsÎ± that might occur during Alzheimer pathogenesis cannot be compensated by APPsÎ².",29661886,PMC5983155,10.15252/embj.201798335,40,The EMBO journal,8208664,14.012,0.31647488474845886,0.842809364548495,0.9297658862876255,0.5443999810162994
Synaptic Plasticity Shapes Brain Connectivity: Implications for Network Topology,"Studies of brain network connectivity improved understanding on brain changes and adaptation in response to different pathologies. Synaptic plasticity, the ability of neurons to modify their connections, is involved in brain network remodeling following different types of brain damage (e.g., vascular, neurodegenerative, inflammatory). Although synaptic plasticity mechanisms have been extensively elucidated, how neural plasticity can shape network organization is far from being completely understood. Similarities existing between synaptic plasticity and principles governing brain network organization could be helpful to define brain network properties and reorganization profiles after damage. In this review, we discuss how different forms of synaptic plasticity, including homeostatic and anti-homeostatic mechanisms, could be directly involved in generating specific brain network characteristics. We propose that long-term potentiation could represent the neurophysiological basis for the formation of highly connected nodes (hubs). Conversely, homeostatic plasticity may contribute to stabilize network activity preventing poor and excessive connectivity in the peripheral nodes. In addition, synaptic plasticity dysfunction may drive brain network disruption in neuropsychiatric conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia. Optimal network architecture, characterized by efficient information processing and resilience, and reorganization after damage strictly depend on the balance between these forms of plasticity.",31817968,PMC6940892,10.3390/ijms20246193,42,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,6.208,0.3156304955482483,0.8494983277591973,0.6254180602006689,0.48436157492092224
Selective endocytosis of Ca2+-permeable AMPARs by the Alzheimer's disease risk factor CALM bidirectionally controls synaptic plasticity,"AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) mediate fast excitatory neurotransmission, and the plastic modulation of their surface levels determines synaptic strength. AMPARs of different subunit compositions fulfill distinct roles in synaptic long-term potentiation (LTP) and depression (LTD) to enable learning. Largely unknown endocytic mechanisms mediate the subunit-selective regulation of the surface levels of GluA1-homomeric Ca2+-permeable (CP) versus heteromeric Ca2+-impermeable (CI) AMPARs. Here, we report that the Alzheimer's disease risk factor CALM controls the surface levels of CP-AMPARs and thereby reciprocally regulates LTP and LTD in vivo to modulate learning. We show that CALM selectively facilitates the endocytosis of ubiquitinated CP-AMPARs via a mechanism that depends on ubiquitin recognition by its ANTH domain but is independent of clathrin. Our data identify CALM and related ANTH domain-containing proteins as the core endocytic machinery that determines the surface levels of CP-AMPARs to bidirectionally control synaptic plasticity and modulate learning in the mammalian brain.",35613266,PMC9132451,10.1126/sciadv.abl5032,10,Science advances,101653440,14.957,0.31541958451271057,0.5183946488294314,0.9331103678929766,0.47955275405210795
Prediction of Translational Regulation by Network Interaction in Synaptic Plasticity Induced withCentella asiatica,"Background:Recently, human life expectancy, aging, and age-related health disorders, especially neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), have increased. The increasing number of AD patients causes a heavy social and economic burden on society. Since there is no treatment for AD, utilization of natural products is currently accepted as an alternative or integrative treatment agent against AD.Methods:Selection of protein databases related to synaptic plasticity was obtained from a gene bank. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis was performed using Cytoscape 3.9.1. Prediction ofCentella asiaticatarget constituents and their relationship with target synaptic plasticity was performed using STITCH, followed by GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis and molecular binding of ligands to presynaptic and postsynaptic receptors afterwards.Results:From the protein database, 446 protein coding genes related to synaptic plasticity were found. PPI and KEGG pathway analysis showed potentiality to inhibit AKT and mTORC1 pathways. The targeted proteins were TSC1, Rheb, and FMRP.Conclusion:This study showed potentiality ofCentella asiaticain AD through its binding to several proteins such as TSC1, Rheb, and FMRP.

Synapses in neurodegenerative diseases,"Synapse is the basic structural and functional component for neural communication in the brain. The presynaptic terminal is the structural and functionally essential area that initiates communication and maintains the continuous functional neural information flow. It contains synaptic vesicles (SV) filled with neurotransmitters, an active zone for release, and numerous proteins for SV fusion and retrieval. The structural and functional synaptic plasticity is a representative characteristic; however, it is highly vulnerable to various pathological conditions. In fact, synaptic alteration is thought to be central to neural disease processes. In particular, the alteration of the structural and functional phenotype of the presynaptic terminal is a highly significant evidence for neural diseases. In this review, we specifically describe structural and functional alteration of nerve terminals in several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Huntington's disease (HD).

Sodium butyrate ameliorates the impairment of synaptic plasticity by inhibiting the neuroinflammation in 5XFAD mice,"Current strategies for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) focus on the pathology in the later stages of disease progression. Early microglia abnormality and Î²-amyloid (AÎ²) deposition trigger disease development before identical symptoms emerge, which leads to poor clinical treatment effects in the later stages. In the early stage of disease progression, microglia in brains of 5XFAD mice have been activated by AÎ² plaques to secrete more pro-inflammatory cytokines. In the meantime, these cytokines up-regulate AÎ² via increasing the APP processing. Sodium butyrate (NaB), as one of the short chain fatty acid (SCFA) generated by gut microbiota, is the inhibitor of histone deacetylase (HDAC), which reduces the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In our experiment, 8-week-old 5XFAD mice and their litter WT mice were treated with NaB or normal saline for 2 weeks (WT + Vehicle group, WT + NaB group, AD + Vehicle group and AD + NaB group). After treatment, behavioral tests were carried out. The novel object recognition (NOR) and Morris water maze (MWM) tests demonstrated that there was no significant difference between four groups of mice. The results of long-term potentiation (LTP) and depotentiation (DEP) illustrated that the synaptic plasticity was promoted in 5XFAD mice after treatment with NaB. Compared to the AD + Vehicle group, the dendritic spines were more abundant in other groups of mice. Furthermore, the synapse-associated proteins (PSD-95, SYP, NR2B) were reduced and the pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-Î±, IL-6, IL-1Î²) were increased in the AD + Vehicle group. These phenomena were reversed after treatment with NaB. Moreover, our results suggested that NaB suppressed the over-activation of microglia and the accumulation of AÎ² in AD mice. Altogether, all results illustrated that HDAC inhibitor NaB could ameliorate the synaptic plasticity by reducing neuroinflammation in 5XFAD mice in the early stage of the disease.",33785315,,10.1016/j.cbi.2021.109452,45,Chemico-biological interactions,227276,5.168,0.3126847445964813,0.8662207357859532,0.44481605351170567,0.44981820461742056
"The role of the drebrin/EB3/Cdk5 pathway in dendritic spine plasticity, implications for Alzheimer's disease","The drebrin/EB3/Cdk5 intracellular signalling pathway couples actin filaments to dynamic microtubules in cellular settings where cells are changing shape. The pathway has been most intensively studied in neuronal development, particularly neuritogenesis and neuronal migration, and in synaptic plasticity at dendritic spines in mature neurons. Drebrin is an actin filament side-binding and bundling protein that stabilises actin filaments. The end-binding (EB) proteins are microtubule plus-end tracking proteins (+TIPs) that localise to the growing plus-ends of dynamic microtubules and regulate their behavior and the binding of other +TIP proteins. EB3 binds specifically to drebrin when drebrin is bound to actin filaments, for example at the base of a growth cone filopodium, and EB3 is located at the plus-end of a growing microtubule inserting into the filopodium. This interaction therefore forms the basis for coupling dynamic microtubules to actin filaments in growth cones of developing neurons. Appropriate responses to growth cone guidance cues depend on actin filament/microtubule co-ordination in the growth cone, although the role of the drebrin/EB3/Cdk5 pathway in this context has not been directly tested. A similar cytoskeleton coupling pathway operates in dendritic spines in mature neurons where the activity-dependent insertion of dynamic microtubules into dendritic spines is facilitated by drebrin binding to EB3. Microtubule insertion into dendritic spines drives spine maturation during long-term potentiation and therefore has a role in synaptic plasticity and memory formation. In Alzheimer's disease and related chronic neurodegenerative diseases, there is an early and dramatic loss of drebrin from dendritic spines that precedes synapse loss and neurodegeneration and might contribute to a failure of synaptic plasticity and hence to cognitive decline.",27365229,,10.1016/j.brainresbull.2016.06.015,14,Brain research bulletin,7605818,3.715,0.3090237081050873,0.5752508361204013,0.27759197324414714,0.35598278673596206
Dysregulated glial genes in Alzheimer's disease are essential for homeostatic plasticity: Evidence from integrative epigenetic and single cell analyses,"Synaptic homeostatic plasticity is a foundational regulatory mechanism that maintains the stability of synaptic and neural functions within the nervous system. Impairment of homeostatic regulation has been linked to synapse destabilization during the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent epigenetic and transcriptomic characterizations of the nervous system have revealed intricate molecular details about the aging brain and the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Yet, how abnormal epigenetic and transcriptomic alterations in different cell types in AD affect synaptic homeostatic plasticity remains to be elucidated. Various glial cell types play critical roles in modulating synaptic functions both during the aging process and in the context of AD. Here, we investigated the impact of glial dysregulation of histone acetylation and transcriptome in AD on synaptic homeostatic plasticity, using computational analysis combined with electrophysiological methods in Drosophila. By integrating snRNA-seq and H3K9ac ChIP-seq data from the same AD patient cohort, we pinpointed cell type-specific signature genes that were transcriptionally altered by histone acetylation. We subsequently investigated the role of these glial genes in regulating presynaptic homeostatic potentiation in Drosophila. Remarkably, nine glial-specific genes, which were identified through our computational method as targets of H3K9ac and transcriptional dysregulation, were found to be crucial for the regulation of synaptic homeostatic plasticity in Drosophila. Our genetic evidence connects abnormal glial transcriptomic changes in AD with the impairment of homeostatic plasticity in the nervous system. In summary, our integrative computational and genetic studies highlight specific glial genes as potential key players in the homeostatic imbalance observed in AD.",37712202,PMC10652298,10.1111/acel.13989,1,Aging cell,101130839,11.005,0.3073579967021942,0.12709030100334448,0.8762541806020067,0.3850836943423867
Impaired brain plasticity as a potential therapeutic target for treatment and prevention of dementia,"In 2017, it was estimated that close to 50 million people were living with dementia worldwide and this number is expected to double every 20 years. No effective treatment exists yet probably because by the time Alzheimer's dementia (AD) has developed it is too late to intervene. Areas covered: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a clinical state that typically precedes AD. In MCI, the prefrontal cortex supports compensatory mechanisms that depend on robust synaptic plasticity and that delay progression to AD. This review focuses on novel neurostimulation approaches that could enhance prefrontal cortical plasticity in vivo by enhancing prefrontal cortical plasticity and function in patients with MCI or AD. It also describes novel neurophysiological markers that could function as targets for such approaches. Expert commentary: Targeting synaptic plasticity in patients with early AD or at risk of developing AD could be a promising approach to slow progression or prevent AD.",30451545,,10.1080/14728222.2019.1550074,9,Expert opinion on therapeutic targets,101127833,6.797,0.3069423735141754,0.4882943143812709,0.6688963210702341,0.41560355119880626
Epigenetics and depression,"The risk for major depression is both genetically and environmentally determined. It has been proposed that epigenetic mechanisms could mediate the lasting increases in depression risk following exposure to adverse life events and provide a mechanistic framework within which genetic and environmental factors can be integrated. Epigenetics refers to processes affecting gene expression and translation that do not involve changes in the DNA sequence and include DNA methylation (DNAm) and microRNAs (miRNAs) as well as histone modifications. Here we review evidence for a role of epigenetics in the pathogenesis of depression from studies investigating DNAm, miRNAs, and histone modifications using different tissues and various experimental designs. From these studies, a model emerges where underlying genetic and environmental risk factors, and interactions between the two, could drive aberrant epigenetic mechanisms targeting stress response pathways, neuronal plasticity, and other behaviorally relevant pathways that have been implicated in major depression. .",31949407,PMC6952745,10.31887/DCNS.2019.21.4/ebinder,80,Dialogues in clinical neuroscience,101238198,0.0,0.3058009743690491,0.939799331103679,0.06688963210702341,0.38481837726356993

Evidence that Alzheimer's Disease Is a Disease of Competitive Synaptic Plasticity Gone Awry,"Mounting evidence indicates that a physiological function of amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) is to mediate neural activity-dependent homeostatic and competitive synaptic plasticity in the brain. I have previously summarized the lines of evidence supporting this hypothesis and highlighted the similarities between AÎ² and anti-microbial peptides in mediating cell/synapse competition. In cell competition, anti-microbial peptides deploy a multitude of mechanisms to ensure both self-protection and competitor elimination. Here I review recent studies showing that similar mechanisms are at play in AÎ²-mediated synapse competition and perturbations in these mechanisms underpin Alzheimer's disease (AD). Specifically, I discuss evidence that AÎ² and ApoE, two crucial players in AD, co-operate in the regulation of synapse competition. Glial ApoE promotes self-protection by increasing the production of trophic monomeric AÎ² and inhibiting its assembly into toxic oligomers. Conversely, AÎ² oligomers, once assembled, promote the elimination of competitor synapses via direct toxic activity and amplification of ""eat-me"" signals promoting the elimination of weak synapses. I further summarize evidence that neuronal ApoE may be part of a gene regulatory network that normally promotes competitive plasticity, explaining the selective vulnerability of ApoE expressing neurons in AD brains. Lastly, I discuss evidence that sleep may be key to AÎ²-orchestrated plasticity, in which sleep is not only induced by AÎ² but is also required for AÎ²-mediated plasticity, underlining the link between sleep and AD. Together, these results strongly argue that AD is a disease of competitive synaptic plasticity gone awry, a novel perspective that may promote AD research.",38669548,PMC11119021,10.3233/JAD-240042,0,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,4.16,0.30331891775131226,0.0802675585284281,0.3210702341137124,0.26225890917921546
The Protein Biochemistry of the Postsynaptic Density in Glutamatergic Synapses Mediates Learning in Neural Networks,"The strength of each excitatory synapse in the central nervous system is regulated by its prior activity in a process called synaptic plasticity. The initiation of synaptic plasticity occurs when calcium ions enter the postsynaptic compartment and encounter a subcellular structure called the postsynaptic density (PSD). The PSD is attached to the postsynaptic membrane just underneath the concentrated plaque of neurotransmitter receptors. It is comprised of a core set of 30-60 proteins, approximately 20 of which are scaffold proteins. The rest include protein kinases and phosphatases, some of which respond to calcium ion; small GTPases and their regulators; chaperones; ubiquitins; and proteases. The assembly of the PSD involves competitive binding among a variety of specific protein binding sites to form a dynamic network. A biochemical challenge for the future is to understand how the dynamic regulation of the structure, composition, and activity of the PSD mediates synaptic plasticity and how mutations in PSD proteins lead to mental and neurodegenerative diseases.",29913061,PMC7879948,10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00496,2,Biochemistry,370623,3.321,0.3020821511745453,0.1806020066889632,0.21739130434782608,0.260847952912085
Restoring Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling is a promising therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer's disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an aging-related neurological disorder characterized by synaptic loss and dementia. Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling is an essential signal transduction pathway that regulates numerous cellular processes including cell survival. In brain, Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling is not only crucial for neuronal survival and neurogenesis, but it plays important roles in regulating synaptic plasticity and blood-brain barrier integrity and function. Moreover, activation of Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling inhibits amyloid-Î² production and tau protein hyperphosphorylation in the brain. Critically, Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling is greatly suppressed in AD brain via multiple pathogenic mechanisms. As such, restoring Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling represents a unique opportunity for the rational design of novel AD therapies.",31801553,PMC6894260,10.1186/s13041-019-0525-5,100,Molecular brain,101468876,4.399,0.3007456064224243,0.9665551839464883,0.34448160535117056,0.44265472171298637
Brain Endothelial Cell-Derived Exosomes Induce Neuroplasticity in Rats with Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury,"Exosomes derived from the cerebral endothelial cells play essential roles in protecting neurons from hypoxia injury, but little is known regarding the biological effects and mechanisms of exosomes on brain plasticity. In this study, exosomes were isolated from rodent cerebral endothelial cells (bEnd.3 cells) by ultracentrifugation, either endothelial cell-derived exosomes (EC-Exo) or PBS was injected intraventricularly 2 h after the middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) model surgery in the Exo group and control group, respectively. Sham group rats received the same surgical but not ischemic procedure. We evaluated the motor function of rats after MCAO/R, and the foot-fault rate of the Exo group was significantly lower than that of the control group within 23 days (p< 0.05); the Catwalk analysis also showed gait difference between two groups (p< 0.05). On day 28 after MCAO/R, we euthanized the rats, removed the motor cortex from the brain, and then sequenced the genes by using GO and KEGG to find transcriptome analysis of biological terms and functional annotations: The pathway enrichment revealed that the function of synaptic transmission, regulation of synaptic plasticity, and regulation of synaptic vesicle cycle was significantly enriched with the Exo group than control group. Furthermore, the upregulation of synapsin-I expression in the motor cortex (p< 0.05) as well as the increase of the length of the dendrites were found in the Exo group (p< 0.05) than the control group. We determined the content of exosome microRNA levels, and microRNA-126-3p was the highest (TPM) by transcriptome analysis. Moreover, the microRNA-126-3p protected PC12 cells from apoptosis and increased neurite outgrowth, illustrating the mechanism of how exosomes play a role in altering brain plasticity. This study demonstrated that EC-Exo promoted functional motor recovery in the MCAO/R model, exosomes were critical for the reconstruction of synaptic function in ischemic brain injury, and microRNA-126-3p from EC-Exo could serve as a treatment for nerve damage.",32574032,,10.1021/acschemneuro.0c00089,21,ACS chemical neuroscience,101525337,5.78,0.29982224106788635,0.6889632107023411,0.5618729096989966,0.4300605687209994
"Cerebellin 4, a synaptic protein, enhances inhibitory activity and resistance of neurons to amyloid-Î² toxicity","Imbalances between excitatory and inhibitory transmissions in the brain anticipate the neuronal damage and death that occur in the neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD). We previously showed that amyloid-Î² (AÃ), a natural peptide involved in the onset and development of AD, counteracts the neurotrophic activity of the nerve growth factor (NGF) by dampening the Î³-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic connectivity of cultured hippocampal neurons. Neuronal plasticity is partly controlled by the NGF-promoted expression of the homologue of enhancer-of-split 1 (Hes1), a transcription factor that regulates the formation of GABAergic synapses. We now show that Hes1 controls the expression of cerebellin 4 (Cbln4), a member of a small family of secreted synaptic proteins, and we present the evidence that Cbln4 plays an essential role in the formation and maintenance of inhibitory GABAergic connections. Cbln4 immunoreactivity was found in the hippocampus, mostly in the dendrites and somata of pyramidal neurons. In the CA1, the hippocampal region where the first neurons degenerate in AD, Cbln4 immunoreactivity was associated with GABAergic synapses (detected by vesicular inhibitory amino acid transporter [VGAT] immunostaining), which appear to surround and embrace the somata of CA1 pyramidal neurons (basket cells). Moreover, significant decreases of Hes1, Cbln4, and VGAT immunoreactivities and messenger RNA expression were found in the hippocampus of a mouse model of AD. We also found that either the overexpression of Cbln4 in cultured hippocampal neurons or the application of recombinant Cbln4 to the cultures increased the number of GABAergic varicosities, rescuing neurons from AÃ-induced death. In contrast, knockdown of Cbln4 gene in cultured neurons was followed by a large reduction of GABAergic connections. Such an effect was reverted by exogenously added Cbln4. These findings suggest a therapeutic potential for Cbln4 in the treatment of AD.",25534236,,10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2014.11.006,15,Neurobiology of aging,8100437,5.133,0.2995148003101349,0.5953177257525084,0.4414715719063545,0.3870667397178535

Extracellular Forms of AÎ² and Tau from iPSC Models of Alzheimer's Disease Disrupt Synaptic Plasticity,"The early stages of Alzheimer's disease are associated with synaptic dysfunction prior to overt loss of neurons. To identify extracellular molecules that impair synaptic plasticity in the brain, we studied the secretomes of human iPSC-derived neuronal models of Alzheimer's disease. When introduced into the rat brain, secretomes from human neurons with either a presenilin-1 mutation, amyloid precursor protein duplication, or trisomy of chromosome 21 all strongly inhibit hippocampal long-term potentiation. Synaptic dysfunction caused by presenilin-1 mutant and amyloid precusor protein duplication secretomes is mediated by AÎ² peptides, whereas trisomy of chromosome 21 (trisomy 21) neuronal secretomes induce dysfunction through extracellular tau. In all cases, synaptotoxicity is relieved by antibody blockade of cellular prion protein. These data indicate that human models of Alzheimer's disease generate distinct proteins that converge at the level of cellular prion protein to induce synaptic dysfunction in vivo.",29768194,PMC5972225,10.1016/j.celrep.2018.04.040,36,Cell reports,101573691,9.995,0.2970619201660156,0.822742474916388,0.8394648829431438,0.5106786236715157
Synapse-to-Nucleus Signaling in Neurodegenerative and Neuropsychiatric Disorders,"Synapse-to-nucleus signaling is critical for converting signals received at synapses into transcriptional programs essential for cognition, memory, and emotion. This neuronal mechanism usually involves activity-dependent translocation of synaptonuclear factors from synapses to the nucleus resulting in regulation of transcriptional programs underlying synaptic plasticity. Acting as synapse-to-nucleus messengers, amyloid precursor protein intracellular domain associated-1 protein, cAMP response element binding protein (CREB)-regulated transcription coactivator-1, Jacob, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells, RING finger protein 10, and SH3 and multiple ankyrin repeat domains 3 play essential roles in synapse remodeling and plasticity, which are considered the cellular basis of memory. Other synaptic proteins, such as extracellular signal-regulated kinase, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II gamma, and CREB2, translocate from dendrites or cytosol to the nucleus upon synaptic activity, suggesting that they could contribute to synapse-to-nucleus signaling. Notably, some synaptonuclear factors converge on the transcription factor CREB, indicating that CREB signaling is a key hub mediating integration of synaptic signals into transcriptional programs required for neuronal function and plasticity. Although major efforts have been focused on identification and regulatory mechanisms of synaptonuclear factors, the relevance of synapse-to-nucleus communication in brain physiology and pathology is still unclear. Recent evidence, however, indicates that synaptonuclear factors are implicated in neuropsychiatric, neurodevelopmental, and neurodegenerative disorders, suggesting that uncoupling synaptic activity from nuclear signaling may prompt synapse pathology, contributing to a broad spectrum of brain disorders. This review summarizes current knowledge of synapse-to-nucleus signaling in neuron survival, synaptic function and plasticity, and memory. Finally, we discuss how altered synapse-to-nucleus signaling may lead to memory and emotional disturbances, which is relevant for clinical and therapeutic strategies in neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases.",30846302,,10.1016/j.biopsych.2019.01.006,13,Biological psychiatry,213264,12.81,0.2952299118041992,0.5451505016722408,0.8996655518394648,0.46610115778486066
Activation of Î²2-adrenergic receptor promotes dendrite ramification and spine generation in APP/PS1 mice,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder, and currently there is no effective cure for this devastating disease. Decreases in the levels of Î²2-adrenoceptor (Î²2-AR) and norepinephrine have been reported in several regions of AD brains. The activation of Î²2AR can prevent the amyloid Î² (AÎ²)-mediated inhibition of LTP (Long-term potentiation), but the mechanism is not fully understood. Here, we used APP/PS1 mice to study whether the activation of Î²2AR could remodel synaptic and/or dendritic plasticity. We found that the activation of Î²2AR by Clenbuterol (Clen) ameliorated memory deficits and promoted dendrite ramification and spine generation in hippocampal CA1 neurons, which was accompanied by the upregulation of postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95), synapsin 1 and synaptophysin. Conversely, the inhibition of Î²2AR by a siRNA blocked the Clen-induced increase in dendrite ramification and dendritic spines in primary hippocampal neurons. Furthermore, the activation of Î²2AR decreased cerebral amyloid plaques through the up-regulation of Î±-secretase activity and by decreasing the phosphorylation of APP at Thr668. Based on the roles of Î²2AR in dendrite ramification and spine generation, memory deficits and AD pathogenesis, compounds designed to activate Î²2AR might shed light on the cure of AD.",27838449,,10.1016/j.neulet.2016.11.022,13,Neuroscience letters,7600130,3.197,0.2941135764122009,0.5484949832775919,0.2140468227424749,0.32897650705133397
mRNA changes in nucleus accumbens related to methamphetamine addiction in mice,"Methamphetamine (METH) is a highly addictive psychostimulant that elicits aberrant changes in the expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the nucleus accumbens of mice, indicating a potential role of METH in post-transcriptional regulations. To decipher the potential consequences of these post-transcriptional regulations in response to METH, we performed strand-specific RNA sequencing (ssRNA-Seq) to identify alterations in mRNA expression and their alternative splicing in the nucleus accumbens of mice following exposure to METH. METH-mediated changes in mRNAs were analyzed and correlated with previously reported changes in non-coding RNAs (miRNAs and lncRNAs) to determine the potential functions of these mRNA changes observed here and how non-coding RNAs are involved. A total of 2171 mRNAs were differentially expressed in response to METH with functions involved in synaptic plasticity, mitochondrial energy metabolism and immune response. 309 and 589 of these mRNAs are potential targets of miRNAs and lncRNAs respectively. In addition, METH treatment decreases mRNA alternative splicing, and there are 818 METH-specific events not observed in saline-treated mice. Our results suggest that METH-mediated addiction could be attributed by changes in miRNAs and lncRNAs and consequently, changes in mRNA alternative splicing and expression. In conclusion, our study reported a methamphetamine-modified nucleus accumbens transcriptome and provided non-coding RNA-mRNA interaction networks possibly involved in METH addiction.",27869204,PMC5116666,10.1038/srep36993,26,Scientific reports,101563288,4.996,0.29370826482772827,0.7558528428093646,0.4180602006688963,0.4110075675922891
RBM3 mediates structural plasticity and protective effects of cooling in neurodegeneration,"In the healthy adult brain synapses are continuously remodelled through a process of elimination and formation known as structural plasticity. Reduction in synapse number is a consistent early feature of neurodegenerative diseases, suggesting deficient compensatory mechanisms. Although much is known about toxic processes leading to synaptic dysfunction and loss in these disorders, how synaptic regeneration is affected is unknown. In hibernating mammals, cooling induces loss of synaptic contacts, which are reformed on rewarming, a form of structural plasticity. We have found that similar changes occur in artificially cooled laboratory rodents. Cooling and hibernation also induce a number of cold-shock proteins in the brain, including the RNA binding protein, RBM3 (ref. 6). The relationship of such proteins to structural plasticity is unknown. Here we show that synapse regeneration is impaired in mouse models of neurodegenerative disease, in association with the failure to induce RBM3. In both prion-infected and 5XFAD (Alzheimer-type) mice, the capacity to regenerate synapses after cooling declined in parallel with the loss of induction of RBM3. Enhanced expression of RBM3 in the hippocampus prevented this deficit and restored the capacity for synapse reassembly after cooling. RBM3 overexpression, achieved either by boosting endogenous levels through hypothermia before the loss of the RBM3 response or by lentiviral delivery, resulted in sustained synaptic protection in 5XFAD mice and throughout the course of prion disease, preventing behavioural deficits and neuronal loss and significantly prolonging survival. In contrast, knockdown of RBM3 exacerbated synapse loss in both models and accelerated disease and prevented the neuroprotective effects of cooling. Thus, deficient synapse regeneration, mediated at least in part by failure of the RBM3 stress response, contributes to synapse loss throughout the course of neurodegenerative disease. The data support enhancing cold-shock pathways as potential protective therapies in neurodegenerative disorders.",25607368,PMC4338605,10.1038/nature14142,111,Nature,410462,69.504,0.2901756167411804,0.979933110367893,1.0,0.5700919921182869
"Regulation of intrinsic excitability: Roles for learning and memory, aging and Alzheimer's disease, and genetic diversity","Plasticity of intrinsic neuronal excitability facilitates learning and memory across multiple species, with aberrant modulation of this process being linked to the development of neurological symptoms in models of cognitive aging and Alzheimer's disease. Learning-related increases in intrinsic excitability of neurons occurs in a variety of brain regions, and is generally thought to promote information processing and storage through enhancement of synaptic throughput and induction of synaptic plasticity. Experience-dependent changes in intrinsic neuronal excitability rely on activity-dependent gene expression patterns, which can be influenced by genetic and environmental factors, aging, and disease. Reductions in baseline intrinsic excitability, as well as aberrant plasticity of intrinsic neuronal excitability and in some cases pathological hyperexcitability, have been associated with cognitive deficits in animal models of both normal cognitive aging and Alzheimer's disease. Genetic factors that modulate plasticity of intrinsic excitability likely underlie individual differences in cognitive function and susceptibility to cognitive decline. Thus, targeting molecular mediators that either control baseline intrinsic neuronal excitability, subserve learning-related intrinsic neuronal plasticity, and/or promote resilience may be a promising therapeutic strategy for maintaining cognitive function in aging and disease. In this review, we discuss the complementary relationship between intrinsic excitability and learning, with a particular focus on how this relationship varies as a function of age, disease state, and genetic make-up, and how targeting these factors may help to further elucidate our understanding of the role of intrinsic excitability in cognitive function and cognitive decline.",31442579,PMC6752224,10.1016/j.nlm.2019.107069,17,Neurobiology of learning and memory,9508166,3.109,0.28876960277557373,0.6187290969899666,0.17725752508361203,0.3324590860800599
Sex-specific accelerated decay in time/activity-dependent plasticity and associative memory in an animal model of Alzheimer's disease,"Clinical studies have shown that female brains are more predisposed to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the cellular and molecular mechanisms behind this disparity remain unknown. In several mouse models of AD, synaptic plasticity dysfunction is an early event and appears before significant accumulation of amyloid plaques and neuronal degeneration. However, it is unclear whether sexual dimorphism at the synaptic level contributes to the higher risk and prevalence of AD in females. Our studies on APP/PS1 (APPSwe/PS1dE9) mouse model show that AD impacts hippocampal long-term plasticity in a sex-specific manner. Long-term potentiation (LTP) induced by strong tetanic stimulation (STET), theta burst stimulation (TBS) and population spike timing-dependent plasticity (pSTDP) show a faster decay in AD females compared with age-matched AD males. In addition, behavioural tagging (BT), a model of associative memory, is specifically impaired in AD females with a faster decay in memory compared with males. Together with the plasticity and behavioural data, we also observed an upregulation of neuroinflammatory markers, along with downregulation of transcripts that regulate cellular processes associated with synaptic plasticity and memory in females. Immunohistochemistry of AD brains confirms that female APP/PS1 mice carry a higher amyloid plaque burden and have enhanced microglial activation compared with male APP/PS1 mice. Their presence in the diseased mice also suggests a link between the impairment of LTP and the upregulation of the inflammatory response. Overall, our data show that synaptic plasticity and associative memory impairments are more prominent in females and this might account for the faster progression of AD in females.",34796608,PMC8672784,10.1111/acel.13502,8,Aging cell,101130839,11.005,0.2884688675403595,0.431438127090301,0.8795986622073578,0.43528867838374746
From the genetic architecture to synaptic plasticity in autism spectrum disorder,"Genetics studies of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have identified several risk genes that are key regulators of synaptic plasticity. Indeed, many of the risk genes that have been linked to these disorders encode synaptic scaffolding proteins, receptors, cell adhesion molecules or proteins that are involved in chromatin remodelling, transcription, protein synthesis or degradation, or actin cytoskeleton dynamics. Changes in any of these proteins can increase or decrease synaptic strength or number and, ultimately, neuronal connectivity in the brain. In addition, when deleterious mutations occur, inefficient genetic buffering and impaired synaptic homeostasis may increase an individual's risk for ASD.",26289574,,10.1038/nrn3992,432,Nature reviews.
