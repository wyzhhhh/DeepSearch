Using machine learning approaches for multi-omics data analysis: A review,"With the development of modern high-throughput omic measurement platforms, it has become essential for biomedical studies to undertake an integrative (combined) approach to fully utilise these data to gain insights into biological systems. Data from various omics sources such as genetics, proteomics, and metabolomics can be integrated to unravel the intricate working of systems biology using machine learning-based predictive algorithms. Machine learning methods offer novel techniques to integrate and analyse the various omics data enabling the discovery of new biomarkers. These biomarkers have the potential to help in accurate disease prediction, patient stratification and delivery of precision medicine. This review paper explores different integrative machine learning methods which have been used to provide an in-depth understanding of biological systems during normal physiological functioning and in the presence of a disease. It provides insight and recommendations for interdisciplinary professionals who envisage employing machine learning skills in multi-omics studies.",33794304,,10.1016/j.biotechadv.2021.107739,157,Biotechnology advances,8403708,17.681
"Oxidative stress gene expression, DNA methylation, and gut microbiota interaction trigger Crohn's disease: a multi-omics Mendelian randomization study","Background:Oxidative stress (OS) is a key pathophysiological mechanism in Crohn's disease (CD). OS-related genes can be affected by environmental factors, intestinal inflammation, gut microbiota, and epigenetic changes. However, the role of OS as a potential CD etiological factor or triggering factor is unknown, as differentially expressed OS genes in CD can be either a cause or a subsequent change of intestinal inflammation. Herein, we used a multi-omics summary data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR) approach to identify putative causal effects and underlying mechanisms of OS genes in CD.Methods:OS-related genes were extracted from the GeneCards database. Intestinal transcriptome datasets were collected from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and meta-analyzed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to OS in CD. Integration analyses of the largest CD genome-wide association study (GWAS) summaries with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and DNA methylation QTLs (mQTLs) from the blood were performed using SMR methods to prioritize putative blood OS genes and their regulatory elements associated with CD risk. Up-to-date intestinal eQTLs and fecal microbial QTLs (mbQTLs) were integrated to uncover potential interactions between host OS gene expression and gut microbiota through SMR and colocalization analysis. Two additional Mendelian randomization (MR) methods were used as sensitivity analyses. Putative results were validated in an independent multi-omics cohort from the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University (FAH-SYS).Results:A meta-analysis from six datasets identified 438 OS-related DEGs enriched in intestinal enterocytes in CD from 817 OS-related genes. Five genes from blood tissue were prioritized as candidate CD-causal genes using three-step SMR methods: BAD, SHC1, STAT3, MUC1, and GPX3. Furthermore, SMR analysis also identified five putative intestinal genes, three of which were involved in gene-microbiota interactions through colocalization analysis: MUC1, CD40, and PRKAB1. Validation results showed that 88.79% of DEGs were replicated in the FAH-SYS cohort. Associations between pairs of MUC1-Bacillus aciditolerans and PRKAB1-Escherichia coli in the FAH-SYS cohort were consistent with eQTL-mbQTL colocalization.Conclusions:This multi-omics integration study highlighted that OS genes causal to CD are regulated by DNA methylation and host-microbiota interactions. This provides evidence for future targeted functional research aimed at developing suitable therapeutic interventions and disease prevention.",37170220,PMC10173549,10.1186/s12916-023-02878-8,18,BMC medicine,101190723,11.15
Artificial intelligence-based multi-omics analysis fuels cancer precision medicine,"With biotechnological advancements, innovative omics technologies are constantly emerging that have enabled researchers to access multi-layer information from the genome, epigenome, transcriptome, proteome, metabolome, and more. A wealth of omics technologies, including bulk and single-cell omics approaches, have empowered to characterize different molecular layers at unprecedented scale and resolution, providing a holistic view of tumor behavior. Multi-omics analysis allows systematic interrogation of various molecular information at each biological layer while posing tricky challenges regarding how to extract valuable insights from the exponentially increasing amount of multi-omics data. Therefore, efficient algorithms are needed to reduce the dimensionality of the data while simultaneously dissecting the mysteries behind the complex biological processes of cancer. Artificial intelligence has demonstrated the ability to analyze complementary multi-modal data streams within the oncology realm. The coincident development of multi-omics technologies and artificial intelligence algorithms has fuelled the development of cancer precision medicine. Here, we present state-of-the-art omics technologies and outline a roadmap of multi-omics integration analysis using an artificial intelligence strategy. The advances made using artificial intelligence-based multi-omics approaches are described, especially concerning early cancer screening, diagnosis, response assessment, and prognosis prediction. Finally, we discuss the challenges faced in multi-omics analysis, along with tentative future trends in this field. With the increasing application of artificial intelligence in multi-omics analysis, we anticipate a shifting paradigm in precision medicine becoming driven by artificial intelligence-based multi-omics technologies.",36596352,,10.1016/j.semcancer.2022.12.009,26,Seminars in cancer biology,9010218,17.012
Integrative Analysis of Multi-omics Data for Discovery and Functional Studies of Complex Human Diseases,"Complex and dynamic networks of molecules are involved in human diseases. High-throughput technologies enable omics studies interrogating thousands to millions of makers with similar biochemical properties (eg, transcriptomics for RNA transcripts). However, a single layer of ""omics"" can only provide limited insights into the biological mechanisms of a disease. In the case of genome-wide association studies, although thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms have been identified for complex diseases and traits, the functional implications and mechanisms of the associated loci are largely unknown. Additionally, the genomic variants alone are not able to explain the changing disease risk across the life span. DNA, RNA, protein, and metabolite often have complementary roles to jointly perform a certain biological function. Such complementary effects and synergistic interactions between omic layers in the life course can only be captured by integrative study of multiple molecular layers. Building upon the success in single-omics discovery research, population studies started adopting the multi-omics approach to better understanding the molecular function and disease etiology. Multi-omics approaches integrate data obtained from different omic levels to understand their interrelation and combined influence on the disease processes. Here, we summarize major omics approaches available in population research, and review integrative approaches and methodologies interrogating multiple omic layers, which enhance the gene discovery and functional analysis of human diseases. We seek to provide analytical recommendations for different types of multi-omics data and study designs to guide the emerging multi-omic research, and to suggest improvement of the existing analytical methods.",26915271,PMC5742494,10.1016/bs.adgen.2015.11.004,161,Advances in genetics,370421,3.88
A roadmap for multi-omics data integration using deep learning,"High-throughput next-generation sequencing now makes it possible to generate a vast amount of multi-omics data for various applications. These data have revolutionized biomedical research by providing a more comprehensive understanding of the biological systems and molecular mechanisms of disease development. Recently, deep learning (DL) algorithms have become one of the most promising methods in multi-omics data analysis, due to their predictive performance and capability of capturing nonlinear and hierarchical features. While integrating and translating multi-omics data into useful functional insights remain the biggest bottleneck, there is a clear trend towards incorporating multi-omics analysis in biomedical research to help explain the complex relationships between molecular layers. Multi-omics data have a role to improve prevention, early detection and prediction; monitor progression; interpret patterns and endotyping; and design personalized treatments. In this review, we outline a roadmap of multi-omics integration using DL and offer a practical perspective into the advantages, challenges and barriers to the implementation of DL in multi-omics data.",34791014,PMC8769688,10.1093/bib/bbab454,55,Briefings in bioinformatics,100912837,13.994
Integrated multi-omics profiling yields a clinically relevant molecular classification for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma,"Integrated molecular analysis of human cancer has yielded molecular classification for precise management of cancer patients. Here, we analyzed the whole genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data of 155 esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCCs). Multi-omics analysis led to the classification of ESCCs into four subtypes: cell cycle pathway activation, NRF2 oncogenic activation, immune suppression (IS), and immune modulation (IM). IS and IM cases were highly immune infiltrated but differed in the type and distribution of immune cells. IM cases showed better response to immune checkpoint blockade therapy than other subtypes in a clinical trial. We further developed a classifier with 28 features to identify the IM subtype, which predicted anti-PD-1 therapy response with 85.7% sensitivity and 90% specificity. These results emphasize the clinical value of unbiased molecular classification based on multi-omics data and have the potential to further improve the understanding and treatment of ESCC.",36584672,,10.1016/j.ccell.2022.12.004,23,Cancer cell,101130617,38.585
Cell-free multi-omics analysis reveals potential biomarkers in gastrointestinal cancer patients' blood,"During cancer progression, tumorigenic and immune signals are spread through circulating molecules, such as cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and cell-free RNA (cfRNA) in the blood. So far, they have not been comprehensively investigated in gastrointestinal cancers. Here, we profile 4 categories of cell-free omics data from patients with colorectal cancer and patients with stomach adenocarcinoma and then assay 15 types of genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic variations. We find that multi-omics data are more appropriate for detection of cancer genes compared with single-omics data. In particular, cfRNAs are more sensitive and informative than cfDNAs in terms of detection rate, enriched functional pathways, etc. Moreover, we identify several peripheral immune signatures that are suppressed in patients with cancer. Specifically, we establish a γδ-T cell score and a cancer-associated-fibroblast (CAF) score, providing insights into clinical statuses like cancer stage and survival. Overall, we reveal a cell-free multi-molecular landscape that is useful for blood monitoring in personalized cancer treatment.",37992683,PMC10694666,10.1016/j.xcrm.2023.101281,1,Cell reports.

Machine learning for precision medicine,"Precision medicine is an emerging approach to clinical research and patient care that focuses on understanding and treating disease by integrating multi-modal or multi-omics data from an individual to make patient-tailored decisions. With the large and complex datasets generated using precision medicine diagnostic approaches, novel techniques to process and understand these complex data were needed. At the same time, computer science has progressed rapidly to develop techniques that enable the storage, processing, and analysis of these complex datasets, a feat that traditional statistics and early computing technologies could not accomplish. Machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, is a computer science methodology that aims to identify complex patterns in data that can be used to make predictions or classifications on new unseen data or for advanced exploratory data analysis. Machine learning analysis of precision medicine's multi-modal data allows for broad analysis of large datasets and ultimately a greater understanding of human health and disease. This review focuses on machine learning utilization for precision medicine's ""big data"", in the context of genetics, genomics, and beyond.",33091314,,10.1139/gen-2020-0131,109,Genome,8704544,2.449
Multi-omics research strategies in ischemic stroke: A multidimensional perspective,"Ischemic stroke (IS) is a multifactorial and heterogeneous neurological disorder with high rate of death and long-term impairment. Despite years of studies, there are still no stroke biomarkers for clinical practice, and the molecular mechanisms of stroke remain largely unclear. The high-throughput omics approach provides new avenues for discovering biomarkers of IS and explaining its pathological mechanisms. However, single-omics approaches only provide a limited understanding of the biological pathways of diseases. The integration of multiple omics data means the simultaneous analysis of thousands of genes, RNAs, proteins and metabolites, revealing networks of interactions between multiple molecular levels. Integrated analysis of multi-omics approaches will provide helpful insights into stroke pathogenesis, therapeutic target identification and biomarker discovery. Here, we consider advances in genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics and outline their use in discovering the biomarkers and pathological mechanisms of IS. We then delineate strategies for achieving integration at the multi-omics level and discuss how integrative omics and systems biology can contribute to our understanding and management of IS.",36087702,,10.1016/j.arr.2022.101730,12,Ageing research reviews,101128963,11.788
DIABLO: an integrative approach for identifying key molecular drivers from multi-omics assays,"Motivation:In the continuously expanding omics era, novel computational and statistical strategies are needed for data integration and identification of biomarkers and molecular signatures. We present Data Integration Analysis for Biomarker discovery using Latent cOmponents (DIABLO), a multi-omics integrative method that seeks for common information across different data types through the selection of a subset of molecular features, while discriminating between multiple phenotypic groups.Results:Using simulations and benchmark multi-omics studies, we show that DIABLO identifies features with superior biological relevance compared with existing unsupervised integrative methods, while achieving predictive performance comparable to state-of-the-art supervised approaches. DIABLO is versatile, allowing for modular-based analyses and cross-over study designs. In two case studies, DIABLO identified both known and novel multi-omics biomarkers consisting of mRNAs, miRNAs, CpGs, proteins and metabolites.Availability and implementation:DIABLO is implemented in the mixOmics R Bioconductor package with functions for parameters' choice and visualization to assist in the interpretation of the integrative analyses, along with tutorials on http://mixomics.org and in our Bioconductor vignette.Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",30657866,PMC6735831,10.1093/bioinformatics/bty1054,284,"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",9808944,6.931
Integrating genetic and non-genetic determinants of cancer evolution by single-cell multi-omics,"Cancer represents an evolutionary process through which growing malignant populations genetically diversify, leading to tumour progression, relapse and resistance to therapy. In addition to genetic diversity, the cell-to-cell variation that fuels evolutionary selection also manifests in cellular states, epigenetic profiles, spatial distributions and interactions with the microenvironment. Therefore, the study of cancer requires the integration of multiple heritable dimensions at the resolution of the single cell - the atomic unit of somatic evolution. In this Review, we discuss emerging analytic and experimental technologies for single-cell multi-omics that enable the capture and integration of multiple data modalities to inform the study of cancer evolution. These data show that cancer results from a complex interplay between genetic and non-genetic determinants of somatic evolution.",32807900,PMC8450921,10.1038/s41576-020-0265-5,144,Nature reviews.

Multi-omics integration in biomedical research - A metabolomics-centric review,"Recent advances in high-throughput technologies have enabled the profiling of multiple layers of a biological system, including DNA sequence data (genomics), RNA expression levels (transcriptomics), and metabolite levels (metabolomics). This has led to the generation of vast amounts of biological data that can be integrated in so-called multi-omics studies to examine the complex molecular underpinnings of health and disease. Integrative analysis of such datasets is not straightforward and is particularly complicated by the high dimensionality and heterogeneity of the data and by the lack of universal analysis protocols. Previous reviews have discussed various strategies to address the challenges of data integration, elaborating on specific aspects, such as network inference or feature selection techniques. Thereby, the main focus has been on the integration of two omics layers in their relation to a phenotype of interest. In this review we provide an overview over a typical multi-omics workflow, focusing on integration methods that have the potential to combine metabolomics data with two or more omics. We discuss multiple integration concepts including data-driven, knowledge-based, simultaneous and step-wise approaches. We highlight the application of these methods in recent multi-omics studies, including large-scale integration efforts aiming at a global depiction of the complex relationships within and between different biological layers without focusing on a particular phenotype.",33248648,PMC7701361,10.1016/j.aca.2020.10.038,68,Analytica chimica acta,370534,6.911
DeepProg: an ensemble of deep-learning and machine-learning models for prognosis prediction using multi-omics data,"Multi-omics data are good resources for prognosis and survival prediction; however, these are difficult to integrate computationally. We introduce DeepProg, a novel ensemble framework of deep-learning and machine-learning approaches that robustly predicts patient survival subtypes using multi-omics data. It identifies two optimal survival subtypes in most cancers and yields significantly better risk-stratification than other multi-omics integration methods. DeepProg is highly predictive, exemplified by two liver cancer (C-index 0.73-0.80) and five breast cancer datasets (C-index 0.68-0.73). Pan-cancer analysis associates common genomic signatures in poor survival subtypes with extracellular matrix modeling, immune deregulation, and mitosis processes.

Integrative Multi-omics Analysis of Childhood Aggressive Behavior,"This study introduces and illustrates the potential of an integrated multi-omics approach in investigating the underlying biology of complex traits such as childhood aggressive behavior. In 645 twins (cases = 42%), we trained single- and integrative multi-omics models to identify biomarkers for subclinical aggression and investigated the connections among these biomarkers. Our data comprised transmitted and two non-transmitted polygenic scores (PGSs) for 15 traits, 78,772 CpGs, and 90 metabolites. The single-omics models selected 31 PGSs, 1614 CpGs, and 90 metabolites, and the multi-omics model comprised 44 PGSs, 746 CpGs, and 90 metabolites. The predictive accuracy for these models in the test (N = 277, cases = 42%) and independent clinical data (N = 142, cases = 45%) ranged from 43 to 57%. We observed strong connections between DNA methylation, amino acids, and parental non-transmitted PGSs for ADHD, Autism Spectrum Disorder, intelligence, smoking initiation, and self-reported health. Aggression-related omics traits link to known and novel risk factors, including inflammation, carcinogens, and smoking.",36344863,PMC9922241,10.1007/s10519-022-10126-7,3,Behavior genetics,251711,2.965
A Customizable Analysis Flow in Integrative Multi-Omics,"The number of researchers using multi-omics is growing. Though still expensive, every year it is cheaper to perform multi-omic studies, often exponentially so. In addition to its increasing accessibility, multi-omics reveals a view of systems biology to an unprecedented depth. Thus, multi-omics can be used to answer a broad range of biological questions in finer resolution than previous methods. We used six omic measurements-four nucleic acid (i.e., genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomics, and metagenomic) and two mass spectrometry (proteomics and metabolomics) based-to highlight an analysis workflow on this type of data, which is often vast. This workflow is not exhaustive of all the omic measurements or analysis methods, but it will provide an experienced or even a novice multi-omic researcher with the tools necessary to analyze their data. This review begins with analyzing a single ome and study design, and then synthesizes best practices in data integration techniques that include machine learning. Furthermore, we delineate methods to validate findings from multi-omic integration. Ultimately, multi-omic integration offers a window into the complexity of molecular interactions and a comprehensive view of systems biology.",33260881,PMC7760368,10.3390/biom10121606,7,Biomolecules,101596414,6.064
Multi-Omics Data Analysis Identifies Prognostic Biomarkers across Cancers,"Combining omics data from different layers using integrative methods provides a better understanding of the biology of a complex disease such as cancer. The discovery of biomarkers related to cancer development or prognosis helps to find more effective treatment options. This study integrates multi-omics data of different cancer types with a network-based approach to explore common gene modules among different tumors by running community detection methods on the integrated network. The common modules were evaluated by several biological metrics adapted to cancer. Then, a new prognostic scoring method was developed by weighting mRNA expression, methylation, and mutation status of genes. The survival analysis pointed out statistically significant results forGNG11,CBX2,CDKN3,ARHGEF10,CLN8,SEC61GandPTDSS1genes. The literature search reveals that the identified biomarkers are associated with the same or different types of cancers. Our method does not only identify known cancer-specific biomarker genes, but also proposes new potential biomarkers. Thus, this study provides a rationale for identifying new gene targets and expanding treatment options across cancer types.",37489460,PMC10366886,10.3390/medsci11030044,3,"Medical sciences (Basel, Switzerland)",101629322,0.0
Integrative analysis of multi-omics data for liquid biopsy,"The innovation of liquid biopsy holds great potential to revolutionise cancer management through early diagnosis and timely treatment of cancer. Integrative analysis of different tumour-derived omics data (such as genomics, epigenetics, fragmentomics, and proteomics) from body fluids for cancer detection and monitoring could outperform the analysis of single modality data alone. In this review, we focussed on the discussion of early cancer detection and molecular residual disease surveillance based on multi-omics data of blood. We summarised diverse types of tumour-derived components, current popular platforms for profiling cancer-associated signals, machine learning approaches for joint analysis of liquid biopsy data, as well as multi-omics-based early detection of cancers, molecular residual disease monitoring, and treatment response surveillance. We also discussed the challenges and future directions of multi-omics-based liquid biopsy. With the development of both experimental protocols and computational methods dedicated to liquid biopsy, the implementation of multi-omics strategies into the clinical workflow will likely benefit the clinical management of cancers including decision-making guidance and patient outcome improvement.",36357703,PMC9938261,10.1038/s41416-022-02048-2,5,British journal of cancer,370635,9.075
Computational Analysis of Phosphoproteomics Data in Multi-Omics Cancer Studies,"Multiple types of molecular data for the same set of clinical samples are increasingly available and may be analyzed jointly in an integrative analysis to maximize comprehensive biological insight. This analysis is important as separate analyses of individual omics data types usually do not fully explain disease phenotypes. An increasing number of studies have now been focusing on multi-omics data integration, yet not many studies have included phosphoproteomics data, an important layer for understanding signaling pathways. Multi-omics integration methods with phosphoproteomics data are reviewed in the context of cancer research as well as multi-omics methods papers that would be promising to apply to phosphoproteomics data. Analysis of individual data types is still the major approach even in large cohort proteogenomics studies. Hence, a section is dedicated on possible integrative methods for multi-omics and phosphoproteomics data. In summary, this review provides the readers with both currently used integrative methods previously applied to phosphoproteomics and multi-omics data integration and other algorithms for multi-omics data integration promising for future application to phosphoproteomics data.",32875713,,10.1002/pmic.201900312,7,Proteomics,101092707,5.393
Spatial transformation of multi-omics data unlocks novel insights into cancer biology,"The application of next-generation sequencing (NGS) has transformed cancer research. As costs have decreased, NGS has increasingly been applied to generate multiple layers of molecular data from the same samples, covering genomics, transcriptomics, and methylomics. Integrating these types of multi-omics data in a combined analysis is now becoming a common issue with no obvious solution, often handled on an ad hoc basis, with multi-omics data arriving in a tabular format and analyzed using computationally intensive statistical methods. These methods particularly ignore the spatial orientation of the genome and often apply stringent p-value corrections that likely result in the loss of true positive associations. Here, we present GENIUS (GEnome traNsformatIon and spatial representation of mUltiomicS data), a framework for integrating multi-omics data using deep learning models developed for advanced image analysis. The GENIUS framework is able to transform multi-omics data into images with genes displayed as spatially connected pixels and successfully extract relevant information with respect to the desired output. We demonstrate the utility of GENIUS by applying the framework to multi-omics datasets from the Cancer Genome Atlas. Our results are focused on predicting the development of metastatic cancer from primary tumors, and demonstrate how through model inference, we are able to extract the genes which are driving the model prediction and are likely associated with metastatic disease progression. We anticipate our framework to be a starting point and strong proof of concept for multi-omics data transformation and analysis without the need for statistical correction.",37669321,PMC10479962,10.7554/eLife.87133,1,eLife,101579614,8.713
Multi-Staged Data-Integrated Multi-Omics Analysis for Symptom Science Research,"The incorporation of omics approaches into symptom science research can provide researchers with information about the molecular mechanisms that underlie symptoms. Most of the omics analyses in symptom science have used a single omics approach. Therefore, these analyses are limited by the information contained within a specific omics domain (e.g., genomics and inherited variations, transcriptomics and gene function). A multi-staged data-integrated multi-omics (MS-DIMO) analysis integrates multiple types of omics data in a single study. With this integration, a MS-DIMO analysis can provide a more comprehensive picture of the complex biological mechanisms that underlie symptoms. The results of a MS-DIMO analysis can be used to refine mechanistic hypotheses and/or discover therapeutic targets for specific symptoms. The purposes of this paper are to: (1) describe a MS-DIMO analysis using ""Symptom X"" as an example; (2) discuss a number of challenges associated with specific omics analyses and how a MS-DIMO analysis can address them; (3) describe the various orders of omics data that can be used in a MS-DIMO analysis; (4) describe omics analysis tools; and (5) review case exemplars of MS-DIMO analyses in symptom science. This paper provides information on how a MS-DIMO analysis can strengthen symptom science research through the prioritization of functional genes and biological processes associated with a specific symptom.",33827270,PMC8726420,10.1177/10998004211003980,4,Biological research for nursing,9815758,2.318
Identifying biomarkers associated with immunotherapy response in melanoma by multi-omics analysis,"Despite immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have shown the greatest success in melanoma treatment, only a subset of melanoma patients responds well to ICIs. Thus, identifying predictive biomarkers for immunotherapy response is crucial. In this study, we took complementary advantages of immunotherapy data and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) multi-omics data to explore the predictive biomarkers for the response to immunotherapy in melanoma. We first predicted responsive and non-responsive melanomas in the TCGA skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) cohort based on both somatic mutation and transcriptome datasets which involved immunotherapy data for melanoma. This method identified 170 responsive and 56 non-responsive melanomas in TCGA-SKCM. Based on the TCGA-SKCM data, we performed a comprehensive comparison of multi-omics molecular features between responsive and non-responsive melanomas. We identified the molecular features significantly associated with immunotherapy response in melanoma at the genome, transcriptome, epigenome, and proteome levels, respectively. Our analysis confirmed certain immunotherapy response-associated biomarkers, such as tumor mutation burden (TMB), copy number alteration (CNA), intratumor heterogeneity (ITH), PD-L1 expression, and tumor immunity. Moreover, we identified some novel molecular features associated with immunotherapy response: (1) the activation of mast cells and dendritic cells correlating negatively with immunotherapy response; (2) the enrichment of many oncogenic pathways correlating positively with immunotherapy response, such as JAK-STAT, RAS, MAPK, HIF-1, PI3K-Akt, and VEGF pathways; and (3) a number of microRNAs and proteins whose expression correlates with immunotherapy response. In addition, the mTOR signaling pathway has a negative association with immunotherapy response. The novel biomarkers have potential predictive values in immunotherapy response and warrant further investigation.",37875043,,10.1016/j.compbiomed.2023.107591,2,Computers in biology and medicine,1250250,6.698
"Integrative, multi-omics, analysis of blood samples improves model predictions: applications to cancer","Background:Cancer genomic studies often include data collected from several omics platforms. Each omics data source contributes to the understanding of the underlying biological process via source specific (""individual"") patterns of variability. At the same time, statistical associations and potential interactions among the different data sources can reveal signals from common biological processes that might not be identified by single source analyses. These common patterns of variability are referred to as ""shared"" or ""joint"". In this work, we show how the use of joint and individual components can lead to better predictive models, and to a deeper understanding of the biological process at hand. We identify joint and individual contributions of DNA methylation, miRNA and mRNA expression collected from blood samples in a lung cancer case-control study nested within the Norwegian Women and Cancer (NOWAC) cohort study, and we use such components to build prediction models for case-control and metastatic status. To assess the quality of predictions, we compare models based on simultaneous, integrative analysis of multi-source omics data to a standard non-integrative analysis of each single omics dataset, and to penalized regression models. Additionally, we apply the proposed approach to a breast cancer dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas.Results:Our results show how an integrative analysis that preserves both components of variation is more appropriate than standard multi-omics analyses that are not based on such a distinction. Both joint and individual components are shown to contribute to a better quality of model predictions, and facilitate the interpretation of the underlying biological processes in lung cancer development.Conclusions:In the presence of multiple omics data sources, we recommend the use of data integration techniques that preserve the joint and individual components across the omics sources. We show how the inclusion of such components increases the quality of model predictions of clinical outcomes.",34353282,PMC8340537,10.1186/s12859-021-04296-0,7,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,3.307

PIntMF: Penalized Integrative Matrix Factorization method for multi-omics data,"Motivation:It is more and more common to perform multi-omics analyses to explore the genome at diverse levels and not only at a single level. Through integrative statistical methods, multi-omics data have the power to reveal new biological processes, potential biomarkers and subgroups in a cohort. Matrix factorization (MF) is an unsupervised statistical method that allows a clustering of individuals, but also reveals relevant omics variables from the various blocks.Results:Here, we present PIntMF (Penalized Integrative Matrix Factorization), an MF model with sparsity, positivity and equality constraints. To induce sparsity in the model, we used a classical Lasso penalization on variable and individual matrices. For the matrix of samples, sparsity helps in the clustering, while normalization (matching an equality constraint) of inferred coefficients is added to improve interpretation. Moreover, we added an automatic tuning of the sparsity parameters using the famous glmnet package. We also proposed three criteria to help the user to choose the number of latent variables. PIntMF was compared with other state-of-the-art integrative methods including feature selection techniques in both synthetic and real data. PIntMF succeeds in finding relevant clusters as well as variables in two types of simulated data (correlated and uncorrelated). Next, PIntMF was applied to two real datasets (Diet and cancer), and it revealed interpretable clusters linked to available clinical data. Our method outperforms the existing ones on two criteria (clustering and variable selection).

Integrative human and murine multi-omics: Highlighting shared biomarkers in the neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses,"Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL) is a group of neurodegenerative disorders whose molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. Omics approaches are among the methods that generate new information on modifying factors and molecular signatures. Moreover, omics data integration can address the need to progressively expand knowledge around the disease and pinpoint specific proteins to promote as candidate biomarkers. In this work, we integrated a total of 62 proteomic and transcriptomic datasets originating from humans and mice, employing a new approach able to define dysregulated processes across species, stages and NCL forms. Moreover, we selected a pool of differentially expressed proteins and genes as species- and form-related biomarkers of disease status/progression and evaluated local and spatial differences in most affected brain regions. Our results offer promising targets for potential new therapeutic strategies and reinforce the hypothesis of a connection between NCLs and other forms of dementia, particularly Alzheimer's disease.",37952681,,10.1016/j.nbd.2023.106349,0,Neurobiology of disease,9500169,7.046
Integrative multi-omics analysis reveals novel idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis endotypes associated with disease progression,"Background:Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is characterized by the accumulation of extracellular matrix in the pulmonary interstitium and progressive functional decline. We hypothesized that integration of multi-omics data would identify clinically meaningful molecular endotypes of IPF.Methods:The IPF-PRO Registry is a prospective registry of patients with IPF. Proteomic and transcriptomic (including total RNA [toRNA] and microRNA [miRNA]) analyses were performed using blood collected at enrollment. Molecular data were integrated using Similarity Network Fusion, followed by unsupervised spectral clustering to identify molecular subtypes. Cox proportional hazards models tested the relationship between these subtypes and progression-free and transplant-free survival. The molecular subtypes were compared to risk groups based on a previously described 52-gene (toRNA expression) signature. Biological characteristics of the molecular subtypes were evaluated via linear regression differential expression and canonical pathways (Ingenuity Pathway Analysis [IPA]) over-representation analyses.Results:Among 232 subjects, two molecular subtypes were identified. Subtype 1 (n = 105, 45.3%) and Subtype 2 (n = 127, 54.7%) had similar distributions of age (70.1 +/- 8.1 vs. 69.3 +/- 7.6 years; p = 0.31) and sex (79.1% vs. 70.1% males, p = 0.16). Subtype 1 had more severe disease based on composite physiologic index (CPI) (55.8 vs. 51.2; p = 0.002). After adjusting for CPI and antifibrotic treatment at enrollment, subtype 1 experienced shorter progression-free survival (HR 1.79, 95% CI 1.28,2.56; p = 0.0008) and similar transplant-free survival (HR 1.30, 95% CI 0.87,1.96; p = 0.20) as subtype 2. There was little agreement in the distribution of subjects to the molecular subtypes and the risk groups based on 52-gene signature (kappa = 0.04, 95% CI= -0.08, 0.17), and the 52-gene signature risk groups were associated with differences in transplant-free but not progression-free survival. Based on heatmaps and differential expression analyses, proteins and miRNAs (but not toRNA) contributed to classification of subjects to the molecular subtypes. The IPA showed enrichment in pulmonary fibrosis-relevant pathways, including mTOR, VEGF, PDGF, and B-cell receptor signaling.Conclusions:Integration of transcriptomic and proteomic data from blood enabled identification of clinically meaningful molecular endotypes of IPF. If validated, these endotypes could facilitate identification of individuals likely to experience disease progression and enrichment of clinical trials.Trial registration:NCT01915511.",37344825,PMC10283254,10.1186/s12931-023-02435-0,3,Respiratory research,101090633,7.162
"DNA methylation regulator-mediated modification patterns and risk of intracranial aneurysm: a multi-omics and epigenome-wide association study integrating machine learning, Mendelian randomization, eQTL and mQTL data","Background:Intracranial aneurysms (IAs) pose a significant and intricate challenge. Elucidating the interplay between DNA methylation and IA pathogenesis is paramount to identify potential biomarkers and therapeutic interventions.Methods:We employed a comprehensive bioinformatics investigation of DNA methylation in IA, utilizing a transcriptomics-based methodology that encompassed 100 machine learning algorithms, genome-wide association studies (GWAS), Mendelian randomization (MR), and summary-data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR). Our sophisticated analytical strategy allowed for a systematic assessment of differentially methylated genes and their implications on the onset, progression, and rupture of IA.Results:We identified DNA methylation-related genes (MRGs) and associated molecular pathways, and the MR and SMR analyses provided evidence for potential causal links between the observed DNA methylation events and IA predisposition.Conclusion:These insights not only augment our understanding of the molecular underpinnings of IA but also underscore potential novel biomarkers and therapeutic avenues. Although our study faces inherent limitations and hurdles, it represents a groundbreaking initiative in deciphering the intricate relationship between genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors implicated in IA pathogenesis.",37742034,PMC10518114,10.1186/s12967-023-04512-w,2,Journal of translational medicine,101190741,8.44
Pan-cancer analysis from multi-omics data reveals AAMP as an unfavourable prognostic marker,"Objectives:Angio-associated migratory cell protein (AAMP) is a protein that participates in cell migration and is reported to be involved in cancer progression. However, the molecular mechanism of AAMP in pan-cancer is not known.Methods:We used multi-omics data, such as TIMER, TCGA, GTEx, CPTAC, HPA, and cBioPortal to analyze AAMP expression, and gene alteration in pan-cancer. Univariate Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier were utilized to explore prognostic significance of AAMP expression level. We applied Spearman analysis to investigate the correlation between AAMP and TMB, MSI, immune cell infiltration, immune checkpoints. Moreover, we mainly studied liver hepatocellular carcinoma(LIHC) to explore AAMP expression, clinical significance, and prognosis. Cox regression analysis was used to study independent factor to predict prognosis for AAMP in LIHC. GSEA was utilized to investigate the biological function for AAMP in LIHC.Results:AAMP was overexpressed in most cancers, and high AAMP expression was associated with worse overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), and progress-free interval (PFI) for LIHC and adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC). Moreover, AAMP had the highest mutation frequency in uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC). AAMP was correlated with TMB and MSI in esophageal carcinoma (ESCA), stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD), lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), and thyroid carcinoma (THCA). Then, we focus on LIHC to investigate the expression and prognosis of AAMP. AAMP overexpression was related to histological grade and pathological stage in LIHC. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that AAMP overexpression was an independent adverse prognostic marker for LIHC. AAMP expression was correlated with immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoints in LIHC. Function enrichment analysis indicated the participation of AAMP in the cell cycle and DNA replication.Conclusions:AAMP was a latent prognostic indicator for pan-cancer and had high potential as a biomarker for the diagnosis and prognosis of LIHC.",37501187,PMC10373365,10.1186/s40001-023-01234-z,0,European journal of medical research,9517857,4.981
Integration of single-cell multi-omics data by regression analysis on unpaired observations,"Despite recent developments, it is hard to profile all multi-omics single-cell data modalities on the same cell. Thus, huge amounts of single-cell genomics data of unpaired observations on different cells are generated. We propose a method named UnpairReg for the regression analysis on unpaired observations to integrate single-cell multi-omics data. On real and simulated data, UnpairReg provides an accurate estimation of cell gene expression where only chromatin accessibility data is available. The cis-regulatory network inferred from UnpairReg is highly consistent with eQTL mapping. UnpairReg improves cell type identification accuracy by joint analysis of single-cell gene expression and chromatin accessibility data.",35854350,PMC9295346,10.1186/s13059-022-02726-7,4,Genome biology,100960660,17.906
Statistical Methods for Integrative Clustering of Multi-omics Data,"Cancers are heterogeneous diseases caused by accumulated mutations or abnormal alterations at multi-levels of biological processes including genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics. There is a great clinical interest in identifying cancer molecular subtypes for disease prognosis and personalized medicine. Integrative clustering is a powerful unsupervised learning method that has been increasingly used to identify cancer molecular subtypes using multi-omics data including somatic mutations, DNA copy numbers, DNA methylation, and gene expression. Integrative clustering methods are generally classified into model-based or nonparametric approaches. In this chapter, we will give an overview of the frequently used model-based methods, including iCluster, iClusterPlus, and iClusterBayes, and the nonparametric method, integrative nonnegative matrix factorization (intNMF). We will use the integrative analyses of uveal melanoma and lower-grade glioma to illustrate these representative methods. Finally, we will discuss the strengths and limitations of these representative methods and give suggestions for performing integrative analyses of cancer multi-omics data in practice.",36929074,PMC10950392,10.1007/978-1-0716-2986-4_5,0,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,0.0
An integrated multi-omics analysis reveals osteokines involved in global regulation,"Bone secretory proteins, termed osteokines, regulate bone metabolism and whole-body homeostasis. However, fundamental questions as to what the bona fide osteokines and their cellular sources are and how they are regulated remain unclear. In this study, we analyzed bone and extraskeletal tissues, osteoblast (OB) conditioned media, bone marrow supernatant (BMS), and serum, for basal osteokines and those responsive to aging and mechanical loading/unloading. We identified 375 candidate osteokines and their changes in response to aging and mechanical dynamics by integrating data from RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, and proteomic approaches. Furthermore, we analyzed their cellular sources in the bone and inter-organ communication facilitated by them (bone-brain, liver, and aorta). Notably, we discovered that senescent OBs secrete fatty-acid-binding protein 3 to propagate senescence toward vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Taken together, we identified previously unknown candidate osteokines and established a dynamic regulatory network among them, thus providing valuable resources to further investigate their systemic roles.",38574738,,10.1016/j.cmet.2024.03.006,0,Cell metabolism,101233170,31.373

"Single-cell multi-omics sequencing: application trends, COVID-19, data analysis issues and prospects","Single-cell sequencing is a biotechnology to sequence one layer of genomic information for individual cells in a tissue sample. For example, single-cell DNA sequencing is to sequence the DNA from every single cell. Increasing in complexity, single-cell multi-omics sequencing, or single-cell multimodal omics sequencing, is to profile in parallel multiple layers of omics information from a single cell. In practice, single-cell multi-omics sequencing actually detects multiple traits such as DNA, RNA, methylation information and/or protein profiles from the same cell for many individuals in a tissue sample. Multi-omics sequencing has been widely applied to systematically unravel interplay mechanisms of key components and pathways in cell. This survey overviews recent developments in single-cell multi-omics sequencing, and their applications to understand complex diseases in particular the COVID-19 pandemic. We also summarize machine learning and bioinformatics techniques used in the analysis of the intercorrelated multilayer heterogeneous data. We observed that variational inference and graph-based learning are popular approaches, and Seurat V3 is a commonly used tool to transfer the missing variables and labels. We also discussed two intensively studied issues relating to data consistency and diversity and commented on currently cared issues surrounding the error correction of data pairs and data imputation methods. The survey is concluded with some open questions and opportunities for this extraordinary field.",34111889,PMC8344433,10.1093/bib/bbab229,9,Briefings in bioinformatics,100912837,13.994
Integrative Analysis of Multi-Omics Data Based on Blockwise Sparse Principal Components,"The recent development of high-throughput technology has allowed us to accumulate vast amounts of multi-omics data. Because even single omics data have a large number of variables, integrated analysis of multi-omics data suffers from problems such as computational instability and variable redundancy. Most multi-omics data analyses apply single supervised analysis, repeatedly, for dimensional reduction and variable selection. However, these approaches cannot avoid the problems of redundancy and collinearity of variables. In this study, we propose a novel approach using blockwise component analysis. This would solve the limitations of current methods by applying variable clustering and sparse principal component (sPC) analysis. Our approach consists of two stages. The first stage identifies homogeneous variable blocks, and then extracts sPCs, for each omics dataset. The second stage merges sPCs from each omics dataset, and then constructs a prediction model. We also propose a graphical method showing the results of sparse PCA and model fitting, simultaneously. We applied the proposed methodology to glioblastoma multiforme data from The Cancer Genome Atlas. The comparison with other existing approaches showed that our proposed methodology is more easily interpretable than other approaches, and has comparable predictive power, with a much smaller number of variables.",33147797,PMC7663540,10.3390/ijms21218202,5,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,6.208

These data may yield unprecedented knowledge about molecular pathways in cells and their role in disease. Dimension reduction approaches have been widely used in exploratory analysis of single omics data sets. This review will focus on dimension reduction approaches for simultaneous exploratory analyses of multiple data sets. These methods extract the linear relationships that best explain the correlated structure across data sets, the variability both within and between variables (or observations) and may highlight data issues such as batch effects or outliers. We explore dimension reduction techniques as one of the emerging approaches for data integration, and how these can be applied to increase our understanding of biological systems in normal physiological function and disease.",26969681,PMC4945831,10.1093/bib/bbv108,129,Briefings in bioinformatics,100912837,13.994
Jiangu granules ameliorate postmenopausal osteoporosis via rectifying bone homeostasis imbalance: A network pharmacology analysis based on multi-omics validation,"Background:Postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMOP) is a series of reactions to bone homeostasis dysregulation mediated by estrogen deficiency in elderly women. Jiangu granules, a traditional Chinese medicine formula, has been proven as an effective treatment approach for PMOP, which still needs more research iin its complex regulatory mechanisms.Purpose:Our study aimed to identify the putative targets and regulatory mechanisms of Jiangu granules in PMOP treating.Methods:We utilized the NHANES database to compare the clinical information of normal population and PMOP patients. Associated with transcriptomics and proteomic data, we identified the PMOP-related genes, and further studied them with bioinformatic methods including and prognosis model. Network pharmacology was applied for confirming the action targets of Jiangu granules in PMOP. We verified the safety and effectiveness in PMOP treatments of Jiangu granules, and also demonstrated our hypothesis in rats.Results:We discovered that the PMOP patients had higher monocytes than the normal women. Moreover, the transcriptomics and proteomic analysis suggested that the dysregulation of PMOP-related genes expression was associated with monocytes, and the Notch pathway were the critical targets representing bone homeostasis imbalance highly involved in the occurrence of PMOP. We also ascertained network pharmacology results further revealing that Jiangu granules might treat PMOP via recovering the bone homeostasis imbalance identified above. In vivo experiments, we confirmed the high efficacy which mainly resulted from function in mitigating the imbalance in bone homeostasis by recovering the normal expression of PMOP-related genes associated with monocytes, Notch, and steroid pathway in the rat models.Conclusion:Our finding underscored the clinical potential of Jiangu granules in treating PMOP, and enriched the comprehension of the related pathogenic and therapeutic mechanisms.",37856991,,10.1016/j.phymed.2023.155137,1,Phytomedicine : international journal of phytotherapy and phytopharmacology,9438794,6.656
Evaluation of integrative clustering methods for the analysis of multi-omics data,"Recent advances in sequencing, mass spectrometry and cytometry technologies have enabled researchers to collect large-scale omics data from the same set of biological samples. The joint analysis of multiple omics offers the opportunity to uncover coordinated cellular processes acting across different omic layers. In this work, we present a thorough comparison of a selection of recent integrative clustering approaches, including Bayesian (BCC and MDI) and matrix factorization approaches (iCluster, moCluster, JIVE and iNMF). Based on simulations, the methods were evaluated on their sensitivity and their ability to recover both the correct number of clusters and the simulated clustering at the common and data-specific levels. Standard non-integrative approaches were also included to quantify the added value of integrative methods. For most matrix factorization methods and one Bayesian approach (BCC), the shared and specific structures were successfully recovered with high and moderate accuracy, respectively. An opposite behavior was observed on non-integrative approaches, i.e. high performances on specific structures only. Finally, we applied the methods on the Cancer Genome Atlas breast cancer data set to check whether results based on experimental data were consistent with those obtained in the simulations.",31220206,,10.1093/bib/bbz015,27,Briefings in bioinformatics,100912837,13.994
HONMF: integration analysis of multi-omics microbiome data via matrix factorization and hypergraph,"Motivation:The accumulation of multi-omics microbiome data provides an unprecedented opportunity to understand the diversity of bacterial, fungal, and viral components from different conditions. The changes in the composition of viruses, bacteria, and fungi communities have been associated with environments and critical illness. However, identifying and dissecting the heterogeneity of microbial samples and cross-kingdom interactions remains challenging.Results:We propose HONMF for the integrative analysis of multi-modal microbiome data, including bacterial, fungal, and viral composition profiles. HONMF enables identification of microbial samples and data visualization, and also facilitates downstream analysis, including feature selection and cross-kingdom association analysis between species. HONMF is an unsupervised method based on hypergraph induced orthogonal non-negative matrix factorization, where it assumes that latent variables are specific for each composition profile and integrates the distinct sets of latent variables through graph fusion strategy, which better tackles the distinct characteristics in bacterial, fungal, and viral microbiome. We implemented HONMF on several multi-omics microbiome datasets from different environments and tissues. The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of HONMF in data visualization and clustering. HONMF also provides rich biological insights by implementing discriminative microbial feature selection and bacterium-fungus-virus association analysis, which improves our understanding of ecological interactions and microbial pathogenesis.Availability and implementation:The software and datasets are available at https://github.com/chonghua-1983/HONMF.",37216923,PMC10243929,10.1093/bioinformatics/btad335,0,"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",9808944,6.931
Interpretable meta-learning of multi-omics data for survival analysis and pathway enrichment,"Motivation:Despite the success of recent machine learning algorithms' applications to survival analysis, their black-box nature hinders interpretability, which is arguably the most important aspect. Similarly, multi-omics data integration for survival analysis is often constrained by the underlying relationships and correlations that are rarely well understood. The goal of this work is to alleviate the interpretability problem in machine learning approaches for survival analysis and also demonstrate how multi-omics data integration improves survival analysis and pathway enrichment. We use meta-learning, a machine-learning algorithm that is trained on a variety of related datasets and allows quick adaptations to new tasks, to perform survival analysis and pathway enrichment on pan-cancer datasets. In recent machine learning research, meta-learning has been effectively used for knowledge transfer among multiple related datasets.Results:We use meta-learning with Cox hazard loss to show that the integration of TCGA pan-cancer data increases the performance of survival analysis. We also apply advanced model interpretability method called DeepLIFT (Deep Learning Important FeaTures) to show different sets of enriched pathways for multi-omics and transcriptomics data. Our results show that multi-omics cancer survival analysis enhances performance compared with using transcriptomics or clinical data alone. Additionally, we show a correlation between variable importance assignment from DeepLIFT and gene coenrichment, suggesting that genes with higher and similar contribution scores are more likely to be enriched together in the same enrichment sets.Availability and implementation:https://github.com/berkuva/TCGA-omics-integration.",36864611,PMC10079355,10.1093/bioinformatics/btad113,2,"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",9808944,6.931
Identification of novel prognostic biomarkers by integrating multi-omics data in gastric cancer,"Background:Gastric cancer is a fatal gastrointestinal cancer with high morbidity and poor prognosis. The dismal 5-year survival rate warrants reliable biomarkers to assess and improve the prognosis of gastric cancer. Distinguishing driver mutations that are required for the cancer phenotype from passenger mutations poses a formidable challenge for cancer genomics.Methods:We integrated the multi-omics data of 293 primary gastric cancer patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to identify key driver genes by establishing a prognostic model of the patients. Analyzing both copy number alteration and somatic mutation data helped us to comprehensively reveal molecular markers of genomic variation. Integrating the transcription level of genes provided a unique perspective for us to discover dysregulated factors in transcriptional regulation.Results:We comprehensively identified 31 molecular markers of genomic variation. For instance, the copy number alteration of WASHC5 (also known as KIAA0196) frequently occurred in gastric cancer patients, which cannot be discovered using traditional methods based on significant mutations. Furthermore, we revealed that several dysregulation factors played a hub regulatory role in the process of biological metabolism based on dysregulation networks. Cancer hallmark and functional enrichment analysis showed that these key driver (KD) genes played a vital role in regulating programmed cell death. The drug response patterns and transcriptional signatures of KD genes reflected their clinical application value.Conclusions:These findings indicated that KD genes could serve as novel prognostic biomarkers for further research on the pathogenesis of gastric cancers.

This study proposes a novel use of supervised dimension reduction method, called sliced inverse regression, to multi-omics data analysis to improve prediction over a single data type analysis. The study further proposes an integrative sliced inverse regression method (integrative SIR) for simultaneous analysis of multiple omics data types of cancer samples, including MiRNA, MRNA and proteomics, to achieve integrative dimension reduction and to further improve prediction performance.

Integrated analysis of multi-omics data for the discovery of biomarkers and therapeutic targets for colorectal cancer,"The considerable burden of colorectal cancer and the rising trend in young adults emphasize the necessity of understanding its underlying mechanisms, providing new diagnostic and prognostic markers, and improving therapeutic approaches. Precision medicine is a new trend all over the world and identification of novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets is a step forward towards this trend. In this context, multi-omics data and integrated analysis are being investigated to develop personalized medicine in the management of colorectal cancer. Given the large amount of data from multi-omics approach, data integration and analysis is a great challenge. In this Review, we summarize how statistical and machine learning techniques are applied to analyze multi-omics data and how it contributes to the discovery of useful diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Moreover, we discuss the importance of these biomarkers and therapeutic targets in the clinical management of colorectal cancer in the future.

Molecular Cluster Mining of Adrenocortical Carcinoma via Multi-Omics Data Analysis Aids Precise Clinical Therapy,"Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a malignancy of the endocrine system. We collected clinical and pathological features, genomic mutations, DNA methylation profiles, and mRNA, lncRNA, microRNA, and somatic mutations in ACC patients from the TCGA, GSE19750, GSE33371, and GSE49278 cohorts. Based on the MOVICS algorithm, the patients were divided into ACC1-3 subtypes by comprehensive multi-omics data analysis. We found that immune-related pathways were more activated, and drug metabolism pathways were enriched in ACC1 subtype patients. Furthermore, ACC1 patients were sensitive to PD-1 immunotherapy and had the lowest sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs. Patients with the ACC2 subtype had the worst survival prognosis and the highest tumor-mutation rate. Meanwhile, cell-cycle-related pathways, amino-acid-synthesis pathways, and immunosuppressive cells were enriched in ACC2 patients. Steroid and cholesterol biosynthetic pathways were enriched in patients with the ACC3 subtype. DNA-repair-related pathways were enriched in subtypes ACC2 and ACC3. The sensitivity of the ACC2 subtype to cisplatin, doxorubicin, gemcitabine, and etoposide was better than that of the other two subtypes. For 5-fluorouracil, there was no significant difference in sensitivity to paclitaxel between the three groups.

Integrative analysis of multi-omics data reveals inhibition of RB1 signaling promotes apatinib resistance of hepatocellular carcinoma,"Although apatinib is a promising drug for the treatment of liver cancer, the underlying drug resistance mechanism is still unclear. Here, we constructed apatinib-resistant HepG2 cells. We then characterized the epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic landscapes both in apatinib-resistant and non-resistant HepG2 cells. Differential expression, ATAC-seq, and proteomic data analyses were performed. We found that the cell cycle related protein RB1 may play an essential role in the process of apatinib resistant to hepatocarcinoma. Moreover, there were extensive variations at the transcriptome, epigenetic, and proteomic level. Finally, quantitative PCR (qPCR) and western blot analysis showed that expression level of RB1 in apatinib-resistant cell as well as the samples of patients in progressive disease were significantly lower than that in controls. Those results also showed that the RB1 pathway inhibitors CDK2-IN-73 and Palbociclib could relieve the resistance of apatinib resistant cells. Our results further enhance our understanding of the anti-tumorigenic and anti-angiogenic efficacy of apatinib in liver cancer and provide a novel perspective regarding apatinib resistance. Furthermore, we proved that CDKN2B inhibition of RB1 signaling promoted apatinib resistance in hepatocellular carcinoma. Those findings have greatly important biological significance for the resistance of apatinib and the treatment of liver cancer.",37781033,PMC10535702,10.7150/ijbs.83862,0,International journal of biological sciences,101235568,10.75
MOGSA: Integrative Single Sample Gene-set Analysis of Multiple Omics Data,"Gene-set analysis (GSA) summarizes individual molecular measurements to more interpretable pathways or gene-sets and has become an indispensable step in the interpretation of large-scale omics data. However, GSA methods are limited to the analysis of single omics data. Here, we introduce a new computation method termed multi-omics gene-set analysis (MOGSA), a multivariate single sample gene-set analysis method that integrates multiple experimental and molecular data types measured over the same set of samples. The method learns a low dimensional representation of most variant correlated features (genes, proteins, etc.) across multiple omics data sets, transforms the features onto the same scale and calculates an integrated gene-set score from the most informative features in each data type. MOGSA does not require filtering data to the intersection of features (gene IDs), therefore, all molecular features, including those that lack annotation may be included in the analysis. Using simulated data, we demonstrate that integrating multiple diverse sources of molecular data increases the power to discover subtle changes in gene-sets and may reduce the impact of unreliable information in any single data type. Using real experimental data, we demonstrate three use-cases of MOGSA. First, we show how to remove a source of noise (technical or biological) in integrative MOGSA of NCI60 transcriptome and proteome data.

A comprehensive survey of the approaches for pathway analysis using multi-omics data integration,"Pathway analysis has been widely used to detect pathways and functions associated with complex disease phenotypes. The proliferation of this approach is due to better interpretability of its results and its higher statistical power compared with the gene-level statistics. A plethora of pathway analysis methods that utilize multi-omics setup, rather than just transcriptomics or proteomics, have recently been developed to discover novel pathways and biomarkers. Since multi-omics gives multiple views into the same problem, different approaches are employed in aggregating these views into a comprehensive biological context. As a result, a variety of novel hypotheses regarding disease ideation and treatment targets can be formulated. In this article, we review 32 such pathway analysis methods developed for multi-omics and multi-cohort data. We discuss their availability and implementation, assumptions, supported omics types and databases, pathway analysis techniques and integration strategies. A comprehensive assessment of each method's practicality, and a thorough discussion of the strengths and drawbacks of each technique will be provided. The main objective of this survey is to provide a thorough examination of existing methods to assist potential users and researchers in selecting suitable tools for their data and analysis purposes, while highlighting outstanding challenges in the field that remain to be addressed for future development.",36252928,PMC9677478,10.1093/bib/bbac435,9,Briefings in bioinformatics,100912837,13.994
TCGAplot: an R package for integrative pan-cancer analysis and visualization of TCGA multi-omics data,"Background:Pan-cancer analysis examines both the commonalities and heterogeneity among genomic and cellular alterations across numerous types of tumors. Pan-cancer analysis of gene expression, tumor mutational burden (TMB), microsatellite instability (MSI), and tumor immune microenvironment (TIME), and methylation becomes available based on the multi-omics data from The Cancer Genome Atlas Program (TCGA). Some online tools provide analysis of gene and protein expression, mutation, methylation, and survival for TCGA data. However, these online tools were either Uni-functional or were not able to perform analysis of user-defined functions. Therefore, we created the TCGAplot R package to facilitate perform pan-cancer analysis and visualization of the built-in multi-omic TCGA data.Results:TCGAplot provides several functions to perform pan-cancer paired/unpaired differential gene expression analysis, pan-cancer correlation analysis between gene expression and TMB, MSI, TIME, and promoter methylation. Functions for visualization include paired/unpaired boxplot, survival plot, ROC curve, heatmap, scatter, radar chart, and forest plot. Moreover, gene set based pan-cancer and tumor specific analyses were also available. Finally, all these built-in multi-omic data could be extracted for implementation for user-defined functions, making the pan-cancer analysis much more convenient.\ CONCLUSIONS: We developed an R-package for integrative pan-cancer analysis and visualization of TCGA multi-omics data.

"Multi-omic data integration and analysis using systems genomics approaches: methods and applications in animal production, health and welfare","In the past years, there has been a remarkable development of high-throughput omics (HTO) technologies such as genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics across all facets of biology. This has spearheaded the progress of the systems biology era, including applications on animal production and health traits. However, notwithstanding these new HTO technologies, there remains an emerging challenge in data analysis. On the one hand, different HTO technologies judged on their own merit are appropriate for the identification of disease-causing genes, biomarkers for prevention and drug targets for the treatment of diseases and for individualized genomic predictions of performance or disease risks. On the other hand, integration of multi-omic data and joint modelling and analyses are very powerful and accurate to understand the systems biology of healthy and sustainable production of animals. We present an overview of current and emerging HTO technologies each with a focus on their applications in animal and veterinary sciences before introducing an integrative systems genomics framework for analysing and integrating multi-omic data towards improved animal production, health and welfare. We conclude that there are big challenges in multi-omic data integration, modelling and systems-level analyses, particularly with the fast emerging HTO technologies. We highlight existing and emerging systems genomics approaches and discuss how they contribute to our understanding of the biology of complex traits or diseases and holistic improvement of production performance, disease resistance and welfare.",27130220,PMC4850674,10.1186/s12711-016-0217-x,68,"Genetics, selection, evolution : GSE",9114088,5.1
Multi-Omics Approaches in Immunological Research,"The immune system plays a vital role in health and disease, and is regulated through a complex interactive network of many different immune cells and mediators. To understand the complexity of the immune system, we propose to apply a multi-omics approach in immunological research. This review provides a complete overview of available methodological approaches for the different omics data layers relevant for immunological research, including genetics, epigenetics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and cellomics. Thereafter, we describe the various methods for data analysis as well as how to integrate different layers of omics data.

Clustering single-cell multi-omics data with MoClust,"Motivation:Single-cell multi-omics sequencing techniques have rapidly developed in the past few years. Clustering analysis with single-cell multi-omics data may give us novel perspectives to dissect cellular heterogeneity. However, multi-omics data have the properties of inherited large dimension, high sparsity and existence of doublets. Moreover, representations of different omics from even the same cell follow diverse distributions. Without proper distribution alignment techniques, clustering methods will encounter less separable clusters easily affected by less informative omics data.Results:We developed MoClust, a novel joint clustering framework that can be applied to several types of single-cell multi-omics data. A selective automatic doublet detection module that can identify and filter out doublets is introduced in the pretraining stage to improve data quality. Omics-specific autoencoders are introduced to characterize the multi-omics data. A contrastive learning way of distribution alignment is adopted to adaptively fuse omics representations into an omics-invariant representation. This novel way of alignment boosts the compactness and separableness of clusters, while accurately weighting the contribution of each omics to the clustering object. Extensive experiments, over both simulated and real multi-omics datasets, demonstrated the powerful alignment, doublet detection and clustering ability features of MoClust.Availability and implementation:An implementation of MoClust is available from https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7306504.Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",36383167,PMC9805570,10.1093/bioinformatics/btac736,2,"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",9808944,6.931
Sarcoidosis Related Novel Candidate Genes Identified by Multi-Omics Integrative Analyses,"Sarcoidosis is a multifactorial systemic disease characterized by granulomatous inflammation and greatly impacting on global public health. The etiology and mechanisms of sarcoidosis are not fully understood. Recent high-throughput biological research has generated vast amounts of multi-omics big data on sarcoidosis, but their significance remains to be determined. We sought to identify novel candidate regions, and genes consistently altered in heterogeneous omics studies so as to reveal the underlying molecular mechanisms. We conducted a comprehensive integrative literature analysis on global data on sarcoidosis, including genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and phenomic studies. We performed positional integration analysis of 38 eligible datasets originating from 17 different biological layers. Using the integration interval length of 50 kb, we identified 54 regions reaching significance value p ≤ 0.0001 and 15 regions with significance value p ≤ 0.00001, when applying more stringent criteria. Secondary literature analysis of the top 20 regions, with the most significant accumulation of signals, revealed several novel candidate genes for which associations with sarcoidosis have not yet been established, but have considerable support for their involvement based on omic data. These new plausible candidate genes include NELFE, CFB, EGFL7, AGPAT2, FKBPL, NRC3, and NEU1. Furthermore, annotated data were prepared to enable custom visualization and browsing of these sarcoidosis related omics evidence in the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) Genome Browser. Further multi-omics approaches are called for sarcoidosis biomarkers and diagnostic and therapeutic innovation. Our approach for harnessing multi-omics data and the findings presented herein reflect important steps toward understanding the etiology and underlying pathological mechanisms of sarcoidosis.",29688803,,10.1089/omi.2018.0027,5,Omics : a journal of integrative biology,101131135,3.978
An integrated multi-omics analysis of topoisomerase family in pan-cancer: Friend or foe?,"Background:Topoisomerases are nuclear enzymes that get to the bottom of topological troubles related with DNA all through a range of genetic procedures. More and more studies have shown that topoisomerase-mediated DNA cleavage plays crucial roles in tumor cell death and carcinogenesis. There is however still a lack of comprehensive multi-omics studies related to topoisomerase family genes from a pan-cancer perspective.Methods:In this study, a multiomics pan-cancer analysis of topoisomerase family genes was conducted by integrating over 10,000 multi-dimensional cancer genomic data across 33 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), 481 small molecule drug response data from cancer therapeutics response portal (CTRP) as well as normal tissue data from Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx). Finally, overall activity-level analyses of topoisomerase in pan-cancers were performed by gene set variation analysis (GSVA), together with differential expression, clinical relevancy, immune cell infiltration and regulation of cancer-related pathways.Results:Dysregulated gene expression of topoisomerase family were related to genomic changes and abnormal epigenetic modifications. The expression levels of topoisomerase family genes could significantly impact cancer progression, intratumoral heterogeneity, alterations in the immunological condition and regulation of the cancer marker-related pathways, which in turn caused the differences in potential drugs sensitivity and the distinct prognosis of patients.Conclusion:It was anticipated that topoisomerase family genes would become novel prognostic biomarkers for cancer patients and provide new insights for the diagnosis and treatment of tumors.",36288358,PMC9604985,10.1371/journal.pone.0274546,3,PloS one,101285081,3.752
'Multi-omic' data analysis using O-miner,"Innovations in -omics technologies have driven advances in biomedical research. However, integrating and analysing the large volumes of data generated from different high-throughput -omics technologies remain a significant challenge to basic and clinical scientists without bioinformatics skills or access to bioinformatics support. To address this demand, we have significantly updated our previous O-miner analytical suite, to incorporate several new features and data types to provide an efficient and easy-to-use Web tool for the automated analysis of data from '-omics' technologies. Created from a biologist's perspective, this tool allows for the automated analysis of large and complex transcriptomic, genomic and methylomic data sets, together with biological/clinical information, to identify significantly altered pathways and prioritize novel biomarkers/targets for biological validation. Our resource can be used to analyse both in-house data and the huge amount of publicly available information from array and sequencing platforms. Multiple data sets can be easily combined, allowing for meta-analyses. Here, we describe the analytical pipelines currently available in O-miner and present examples of use to demonstrate its utility and relevance in maximizing research output.

"Integrative multi-omics analysis of genomic, epigenomic, and metabolomics data leads to new insights for Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder","The evolving field of multi-omics combines data and provides methods for simultaneous analysis across several omics levels. Here, we integrated genomics (transmitted and non-transmitted polygenic scores [PGSs]), epigenomics, and metabolomics data in a multi-omics framework to identify biomarkers for Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and investigated the connections among the three omics levels. We first trained single- and next multi-omics models to differentiate between cases and controls in 596 twins (cases = 14.8%) from the Netherlands Twin Register (NTR) demonstrating reasonable in-sample prediction through cross-validation. The multi-omics model selected 30 PGSs, 143 CpGs, and 90 metabolites. We confirmed previous associations of ADHD with glucocorticoid exposure and the transmembrane protein family TMEM, show that the DNA methylation of the MAD1L1 gene associated with ADHD has a relation with parental smoking behavior, and present novel findings including associations between indirect genetic effects and CpGs of the STAP2 gene. However, out-of-sample prediction in NTR participants (N = 258, cases = 14.3%) and in a clinical sample (N = 145, cases = 51%) did not perform well (range misclassification was [0.40, 0.57]). The results highlighted connections between omics levels, with the strongest connections between non-transmitted PGSs, CpGs, and amino acid levels and show that multi-omics designs considering interrelated omics levels can help unravel the complex biology underlying ADHD.",37534875,,10.1002/ajmg.b.32955,5,"American journal of medical genetics.

"Integrated multi-omics analysis of genomics, epigenomics, and transcriptomics in ovarian carcinoma","In this study, we identified prognostic biomarkers in ovarian carcinoma by integrating multi-omics DNA copy number variation (CNV) and methylation variation (MET) data. CNV, MET, and messenger RNA (mRNA) expression were examined in 351 ovarian carcinoma patients. Genes for which expression was correlated with DNA copy-number or DNA methylation were identified; three ovarian carcinoma gene subtypes were defined based on these correlations. Overall survival and B cell scores were lower, while the macrophage cell score was higher, in the DNA imprinting centre 1 (iC1) subtype than in the iC2 and iC3 subtypes. Comparison of CNV, MET, and mRNA expression among the subtypes identified two genes, ubiquitin B (UBB) and interleukin 18 binding protein (IL18BP), that were associated with prognosis. Mutation spectrum results based on subtype indicated that UBB and IL18BP expression may be influenced by mutation loci. Mutation levels were higher in iC1 samples than in iC2 or iC3 samples, indicating that the iC1 subtype is associated with disease progression. This integrated multi-omics analysis of genomics, epigenomics, and transcriptomics provides new insight into the molecular mechanisms of ovarian carcinoma and may help identify biomolecular markers for early disease diagnosis.",31257224,PMC6629004,10.18632/aging.102047,12,Aging,101508617,5.955
MEXPRESS update 2019,"The recent growth in the number of publicly available cancer omics databases has been accompanied by the development of various tools that allow researchers to visually explore these data. In 2015, we built MEXPRESS, an online tool for the integration and visualization of gene expression, DNA methylation and clinical data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), a large collection of publicly available multi-omics cancer data. MEXPRESS addresses the need for an easy-to-use, interactive application that allows researchers to identify dysregulated genes and their clinical relevance in cancer. Furthermore, while other tools typically do not support integrated visualization of expression and DNA methylation data in combination with the precise genomic location of the methylation, MEXPRESS is unique in how it depicts these diverse data types together. Motivated by the large number of users MEXPRESS has managed to attract over the past 3 years and the recent migration of all TCGA data to a new data portal, we developed a new version of MEXPRESS (https://mexpress.be). It contains the latest TCGA data, additional types of omics and clinical data and extra functionality, allowing users to explore mechanisms of gene dysregulation beyond expression and DNA methylation.",31114869,PMC6602516,10.1093/nar/gkz445,133,Nucleic acids research,411011,19.16
A multi-omics data analysis workflow packaged as a FAIR Digital Object,"Background:Applying good data management and FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data principles in research projects can help disentangle knowledge discovery, study result reproducibility, and data reuse in future studies. Based on the concepts of the original FAIR principles for research data, FAIR principles for research software were recently proposed. FAIR Digital Objects enable discovery and reuse of Research Objects, including computational workflows for both humans and machines. Practical examples can help promote the adoption of FAIR practices for computational workflows in the research community. We developed a multi-omics data analysis workflow implementing FAIR practices to share it as a FAIR Digital Object.Findings:We conducted a case study investigating shared patterns between multi-omics data and childhood externalizing behavior. The analysis workflow was implemented as a modular pipeline in the workflow manager Nextflow, including containers with software dependencies. We adhered to software development practices like version control, documentation, and licensing. Finally, the workflow was described with rich semantic metadata, packaged as a Research Object Crate, and shared via WorkflowHub.Conclusions:Along with the packaged multi-omics data analysis workflow, we share our experiences adopting various FAIR practices and creating a FAIR Digital Object.

Multi-Omics Data Analysis Uncovers Molecular Networks and Gene Regulators for Metabolic Biomarkers,"The insulin-like growth factors (IGFs)/insulin resistance (IR) axis is the major metabolic hormonal pathway mediating the biologic mechanism of several complex human diseases, including type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and cancers. The genomewide association study (GWAS)-based approach has neither fully characterized the phenotype variation nor provided a comprehensive understanding of the regulatory biologic mechanisms. We applied systematic genomics to integrate our previous GWAS data for IGF-I and IR with multi-omics datasets, e.g., whole-blood expression quantitative loci, molecular pathways, and gene network, to capture the full range of genetic functionalities associated with IGF-I/IR and key drivers (KDs) in gene-regulatory networks. We identified both shared (e.g., T2DM, lipid metabolism, and estimated glomerular filtration signaling) and IR-specific (e.g., mechanistic target of rapamycin, phosphoinositide 3-kinases, and erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 4 signaling) molecular biologic processes of IGF-I/IR axis regulation. Next, by using tissue-specific gene-gene interaction networks, we identified both well-established (e.g.,IRS1andIGF1R) and novel (e.g.,AKT1,HRAS, andJAK1) KDs in the IGF-I/IR-associated subnetworks. Our results, if validated in additional genomic studies, may provide robust, comprehensive insights into the mechanisms of IGF-I/IR regulation and highlight potential novel genetic targets as preventive and therapeutic strategies for the associated diseases, e.g., T2DM and cancers.",33801830,PMC8001935,10.3390/biom11030406,1,Biomolecules,101596414,6.064
Omics in gut microbiome analysis,"Our understanding of the interactions between microbial communities and their niche in the host gut has improved owing to recent advances in environmental microbial genomics. Integration of metagenomic and metataxonomic sequencing data with other omics data to study the gut microbiome has become increasingly common, but downstream analysis after data integration and interpretation of complex omics data remain challenging. Here, we review studies that have explored the gut microbiome signature using omics approaches, including metagenomics, metataxonomics, metatranscriptomics, and metabolomics. We further discuss recent analytics programs to analyze and integrate multi-omics datasets and further utilization of omics data with other advanced techniques, such as adaptive immune receptor repertoire sequencing, microbial culturomics, and machine learning, to evaluate important microbiome characteristics in the gut.",33624266,,10.1007/s12275-021-1004-0,22,"Journal of microbiology (Seoul, Korea)",9703165,2.902
Canonical correlation analysis for multi-omics: Application to cross-cohort analysis,"Integrative approaches that simultaneously model multi-omics data have gained increasing popularity because they provide holistic system biology views of multiple or all components in a biological system of interest. Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is a correlation-based integrative method designed to extract latent features shared between multiple assays by finding the linear combinations of features-referred to as canonical variables (CVs)-within each assay that achieve maximal across-assay correlation. Although widely acknowledged as a powerful approach for multi-omics data, CCA has not been systematically applied to multi-omics data in large cohort studies, which has only recently become available. Here, we adapted sparse multiple CCA (SMCCA), a widely-used derivative of CCA, to proteomics and methylomics data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) and Jackson Heart Study (JHS). To tackle challenges encountered when applying SMCCA to MESA and JHS, our adaptations include the incorporation of the Gram-Schmidt (GS) algorithm with SMCCA to improve orthogonality among CVs, and the development of Sparse Supervised Multiple CCA (SSMCCA) to allow supervised integration analysis for more than two assays. Effective application of SMCCA to the two real datasets reveals important findings. Applying our SMCCA-GS to MESA and JHS, we identified strong associations between blood cell counts and protein abundance, suggesting that adjustment of blood cell composition should be considered in protein-based association studies. Importantly, CVs obtained from two independent cohorts also demonstrate transferability across the cohorts. For example, proteomic CVs learned from JHS, when transferred to MESA, explain similar amounts of blood cell count phenotypic variance in MESA, explaining 39.0% ~ 50.0% variation in JHS and 38.9% ~ 49.1% in MESA. Similar transferability was observed for other omics-CV-trait pairs. This suggests that biologically meaningful and cohort-agnostic variation is captured by CVs. We anticipate that applying our SMCCA-GS and SSMCCA on various cohorts would help identify cohort-agnostic biologically meaningful relationships between multi-omics data and phenotypic traits.",37216410,PMC10237647,10.1371/journal.pgen.1010517,2,PLoS genetics,101239074,6.02
"Big data, integrative omics and network biology","A cell integrates various signals through a network of biomolecules that crosstalk to synergistically regulate the replication, transcription, translation and other metabolic activities of a cell. These networks regulate signal perception and processing that drives biological functions. The biological complexity cannot be fully captured by a single -omics discipline. The holistic study of an organism-in health, perturbation, exposure to environment and disease, is studied under systems biology. The bottom-up molecular approaches (genes, mRNA, protein, metabolite, etc.) have laid the foundation of current biological knowledge covering the horizon from viruses, bacteria, fungi, plants and animals. Yet, these techniques provide a rather myopic view of biology at the molecular level. To understand how the interconnected molecular components are formed and rewired in disease or exposure to environmental stimuli is the holy grail of modern biology. The omics era was heralded by the genomics revolution but advanced sequencing techniques are now also ubiquitous in transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and lipidomics. Multi-omics data analysis and integration techniques are driving the quest for deeper insights into how the different layers of biomolecules talk to each other in diverse contexts.",34340766,,10.1016/bs.apcsb.2021.03.006,10,Advances in protein chemistry and structural biology,101497281,5.447
Graph Neural Networks With Multiple Prior Knowledge for Multi-Omics Data Analysis,"With the development of biotechnology, a large amount of multi-omics data have been collected for precision medicine. There exists multiple graph-based prior biological knowledge about omics data, such as gene-gene interaction networks. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in introducing graph neural networks (GNNs) into multi-omics learning. However, existing methods have not fully exploited these graphical priors since none have been able to integrate knowledge from multiple sources simultaneously. To solve this problem, we propose a multi-omics data analysis framework by incorporating multiple prior knowledge into graph neural network (MPK-GNN). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to introduce multiple prior graphs into multi-omics data analysis. Specifically, the proposed method contains four parts: (1) a feature-level learning module to aggregate information from prior graphs; (2) a projection module to maximize the agreement among prior networks by optimizing a contrastive loss; (3) a sample-level module to learn a global representation from input multi-omics features; (4) a task-specific module to flexibly extend MPK-GNN for various downstream multi-omics analysis tasks. Finally, we verify the effectiveness of the proposed multi-omics learning algorithm on the cancer molecular subtype classification task. Experimental results show that MPK-GNN outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms, including multi-view learning methods and multi-omics integrative approaches.",37307177,,10.1109/JBHI.2023.3284794,1,IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics,101604520,7.021
Multi-modal meta-analysis of cancer cell line omics profiles identifies ECHDC1 as a novel breast tumor suppressor,"Molecular and functional profiling of cancer cell lines is subject to laboratory-specific experimental practices and data analysis protocols. The current challenge therefore is how to make an integrated use of the omics profiles of cancer cell lines for reliable biological discoveries. Here, we carried out a systematic analysis of nine types of data modalities using meta-analysis of 53 omics studies across 12 research laboratories for 2,018 cell lines. To account for a relatively low consistency observed for certain data modalities, we developed a robust data integration approach that identifies reproducible signals shared among multiple data modalities and studies. We demonstrated the power of the integrative analyses by identifying a novel driver gene, ECHDC1, with tumor suppressive role validated both in breast cancer cells and patient tumors. The multi-modal meta-analysis approach also identified synthetic lethal partners of cancer drivers, including a co-dependency of PTEN deficient endometrial cancer cells on RNA helicases.",33750001,PMC7983037,10.15252/msb.20209526,5,Molecular systems biology,101235389,13.068
Deep cross-omics cycle attention model for joint analysis of single-cell multi-omics data,"Motivation:Joint profiling of single-cell transcriptomics and epigenomics data enables us to characterize cell states and transcriptomics regulatory programs related to cellular heterogeneity. However, the highly different features on sparsity, heterogeneity and dimensionality between multi-omics data have severely hindered its integrative analysis.Results:We proposed deep cross-omics cycle attention (DCCA) model, a computational tool for joint analysis of single-cell multi-omics data, by combining variational autoencoders (VAEs) and attention-transfer. Specifically, we show that DCCA can leverage one omics data to fine-tune the network trained for another omics data, given a dataset of parallel multi-omics data within the same cell. Studies on both simulated and real datasets from various platforms, DCCA demonstrates its superior capability: (i) dissecting cellular heterogeneity; (ii) denoising and aggregating data and (iii) constructing the link between multi-omics data, which is used to infer new transcriptional regulatory relations. In our applications, DCCA was demonstrated to have a superior power to generate missing stages or omics in a biologically meaningful manner, which provides a new way to analyze and also understand complicated biological processes.Availability and implementation:DCCA source code is available at https://github.com/cmzuo11/DCCA, and has been deposited in archived format at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4762065.Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",34028557,,10.1093/bioinformatics/btab403,15,"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",9808944,6.931
Analysis of cancer omics data: a selective review of statistical techniques,"Cancer is an omics disease.

The goal of this review is to assist cancer researchers with limited statistical expertise in establishing the 'overall framework' of cancer omics data analysis. To facilitate understanding, we mainly focus on intuition, concepts and key steps, and refer readers to the original publications for mathematical details.

Novel feature selection method via kernel tensor decomposition for improved multi-omics data analysis,"Background:Feature selection of multi-omics data analysis remains challenging owing to the size of omics datasets, comprising approximately [Formula: see text]-[Formula: see text] features. In particular, appropriate methods to weight individual omics datasets are unclear, and the approach adopted has substantial consequences for feature selection. In this study, we extended a recently proposed kernel tensor decomposition (KTD)-based unsupervised feature extraction (FE) method to integrate multi-omics datasets obtained from common samples in a weight-free manner.Method:KTD-based unsupervised FE was reformatted as the collection of kernelized tensors sharing common samples, which was applied to synthetic and real datasets.Results:The proposed advanced KTD-based unsupervised FE method showed comparative performance to that of the previously proposed KTD method, as well as tensor decomposition-based unsupervised FE, but required reduced memory and central processing unit time. Moreover, this advanced KTD method, specifically designed for multi-omics analysis, attributes P values to features, which is rare for existing multi-omics-oriented methods.Conclusions:The sample R code is available at https://github.com/tagtag/MultiR/ .",35209912,PMC8876179,10.1186/s12920-022-01181-4,2,BMC medical genomics,101319628,3.622
Omics-Based Investigations of Breast Cancer,"Breast cancer (BC) is characterized by an extensive genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity. In-depth investigations into the molecular bases of BC phenotypes, carcinogenesis, progression, and metastasis are necessary for accurate diagnoses, prognoses, and therapy assessments in predictive, precision, and personalized oncology. This review discusses both classic as well as several novel omics fields that are involved or should be used in modern BC investigations, which may be integrated as a holistic term, onco-breastomics. Rapid and recent advances in molecular profiling strategies and analytical techniques based on high-throughput sequencing and mass spectrometry (MS) development have generated large-scale multi-omics datasets, mainly emerging from the three ""big omics"", based on the central dogma of molecular biology: genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics. Metabolomics-based approaches also reflect the dynamic response of BC cells to genetic modifications. Interactomics promotes a holistic view in BC research by constructing and characterizing protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks that provide a novel hypothesis for the pathophysiological processes involved in BC progression and subtyping. The emergence of new omics- and epiomics-based multidimensional approaches provide opportunities to gain insights into BC heterogeneity and its underlying mechanisms. The three main epiomics fields (epigenomics, epitranscriptomics, and epiproteomics) are focused on the epigenetic DNA changes, RNAs modifications, and posttranslational modifications (PTMs) affecting protein functions for an in-depth understanding of cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Novel omics fields, such as epichaperomics or epimetabolomics, could investigate the modifications in the interactome induced by stressors and provide PPI changes, as well as in metabolites, as drivers of BC-causing phenotypes. Over the last years, several proteomics-derived omics, such as matrisomics, exosomics, secretomics, kinomics, phosphoproteomics, or immunomics, provided valuable data for a deep understanding of dysregulated pathways in BC cells and their tumor microenvironment (TME) or tumor immune microenvironment (TIMW). Most of these omics datasets are still assessed individually using distinct approches and do not generate the desired and expected global-integrative knowledge with applications in clinical diagnostics. However, several hyphenated omics approaches, such as proteo-genomics, proteo-transcriptomics, and phosphoproteomics-exosomics are useful for the identification of putative BC biomarkers and therapeutic targets. To develop non-invasive diagnostic tests and to discover new biomarkers for BC, classic and novel omics-based strategies allow for significant advances in blood/plasma-based omics. Salivaomics, urinomics, and milkomics appear as integrative omics that may develop a high potential for early and non-invasive diagnoses in BC. Thus, the analysis of the tumor circulome is considered a novel frontier in liquid biopsy. Omics-based investigations have applications in BC modeling, as well as accurate BC classification and subtype characterization. The future in omics-based investigations of BC may be also focused on multi-omics single-cell analyses.",37375323,PMC10302907,10.3390/molecules28124768,8,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",100964009,4.927
BioVLAB-Cancer-Pharmacogenomics: tumor heterogeneity and pharmacogenomics analysis of multi-omics data from tumor on the cloud,"Motivation:Multi-omics data in molecular biology has accumulated rapidly over the years. Such data contains valuable information for research in medicine and drug discovery. Unfortunately, data-driven research in medicine and drug discovery is challenging for a majority of small research labs due to the large volume of data and the complexity of analysis pipeline.Results:We present BioVLAB-Cancer-Pharmacogenomics, a bioinformatics system that facilitates analysis of multi-omics data from breast cancer to analyze and investigate intratumor heterogeneity and pharmacogenomics on Amazon Web Services. Our system takes multi-omics data as input to perform tumor heterogeneity analysis in terms of TCGA data and deconvolve-and-match the tumor gene expression to cell line data in CCLE using DNA methylation profiles. We believe that our system can help small research labs perform analysis of tumor multi-omics without worrying about computational infrastructure and maintenance of databases and tools.Availability and implementation:http://biohealth.snu.ac.kr/software/biovlab_cancer_pharmacogenomics.Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",34185062,,10.1093/bioinformatics/btab478,1,"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",9808944,6.931
Prioritization of therapeutic targets for cancers using integrative multi-omics analysis,"Background:The integration of transcriptomic, proteomic, druggable genetic and metabolomic association studies facilitated a comprehensive investigation of molecular features and shared pathways for cancers' development and progression.Methods:Comprehensive approaches consisting of transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS), proteome-wide association studies (PWAS), summary-data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR) and MR were performed to identify genes significantly associated with cancers. The results identified in above analyzes were subsequently involved in phenotype scanning and enrichment analyzes to explore the possible health effects and shared pathways. Additionally, we also conducted MR analysis to investigate metabolic pathways related to cancers.Results:Totally 24 genes (18 transcriptomic, 1 proteomic and 5 druggable genetic) showed significant associations with cancers risk. All genes identified in multiple methods were mainly enriched in nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) pathway. Additionally, biosynthesis of ubiquinol and urate were found to play an important role in gastrointestinal tumors.Conclusions:A set of putatively causal genes and pathways relevant to cancers were identified in this study, shedding light on the shared biological processes for tumorigenesis and providing compelling genetic evidence to prioritize anti-cancer drugs development.",38659038,PMC11040978,10.1186/s40246-024-00571-2,0,Human genomics,101202210,6.481
Robust knowledge-guided biclustering for multi-omics data,"Biclustering is a useful method for simultaneously grouping samples and features and has been applied across various biomedical data types. However, most existing biclustering methods lack the ability to integratively analyze multi-modal data such as multi-omics data such as genome, transcriptome and epigenome. Moreover, the potential of leveraging biological knowledge represented by graphs, which has been demonstrated to be beneficial in various statistical tasks such as variable selection and prediction, remains largely untapped in the context of biclustering. To address both, we propose a novel Bayesian biclustering method called Bayesian graph-guided biclustering (BGB). Specifically, we introduce a new hierarchical sparsity-inducing prior to effectively incorporate biological graph information and establish a unified framework to model multi-view data. We develop an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to conduct posterior sampling and inference. Extensive simulations and real data analysis show that BGB outperforms other popular biclustering methods. Notably, BGB is robust in terms of utilizing biological knowledge and has the capability to reveal biologically meaningful information from heterogeneous multi-modal data.",38058188,PMC10701104,10.1093/bib/bbad446,1,Briefings in bioinformatics,100912837,13.994
A probabilistic multi-omics data matching method for detecting sample errors in integrative analysis,"Background:Data errors, including sample swapping and mis-labeling, are inevitable in the process of large-scale omics data generation. Data errors need to be identified and corrected before integrative data analyses where different types of data are merged on the basis of the annotated labels. Data with labeling errors dampen true biological signals. More importantly, data analysis with sample errors could lead to wrong scientific conclusions. We developed a robust probabilistic multi-omics data matching procedure, proMODMatcher, to curate data and identify and correct data annotation and errors in large databases.Results:Application to simulated datasets suggests that proMODMatcher achieved robust statistical power even when the number of cis-associations was small and/or the number of samples was large. Application of our proMODMatcher to multi-omics datasets in The Cancer Genome Atlas and International Cancer Genome Consortium identified sample errors in multiple cancer datasets. Our procedure was not only able to identify sample-labeling errors but also to unambiguously identify the source of the errors. Our results demonstrate that these errors should be identified and corrected before integrative analysis.Conclusions:Our results indicate that sample-labeling errors were common in large multi-omics datasets. These errors should be corrected before integrative analysis.",31289834,PMC6615984,10.1093/gigascience/giz080,4,GigaScience,101596872,7.658
Perspectives of using Cloud computing in integrative analysis of multi-omics data,"Integrative analysis of multi-omics data is usually computationally demanding. It frequently requires building complex, multi-step analysis pipelines, applying dedicated techniques for data processing and combining several data sources. These efforts lead to a better understanding of life processes, current health state or the effects of therapeutic activities. However, many omics data analysis solutions focus only on a selected problem, disease, types of data or organisms. Moreover, they are implemented for general-purpose scientific computational platforms that most often do not easily scale the calculations natively. These features are not conducive to advances in understanding genotype-phenotypic relationships. Fortunately, with new technological paradigms, including Cloud computing, virtualization and containerization, these functionalities could be orchestrated for easy scaling and building independent analysis pipelines for omics data. Therefore, solutions can be re-used for purposes that they were not primarily designed. This paper shows perspectives of using Cloud computing advances and containerization approach for such a purpose. We first review how the Cloud computing model is utilized in multi-omics data analysis and show weak points of the adopted solutions. Then, we introduce containerization concepts, which allow both scaling and linking of functional services designed for various purposes. Finally, on the Bioconductor software package example, we disclose a verified concept model of a universal solution that exhibits the potentials for performing integrative analysis of multiple omics data sources.",33676373,,10.1093/bfgp/elab007,1,Briefings in functional genomics,101528229,4.84
Integration of Multi-omics Data for Expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTL) Analysis and eQTL Epistasis,"Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) mapping studies identify genetic loci that regulate gene expression. eQTL mapping studies can capture gene regulatory interactions and provide insight into the genetic mechanism of biological systems. Recently, the integration of multi-omics data, such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), copy number variations (CNVs), DNA methylation, and gene expression, plays an important role in elucidating complex biological systems, since biological systems involve a sequence of complex interactions between various biological processes. This chapter introduces multi-omics data that have been used in many eQTL studies and integrative methodologies that incorporate multi-omics data for eQTL studies. Furthermore, we describe a statistical approach that can detect nonlinear causal relationships between eQTLs, called eQTL epistasis, and its importance.",31849014,,10.1007/978-1-0716-0026-9_11,0,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,0.0
Multi-omics analysis identifies drivers of protein phosphorylation,"Background:Phosphorylation of proteins is a key step in the regulation of many cellular processes including activation of enzymes and signaling cascades. The abundance of a phosphorylated peptide (phosphopeptide) is determined by the abundance of its parent protein and the proportion of target sites that are phosphorylated.Results:We quantified phosphopeptides, proteins, and transcripts in heart, liver, and kidney tissue samples of mice from 58 strains of the Collaborative Cross strain panel. We mapped ~700 phosphorylation quantitative trait loci (phQTL) across the three tissues and applied genetic mediation analysis to identify causal drivers of phosphorylation. We identified kinases, phosphatases, cytokines, and other factors, including both known and potentially novel interactions between target proteins and genes that regulate site-specific phosphorylation. Our analysis highlights multiple targets of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1), a regulator of mitochondrial function that shows reduced activity in the NZO/HILtJ mouse, a polygenic model of obesity and type 2 diabetes.Conclusions:Together, this integrative multi-omics analysis in genetically diverse CC strains provides a powerful tool to identify regulators of protein phosphorylation. The data generated in this study provides a resource for further exploration.",36944993,PMC10031968,10.1186/s13059-023-02892-2,1,Genome biology,100960660,17.906
Prospects and challenges of multi-omics data integration in toxicology,"Exposure of cells or organisms to chemicals can trigger a series of effects at the regulatory pathway level, which involve changes of levels, interactions, and feedback loops of biomolecules of different types. A single-omics technique, e.g., transcriptomics, will detect biomolecules of one type and thus can only capture changes in a small subset of the biological cascade. Therefore, although applying single-omics analyses can lead to the identification of biomarkers for certain exposures, they cannot provide a systemic understanding of toxicity pathways or adverse outcome pathways. Integration of multiple omics data sets promises a substantial improvement in detecting this pathway response to a toxicant, by an increase of information as such and especially by a systemic understanding. Here, we report the findings of a thorough evaluation of the prospects and challenges of multi-omics data integration in toxicological research. We review the availability of such data, discuss options for experimental design, evaluate methods for integration and analysis of multi-omics data, discuss best practices, and identify knowledge gaps. Re-analyzing published data, we demonstrate that multi-omics data integration can considerably improve the confidence in detecting a pathway response. Finally, we argue that more data need to be generated from studies with a multi-omics-focused design, to define which omics layers contribute most to the identification of a pathway response to a toxicant.",32034435,,10.1007/s00204-020-02656-y,61,Archives of toxicology,417615,6.168
Multi-Omics Model Applied to Cancer Genetics,"In this review, we focus on bioinformatic oncology as an integrative discipline that incorporates knowledge from the mathematical, physical, and computational fields to further the biomedical understanding of cancer. Before providing a deeper insight into the bioinformatics approach and utilities involved in oncology, we must understand what is a system biology framework and the genetic connection, because of the high heterogenicity of the backgrounds of people approaching precision medicine. In fact, it is essential to providing general theoretical information on genomics, epigenomics, and transcriptomics to understand the phases of multi-omics approach. We consider how to create a multi-omics model. In the last section, we describe the new frontiers and future perspectives of this field.",34072237,PMC8199287,10.3390/ijms22115751,15,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,6.208
IMIX: a multivariate mixture model approach to association analysis through multi-omics data integration,"Motivation:Integrative genomic analysis is a powerful tool used to study the biological mechanisms underlying a complex disease or trait across multiplatform high-dimensional data, such as DNA methylation, copy number variation and gene expression. It is common to perform large-scale genome-wide association analysis of an outcome for each data type separately and combine the results ad hoc, leading to loss of statistical power and uncontrolled overall false discovery rate (FDR).Results:We propose a multivariate mixture model (IMIX) framework that integrates multiple types of genomic data and allows modeling of inter-data-type correlations. We investigated the across-data-type FDR control in IMIX and demonstrated lower misclassification rates at controlled overall FDR than established individual data type analysis strategies, such as the Benjamini-Hochberg FDR control, the q-value and the local FDR control by extensive simulations. IMIX features statistically principled model selection, FDR control and computational efficiency. Applications to The Cancer Genome Atlas data provided novel multi-omics insights into the genes and mechanisms associated with the luminal and basal subtypes of bladder cancer and the prognosis of pancreatic cancer.Availabilityand implementation:We have implemented our method in R package 'IMIX' available at https://github.com/ziqiaow/IMIX, as well as CRAN soon.Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",33258948,PMC8016490,10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa1001,3,"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",9808944,6.931
Integrative analysis of multi-omics and imaging data with incorporation of biological information via structural Bayesian factor analysis,"Motivation:With the rapid development of modern technologies, massive data are available for the systematic study of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Though many existing AD studies mainly focus on single-modality omics data, multi-omics datasets can provide a more comprehensive understanding of AD. To bridge this gap, we proposed a novel structural Bayesian factor analysis framework (SBFA) to extract the information shared by multi-omics data through the aggregation of genotyping data, gene expression data, neuroimaging phenotypes and prior biological network knowledge. Our approach can extract common information shared by different modalities and encourage biologically related features to be selected, guiding future AD research in a biologically meaningful way.Method:Our SBFA model decomposes the mean parameters of the data into a sparse factor loading matrix and a factor matrix, where the factor matrix represents the common information extracted from multi-omics and imaging data. Our framework is designed to incorporate prior biological network information. Our simulation study demonstrated that our proposed SBFA framework could achieve the best performance compared with the other state-of-the-art factor-analysis-based integrative analysis methods.Results:We apply our proposed SBFA model together with several state-of-the-art factor analysis models to extract the latent common information from genotyping, gene expression and brain imaging data simultaneously from the ADNI biobank database. The latent information is then used to predict the functional activities questionnaire score, an important measurement for diagnosis of AD quantifying subjects' abilities in daily life. Our SBFA model shows the best prediction performance compared with the other factor analysis models.Availability:Code are publicly available at https://github.com/JingxuanBao/SBFA.Contact:qlong@upenn.edu.",36882008,PMC10387302,10.1093/bib/bbad073,2,Briefings in bioinformatics,100912837,13.994
Paired single-cell multi-omics data integration with Mowgli,"The profiling of multiple molecular layers from the same set of cells has recently become possible. There is thus a growing need for multi-view learning methods able to jointly analyze these data. We here present Multi-Omics Wasserstein inteGrative anaLysIs (Mowgli), a novel method for the integration of paired multi-omics data with any type and number of omics. Of note, Mowgli combines integrative Nonnegative Matrix Factorization and Optimal Transport, enhancing at the same time the clustering performance and interpretability of integrative Nonnegative Matrix Factorization. We apply Mowgli to multiple paired single-cell multi-omics data profiled with 10X Multiome, CITE-seq, and TEA-seq. Our in-depth benchmark demonstrates that Mowgli's performance is competitive with the state-of-the-art in cell clustering and superior to the state-of-the-art once considering biological interpretability. Mowgli is implemented as a Python package seamlessly integrated within the scverse ecosystem and it is available at http://github.com/cantinilab/mowgli .",38001063,PMC10673889,10.1038/s41467-023-43019-2,1,Nature communications,101528555,17.694
Multi-Omics Analysis of Circulating Exosomes in Adherent Long-Term Treated OSA Patients,"Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a highly prevalent chronic disease affecting nearly a billion people globally and increasing the risk of multi-organ morbidity and overall mortality. However, the mechanisms underlying such adverse outcomes remain incompletely delineated. Extracellular vesicles (exosomes) are secreted by most cells, are involved in both proximal and long-distance intercellular communication, and contribute toward homeostasis under physiological conditions. A multi-omics integrative assessment of plasma-derived exosomes from adult OSA patients prior to and after 1-year adherent CPAP treatment is lacking. We conducted multi-omic integrative assessments of plasma-derived exosomes from adult OSA patients prior to and following 1-year adherent CPAP treatment to identify potential specific disease candidates. Fasting morning plasma exosomes isolated from 12 adult patients with polysomnographically-diagnosed OSA were analyzed before and after 12 months of adherent CPAP therapy (mean ≥ 6 h/night) (OSAT). Exosomes were characterized by flow cytometry, transmission electron microscopy, and nanoparticle tracking analysis. Endothelial cell barrier integrity, wound healing, and tube formation were also performed. Multi-omics analysis for exosome cargos was integrated. Exosomes derived from OSAT improved endothelial permeability and dysfunction as well as significant improvement in tube formation compared with OSA. Multi-omic approaches for OSA circulating exosomes included lipidomic, proteomic, and small RNA (miRNAs) assessments. We found 30 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs), 72 lipids (DELs), and 13 miRNAs (DEMs). We found that the cholesterol metabolism (has04979) pathway is associated with lipid classes in OSA patients. Among the 12 subjects of OSA and OSAT, seven subjects had complete comprehensive exosome cargo information including lipids, proteins, and miRNAs. Multi-omic approaches identify potential signature biomarkers in plasma exosomes that are responsive to adherent OSA treatment. These differentially expressed molecules may also play a mechanistic role in OSA-induced morbidities and their reversibility. Our data suggest that a multi-omic integrative approach might be useful in understanding how exosomes function, their origin, and their potential clinical relevance, all of which merit future exploration in the context of relevant phenotypic variance. Developing an integrated molecular classification should lead to improved diagnostic classification, risk stratification, and patient management of OSA by assigning molecular disease-specific therapies.",38003263,PMC10671639,10.3390/ijms242216074,0,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,6.208
ReactomeGSA - Efficient Multi-Omics Comparative Pathway Analysis,"Pathway analyses are key methods to analyze 'omics experiments. Nevertheless, integrating data from different 'omics technologies and different species still requires considerable bioinformatics knowledge.Here we present the novel ReactomeGSA resource for comparative pathway analyses of multi-omics datasets. ReactomeGSA can be used through Reactome's existing web interface and the novel ReactomeGSA R Bioconductor package with explicit support for scRNA-seq data. Data from different species is automatically mapped to a common pathway space. Public data from ExpressionAtlas and Single Cell ExpressionAtlas can be directly integrated in the analysis. ReactomeGSA greatly reduces the technical barrier for multi-omics, cross-species, comparative pathway analyses.We used ReactomeGSA to characterize the role of B cells in anti-tumor immunity. We compared B cell rich and poor human cancer samples from five of the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) transcriptomics and two of the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) proteomics studies. B cell-rich lung adenocarcinoma samples lacked the otherwise present activation through NFkappaB. This may be linked to the presence of a specific subset of tumor associated IgG+ plasma cells that lack NFkappaB activation in scRNA-seq data from human melanoma. This showcases how ReactomeGSA can derive novel biomedical insights by integrating large multi-omics datasets.",32907876,PMC7710148,10.1074/mcp.TIR120.002155,112,Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP,101125647,7.381
Integrated multi-omics analysis of ovarian cancer using variational autoencoders,"Cancer is a complex disease that deregulates cellular functions at various molecular levels (e.g., DNA, RNA, and proteins). Integrated multi-omics analysis of data from these levels is necessary to understand the aberrant cellular functions accountable for cancer and its development. In recent years, Deep Learning (DL) approaches have become a useful tool in integrated multi-omics analysis of cancer data. However, high dimensional multi-omics data are generally imbalanced with too many molecular features and relatively few patient samples. This imbalance makes a DL based integrated multi-omics analysis difficult. DL-based dimensionality reduction technique, including variational autoencoder (VAE), is a potential solution to balance high dimensional multi-omics data. However, there are few VAE-based integrated multi-omics analyses, and they are limited to pancancer. In this work, we did an integrated multi-omics analysis of ovarian cancer using the compressed features learned through VAE and an improved version of VAE, namely Maximum Mean Discrepancy VAE (MMD-VAE). First, we designed and developed a DL architecture for VAE and MMD-VAE. Then we used the architecture for mono-omics, integrated di-omics and tri-omics data analysis of ovarian cancer through cancer samples identification, molecular subtypes clustering and classification, and survival analysis. The results show that MMD-VAE and VAE-based compressed features can respectively classify the transcriptional subtypes of the TCGA datasets with an accuracy in the range of 93.2-95.5% and 87.1-95.7%. Also, survival analysis results show that VAE and MMD-VAE based compressed representation of omics data can be used in cancer prognosis. Based on the results, we can conclude that (i) VAE and MMD-VAE outperform existing dimensionality reduction techniques, (ii) integrated multi-omics analyses perform better or similar compared to their mono-omics counterparts, and (iii) MMD-VAE performs better than VAE in most omics dataset.",33737557,PMC7973750,10.1038/s41598-021-85285-4,24,Scientific reports,101563288,4.996
Cancer subtyping with heterogeneous multi-omics data via hierarchical multi-kernel learning,"Differentiating cancer subtypes is crucial to guide personalized treatment and improve the prognosis for patients. Integrating multi-omics data can offer a comprehensive landscape of cancer biological process and provide promising ways for cancer diagnosis and treatment. Taking the heterogeneity of different omics data types into account, we propose a hierarchical multi-kernel learning (hMKL) approach, a novel cancer molecular subtyping method to identify cancer subtypes by adopting a two-stage kernel learning strategy. In stage 1, we obtain a composite kernel borrowing the cancer integration via multi-kernel learning (CIMLR) idea by optimizing the kernel parameters for individual omics data type. In stage 2, we obtain a final fused kernel through a weighted linear combination of individual kernels learned from stage 1 using an unsupervised multiple kernel learning method. Based on the final fusion kernel, k-means clustering is applied to identify cancer subtypes. Simulation studies show that hMKL outperforms the one-stage CIMLR method when there is data heterogeneity. hMKL can estimate the number of clusters correctly, which is the key challenge in subtyping. Application to two real data sets shows that hMKL identified meaningful subtypes and key cancer-associated biomarkers. The proposed method provides a novel toolkit for heterogeneous multi-omics data integration and cancer subtypes identification.",36433785,,10.1093/bib/bbac488,2,Briefings in bioinformatics,100912837,13.994
"Precision medicine with multi-omics strategies, deep phenotyping, and predictive analysis","Precision medicine is driven by the paradigm shift of empowering clinicians to predict the most appropriate course of action for patients with complex diseases and to improve routine medical and public health practice. Understanding patients' multi-omics make-up in conjunction with the clinical data will lead to determining predisposition, diagnostic, prognostic and predictive biomarkers and to optimal paths providing personalized care for diverse and targeted chronic, acute, and infectious diseases. Precision medicine promotes integrating collective and individualized clinical data with patient-specific multi-omics data to develop therapeutic strategies and knowledge bases for predictive and personalized medicine in diverse populations.

Multi-omic approaches for host-microbiome data integration,"The gut microbiome interacts with the host through complex networks that affect physiology and health outcomes. It is becoming clear that these interactions can be measured across many different omics layers, including the genome, transcriptome, epigenome, metabolome, and proteome, among others. Multi-omic studies of the microbiome can provide insight into the mechanisms underlying host-microbe interactions. As more omics layers are considered, increasingly sophisticated statistical methods are required to integrate them. In this review, we provide an overview of approaches currently used to characterize multi-omic interactions between host and microbiome data. While a large number of studies have generated a deeper understanding of host-microbiome interactions, there is still a need for standardization across approaches. Furthermore, microbiome studies would also benefit from the collection and curation of large, publicly available multi-omics datasets.",38166610,PMC10766395,10.1080/19490976.2023.2297860,1,Gut microbes,101495343,9.434
"Perseus plugin ""Metis"" for metabolic-pathway-centered quantitative multi-omics data analysis for static and time-series experimental designs","We introduce Metis, a new plugin for the Perseus software aimed at analyzing quantitative multi-omics data based on metabolic pathways. Data from different omics types are connected through reactions of a genome-scale metabolic-pathway reconstruction. Metabolite concentrations connect through the reactants, while transcript, protein, and protein post-translational modification (PTM) data are associated through the enzymes catalyzing the reactions. Supported experimental designs include static comparative studies and time-series data. As an example for the latter, we combine circadian mouse liver multi-omics data and study the contribution of cycles of phosphoproteome and metabolome to enzyme activity regulation. Our analysis resulted in 52 pairs of cycling phosphosites and metabolites connected through a reaction. The time lags between phosphorylation and metabolite peak show non-uniform behavior, indicating a major contribution of phosphorylation in the modulation of enzymatic activity.",35497496,PMC9046241,10.1016/j.crmeth.2022.100198,0,Cell reports methods,9918227360606676,0.0
CHOmics: A web-based tool for multi-omics data analysis and interactive visualization in CHO cell lines,"Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines are widely used in industry for biological drug production. During cell culture development, considerable effort is invested to understand the factors that greatly impact cell growth, specific productivity and product qualities of the biotherapeutics. While high-throughput omics approaches have been increasingly utilized to reveal cellular mechanisms associated with cell line phenotypes and guide process optimization, comprehensive omics data analysis and management have been a challenge. Here we developed CHOmics, a web-based tool for integrative analysis of CHO cell line omics data that provides an interactive visualization of omics analysis outputs and efficient data management. CHOmics has a built-in comprehensive pipeline for RNA sequencing data processing and multi-layer statistical modules to explore relevant genes or pathways. Moreover, advanced functionalities were provided to enable users to customize their analysis and visualize the output systematically and interactively. The tool was also designed with the flexibility to accommodate other types of omics data and thereby enabling multi-omics comparison and visualization at both gene and pathway levels. Collectively, CHOmics is an integrative platform for data analysis, visualization and management with expectations to promote the broader use of omics in CHO cell research.",33351794,PMC7790544,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008498,4,PLoS computational biology,101238922,4.779
Multi-Omics Analysis Provides Novel Insight into Immuno-Physiological Pathways and Development of Thermal Resistance in Rainbow Trout Exposed to Acute Thermal Stress,"In recent years, poikilothermic animals such as fish have increasingly been exposed to stressful high-temperature environments due to global warming. However, systemic changes in fish under thermal stress are not fully understood yet at both the transcriptome and proteome level. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the immuno-physiological responses of fish under extreme thermal stress through integrated multi-omics analysis. Trout were exposed to acute thermal stress by raising water temperature from 15 to 25 °C within 30 min. Head-kidney and plasma samples were collected and used for RNA sequencing and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Gene enrichment analysis was performed: differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were identified to interpret the multi-omics results and identify the relevant biological processes through pathway analysis. Thousands of DEGs and 49 DEPs were identified in fish exposed to thermal stress. Most of these genes and proteins were highly linked to DNA replication, protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, cell signaling and structure, glycolysis activation, complement-associated hemolysis, processing of released free hemoglobin, and thrombosis and hypertension/vasoconstriction. Notably, we found that immune disorders mediated by the complement system may trigger hemolysis in thermally stressed fish, which could have serious consequences such as ferroptosis and thrombosis. However, antagonistic activities that decrease cell-free hemoglobin, heme, and iron might be involved in alleviating the side effects of thermally induced immuno-physiological disorders. These factors may represent the major thermal resistance traits that allow fish to overcome extreme thermal stress. Our findings, based on integration of multi-omics data from transcriptomics and proteomics analyses, provide novel insight into the pathogenesis of acute thermal stress and temperature-linked epizootics.",33276666,PMC7731343,10.3390/ijms21239198,6,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,6.208
A novel integrative multi-omics approach to unravel the genetic determinants of rare diseases with application in sinusoidal obstruction syndrome,"Background:Genotype-phenotype analyses of rare diseases often suffer from a lack of power, due to small sample size, which makes identifying significant associations difficult. Sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS) of the liver is a rare but life-threatening complication of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The alkylating agent busulfan is commonly used in HSCT and known to trigger SOS. We developed a novel pipeline to identify genetic determinants in rare diseases by combining in vitro information with clinical whole-exome sequencing (WES) data and applied it in SOS patients and controls.Methods:First, we analysed differential gene expression in six lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) before and after incubation with busulfan. Second, we used WES data from 87 HSCT patients and estimated the association with SOS at the SNP and the gene levels. We then combined the results of the expression and the association analyses into an association statistic at the gene level. We used an over-representation analysis to functionally characterize the genes that were associated with a significant combined test statistic.Results:After treatment of LCLs with busulfan, 1708 genes were significantly up-, and 1385 down-regulated. The combination of the expression experiment and the association analysis of WES data into a single test statistic revealed 35 genes associated with the outcome. These genes are involved in various biological functions and processes, such as ""Cell growth and death"", ""Signalling molecules and interaction"", ""Cancer"", and ""Infectious disease"".Conclusions:This novel data analysis pipeline integrates two independent omics datasets and increases statistical power for identifying genotype-phenotype associations. The analysis of the transcriptomics profile of cell lines treated with busulfan and WES data from HSCT patients allowed us to identify potential genetic contributors to SOS. Our pipeline could be useful for identifying genetic contributors to other rare diseases where limited power renders genome-wide analyses unpromising.Trial registration:For the clinical dataset: Clinicaltrials.gov:NCT01257854. https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/history/NCT01257854.",37018234,PMC10075428,10.1371/journal.pone.0281892,0,PloS one,101285081,3.752
wMKL: multi-omics data integration enables novel cancer subtype identification via weight-boosted multi-kernel learning,"Background:Cancer is a heterogeneous disease driven by complex molecular alterations. Cancer subtypes determined from multi-omics data can provide novel insight into personalised precision treatment. It is recognised that incorporating prior weight knowledge into multi-omics data integration can improve disease subtyping.Methods:We develop a weighted method, termed weight-boosted Multi-Kernel Learning (wMKL) which incorporates heterogeneous data types as well as flexible weight functions, to boost subtype identification. Given a series of weight functions, we propose an omnibus combination strategy to integrate different weight-related P-values to improve subtyping precision.Results:wMKL models each data type with multiple kernel choices, thus alleviating the sensitivity and robustness issue due to selecting kernel parameters. Furthermore, wMKL integrates different data types by learning weights of different kernels derived from each data type, recognising the heterogeneous contribution of different data types to the final subtyping performance. The proposed wMKL outperforms existing weighted and non-weighted methods. The utility and advantage of wMKL are illustrated through extensive simulations and applications to two TCGA datasets. Novel subtypes are identified followed by extensive downstream bioinformatics analysis to understand the molecular mechanisms differentiating different subtypes.Conclusions:The proposed wMKL method provides a novel strategy for disease subtyping.

Multi-omics analysis revealing the interplay between gut microbiome and the host following opioid use,"Opioid crisis is an ongoing epidemic since the past several decades in the United States. Opioid use-associated microbial dysbiosis is emerging as a key regulator of intestinal homeostasis and behavioral responses to opioid. However, the mechanistic insight into the role of microbial community in modulating host response is unavailable. To uncover the role of opioid-induced dysbiosis in disrupting intestinal homeostasis we utilized whole genome sequencing, untargeted metabolomics, and mRNA sequencing to identify changes in microbiome, metabolome, and host transcriptome respectively. Morphine treatment resulted in significant expansion ofParasuterella excrementihominis, Burkholderiales bacterium 1_1_47,Enterococcus faecalis,Enterorhabdus caecimurisand depletion ofLactobacillus johnsonii. These changes correlated with alterations in lipid metabolites and flavonoids. Significant alteration in microbial metabolism (metabolism of lipids, amino acids, vitamins and cofactors) and increased expression of virulence factors and biosynthesis of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and lipoteichoic acid (LTA) were observed in microbiome of morphine-treated animals. In concurrence with changes in microbiome and metabolome extensive changes in innate and adaptive immune response, lipid metabolism, and gut barrier dysfunction were observed in the host transcriptome. Microbiome depleted mice displayed lower levels of inflammation, immune response and tissue destruction compared to mice harboring a dysbiotic microbiome in response to morphine treatment, thus establishing dysbiotic microbiome as mediator of morphine gut pathophysiology. Integrative analysis of multi-omics data highlighted the associations betweenParasutterella excrementihominis, Burkholderiales bacterium 1_1_47,Enterococcus faecalis,Enterorhabdus caecimurisand altered levels of riboflavin, flavonoids, and lipid metabolites including phosphocholines, carnitines, bile acids, and ethanolamines with host gene expression changes involved in inflammation and barrier integrity of intestine. Omic analysis also highlighted the role of probiotic bacteriaLactobacillus johnsonii, metabolites flavonoids and riboflavin that were depleted with morphine as important factors for intestinal homeostasis. This study presents for the first time ever an interactive view of morphine-induced changes in microbial metabolism, strain level gut microbiome analysis and comprehensive view of changes in gut transcriptome. We also identified areas of potential therapeutic interventions to limit microbial dysbiosis and present a unique resource to the opioid research community.",37610102,PMC10448978,10.1080/19490976.2023.2246184,4,Gut microbes,101495343,9.434
Multi-omics data analysis reveals the biological implications of alternative splicing events in lung adenocarcinoma,"Cancer is characterized by the dysregulation of alternative splicing (AS). However, the comprehensive regulatory mechanisms of AS in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) are poorly understood. Here, we displayed the AS landscape in LUAD based on the integrated analyses of LUAD's multi-omics data. We identified 13,995 AS events in 6309 genes as differentially expressed alternative splicing events (DEASEs) mainly covering protein-coding genes. These DEASEs were strongly linked to ""cancer hallmarks"", such as apoptosis, DNA repair, cell cycle, cell proliferation, angiogenesis, immune response, generation of precursor metabolites and energy, p53 signaling pathway and PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. We further built a regulatory network connecting splicing factors (SFs) and DEASEs. In addition, RNA-binding protein (RBP) mutations that can affect DEASEs were investigated to find some potential cancer drivers. Further association analysis demonstrated that DNA methylation levels were highly correlated with DEASEs. In summary, our results can bring new insight into understanding the mechanism of AS and provide novel biomarkers for personalized medicine of LUAD.",37694487,,10.1142/S0219720023500208,0,Journal of bioinformatics and computational biology,101187344,1.204
Integrative time-scale and multi-omics analysis of host responses to viroid infection,"Viroids are circular RNAs of minimal complexity compelled to subvert plant-regulatory networks to accomplish their infectious process. Studies focused on the response to viroid-infection have mostly addressed specific regulatory levels and considered specifics infection-times. Thus, much remains to be done to understand the temporal evolution and complex nature of viroid-host interactions. Here we present an integrative analysis of the temporal evolution of the genome-wide alterations in cucumber plants infected with hop stunt viroid (HSVd) by integrating differential host transcriptome, sRNAnome and methylome. Our results support that HSVd promotes the redesign of the cucumber regulatory-pathways predominantly affecting specific regulatory layers at different infection-phases. The initial response was characterised by a reconfiguration of the host-transcriptome by differential exon-usage, followed by a progressive transcriptional downregulation modulated by epigenetic changes. Regarding endogenous small RNAs, the alterations were limited and mainly occurred at the late stage. Significant host-alterations were predominantly related to the downregulation of transcripts involved in plant-defence mechanisms, the restriction of pathogen-movement and the systemic spreading of defence signals. We expect that these data constituting the first comprehensive temporal-map of the plant-regulatory alterations associated with HSVd infection could contribute to elucidate the molecular basis of the yet poorly known host-response to viroid-induced pathogenesis.",37378473,,10.1111/pce.14647,1,"Plant, cell & environment",9309004,7.947
Big Data in Gastroenterology Research,"Studying individual data types in isolation provides only limited and incomplete answers to complex biological questions and particularly falls short in revealing sufficient mechanistic and kinetic details. In contrast, multi-omics approaches to studying health and disease permit the generation and integration of multiple data types on a much larger scale, offering a comprehensive picture of biological and disease processes. Gastroenterology and hepatobiliary research are particularly well-suited to such analyses, given the unique position of the luminal gastrointestinal (GI) tract at the nexus between the gut (mucosa and luminal contents), brain, immune and endocrine systems, and GI microbiome. The generation of 'big data' from multi-omic, multi-site studies can enhance investigations into the connections between these organ systems and organisms and more broadly and accurately appraise the effects of dietary, pharmacological, and other therapeutic interventions. In this review, we describe a variety of useful omics approaches and how they can be integrated to provide a holistic depiction of the human and microbial genetic and proteomic changes underlying physiological and pathophysiological phenomena. We highlight the potential pitfalls and alternatives to help avoid the common errors in study design, execution, and analysis. We focus on the application, integration, and analysis of big data in gastroenterology and hepatobiliary research.",36768780,PMC9916510,10.3390/ijms24032458,4,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,6.208
Adaptive Sparse Multi-Block PLS Discriminant Analysis: An Integrative Method for Identifying Key Biomarkers from Multi-Omics Data,"With the growing use of high-throughput technologies, multi-omics data containing various types of high-dimensional omics data is increasingly being generated to explore the association between the molecular mechanism of the host and diseases. In this study, we present an adaptive sparse multi-block partial least square discriminant analysis (asmbPLS-DA), an extension of our previous work, asmbPLS. This integrative approach identifies the most relevant features across different types of omics data while discriminating multiple disease outcome groups. We used simulation data with various scenarios and a real dataset from the TCGA project to demonstrate that asmbPLS-DA can identify key biomarkers from each type of omics data with better biological relevance than existing competitive methods. Moreover, asmbPLS-DA showed comparable performance in the classification of subjects in terms of disease status or phenotypes using integrated multi-omics molecular profiles, especially when combined with other classification algorithms, such as linear discriminant analysis and random forest. We have made the R package calledasmbPLSthat implements this method publicly available on GitHub. Overall, asmbPLS-DA achieved competitive performance in terms of feature selection and classification. We believe that asmbPLS-DA can be a valuable tool for multi-omics research.",37239321,PMC10218045,10.3390/genes14050961,1,Genes,101551097,4.141
Big data in yeast systems biology,"Systems biology uses computational and mathematical modeling to study complex interactions in a biological system. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which has served as both an important model organism and cell factory, has pioneered both the early development of such models and modeling concepts, and the more recent integration of multi-omics big data in these models to elucidate fundamental principles of biology. Here, we review the advancement of big data technologies to gain biological insight in three aspects of yeast systems biology: gene expression dynamics, cellular metabolism and the regulation network between gene expression and metabolism. The role of big data and complementary modeling approaches, including the expansion of genome-scale metabolic models and machine learning methodologies, are discussed as key drivers in the rapid advancement of yeast systems biology.",31603503,,10.1093/femsyr/foz070,8,FEMS yeast research,101085384,2.923
Randomized singular value decomposition for integrative subtype analysis of 'omics data' using non-negative matrix factorization,"Integration of multiple 'omics datasets for differentiating cancer subtypes is a powerful technic that leverages the consistent and complementary information across multi-omics data. Matrix factorization is a common technique used in integrative clustering for identifying latent subtype structure across multi-omics data. High dimensionality of the omics data and long computation time have been common challenges of clustering methods. In order to address the challenges, we propose randomized singular value decomposition (RSVD) for integrative clustering using Non-negative Matrix Factorization:intNMF-rsvd. The method utilizes RSVD to reduce the dimensionality by projecting the data into eigen vector space with user specified lower rank. Then, clustering analysis is carried out by estimating common basis matrix across the projected multi-omics datasets. The performance of the proposed method was assessed using the simulated datasets and compared with six state-of-the-art integrative clustering methods using real-life datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas Study.intNMF-rsvdwas found working efficiently and competitively as compared to standard intNMF and other multi-omics clustering methods. Most importantly,intNMF-rsvdcan handle large number of features and significantly reduce the computation time. The identified subtypes can be utilized for further clinical association studies to understand the etiology of the disease.",37937887,,10.1515/sagmb-2022-0047,0,Statistical applications in genetics and molecular biology,101176023,0.676
"scMHNN: a novel hypergraph neural network for integrative analysis of single-cell epigenomic, transcriptomic and proteomic data","Technological advances have now made it possible to simultaneously profile the changes of epigenomic, transcriptomic and proteomic at the single cell level, allowing a more unified view of cellular phenotypes and heterogeneities. However, current computational tools for single-cell multi-omics data integration are mainly tailored for bi-modality data, so new tools are urgently needed to integrate tri-modality data with complex associations. To this end, we develop scMHNN to integrate single-cell multi-omics data based on hypergraph neural network. After modeling the complex data associations among various modalities, scMHNN performs message passing process on the multi-omics hypergraph, which can capture the high-order data relationships and integrate the multiple heterogeneous features. Followingly, scMHNN learns discriminative cell representation via a dual-contrastive loss in self-supervised manner. Based on the pretrained hypergraph encoder, we further introduce the pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm, which allows more accurate cell-type annotation with only a small number of labeled cells as reference. Benchmarking results on real and simulated single-cell tri-modality datasets indicate that scMHNN outperforms other competing methods on both cell clustering and cell-type annotation tasks. In addition, we also demonstrate scMHNN facilitates various downstream tasks, such as cell marker detection and enrichment analysis.",37930028,,10.1093/bib/bbad391,0,Briefings in bioinformatics,100912837,13.994
Interpretation of network-based integration from multi-omics longitudinal data,"Multi-omics integration is key to fully understand complex biological processes in an holistic manner. Furthermore, multi-omics combined with new longitudinal experimental design can unreveal dynamic relationships between omics layers and identify key players or interactions in system development or complex phenotypes. However, integration methods have to address various experimental designs and do not guarantee interpretable biological results. The new challenge of multi-omics integration is to solve interpretation and unlock the hidden knowledge within the multi-omics data. In this paper, we go beyond integration and propose a generic approach to face the interpretation problem. From multi-omics longitudinal data, this approach builds and explores hybrid multi-omics networks composed of both inferred and known relationships within and between omics layers. With smart node labelling and propagation analysis, this approach predicts regulation mechanisms and multi-omics functional modules. We applied the method on 3 case studies with various multi-omics designs and identified new multi-layer interactions involved in key biological functions that could not be revealed with single omics analysis. Moreover, we highlighted interplay in the kinetics that could help identify novel biological mechanisms. This method is available as an R package netOmics to readily suit any application.",34883510,PMC8934642,10.1093/nar/gkab1200,20,Nucleic acids research,411011,19.16
Multi-omics integration analysis of GPCRs in pan-cancer to uncover inter-omics relationships and potential driver genes,"G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest drug target family. Unfortunately, applications of GPCRs in cancer therapy are scarce due to very limited knowledge regarding their correlations with cancers. Multi-omics data enables systematic investigations of GPCRs, yet their effective integration remains a challenge due to the complexity of the data. Here, we adopt two types of integration strategies, multi-staged and meta-dimensional approaches, to fully characterize somatic mutations, somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs), DNA methylations, and mRNA expressions of GPCRs in 33 cancers. Results from the multi-staged integration reveal that GPCR mutations cannot well predict expression dysregulation. The correlations between expressions and SCNAs are primarily positive, while correlations of the methylations with expressions and SCNAs are bimodal with negative correlations predominating. Based on these correlations, 32 and 144 potential cancer-related GPCRs driven by aberrant SCNA and methylation are identified, respectively. In addition, the meta-dimensional integration analysis is carried out by using deep learning models, which predict more than one hundred GPCRs as potential oncogenes. When comparing results between the two integration strategies, 165 cancer-related GPCRs are common in both, suggesting that they should be prioritized in future studies. However, 172 GPCRs emerge in only one, indicating that the two integration strategies should be considered concurrently to complement the information missed by the other such that obtain a more comprehensive understanding. Finally, correlation analysis further reveals that GPCRs, in particular for the class A and adhesion receptors, are generally immune-related. In a whole, the work is for the first time to reveal the associations between different omics layers and highlight the necessity of combing the two strategies in identifying cancer-related GPCRs.",37201441,,10.1016/j.compbiomed.2023.106988,4,Computers in biology and medicine,1250250,6.698
Geometric graph neural networks on multi-omics data to predict cancer survival outcomes,"The advance of sequencing technologies has enabled a thorough molecular characterization of the genome in human cancers. To improve patient prognosis predictions and subsequent treatment strategies, it is imperative to develop advanced computational methods to analyze large-scale, high-dimensional genomic data. However, traditional machine learning methods face a challenge in handling the high-dimensional, low-sample size problem that is shown in most genomic data sets. To address this, our group has developed geometric network analysis techniques on multi-omics data in connection with prior biological knowledge derived from protein-protein interactions (PPIs) or pathways. Geometric features obtained from the genomic network, such as Ollivier-Ricci curvature and the invariant measure of the associated Markov chain, have been shown to be predictive of survival outcomes in various cancers. In this study, we propose a novel supervised deep learning method called geometric graph neural network (GGNN) that incorporates such geometric features into deep learning for enhanced predictive power and interpretability. More specifically, we utilize a state-of-the-art graph neural network with sparse connections between the hidden layers based on known biology of the PPI network and pathway information. Geometric features along with multi-omics data are then incorporated into the corresponding layers. The proposed approach utilizes a local-global principle in such a manner that highly predictive features are selected at the front layers and fed directly to the last layer for multivariable Cox proportional-hazards regression modeling. The method was applied to multi-omics data from the CoMMpass study of multiple myeloma and ten major cancers in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). In most experiments, our method showed superior predictive performance compared to other alternative methods.",37329617,PMC10638676,10.1016/j.compbiomed.2023.107117,2,Computers in biology and medicine,1250250,6.698
Spatial multi-omics: novel tools to study the complexity of cardiovascular diseases,"Spatial multi-omic studies have emerged as a promising approach to comprehensively analyze cells in tissues, enabling the joint analysis of multiple data modalities like transcriptome, epigenome, proteome, and metabolome in parallel or even the same tissue section. This review focuses on the recent advancements in spatial multi-omics technologies, including novel data modalities and computational approaches. We discuss the advancements in low-resolution and high-resolution spatial multi-omics methods which can resolve up to 10,000 of individual molecules at subcellular level. By applying and integrating these techniques, researchers have recently gained valuable insights into the molecular circuits and mechanisms which govern cell biology along the cardiovascular disease spectrum. We provide an overview of current data analysis approaches, with a focus on data integration of multi-omic datasets, highlighting strengths and weaknesses of various computational pipelines. These tools play a crucial role in analyzing and interpreting spatial multi-omics datasets, facilitating the discovery of new findings, and enhancing translational cardiovascular research. Despite nontrivial challenges, such as the need for standardization of experimental setups, data analysis, and improved computational tools, the application of spatial multi-omics holds tremendous potential in revolutionizing our understanding of human disease processes and the identification of novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Exciting opportunities lie ahead for the spatial multi-omics field and will likely contribute to the advancement of personalized medicine for cardiovascular diseases.",38238823,PMC10795303,10.1186/s13073-024-01282-y,0,Genome medicine,101475844,15.266
CAS-viewer: web-based tool for splicing-guided integrative analysis of multi-omics cancer data,"Background:The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project is a public resource that provides transcriptomic, DNA sequence, methylation, and clinical data for 33 cancer types. Transforming the large size and high complexity of TCGA cancer genome data into integrated knowledge can be useful to promote cancer research. Alternative splicing (AS) is a key regulatory mechanism of genes in human cancer development and in the interaction with epigenetic factors. Therefore, AS-guided integration of existing TCGA data sets will make it easier to gain insight into the genetic architecture of cancer risk and related outcomes. There are already existing tools analyzing and visualizing alternative mRNA splicing patterns for large-scale RNA-seq experiments. However, these existing web-based tools are limited to the analysis of individual TCGA data sets at a time, such as only transcriptomic information.Results:We implemented CAS-viewer (integrative analysis of Cancer genome data based on Alternative Splicing), a web-based tool leveraging multi-cancer omics data from TCGA. It illustrates alternative mRNA splicing patterns along with methylation, miRNAs, and SNPs, and then provides an analysis tool to link differential transcript expression ratio to methylation, miRNA, and splicing regulatory elements for 33 cancer types. Moreover, one can analyze AS patterns with clinical data to identify potential transcripts associated with different survival outcome for each cancer.Conclusions:CAS-viewer is a web-based application for transcript isoform-driven integration of multi-omics data in multiple cancer types and will aid in the visualization and possible discovery of biomarkers for cancer by integrating multi-omics data from TCGA.",29697367,PMC5918456,10.1186/s12920-018-0348-8,7,BMC medical genomics,101319628,3.622
Deep learning applications in single-cell genomics and transcriptomics data analysis,"Traditional bulk sequencing methods are limited to measuring the average signal in a group of cells, potentially masking heterogeneity, and rare populations. The single-cell resolution, however, enhances our understanding of complex biological systems and diseases, such as cancer, the immune system, and chronic diseases. However, the single-cell technologies generate massive amounts of data that are often high-dimensional, sparse, and complex, thus making analysis with traditional computational approaches difficult and unfeasible. To tackle these challenges, many are turning to deep learning (DL) methods as potential alternatives to the conventional machine learning (ML) algorithms for single-cell studies. DL is a branch of ML capable of extracting high-level features from raw inputs in multiple stages. Compared to traditional ML, DL models have provided significant improvements across many domains and applications. In this work, we examine DL applications in genomics, transcriptomics, spatial transcriptomics, and multi-omics integration, and address whether DL techniques will prove to be advantageous or if the single-cell omics domain poses unique challenges. Through a systematic literature review, we have found that DL has not yet revolutionized the most pressing challenges of the single-cell omics field. However, using DL models for single-cell omics has shown promising results (in many cases outperforming the previous state-of-the-art models) in data preprocessing and downstream analysis. Although developments of DL algorithms for single-cell omics have generally been gradual, recent advances reveal that DL can offer valuable resources in fast-tracking and advancing research in single-cell.",37393865,,10.1016/j.biopha.2023.115077,11,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,8213295,7.419

Practicing precision medicine with intelligently integrative clinical and multi-omics data analysis,"Precision medicine aims to empower clinicians to predict the most appropriate course of action for patients with complex diseases like cancer, diabetes, cardiomyopathy, and COVID-19. With a progressive interpretation of the clinical, molecular, and genomic factors at play in diseases, more effective and personalized medical treatments are anticipated for many disorders. Understanding patient's metabolomics and genetic make-up in conjunction with clinical data will significantly lead to determining predisposition, diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive biomarkers and paths ultimately providing optimal and personalized care for diverse, and targeted chronic and acute diseases. In clinical settings, we need to timely model clinical and multi-omics data to find statistical patterns across millions of features to identify underlying biologic pathways, modifiable risk factors, and actionable information that support early detection and prevention of complex disorders, and development of new therapies for better patient care. It is important to calculate quantitative phenotype measurements, evaluate variants in unique genes and interpret using ACMG guidelines, find frequency of pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants without disease indicators, and observe autosomal recessive carriers with a phenotype manifestation in metabolome. Next, ensuring security to reconcile noise, we need to build and train machine-learning prognostic models to meaningfully process multisource heterogeneous data to identify high-risk rare variants and make medically relevant predictions. The goal, today, is to facilitate implementation of mainstream precision medicine to improve the traditional symptom-driven practice of medicine, and allow earlier interventions using predictive diagnostics and tailoring better-personalized treatments.

Deep learning based feature-level integration of multi-omics data for breast cancer patients survival analysis,"Background:Breast cancer is the most prevalent and among the most deadly cancers in females. Patients with breast cancer have highly variable survival lengths, indicating a need to identify prognostic biomarkers for personalized diagnosis and treatment. With the development of new technologies such as next-generation sequencing, multi-omics information are becoming available for a more thorough evaluation of a patient's condition. In this study, we aim to improve breast cancer overall survival prediction by integrating multi-omics data (e.g., gene expression, DNA methylation, miRNA expression, and copy number variations (CNVs)).Methods:Motivated by multi-view learning, we propose a novel strategy to integrate multi-omics data for breast cancer survival prediction by applying complementary and consensus principles. The complementary principle assumes each -omics data contains modality-unique information. To preserve such information, we develop a concatenation autoencoder (ConcatAE) that concatenates the hidden features learned from each modality for integration. The consensus principle assumes that the disagreements among modalities upper bound the model errors. To get rid of the noises or discrepancies among modalities, we develop a cross-modality autoencoder (CrossAE) to maximize the agreement among modalities to achieve a modality-invariant representation. We first validate the effectiveness of our proposed models on the MNIST simulated data. We then apply these models to the TCCA breast cancer multi-omics data for overall survival prediction.Results:For breast cancer overall survival prediction, the integration of DNA methylation and miRNA expression achieves the best overall performance of 0.641 ± 0.031 with ConcatAE, and 0.63 ± 0.081 with CrossAE. Both strategies outperform baseline single-modality models using only DNA methylation (0.583 ± 0.058) or miRNA expression (0.616 ± 0.057).Conclusions:In conclusion, we achieve improved overall survival prediction performance by utilizing either the complementary or consensus information among multi-omics data. The proposed ConcatAE and CrossAE models can inspire future deep representation-based multi-omics integration techniques. We believe these novel multi-omics integration models can benefit the personalized diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer patients.",32933515,PMC7493161,10.1186/s12911-020-01225-8,26,BMC medical informatics and decision making,101088682,3.298
Multi-omics Data Integration in the Context of Plant Abiotic Stress Signaling,"In order to answer new biological questions, high-throughput data generated by new biotechnologies can be very meaningful but require specific and adapted statistical treatments. Thus, in the context of abiotic stress signaling studies, understanding the integration of cascading mechanisms from stress perception to biochemical and physiological adjustments necessarily entails efficient and valid analysis of multilevel and heterogeneous data. In this chapter, we propose examples to manage, analyze, and integrate multi-omics heterogeneous data. This workflow suggests and follows different general biological questions or issues answered with detailed code, data analysis, multiple visualizations, and always followed by brief interpretations. We illustrated this using the mixOmics package for the R software, as it specifically provides tools to address vertical and horizontal data integration issues. In order to illustrate this workflow, we used the usual omics datasets biologists can generate (phenomics, metabolomics, proteomics, and transcriptomics). These data were collected from two organs (leaf rosettes, floral stems) of five ecotypes of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana exposed to two temperature growth conditions.

A multi-omics dataset for the analysis of frontotemporal dementia genetic subtypes,"Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is essential for the development of successful therapies. Systematic studies on human post-mortem brain tissue of patients with genetic subtypes of FTD are currently lacking. The Risk and Modyfing Factors of Frontotemporal Dementia (RiMod-FTD) consortium therefore has generated a multi-omics dataset for genetic subtypes of FTD to identify common and distinct molecular mechanisms disturbed in disease. Here, we present multi-omics datasets generated from the frontal lobe of post-mortem human brain tissue from patients with mutations in MAPT, GRN and C9orf72 and healthy controls. This data resource consists of four datasets generated with different technologies to capture the transcriptome by RNA-seq, small RNA-seq, CAGE-seq, and methylation profiling. We show concrete examples on how to use the resulting data and confirm current knowledge about FTD and identify new processes for further investigation. This extensive multi-omics dataset holds great value to reveal new research avenues for this devastating disease.",38040703,PMC10692098,10.1038/s41597-023-02598-x,0,Scientific data,101640192,8.501
Multi-omics integration in the age of million single-cell data,"An explosion in single-cell technologies has revealed a previously underappreciated heterogeneity of cell types and novel cell-state associations with sex, disease, development and other processes. Starting with transcriptome analyses, single-cell techniques have extended to multi-omics approaches and now enable the simultaneous measurement of data modalities and spatial cellular context. Data are now available for millions of cells, for whole-genome measurements and for multiple modalities. Although analyses of such multimodal datasets have the potential to provide new insights into biological processes that cannot be inferred with a single mode of assay, the integration of very large, complex, multimodal data into biological models and mechanisms represents a considerable challenge. An understanding of the principles of data integration and visualization methods is required to determine what methods are best applied to a particular single-cell dataset. Each class of method has advantages and pitfalls in terms of its ability to achieve various biological goals, including cell-type classification, regulatory network modelling and biological process inference. In choosing a data integration strategy, consideration must be given to whether the multi-omics data are matched (that is, measured on the same cell) or unmatched (that is, measured on different cells) and, more importantly, the overall modelling and visualization goals of the integrated analysis.",34417589,PMC9191639,10.1038/s41581-021-00463-x,56,Nature reviews.

Multi-omics analyses of glucose metabolic reprogramming in colorectal cancer,"Background:Glucose metabolic reprogramming (GMR) is a cardinal feature of carcinogenesis and metastasis. However, the underlying mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. The aim of this study was to profile the metabolic signature of primary tumor and circulating tumor cells from metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients using integrated omics analysis.Methods:PET-CT imaging, serum metabolomics, genomics and proteomics data of 325 high 18F-fluorinated deoxyglucose (FDGhigh) mCRC patients were analyzed. The para-tumor, primary tumor and liver metastatic tissues of mCRC patients were used for proteomics analysis.Results:The glucose uptake in tumor tissues as per the PET/CT images was correlated to serum levels of glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (ALT), total bilirubin (TBIL), creatinine (CRE). Proteomics analysis indicated that several differentially expressed proteins were enriched in both GMR and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related pathways. Using a tissue-optimized proteomic workflow, we identified novel proteomic markers (e.g. CCND1, EPCAM, RPS6), a novel PCK1-CDK6-INSR protein axis, and a potential role for FOLR (FR) in GMR/EMT of CRC cells. Finally, CEA/blood glucose (CSR) was defined as a new index, which can be used to jointly diagnose liver metastasis of colorectal cancer.Conclusions:GMR in CRC cells is closely associated with the EMT pathway, and this network is a promising source of potential therapeutic targets.",37475862,PMC10354426,10.3389/fimmu.2023.1179699,0,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,8.786
Integrated multi-omics analysis of Alzheimer's disease shows molecular signatures associated with disease progression and potential therapeutic targets,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by the formation of amyloid plaques implicated in neuronal death. Genetics, age, and sex are the risk factors attributed to AD. Though omics studies have helped to identify pathways associated with AD, an integrated systems analysis with the available data could help to understand mechanisms, potential biomarkers, and therapeutic targets. Analysis of transcriptomic data sets from the GEO database, and proteomic and metabolomic data sets from literature was performed to identify deregulated pathways and commonality analysis identified overlapping pathways among the data sets. The deregulated pathways included those of neurotransmitter synapses, oxidative stress, inflammation, vitamins, complement, and coagulation pathways. Cell type analysis of GEO data sets showed microglia, endothelial, myeloid, and lymphoid cells are affected. Microglia are associated with inflammation and pruning of synapses with implications for memory and cognition. Analysis of the protein-cofactor network of B2, B6,and pantothenate shows metabolic pathways modulated by these vitamins which overlap with the deregulated pathways from the multi-omics analysis. Overall, the integrated analysis identified the molecular signature associated with AD. Treatment with anti-oxidants, B2, B6, and pantothenate in genetically susceptible individuals in the pre-symptomatic stage might help in better management of the disease.",36879094,PMC9986671,10.1038/s41598-023-30892-6,8,Scientific reports,101563288,4.996
Clustering of single-cell multi-omics data with a multimodal deep learning method,"Single-cell multimodal sequencing technologies are developed to simultaneously profile different modalities of data in the same cell. It provides a unique opportunity to jointly analyze multimodal data at the single-cell level for the identification of distinct cell types. A correct clustering result is essential for the downstream complex biological functional studies. However, combining different data sources for clustering analysis of single-cell multimodal data remains a statistical and computational challenge. Here, we develop a novel multimodal deep learning method, scMDC, for single-cell multi-omics data clustering analysis. scMDC is an end-to-end deep model that explicitly characterizes different data sources and jointly learns latent features of deep embedding for clustering analysis. Extensive simulation and real-data experiments reveal that scMDC outperforms existing single-cell single-modal and multimodal clustering methods on different single-cell multimodal datasets. The linear scalability of running time makes scMDC a promising method for analyzing large multimodal datasets.",36513636,PMC9748135,10.1038/s41467-022-35031-9,11,Nature communications,101528555,17.694
MOMA: a multi-task attention learning algorithm for multi-omics data interpretation and classification,"Motivation:Accurate diagnostic classification and biological interpretation are important in biology and medicine, which are data-rich sciences. Thus, integration of different data types is necessary for the high predictive accuracy of clinical phenotypes, and more comprehensive analyses for predicting the prognosis of complex diseases are required.Results:Here, we propose a novel multi-task attention learning algorithm for multi-omics data, termed MOMA, which captures important biological processes for high diagnostic performance and interpretability. MOMA vectorizes features and modules using a geometric approach and focuses on important modules in multi-omics data via an attention mechanism. Experiments using public data on Alzheimer's disease and cancer with various classification tasks demonstrated the superior performance of this approach.

Bayesian linear mixed model with multiple random effects for prediction analysis on high-dimensional multi-omics data,"Motivation:Accurate disease risk prediction is an essential step in the modern quest for precision medicine. While high-dimensional multi-omics data have provided unprecedented data resources for prediction studies, their high-dimensionality and complex inter/intra-relationships have posed significant analytical challenges.Results:We proposed a two-step Bayesian linear mixed model framework (TBLMM) for risk prediction analysis on multi-omics data. TBLMM models the predictive effects from multi-omics data using a hybrid of the sparsity regression and linear mixed model with multiple random effects. It can resemble the shape of the true effect size distributions and accounts for non-linear, including interaction effects, among multi-omics data via kernel fusion. It infers its parameters via a computationally efficient variational Bayes algorithm. Through extensive simulation studies and the prediction analyses on the positron emission tomography imaging outcomes using data obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, we have demonstrated that TBLMM can consistently outperform the existing method in predicting the risk of complex traits.Availability and implementation:The corresponding R package is available on GitHub (https://github.com/YaluWen/TBLMM).",37882747,PMC10627352,10.1093/bioinformatics/btad647,0,"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",9808944,6.931
Evaluation and comparison of multi-omics data integration methods for cancer subtyping,"Computational integrative analysis has become a significant approach in the data-driven exploration of biological problems. Many integration methods for cancer subtyping have been proposed, but evaluating these methods has become a complicated problem due to the lack of gold standards. Moreover, questions of practical importance remain to be addressed regarding the impact of selecting appropriate data types and combinations on the performance of integrative studies. Here, we constructed three classes of benchmarking datasets of nine cancers in TCGA by considering all the eleven combinations of four multi-omics data types. Using these datasets, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of ten representative integration methods for cancer subtyping in terms of accuracy measured by combining both clustering accuracy and clinical significance, robustness, and computational efficiency. We subsequently investigated the influence of different omics data on cancer subtyping and the effectiveness of their combinations. Refuting the widely held intuition that incorporating more types of omics data always produces better results, our analyses showed that there are situations where integrating more omics data negatively impacts the performance of integration methods. Our analyses also suggested several effective combinations for most cancers under our studies, which may be of particular interest to researchers in omics data analysis.",34383739,PMC8384175,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009224,24,PLoS computational biology,101238922,4.779
Scbean: a python library for single-cell multi-omics data analysis,"Summary:Single-cell multi-omics technologies provide a unique platform for characterizing cell states and reconstructing developmental process by simultaneously quantifying and integrating molecular signatures across various modalities, including genome, transcriptome, epigenome, and other omics layers. However, there is still an urgent unmet need for novel computational tools in this nascent field, which are critical for both effective and efficient interrogation of functionality across different omics modalities. Scbean represents a user-friendly Python library, designed to seamlessly incorporate a diverse array of models for the examination of single-cell data, encompassing both paired and unpaired multi-omics data. The library offers uniform and straightforward interfaces for tasks, such as dimensionality reduction, batch effect elimination, cell label transfer from well-annotated scRNA-seq data to scATAC-seq data, and the identification of spatially variable genes.

A powerful framework for an integrative study with heterogeneous omics data: from univariate statistics to multi-block analysis,"High-throughput data generated by new biotechnologies require specific and adapted statistical treatment in order to be efficiently used in biological studies. In this article, we propose a powerful framework to manage and analyse multi-omics heterogeneous data to carry out an integrative analysis. We have illustrated this using the mixOmics package for R software as it specifically addresses data integration issues. Our work also aims at applying the most recent functionalities of mixOmics to real datasets. Although multi-block integrative methodologies exist, we hope to encourage a more widespread use of such approaches in an operational framework by biologists. We have used natural populations of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana in this work, but the framework proposed is not limited to this plant and can be deployed whatever the organisms of interest and the biological question may be. Four omics datasets (phenomics, metabolomics, cell wall proteomics and transcriptomics) were collected, analysed and integrated to study the cell wall plasticity of plants exposed to sub-optimal temperature growth conditions. The methodologies presented here start from basic univariate statistics leading to multi-block integration analysis. We have also highlighted the fact that each method, either unsupervised or supervised, is associated with one biological issue. Using this powerful framework enabled us to arrive at novel conclusions on the biological system, which would not have been possible using standard statistical approaches.",32778869,,10.1093/bib/bbaa166,8,Briefings in bioinformatics,100912837,13.994
Multi-Omics Analysis of NCI-60 Cell Line Data Reveals Novel Metabolic Processes Linked with Resistance to Alkylating Anti-Cancer Agents,"This study aimed to elucidate the molecular determinants influencing the response of cancer cells to alkylating agents, a major class of chemotherapeutic drugs used in cancer treatment. The study utilized data from the National Cancer Institute (NCI)-60 cell line screening program and employed a comprehensive multi-omics approach integrating transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic, and SNP data. Through integrated pathway analysis, the study identified key metabolic pathways, such as cysteine and methionine metabolism, starch and sucrose metabolism, pyrimidine metabolism, and purine metabolism, that differentiate drug-sensitive and drug-resistant cancer cells. The analysis also revealed potential druggable targets within these pathways. Furthermore, copy number variant (CNV) analysis, derived from SNP data, between sensitive and resistant cells identified notable differences in genes associated with metabolic changes (WWOX, CNTN5, DDAH1, PGR), protein trafficking (ARL17B, VAT1L), and miRNAs (MIR1302-2, MIR3163, MIR1244-3, MIR1302-9). The findings of this study provide a holistic view of the molecular landscape and dysregulated pathways underlying the response of cancer cells to alkylating agents. The insights gained from this research can contribute to the development of more effective therapeutic strategies and personalized treatment approaches, ultimately improving patient outcomes in cancer treatment.",37686047,PMC10487847,10.3390/ijms241713242,1,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,6.208
Integrating multi-omics data through deep learning for accurate cancer prognosis prediction,"Background:Genomic information is nowadays widely used for precise cancer treatments. Since the individual type of omics data only represents a single view that suffers from data noise and bias, multiple types of omics data are required for accurate cancer prognosis prediction. However, it is challenging to effectively integrate multi-omics data due to the large number of redundant variables but relatively small sample size. With the recent progress in deep learning techniques, Autoencoder was used to integrate multi-omics data for extracting representative features. Nevertheless, the generated model is fragile from data noises. Additionally, previous studies usually focused on individual cancer types without making comprehensive tests on pan-cancer. Here, we employed the denoising Autoencoder to get a robust representation of the multi-omics data, and then used the learned representative features to estimate patients' risks.Results:By applying to 15 cancers from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), our method was shown to improve the C-index values over previous methods by 6.5% on average. Considering the difficulty to obtain multi-omics data in practice, we further used only mRNA data to fit the estimated risks by training XGboost models, and found the models could achieve an average C-index value of 0.627. As a case study, the breast cancer prognosis prediction model was independently tested on three datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), and shown able to significantly separate high-risk patients from low-risk ones (C-index>0.6, p-values<0.05). Based on the risk subgroups divided by our method, we identified nine prognostic markers highly associated with breast cancer, among which seven genes have been proved by literature review.Conclusion:Our comprehensive tests indicated that we have constructed an accurate and robust framework to integrate multi-omics data for cancer prognosis prediction. Moreover, it is an effective way to discover cancer prognosis-related genes.",33989895,,10.1016/j.compbiomed.2021.104481,31,Computers in biology and medicine,1250250,6.698
IgE-Mediated Peanut Allergy: Current and Novel Predictive Biomarkers for Clinical Phenotypes Using Multi-Omics Approaches,"Food allergy is a collective term for several immune-mediated responses to food. IgE-mediated food allergy is the best-known subtype. The patients present with a marked diversity of clinical profiles including symptomatic manifestations, threshold reactivity and reaction kinetics. In-vitro predictors of these clinical phenotypes are evasive and considered as knowledge gaps in food allergy diagnosis and risk management. Peanut allergy is a relevant disease model where pioneer discoveries were made in diagnosis, immunotherapy and prevention. This review provides an overview on the immune basis for phenotype variations in peanut-allergic individuals, in the light of future patient stratification along emerging omic-areas. Beyond specific IgE-signatures and basophil reactivity profiles with established correlation to clinical outcome, allergenomics, mass spectrometric resolution of peripheral allergen tracing, might be a fundamental approach to understand disease pathophysiology underlying biomarker discovery. Deep immune phenotyping is thought to reveal differential cell responses but also, gene expression and gene methylation profiles (eg, peanut severity genes) are promising areas for biomarker research. Finally, the study of microbiome-host interactions with a focus on the immune system modulation might hold the key to understand tissue-specific responses and symptoms. The immune mechanism underlying acute food-allergic events remains elusive until today. Deciphering this immunological response shall enable to identify novel biomarker for stratification of patients into reaction endotypes. The availability of powerful multi-omics technologies, together with integrated data analysis, network-based approaches and unbiased machine learning holds out the prospect of providing clinically useful biomarkers or biomarker signatures being predictive for reaction phenotypes.",33584660,PMC7876438,10.3389/fimmu.2020.594350,7,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,8.786
Multi-omics annotation of human long non-coding RNAs,"LncRNAs (long non-coding RNAs) are pervasively transcribed in the human genome and also extensively involved in a variety of essential biological processes and human diseases. The comprehensive annotation of human lncRNAs is of great significance in navigating the functional landscape of the human genome and deepening the understanding of the multi-featured RNA world. However, the unique characteristics of lncRNAs as well as their enormous quantity have complicated and challenged the annotation of lncRNAs. Advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies give rise to a large volume of omics data that are generated at an unprecedented rate and scale, providing possibilities in the identification, characterization and functional annotation of lncRNAs. Here, we review the recent important discoveries of human lncRNAs through analysis of various omics data and summarize specialized lncRNA database resources. Moreover, we highlight the multi-omics integrative analysis as a powerful strategy to efficiently discover and characterize the functional lncRNAs and elucidate their potential molecular mechanisms.",32756901,,10.1042/BST20191063,4,Biochemical Society transactions,7506897,4.919
Nano-omics: nanotechnology-based multidimensional harvesting of the blood-circulating cancerome,"Over the past decade, the development of 'simple' blood tests that enable cancer screening, diagnosis or monitoring and facilitate the design of personalized therapies without the need for invasive tumour biopsy sampling has been a core ambition in cancer research. Data emerging from ongoing biomarker development efforts indicate that multiple markers, used individually or as part of a multimodal panel, are required to enhance the sensitivity and specificity of assays for early stage cancer detection. The discovery of cancer-associated molecular alterations that are reflected in blood at multiple dimensions (genome, epigenome, transcriptome, proteome and metabolome) and integration of the resultant multi-omics data have the potential to uncover novel biomarkers as well as to further elucidate the underlying molecular pathways. Herein, we review key advances in multi-omics liquid biopsy approaches and introduce the 'nano-omics' paradigm: the development and utilization of nanotechnology tools for the enrichment and subsequent omics analysis of the blood-circulating cancerome.",35739399,,10.1038/s41571-022-00645-x,8,Nature reviews.

DRAMS: A tool to detect and re-align mixed-up samples for integrative studies of multi-omics data,"Studies of complex disorders benefit from integrative analyses of multiple omics data. Yet, sample mix-ups frequently occur in multi-omics studies, weakening statistical power and risking false findings. Accurately aligning sample information, genotype, and corresponding omics data is critical for integrative analyses. We developed DRAMS (https://github.com/Yi-Jiang/DRAMS) to Detect and Re-Align Mixed-up Samples to address the sample mix-up problem. It uses a logistic regression model followed by a modified topological sorting algorithm to identify the potential true IDs based on data relationships of multi-omics. According to tests using simulated data, the more types of omics data used or the smaller the proportion of mix-ups, the better that DRAMS performs. Applying DRAMS to real data from the PsychENCODE BrainGVEX project, we detected and corrected 201 (12.5% of total data generated) mix-ups. Of the 21 mix-ups involving errors of racial identity, DRAMS re-assigned all data to the correct racial group in the 1000 Genomes project. In doing so, quantitative trait loci (QTL) (FDR<0.01) increased by an average of 1.62-fold. The use of DRAMS in multi-omics studies will strengthen statistical power of the study and improve quality of the results. Even though very limited studies have multi-omics data in place, we expect such data will increase quickly with the needs of DRAMS.",32282793,PMC7179940,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007522,4,PLoS computational biology,101238922,4.779

Integration of Meta-Multi-Omics Data Using Probabilistic Graphs and External Knowledge,"Multi-omics has the promise to provide a detailed molecular picture of biological systems. Although obtaining multi-omics data is relatively easy, methods that analyze such data have been lagging. In this paper, we present an algorithm that uses probabilistic graph representations and external knowledge to perform optimal structure learning and deduce a multifarious interaction network for multi-omics data from a bacterial community. Kefir grain, a microbial community that ferments milk and creates kefir, represents a self-renewing, stable, natural microbial community. Kefir has been shown to have a wide range of health benefits. We obtained a controlled bacterial community using the two most abundant and well-studied species in kefir grains:Lentilactobacillus kefiriandLactobacillus kefiranofaciens. We applied growth temperatures of 30 °C and 37 °C and obtained transcriptomic, metabolomic, and proteomic data for the same 20 samples (10 samples per temperature). We obtained a multi-omics interaction network, which generated insights that would not have been possible with single-omics analysis. We identified interactions among transcripts, proteins, and metabolites, suggesting active toxin/antitoxin systems. We also observed multifarious interactions that involved the shikimate pathway. These observations helped explain bacterial adaptation to different stress conditions, co-aggregation, and increased activation ofL. kefiranofaciensat 37 °C.",37566077,PMC10417344,10.3390/cells12151998,0,Cells,101600052,7.666

Agroecosystem engineering extended from plant-microbe interactions revealed by multi-omics data,"In an agroecosystem, plants and microbes coexist and interact with environmental factors such as climate, soil, and pests. However, agricultural practices that depend on chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and frequent tillage often disrupt the beneficial interactions in the agroecosystem. To reconcile the improvement of crop performance and reduction in environmental impacts in agriculture, we need to understand the functions of the complex interactions and develop an agricultural system that can maximize the potential benefits of the agroecosystem. Therefore, we are developing a system called the agroecosystem engineering system, which aims to optimize the interactions between crops, microbes, and environmental factors, using multi-omics analysis.

When multiple omic methods are used, statistical and computational approaches can exploit these large, connected profiles. Multi-omics is the integration of different omic data sources from the same biological sample. In this review, we focus on correlation-based dimension reduction approaches for single omic datasets, followed by methods for pairs of omics datasets, before detailing further techniques for three or more omic datasets. We also briefly detail network methods when three or more omic datasets are available and which complement correlation-oriented tools. To aid readers new to this area, these are all linked to relevant R packages that can implement these procedures. Finally, we discuss scenarios of experimental design and present road maps that simplify the selection of appropriate analysis methods.

Multimodal deep learning approaches for single-cell multi-omics data integration,"Integrating single-cell multi-omics data is a challenging task that has led to new insights into complex cellular systems. Various computational methods have been proposed to effectively integrate these rapidly accumulating datasets, including deep learning. However, despite the proven success of deep learning in integrating multi-omics data and its better performance over classical computational methods, there has been no systematic study of its application to single-cell multi-omics data integration. To fill this gap, we conducted a literature review to explore the use of multimodal deep learning techniques in single-cell multi-omics data integration, taking into account recent studies from multiple perspectives. Specifically, we first summarized different modalities found in single-cell multi-omics data. We then reviewed current deep learning techniques for processing multimodal data and categorized deep learning-based integration methods for single-cell multi-omics data according to data modality, deep learning architecture, fusion strategy, key tasks and downstream analysis. Finally, we provided insights into using these deep learning models to integrate multi-omics data and better understand single-cell biological mechanisms.",37651607,PMC10516349,10.1093/bib/bbad313,2,Briefings in bioinformatics,100912837,13.994
Integrative phenotyping framework (iPF): integrative clustering of multiple omics data identifies novel lung disease subphenotypes,"Background:The increased multi-omics information on carefully phenotyped patients in studies of complex diseases requires novel methods for data integration. Unlike continuous intensity measurements from most omics data sets, phenome data contain clinical variables that are binary, ordinal and categorical.Results:In this paper we introduce an integrative phenotyping framework (iPF) for disease subtype discovery. A feature topology plot was developed for effective dimension reduction and visualization of multi-omics data. The approach is free of model assumption and robust to data noises or missingness. We developed a workflow to integrate homogeneous patient clustering from different omics data in an agglomerative manner and then visualized heterogeneous clustering of pairwise omics sources. We applied the framework to two batches of lung samples obtained from patients diagnosed with chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) or interstitial lung disease (ILD) with well-characterized clinical (phenomic) data, mRNA and microRNA expression profiles. Application of iPF to the first training batch identified clusters of patients consisting of homogenous disease phenotypes as well as clusters with intermediate disease characteristics. Analysis of the second batch revealed a similar data structure, confirming the presence of intermediate clusters. Genes in the intermediate clusters were enriched with inflammatory and immune functional annotations, suggesting that they represent mechanistically distinct disease subphenotypes that may response to immunomodulatory therapies. The iPF software package and all source codes are publicly available.Conclusions:Identification of subclusters with distinct clinical and biomolecular characteristics suggests that integration of phenomic and other omics information could lead to identification of novel mechanism-based disease sub-phenotypes.",26560100,PMC4642618,10.1186/s12864-015-2170-4,46,BMC genomics,100965258,4.547
Multi-omics at single-cell resolution: comparison of experimental and data fusion approaches,"Biological samples are inherently heterogeneous and complex. Tackling this complexity requires innovative technological and analytical solutions. Recent advances in high-throughput single-cell isolation and nucleic acid barcoding methods are rapidly changing the technological landscape of biological sciences and now make it possible to measure the (epi)genomic, transcriptomic, or proteomic state of individual cells. In addition, few experimental approaches enable multi-omics measurements of the same cell. However, merging-omics data collected from different experiments remains a considerable challenge. Although several strategies for merging transcriptomics datasets have recently been introduced, cell-to-cell variability and heterogeneity remains one of the confounding factors limiting data fusion and integration. Here, we focus our discussion on the latest single-cell technological and analytical solutions to achieve high data dimensionality and resolution. Obtaining datasets with a wealth of multi-omics information will undoubtedly provide new avenues for researchers to unravel the complexity of biological samples encountered in modern biological research and molecular diagnostics.",30368064,,10.1016/j.copbio.2018.09.012,15,Current opinion in biotechnology,9100492,10.279
Integrative multi-omics characterization reveals sex differences in glioblastoma,"Background:Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and lethal primary brain tumor in adults, with limited treatment modalities and poor prognosis. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of considering sex differences in cancer incidence, prognosis, molecular disparities, and treatment outcomes across various tumor types, including colorectal adenocarcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, and GBM.Methods:We performed comprehensive analyses of large-scale multi-omics data (genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data) from TCGA, GLASS, and CPTAC to investigate the genetic and molecular determinants that contribute to the unique clinical properties of male and female GBM patients.Results:Our results revealed several key differences, including enrichments of MGMT promoter methylation, which correlated with increased overall and post-recurrence survival and improved response to chemotherapy in female patients. Moreover, female GBM exhibited a higher degree of genomic instability, including aneuploidy and tumor mutational burden. Integrative proteomic and phosphor-proteomic characterization uncovered sex-specific protein abundance and phosphorylation activities, including EGFR activation in males and SPP1 hyperphosphorylation in female patients. Lastly, the identified sex-specific biomarkers demonstrated prognostic significance, suggesting their potential as therapeutic targets.Conclusions:Collectively, our study provides unprecedented insights into the fundamental modulators of tumor progression and clinical outcomes between male and female GBM patients and facilitates sex-specific treatment interventions. Highlights Female GBM patients were characterized by increased MGMT promoter methylation and favorable clinical outcomes compared to male patients. Female GBMs exhibited higher levels of genomic instability, including aneuploidy and TMB. Each sex-specific GBM is characterized by unique pathway dysregulations and molecular subtypes.

Multi-omics Visualization Platform: An extensible Galaxy plug-in for multi-omics data visualization and exploration,"Background:Proteogenomics integrates genomics, transcriptomics, and mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics data to identify novel protein sequences arising from gene and transcript sequence variants. Proteogenomic data analysis requires integration of disparate 'omic software tools, as well as customized tools to view and interpret results. The flexible Galaxy platform has proven valuable for proteogenomic data analysis. Here, we describe a novel Multi-omics Visualization Platform (MVP) for organizing, visualizing, and exploring proteogenomic results, adding a critically needed tool for data exploration and interpretation.Findings:MVP is built as an HTML Galaxy plug-in, primarily based on JavaScript. Via the Galaxy API, MVP uses SQLite databases as input-a custom data type (mzSQLite) containing MS-based peptide identification information, a variant annotation table, and a coding sequence table. Users can interactively filter identified peptides based on sequence and data quality metrics, view annotated peptide MS data, and visualize protein-level information, along with genomic coordinates. Peptides that pass the user-defined thresholds can be sent back to Galaxy via the API for further analysis; processed data and visualizations can also be saved and shared. MVP leverages the Integrated Genomics Viewer JavaScript framework, enabling interactive visualization of peptides and corresponding transcript and genomic coding information within the MVP interface.Conclusions:MVP provides a powerful, extensible platform for automated, interactive visualization of proteogenomic results within the Galaxy environment, adding a unique and critically needed tool for empowering exploration and interpretation of results.

iODA: An integrated tool for analysis of cancer pathway consistency from heterogeneous multi-omics data,"The latest advances in the next generation sequencing technology have greatly facilitated the extensive research of genomics and transcriptomics, thereby promoting the decoding of carcinogenesis with unprecedented resolution. Considering the contribution of analyzing high-throughput multi-omics data to the exploration of cancer molecular mechanisms, an integrated tool for heterogeneous multi-omics data analysis (iODA) is proposed for the systems-level interpretation of multi-omics data, i.e., transcriptomic profiles (mRNA or miRNA expression data) and protein-DNA interactions (ChIP-Seq data). Considering the data heterogeneity, iODA can compare six statistical algorithms in differential analysis for the selected sample data and assist users in choosing the globally optimal one for dysfunctional mRNA or miRNA identification. Since molecular signatures are more consistent at the pathway level than at the gene level, the tool is able to enrich the identified dysfunctional molecules onto the KEGG pathways and extracted the consistent items as key components for further pathogenesis investigation. Compared with other tools, iODA is multi-functional for the systematic analysis of different level of omics data, and its analytical power was demonstrated through case studies of single and cross-level prostate cancer omics data. iODA is open source under GNU GPL and can be downloaded from http://www.sysbio.org.cn/iODA.",33096244,,10.1016/j.jbi.2020.103605,4,Journal of biomedical informatics,100970413,8.0
Multi-omics analysis of functional substances and expression verification in cashmere fineness,"Background:Numerous factors influence the growth and development of cashmere. Existing research on cashmere has predominantly emphasized a single omics level. Integrating multi-omics analyses can offer a more comprehensive understanding by encompassing the entire spectrum. This study more accurately and comprehensively identified the key factors influencing cashmere fineness using multi-omics analysis.Methods:This study used skin tissues of coarse cashmere type (CT_LCG) and fine cashmere type Liaoning cashmere goats (FT_LCG) for the analysis. This study employed an integrated approach involving transcriptomics, translatomics, proteomics, and metabolomics to identify substances associated with cashmere fineness. The findings were validated using parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) and multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) techniques.Results:The GO functional enrichment analysis identified three common terms: multicellular organismal process, immune system process, and extracellular region. Furthermore, the KEGG enrichment analysis uncovered the involvement of the arachidonic acid metabolic pathway. Protein expression trends were verified using PRM technology. The expression trends of KRT79, as confirmed by PRM, were consistent with those observed in TMT proteomics and exhibited a positive regulatory effect on cashmere fineness. Metabolite expression trends were confirmed using MRM technology. The expression trends of 9 out of 15 validated metabolites were in agreement with those identified in the non-targeted metabolomics analysis.Conclusions:This study employed multi-omics analysis to identify key regulators of cashmere fineness, including PLA2G12A, KRT79, and prostaglandin B2. The findings of this study offer valuable data and establish a theoretical foundation for conducting comprehensive investigations into the molecular regulatory mechanisms and functional aspects of cashmere fineness.",38017403,PMC10685610,10.1186/s12864-023-09825-0,0,BMC genomics,100965258,4.547
IPOP: An Integrative Plant Multi-omics Platform for Cross-species Comparison and Evolutionary Study,"The advent of high-throughput sequencing technologies has led to the production of a significant amount of omics data in plants, which serves as valuable assets for conducting cross-species multi-omics comparative analysis. Nevertheless, the current dearth of comprehensive platforms providing evolutionary annotation information and multi-species multi-omics data impedes users from systematically and efficiently performing evolutionary and functional analysis on specific genes. In order to establish an advanced plant multi-omics platform that provides timely, accurate, and high-caliber omics information, we collected 7 distinct types of omics data from 6 monocots, 6 dicots, and 1 moss, and reanalyzed these data using standardized pipelines. Additionally, we furnished homology information, duplication events, and phylostratigraphic stages of 13 species to facilitate evolutionary examination. Furthermore, the integrative plant omics platform (IPOP) is bundled with a variety of online analysis tools that aid users in conducting evolutionary and functional analysis. Specifically, the Multi-omics Integration Analysis tool is available to consolidate information from diverse omics sources, while the Transcriptome-wide Association Analysis tool facilitates the linkage of functional analysis with phenotype. To illustrate the application of IPOP, we conducted a case study on the YTH domain gene family, wherein we observed shared functionalities within orthologous groups and discerned variations in evolutionary patterns across these groups. To summarize, the IPOP platform offers valuable evolutionary insights and multi-omics data to the plant sciences community, effectively addressing the need for cross-species comparison and evolutionary research platforms. All data and modules within IPOP are freely accessible for academic purposes (http://omicstudio.cloud:4012/ipod/).",37995323,PMC10715199,10.1093/molbev/msad248,0,Molecular biology and evolution,8501455,8.8
Prioritization of risk genes in colorectal cancer by integrative analysis of multi-omics data and gene networks,"Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified over 140 colorectal cancer (CRC)-associated loci; however, target genes at the majority of loci and underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we utilized a Bayesian approach, integrative risk gene selector (iRIGS), to prioritize risk genes at CRC GWAS loci by integrating multi-omics data. As a result, a total of 105 high-confidence risk genes (HRGs) were identified, which exhibited strong gene dependencies for CRC and enrichment in the biological processes implicated in CRC. Among the 105 HRGs, CEBPB, located at the 20q13.13 locus, acted as a transcription factor playing critical roles in cancer. Our subsequent assays indicated the tumor promoter function of CEBPB that facilitated CRC cell proliferation by regulating multiple oncogenic pathways such as MAPK, PI3K-Akt, and Ras signaling. Next, by integrating a fine-mapping analysis and three independent case-control studies in Chinese populations consisting of 8,039 cases and 12,775 controls, we elucidated that rs1810503, a putative functional variant regulating CEBPB, was associated with CRC risk (OR=0.90, 95%CI=0.86-0.93, P=1.07×10-7). The association between rs1810503 and CRC risk was further validated in three additional multi-ancestry populations consisting of 24,254 cases and 58,741 controls. Mechanistically, the rs1810503 A to T allele change weakened the enhancer activity in an allele-specific manner to decrease CEBPB expression via long-range promoter-enhancer interactions, mediated by the transcription factor, REST, and thus decreased CRC risk. In summary, our study provides a genetic resource and a generalizable strategy for CRC etiology investigation, and highlights the biological implications of CEBPB in CRC tumorigenesis, shedding new light on the etiology of CRC.",37747674,,10.1007/s11427-023-2439-7,2,Science China.

Multi-omics study for interpretation of genome-wide association study,"Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified thousands of genetic loci associated with complex traits, including a wide variety of diseases. Despite the successful identification of associated loci, interpreting GWAS findings remains challenging and requires other biological resources. Omics, including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and epigenomics, are increasingly used in a broad range of research fields. Integrative analyses applying GWAS with these omics data are expected to expand our knowledge of complex traits and provide insight into the pathogenesis of complex diseases and their causative factors. Recently, associations between genetic variants and omics data have been comprehensively evaluated, providing new information on the influence of genetic variants on omics. Furthermore, recent advances in analytic methods, including single-cell technologies, have revealed previously unknown disease mechanisms. To advance our understanding of complex traits, integrative analysis using GWAS with multi-omics data is needed. In this review, I describe successful examples of integrative analyses based on omics and GWAS, discuss the limitations of current multi-omics analyses, and provide a perspective on future integrative studies.",32948838,,10.1038/s10038-020-00842-5,18,Journal of human genetics,9808008,3.755
HCNM: Heterogeneous Correlation Network Model for Multi-level Integrative Study of Multi-omics Data for Cancer Subtype Prediction,"Integrative analysis of multi-omics data is important for biomedical applications, as it is required for a comprehensive understanding of biological function. Integrating multi-omics data serves multiple purposes, such as, an integrated data model, dimensionality reduction of omic features, patient clustering, etc. For oncological data, patient clustering is synonymous to cancer subtype prediction. However, there is a gap in combining some of the widely used integrative analyses to build more powerful tools. To bridge the gap, we propose a multi-level integration algorithm to identify representative integrative subspace and use it for cancer subtype prediction. The three integrative approaches we implement on multi-omics features are, (1) multivariate multiple (linear) regression of the features from a cohort of patients/samples, (2) network construction using different omics features, and (3) fusion of sample similarity networks across the features. We use a type of multilayer network, called heterogeneous network, as a data model to transition between a network-free (NF) regression model and a network-based (NB) model, which uses correlation networks. The heterogeneous networks consist of intra- and inter-layer graphs. Our proposed heterogeneous correlation network model, HCNM, is central to our algorithm for gene-ranking, integrative subspace identification, and tumor-specific subtypes prediction. The genes of our representative integrative subspace have been enriched with gene-ontology and found to exhibit significant gene-disease association (GDA) scores. The subspace in genes which is less than 5% of the total gene-set of each genomic feature is used with NB fusion integrative model to predict sample subtypes. As the identified integrative subspace data of multi-omics is less prone to noise, bias, and outliers, our experiments show that the subtypes in our results agree with previous benchmark studies and exhibit better classification between poor and good survival of patient cohorts.Clinical relevance: Finding significant cancer-specific genes and subtypes of cancer is vital for early prognosis, and personalized treatment; therefore, improves survival probability of a patient.",34891654,,10.1109/EMBC46164.2021.9630781,2,Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology,101763872,0.0
Manifold alignment for heterogeneous single-cell multi-omics data integration using Pamona,"Motivation:Single-cell multi-omics sequencing data can provide a comprehensive molecular view of cells. However, effective approaches for the integrative analysis of such data are challenging. Existing manifold alignment methods demonstrated the state-of-the-art performance on single-cell multi-omics data integration, but they are often limited by requiring that single-cell datasets be derived from the same underlying cellular structure.Results:In this study, we present Pamona, a partial Gromov-Wasserstein distance-based manifold alignment framework that integrates heterogeneous single-cell multi-omics datasets with the aim of delineating and representing the shared and dataset-specific cellular structures across modalities. We formulate this task as a partial manifold alignment problem and develop a partial Gromov-Wasserstein optimal transport framework to solve it. Pamona identifies both shared and dataset-specific cells based on the computed probabilistic couplings of cells across datasets, and it aligns cellular modalities in a common low-dimensional space, while simultaneously preserving both shared and dataset-specific structures. Our framework can easily incorporate prior information, such as cell type annotations or cell-cell correspondence, to further improve alignment quality. We evaluated Pamona on a comprehensive set of publicly available benchmark datasets. We demonstrated that Pamona can accurately identify shared and dataset-specific cells, as well as faithfully recover and align cellular structures of heterogeneous single-cell modalities in a common space, outperforming the comparable existing methods.Availabilityand implementation:Pamona software is available at https://github.com/caokai1073/Pamona.Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",34398192,PMC8696097,10.1093/bioinformatics/btab594,29,"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",9808944,6.931
A general framework for integrative analysis of incomplete multiomics data,"There is a tremendous current interest in measuring multiple types of omics features (e.g., DNA sequences, RNA expressions, methylation profiles, metabolic profiles, protein expressions) on a large number of subjects. Although genotypes are typically available for all study subjects, other data types may be measured only on a subset of subjects due to cost or other constraints. In addition, quantitative omics measurements, such as metabolite levels and protein expressions, are subject to detection limits in that the measurements below (or above) certain thresholds are not detectable. In this article, we propose a rigorous and powerful approach to handle missing values and detection limits in integrative analysis of multiomics data. We relate quantitative omics variables to genetic variants and other variables through linear regression models and relate phenotypes to quantitative omics variables and other variables through generalized linear models. We derive the joint-likelihood for the two sets of models by allowing arbitrary patterns of missing values and detection limits for quantitative omics variables. We carry out maximum-likelihood estimation through computationally fast and stable algorithms. The resulting estimators are approximately unbiased and statistically efficient. An application to a major study on chronic obstructive lung disease yielded new biological insights.",32691502,PMC7951090,10.1002/gepi.22328,4,Genetic epidemiology,8411723,2.344
Integrating multi-omics data by learning modality invariant representations for improved prediction of overall survival of cancer,"Breast and ovarian cancers are the second and the fifth leading causes of cancer death among women. Predicting the overall survival of breast and ovarian cancer patients can facilitate the therapeutics evaluation and treatment decision making. Multi-scale multi-omics data such as gene expression, DNA methylation, miRNA expression, and copy number variations can provide insights on personalized survival. However, how to effectively integrate multi-omics data remains a challenging task. In this paper, we develop multi-omics integration methods to improve the prediction of overall survival for breast cancer and ovarian cancer patients. Because multi-omics data for the same patient jointly impact the survival of cancer patients, features from different -omics modality are related and can be modeled by either association or causal relationship (e.g., pathways). By extracting these relationships among modalities, we can get rid of the irrelevant information from high-throughput multi-omics data. However, it is infeasible to use the Brute Force method to capture all possible multi-omics interactions. Thus, we use deep neural networks with novel divergence-based consensus regularization to capture multi-omics interactions implicitly by extracting modality-invariant representations. In comparing the concatenation-based integration networks with our new divergence-based consensus networks, the breast cancer overall survival C-index is improved from 0.655±0.062 to 0.671±0.046 when combing DNA methylation and miRNA expression, and from 0.627±0.062 to 0.667±0.073 when combing miRNA expression and copy number variations. In summary, our novel deep consensus neural network has successfully improved the prediction of overall survival for breast cancer and ovarian cancer patients by implicitly learning the multi-omics interactions.",32763377,,10.1016/j.ymeth.2020.07.008,11,"Methods (San Diego, Calif.)",9426302,4.647
Classifying breast cancer subtypes on multi-omics data via sparse canonical correlation analysis and deep learning,"Background:Classifying breast cancer subtypes is crucial for clinical diagnosis and treatment. However, the early symptoms of breast cancer may not be apparent. Rapid advances in high-throughput sequencing technology have led to generating large number of multi-omics biological data. Leveraging and integrating the available multi-omics data can effectively enhance the accuracy of identifying breast cancer subtypes. However, few efforts focus on identifying the associations of different omics data to predict the breast cancer subtypes.Results:In this paper, we propose a differential sparse canonical correlation analysis network (DSCCN) for classifying the breast cancer subtypes. DSCCN performs differential analysis on multi-omics expression data to identify differentially expressed (DE) genes and adopts sparse canonical correlation analysis (SCCA) to mine highly correlated features between multi-omics DE-genes. Meanwhile, DSCCN uses multi-task deep learning neural network separately to train the correlated DE-genes to predict breast cancer subtypes, which spontaneously tackle the data heterogeneity problem in integrating multi-omics data.Conclusions:The experimental results show that by mining the associations among multi-omics data, DSCCN is more capable of accurately classifying breast cancer subtypes than the existing methods.",38539064,PMC10967155,10.1186/s12859-024-05749-y,0,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,3.307
"The diagnosis of inborn errors of metabolism by an integrative ""multi-omics"" approach: A perspective encompassing genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics","Given the rapidly decreasing cost and increasing speed and accessibility of massively parallel technologies, the integration of comprehensive genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data into a ""multi-omics"" diagnostic pipeline is within reach. Even though genomic analysis has the capability to reveal all possible perturbations in our genetic code, analysis typically reaches a diagnosis in just 35% of cases, with a diagnostic gap arising due to limitations in prioritization and interpretation of detected variants. Here we review the utility of complementing genetic data with transcriptomic data and give a perspective for the introduction of proteomics into the diagnostic pipeline. Together these methodologies enable comprehensive capture of the functional consequence of variants, unobtainable by the analysis of each methodology in isolation. This facilitates functional annotation and reprioritization of candidate genes and variants-a promising approach to shed light on the underlying molecular cause of a patient's disease, increasing diagnostic rate, and allowing actionability in clinical practice.",31119744,,10.1002/jimd.12130,24,Journal of inherited metabolic disease,7910918,4.75
A novel multi-omics data analysis of dose-dependent and temporal changes in regulatory pathways due to chemical perturbation: a case study on caffeine,"Comprehensive analysis of multi-omics data can reveal alterations in regulatory pathways induced by cellular exposure to chemicals by characterizing biological processes at the molecular level.

This study introduces a novel multi-omics data analysis designed to concurrently examine dose-dependent and temporal patterns of cellular responses to chemical perturbations. This analysis, encompassing preliminary exploration, pattern deconstruction, and network reconstruction of multi-omics data, provides a comprehensive perspective on the dynamic behaviors of cells exposed to varying levels of chemical stimuli. Importantly, this analysis is adaptable to any number of omics layers, including site-specific phosphoproteomics. We implemented this analysis on multi-omics data obtained from HepG2 cells exposed to a range of caffeine doses over varying durations and identified six response patterns, along with their associated biomolecules and pathways.

Multi-OMICS: a critical technical perspective on integrative lipidomics approaches,"During the past decades, high-throughput approaches for analyzing different molecular classes such as nucleic acids, proteins, metabolites, and lipids have grown rapidly. These approaches became powerful tools for getting a fundamental understanding of biological systems. Considering each approach and its results separately, relations and causal connections between these classes have no chance to be revealed, since only separate molecular snapshots are provided. Only a combined approach, not fully established yet, with the integration of the corresponding data, might yield a comprehensive and complete understanding of biological processes, such as crosstalk and interactions in signaling pathways. Taking two or more omics-methods into consideration for analysis is referred to as a multi-omics approach, which is gradually evolving. In this critical note, we briefly discuss the relevance, challenges, current state, and potential of data integration from multi-omics approaches, with a special focus on lipidomics analysis, listing the advantages and gaps in this field.

Integrative Placental Multi-Omics Analysis Reveals Perturbed Pathways and Potential Prognostic Biomarkers in Gestational Hypertension,"Background:Gestational hypertension (GH) is a severe complication that occurs after 20 weeks of pregnancy; however, its molecular mechanisms are not yet fully understood.Objective:Through this case-control discovery phase study, we aimed to find disease-specific candidate placental microRNAs (miRNAs) and metabolite markers for differentiating GH by integrating next-generation sequencing and metabolomics multi-omics analysis of placenta. Using small RNA sequencing and metabolomics of placental tissues of healthy pregnant (HP, n = 24) and GH subjects (n = 20), the transcriptome and metabolome were characterized in both groups.Results:The study identified a total of 44 downregulated placental miRNAs which includes three novel, three mature and 38 precursor miRNAs. Six miRNAs including three mature (hsa-miR-181a-5p, hsa-miR-498-5p, and hsa-miR-26b-5p) and three novel (NC_000016.10_1061, NC_000005.10_475, and NC_000001.11_53) were considered for final target prediction and functional annotation. Integrative analysis of differentially expressed miRNAs and metabolites yielded five pathways such as purine, glutathione, glycerophospholipid, inositol phosphate and β-alanine to be significantly perturbed in GH. We present fourteen genes (LPCAT1, LPCAT2, DGKH, PISD, GPAT2, PTEN, SACM1L, PGM2, AMPD3, AK7, AK3, CNDP1, IDH2, and ODC1) and eight metabolites (xanthosine, xanthine, spermine, glycine, CDP-Choline, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, β-alanine, and histidine) with potential to distinguish GH and HP.Conclusion:The differential expression of miRNAs, their target genes, altered metabolites and metabolic pathways in GH patients were identified for the first time in our study. Further, the altered miRNAs and metabolites were integrated to build their inter-connectivity network.

Holomics - a user-friendly R shiny application for multi-omics data integration and analysis,"An organism's observable traits, or phenotype, result from intricate interactions among genes, proteins, metabolites and the environment. External factors, such as associated microorganisms, along with biotic and abiotic stressors, can significantly impact this complex biological system, influencing processes like growth, development and productivity. A comprehensive analysis of the entire biological system and its interactions is thus crucial to identify key components that support adaptation to stressors and to discover biomarkers applicable in breeding programs or disease diagnostics. Since the genomics era, several other 'omics' disciplines have emerged, and recent advances in high-throughput technologies have facilitated the generation of additional omics datasets. While traditionally analyzed individually, the last decade has seen an increase in multi-omics data integration and analysis strategies aimed at achieving a holistic understanding of interactions across different biological layers. Despite these advances, the analysis of multi-omics data is still challenging due to their scale, complexity, high dimensionality and multimodality. To address these challenges, a number of analytical tools and strategies have been developed, including clustering and differential equations, which require advanced knowledge in bioinformatics and statistics. Therefore, this study recognizes the need for user-friendly tools by introducing Holomics, an accessible and easy-to-use R shiny application with multi-omics functions tailored for scientists with limited bioinformatics knowledge. Holomics provides a well-defined workflow, starting with the upload and pre-filtering of single-omics data, which are then further refined by single-omics analysis focusing on key features. Subsequently, these reduced datasets are subjected to multi-omics analyses to unveil correlations between 2-n datasets. This paper concludes with a real-world case study where microbiomics, transcriptomics and metabolomics data from previous studies that elucidate factors associated with improved sugar beet storability are integrated using Holomics. The results are discussed in the context of the biological background, underscoring the importance of multi-omics insights. This example not only highlights the versatility of Holomics in handling different types of omics data, but also validates its consistency by reproducing findings from preceding single-omics studies.",38438871,PMC10913680,10.1186/s12859-024-05719-4,0,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,3.307
Multi-omics data fusion using adaptive GTO guided Non-negative matrix factorization for cancer subtype discovery,"Background and objective:Cancer subtype discovery is essential for personalized clinical treatment. With the onset of progressive profile techniques for cancer, a large amount of heterogeneous and high-dimensional transcriptomic, proteomic and genomic datasets are easily accumulated. Integrative clustering of such multi-omics data is crucial to recognize their latent structure and to acknowledge the correlation within and across them. Although the integrative analysis of diversified multi-omics data is informative, it is challenging when multiplicity in data inflicts poor accordance w.r.t. clustering structure. The objective of this work is to develop an effective integrative analysis framework that encapsulates the heterogeneity of various biological mechanisms and predicts homogeneous subgroups of cancer patients.Method:In this paper, improved sparse-joint non-negative matrix factorization (sparse-jNMF) has been devised for the problem of cancer-subtype discovery. The initial points of sparse-jNMF have improved using a novel meta-heuristic algorithm adaptive gorilla troops optimizer (Ada-GTO). Improving the initialization of sparse-jNMF enhances its convergence behavior and further strengthens the clustering performance. In addition, the consensus clustering approach has been adopted to construct a patient-patient similarity matrix for obtaining stable clusters of patient samples.Result:The proposed framework has been applied to 4 different real-life multi-omics cancer datasets, namely colon adenocarcinoma, breast-invasive carcinoma, kidney-renal clear-cell carcinoma, and lung adenocarcinoma. The proposed method results in patient clusters with better silhouette scores and cluster purity than classical initialization and similar meta-heuristics for initial point estimation approaches. Survival probabilities estimated using Kaplan-Meier (KM) curve show statistically significant difference (p < 0.05) for the homogenous cancer patient clusters obtained using the proposed method as compared to iCluster. The presented approach further identified the somatic mutations for the classified subgroups, which is beneficial to provide targeted treatments.Conclusion:This paper proposes Ada-GTO guided sparse-jNMF framework for cancer subtype discovery, considering the information from multiple omic features that provide comprehension. The proposed meta-guided framework outperforms all other state-of-the-art counterparts. It also has great potential for obtaining the homogeneous subgroups of other diseases.",36434961,,10.1016/j.cmpb.2022.107246,0,Computer methods and programs in biomedicine,8506513,7.027
Robust joint clustering of multi-omics single-cell data via multi-modal high-order neighborhood Laplacian matrix optimization,"Motivation:Simultaneous profiling of multi-omics single-cell data represents exciting technological advancements for understanding cellular states and heterogeneity. Cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing allowed for parallel quantification of cell-surface protein expression and transcriptome profiling in the same cells; methylome and transcriptome sequencing from single cells allows for analysis of transcriptomic and epigenomic profiling in the same individual cells. However, effective integration method for mining the heterogeneity of cells over the noisy, sparse, and complex multi-modal data is in growing need.Results:In this article, we propose a multi-modal high-order neighborhood Laplacian matrix optimization framework for integrating the multi-omics single-cell data: scHoML. Hierarchical clustering method was presented for analyzing the optimal embedding representation and identifying cell clusters in a robust manner. This novel method by integrating high-order and multi-modal Laplacian matrices would robustly represent the complex data structures and allow for systematic analysis at the multi-omics single-cell level, thus promoting further biological discoveries.Availability and implementation:Matlab code is available at https://github.com/jianghruc/scHoML.",37382572,PMC10329495,10.1093/bioinformatics/btad414,0,"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",9808944,6.931
Computational Approaches and Challenges in Spatial Transcriptomics,"The development of spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies has transformed genetic research from a single-cell data level to a two-dimensional spatial coordinate system and facilitated the study of the composition and function of various cell subsets in different environments and organs. The large-scale data generated by these ST technologies, which contain spatial gene expression information, have elicited the need for spatially resolved approaches to meet the requirements of computational and biological data interpretation. These requirements include dealing with the explosive growth of data to determine the cell-level and gene-level expression, correcting the inner batch effect and loss of expression to improve the data quality, conducting efficient interpretation and in-depth knowledge mining both at the single-cell and tissue-wide levels, and conducting multi-omics integration analysis to provide an extensible framework toward the in-depth understanding of biological processes. However, algorithms designed specifically for ST technologies to meet these requirements are still in their infancy. Here, we review computational approaches to these problems in light of corresponding issues and challenges, and present forward-looking insights into algorithm development.",36252814,PMC10372921,10.1016/j.gpb.2022.10.001,17,"Genomics, proteomics & bioinformatics",101197608,6.409
MarsGT: Multi-omics analysis for rare population inference using single-cell graph transformer,"Rare cell populations are key in neoplastic progression and therapeutic response, offering potential intervention targets. However, their computational identification and analysis often lag behind major cell types. To fill this gap, we introduce MarsGT: Multi-omics Analysis for Rare population inference using a Single-cell Graph Transformer. It identifies rare cell populations using a probability-based heterogeneous graph transformer on single-cell multi-omics data. MarsGT outperforms existing tools in identifying rare cells across 550 simulated and four real human datasets. In mouse retina data, it reveals unique subpopulations of rare bipolar cells and a Müller glia cell subpopulation. In human lymph node data, MarsGT detects an intermediate B cell population potentially acting as lymphoma precursors. In human melanoma data, it identifies a rare MAIT-like population impacted by a high IFN-I response and reveals the mechanism of immunotherapy. Hence, MarsGT offers biological insights and suggests potential strategies for early detection and therapeutic intervention of disease.",38184630,PMC10771517,10.1038/s41467-023-44570-8,0,Nature communications,101528555,17.694
A comprehensive overview of oncogenic pathways in human cancer,"Alterations of biological pathways can lead to oncogenesis. An overview of these oncogenic pathways would be highly valuable for researchers to reveal the pathogenic mechanism and develop novel therapeutic approaches for cancers. Here, we reviewed approximately 8500 literatures and documented experimentally validated cancer-pathway associations as benchmarking data set. This data resource includes 4709 manually curated relationships between 1557 paths and 49 cancers with 2427 upstream regulators in 7 species. Based on this resource, we first summarized the cancer-pathway associations and revealed some commonly deregulated pathways across tumor types. Then, we systematically analyzed these oncogenic pathways by integrating TCGA pan-cancer data sets. Multi-omics analysis showed oncogenic pathways may play different roles across tumor types under different omics contexts. We also charted the survival relevance landscape of oncogenic pathways in 26 tumor types, identified dominant omics features and found survival relevance for oncogenic pathways varied in tumor types and omics levels. Moreover, we predicted upstream regulators and constructed a hierarchical network model to understand the pathogenic mechanism of human cancers underlying oncogenic pathway context. Finally, we developed `CPAD' (freely available at http://bio-bigdata.hrbmu.edu.cn/CPAD/), an online resource for exploring oncogenic pathways in human cancers, that integrated manually curated cancer-pathway associations, TCGA pan-cancer multi-omics data sets, drug-target data, drug sensitivity and multi-omics data for cancer cell lines. In summary, our study provides a comprehensive characterization of oncogenic pathways and also presents a valuable resource for investigating the pathogenesis of human cancer.",31155677,,10.1093/bib/bbz046,20,Briefings in bioinformatics,100912837,13.994
Cancer Target Gene Screening: a web application for breast cancer target gene screening using multi-omics data analysis,"Breast cancer comprises several molecular subtypes with distinct clinical features and treatment responses, and a substantial portion of each subtype remains incurable. A comprehensive analysis of multi-omics data and clinical profiles is required in order to better understand the biological complexity of this cancer type and to identify new prognostic and therapeutic markers. Thus, there arises a need for useful analytical tools to assist in the investigation and clinical management of the disease. We developed Cancer Target Gene Screening (CTGS), a web application that provides rapid and user-friendly analysis of multi-omics data sets from a large number of primary breast tumors. It allows the investigation of genomic and epigenomic aberrations, evaluation of transcriptomic profiles and performance of survival analyses and of bivariate correlations between layers of omics data. Notably, the genome-wide screening function of CTGS prioritizes candidate genes of clinical and biological significance among genes with copy number alteration, DNA methylation and dysregulated expression by the integrative analysis of different types of omics data in customized subgroups of breast cancer patients. These features may help in the identification of druggable cancer driver genes in a specific subtype or the clinical condition of human breast cancer.

A Detailed Catalogue of Multi-Omics Methodologies for Identification of Putative Biomarkers and Causal Molecular Networks in Translational Cancer Research,"Recent advances in sequencing and biotechnological methodologies have led to the generation of large volumes of molecular data of different omics layers, such as genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics. Integration of these data with clinical information provides new opportunities to discover how perturbations in biological processes lead to disease. Using data-driven approaches for the integration and interpretation of multi-omics data could stably identify links between structural and functional information and propose causal molecular networks with potential impact on cancer pathophysiology. This knowledge can then be used to improve disease diagnosis, prognosis, prevention, and therapy. This review will summarize and categorize the most current computational methodologies and tools for integration of distinct molecular layers in the context of translational cancer research and personalized therapy. Additionally, the bioinformatics tools Multi-Omics Factor Analysis (MOFA) and netDX will be tested using omics data from public cancer resources, to assess their overall robustness, provide reproducible workflows for gaining biological knowledge from multi-omics data, and to comprehensively understand the significantly perturbed biological entities in distinct cancer types.

Flexible copula model for integrating correlated multi-omics data from single-cell experiments,"With recent advances in technologies to profile multi-omics data at the single-cell level, integrative multi-omics data analysis has been increasingly popular. It is increasingly common that information such as methylation changes, chromatin accessibility, and gene expression are jointly collected in a single-cell experiment. In biomedical studies, it is often of interest to study the associations between various data types and to examine how these associations might change according to other factors such as cell types and gene regulatory components. However, since each data type usually has a distinct marginal distribution, joint analysis of these changes of associations using multi-omics data is statistically challenging. In this paper, we propose a flexible copula-based framework to model covariate-dependent correlation structures independent of their marginals. In addition, the proposed approach could jointly combine a wide variety of univariate marginal distributions, either discrete or continuous, including the class of zero-inflated distributions. The performance of the proposed framework is demonstrated through a series of simulation studies. Finally, it is applied to a set of experimental data to investigate the dynamic relationship between single-cell RNA sequencing, chromatin accessibility, and DNA methylation at different germ layers during mouse gastrulation.",35622236,PMC9701244,10.1111/biom.13701,0,Biometrics,370625,1.701
Integrated multi-omics analysis reveals the molecular interplay between circadian clocks and cancer pathogenesis,"Circadian rhythms (CRs) are fundamental biological processes that significantly impact human well-being. Disruption of these rhythms can trigger insufficient neurocognitive development, insomnia, mental disorders, cardiovascular diseases, metabolic dysfunctions, and cancer. The field of chronobiology has increased our understanding of how rhythm disturbances contribute to cancer pathogenesis, and how circadian timing influences the efficacy of cancer treatments. As the circadian clock steadily gains recognition as an emerging factor in tumorigenesis, a thorough and comprehensive multi-omics analysis of CR genes/proteins has never been performed. To shed light on this, we performed, for the first time, an integrated data analysis encompassing genomic/transcriptomic alterations across 32 cancer types (n = 10,918 tumors) taken from the PanCancer Atlas, unfavorable prognostic protein analysis, protein-protein interactomics, and shortest distance score pathways to cancer hallmark phenotypes. This data mining strategy allowed us to unravel 31 essential CR-related proteins involved in the signaling crossroad between circadian rhythms and cancer. In the context of drugging the clock, we identified pharmacogenomic clinical annotations and drugs currently in late phase clinical trials that could be considered as potential cancer therapeutic strategies. These findings highlight the diverse roles of CR-related genes/proteins in the realm of cancer research and therapy.",37648722,PMC10469199,10.1038/s41598-023-39401-1,4,Scientific reports,101563288,4.996
Sparse overlapping group lasso for integrative multi-omics analysis,"Gene networks and graphs are crucial tools for understanding a heterogeneous system of cancer, since cancer is a disease that does not involve individual genes but combinations of genes associated with oncogenic process. A goal of genomic data analysis via gene networks is to identify both gene networks and individual genes within the selected networks. Existing methods, however, perform only network selection, and thus all genes in selected networks are included in models. This leads to overfitting when uncovering driver genes, and the results are not biologically interpretable. To accomplish both ""groupwise sparsity"" and ""within group sparsity"" for identifying driver genes based on biological knowledge (i.e., predefined overlapping groups of features), we propose a sparse overlapping group lasso via duplicated predictors in extended space. The proposed method effectively identifies driver genes and their interactions using known biological pathway information. Monte Carlo simulations and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project data analysis indicate that the proposed method is effective for fitting a regression model (i.e., feature selection and prediction accuracy) constructed with duplicated predictors in overlapping groups. In the TCGA data analysis, we uncover potential cancer driver genes via expression modules and gene networks constructed by multi-omics data and identify that the uncovered genes have strong evidences as a cancer driver gene. The proposed method is a useful tool for identifying cancer driver genes and for integrative multi-omics analysis.",25629319,,10.1089/cmb.2014.0197,5,Journal of computational biology : a journal of computational molecular cell,9433358,1.549
Rapid Multi-Omics Sample Preparation for Mass Spectrometry,"Multi-omics analysis is a powerful and increasingly utilized approach to gain insight into complex biological systems. One major hindrance with multi-omics, however, is the lengthy and wasteful sample preparation process. Preparing samples for mass spectrometry (MS)-based multi-omics involves extraction of metabolites and lipids with organic solvents, precipitation of proteins, and overnight digestion of proteins. These existing workflows are disparate and laborious. Here, we present a simple, efficient, and unified approach to prepare lipids, metabolites, and proteins for MS analysis. Our approach, termed the Bead-enabled Accelerated Monophasic Multi-omics (BAMM) method, combines ann-butanol-based monophasic extraction with unmodified magnetic beads and accelerated protein digestion. We demonstrate that the BAMM method affords comparable depth, quantitative reproducibility, and recovery of biomolecules as state-of-the-art multi-omics methods (e.g., Matyash extraction and overnight protein digestion). However, the BAMM method only requires about 3 h to perform, which saves 11 steps and 19 h on average compared to published multi-omics methods. Furthermore, we validate the BAMM method for multiple sample types and formats (biofluid, culture plate, and pellet) and show that in all cases, it produces high biomolecular coverage and data quality.",36594155,PMC10026941,10.1021/acs.analchem.2c02042,9,Analytical chemistry,370536,8.008

UNMF: a unified nonnegative matrix factorization for multi-dimensional omics data,"Factor analysis, ranging from principal component analysis to nonnegative matrix factorization, represents a foremost approach in analyzing multi-dimensional data to extract valuable patterns, and is increasingly being applied in the context of multi-dimensional omics datasets represented in tensor form. However, traditional analytical methods are heavily dependent on the format and structure of the data itself, and if these change even slightly, the analyst must change their data analysis strategy and techniques and spend a considerable amount of time on data preprocessing. Additionally, many traditional methods cannot be applied as-is in the presence of missing values in the data. We present a new statistical framework, unified nonnegative matrix factorization (UNMF), for finding informative patterns in messy biological data sets. UNMF is designed for tidy data format and structure, making data analysis easier and simplifying the development of data analysis tools. UNMF can handle a wide range of data structures and formats, and works seamlessly with tensor data including missing observations and repeated measurements. The usefulness of UNMF is demonstrated through its application to several multi-dimensional omics data, offering user-friendly and unified features for analysis and integration. Its application holds great potential for the life science community. UNMF is implemented with R and is available from GitHub (https://github.com/abikoushi/moltenNMF).",37478378,PMC10516365,10.1093/bib/bbad253,0,Briefings in bioinformatics,100912837,13.994
Using knowledge-driven genomic interactions for multi-omics data analysis: metadimensional models for predicting clinical outcomes in ovarian carcinoma,"It is common that cancer patients have different molecular signatures even though they have similar clinical features, such as histology, due to the heterogeneity of tumors. To overcome this variability, we previously developed a new approach incorporating prior biological knowledge that identifies knowledge-driven genomic interactions associated with outcomes of interest. However, no systematic approach has been proposed to identify interaction models between pathways based on multi-omics data. Here we have proposed such a novel methodological framework, called metadimensional knowledge-driven genomic interactions (MKGIs). To test the utility of the proposed framework, we applied it to an ovarian cancer dataset including multi-omics profiles from The Cancer Genome Atlas to predict grade, stage, and survival outcome. We found that each knowledge-driven genomic interaction model, based on different genomic datasets, contains different sets of pathway features, which suggests that each genomic data type may contribute to outcomes in ovarian cancer via a different pathway. In addition, MKGI models significantly outperformed the single knowledge-driven genomic interaction model. From the MKGI models, many interactions between pathways associated with outcomes were found, including the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway and the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) signaling pathway, which are known to play important roles in cancer pathogenesis. The beauty of incorporating biological knowledge into the model based on multi-omics data is the ability to improve diagnosis and prognosis and provide better interpretability. Thus, determining variability in molecular signatures based on these interactions between pathways may lead to better diagnostic/treatment strategies for better precision medicine.",28040685,PMC5391734,10.1093/jamia/ocw165,16,Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,9430800,7.942

However, the datasets generated from these technologies tend to have high level of noise and are highly sparse, bringing challenges to data analysis. In this paper, we develop a novel information-theoretic co-clustering-based multi-view learning (scICML) method for multi-omics single-cell data integration. scICML utilizes co-clusterings to aggregate similar features for each view of data and uncover the common clustering pattern for cells. In addition, scICML automatically matches the clusters of the linked features across different data types for considering the biological dependency structure across different types of genomic features. Our experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that scICML improves the overall clustering performance and provides biological insights into the data analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells.",37590102,,10.1109/TCBB.2023.3305989,0,IEEE/ACM transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics,101196755,3.702
GERDH: an interactive multi-omics database for cross-species data mining in horticultural crops,"Horticultural plants contribute immensely to the quality of human's life. The rapid development of omics studies on horticultural plants has resulted in large volumes of valuable growth- and development-related data. Genes that are essential for growth and development are highly conserved in evolution. Cross-species data mining reduces the impact of species heterogeneity and has been extensively used for conserved gene identification. Owing to the lack of a comprehensive database for cross-species data mining using multi-omics data from all horticultural plant species, the current resources in this field are far from satisfactory. Here, we introduce GERDH (https://dphdatabase.com), a database platform for cross-species data mining among horticultural plants, based on 12 961 uniformly processed publicly available omics libraries from more than 150 horticultural plant accessions, including fruits, vegetables and ornamental plants. Important and conserved genes that are essential for a specific biological process can be obtained by cross-species analysis module with interactive web-based data analysis and visualization. Moreover, GERDH is equipped with seven online analysis tools, including gene expression, in-species analysis, epigenetic regulation, gene co-expression, enrichment/pathway and phylogenetic analysis. By interactive cross-species analysis, we identified key genes contributing to postharvest storage. By gene expression analysis, we explored new functions of CmEIN3 in flower development, which was validated by transgenic chrysanthemum analysis. We believe that GERDH will be a useful resource for key gene identification and will allow for omics big data to be more available and accessible to horticultural plant community members.",37310261,,10.1111/tpj.16350,2,The Plant journal : for cell and molecular biology,9207397,7.091
Multi-omics integration method based on attention deep learning network for biomedical data classification,"Background and objective:Integrating multi-omics data for the comprehensive analysis of the biological processes in human diseases has become one of the most challenging tasks of bioinformatics. Deep learning (DL) algorithms have recently become one of the most promising multi-omics data integration analysis methods. However, existing DL-based studies almost integrate the multi-omics data by concatenation in the input data space or the learned feature space, ignoring the correlations between patients and omics.Methods:We propose a novel multi-omics integration method, called Multi-omics Attention Deep Learning Network (MOADLN), which is used for biomedical data classification. Firstly, for each type of omics data, we use three fully-connected layers and the self-attention mechanism to reduce dimensionality, and construct the correlations between patients, respectively. Then, we apply the feature vector learned from self-attention to generate the initial category labels. Secondly, for the initial label predicted of each omics data, we use an effective Multi-Omics Correlation Discovery Network (MOCDN) to learn the cross-omic correlations in the label space. Finally, we use the softmax classifier for label prediction.Results:We demonstrate that our method outperforms several state-of-the-art methods on two datasets with mRNA expression data, DNA methylation data, and miRNA expression data. In addition, we identified essential biomarkers of relevant diseases by MOADLN, and the generality of MOADLN is also demonstrated in the KIRP and KIRC datasets.Conclusions:MOADLN jointly explores correlations between patients in intra-omics and correlations of cross-omics in label space, which is an effective DL-based classification of biomedical data.",36739624,,10.1016/j.cmpb.2023.107377,5,Computer methods and programs in biomedicine,8506513,7.027
MDSi: Multi-omics Database for Setaria italica,"Background:Foxtail millet (Setaria italica) harbors the small diploid genome (~ 450 Mb) and shows the high inbreeding rate and close relationship to several major foods, feed, fuel and bioenergy grasses. Previously, we created a mini foxtail millet, xiaomi, with an Arabidopsis-like life cycle. The de novo assembled genome data with high-quality and an efficient Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation system made xiaomi an ideal C4model system. The mini foxtail millet has been widely shared in the research community and as a result there is a growing need for a user-friendly portal and intuitive interface to perform exploratory analysis of the data.Results:Here, we built a Multi-omics Database for Setaria italica (MDSi, http://sky.sxau.edu.cn/MDSi.htm ), that contains xiaomi genome of 161,844 annotations, 34,436 protein-coding genes and their expression information in 29 different tissues of xiaomi (6) and JG21 (23) samples that can be showed as an Electronic Fluorescent Pictograph (xEFP) in-situ.

Uncovering the gene regulatory network of type 2 diabetes through multi-omic data integration,"Background:Type 2 diabetes (T2D) onset is a complex, organized biological process with multilevel regulation, and its physiopathological mechanisms are yet to be elucidated. This study aims to find out the key drivers and pathways involved in the pathogenesis of T2D through multi-omics analysis.Methods:The datasets used in the experiments comprise three groups: (1) genomic (2) transcriptomic, and (3) epigenomic categories. Then, a series of bioinformatics technologies including Marker set enrichment analysis (MSEA), weighted key driver analysis (wKDA) was performed to identify key drivers. The hub genes were further verified by the Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) Curve analysis, proteomic analysis, and Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The multi-omics network was applied to the Pharmomics pipeline in Mergeomics to identify drug candidates for T2D treatment. Then, we used the drug-gene interaction network to conduct network pharmacological analysis. Besides, molecular docking was performed using AutoDock/Vina, a computational docking program.Results:Module-gene interaction network was constructed using MSEA, which revealed a significant enrichment of immune-related activities and glucose metabolism. Top 10 key drivers (PSMB9, COL1A1, COL4A1, HLA-DQB1, COL3A1, IRF7, COL5A1, CD74, HLA-DQA1, and HLA-DRB1) were selected by wKDA analysis. Among these, COL5A1, IRF7, CD74, and HLA-DRB1 were verified to have the capability to diagnose T2D, and expression levels of PSMB9 and CD74 had significantly higher in T2D patients. We further predict the co-expression network and transcription factor (TF) binding specificity of the key driver. Besides, based on module interaction networks and key driver networks, 17 compounds are considered to possess T2D-control potential, such as sunitinib.Conclusions:We identified signature genes, biomolecular processes, and pathways using multi-omics networks.

"Multiomics Analysis Reveals Novel Genetic Determinants for Lens Differentiation, Structure, and Transparency","Recent advances in next-generation sequencing and data analysis have provided new gateways for identification of novel genome-wide genetic determinants governing tissue development and disease. These advances have revolutionized our understanding of cellular differentiation, homeostasis, and specialized function in multiple tissues. Bioinformatic and functional analysis of these genetic determinants and the pathways they regulate have provided a novel basis for the design of functional experiments to answer a wide range of long-sought biological questions. A well-characterized model for the application of these emerging technologies is the development and differentiation of the ocular lens and how individual pathways regulate lens morphogenesis, gene expression, transparency, and refraction. Recent applications of next-generation sequencing analysis on well-characterized chicken and mouse lens differentiation models using a variety of omics techniques including RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS), chip-seq, and CUT&RUN have revealed a wide range of essential biological pathways and chromatin features governing lens structure and function. Multiomics integration of these data has established new gene functions and cellular processes essential for lens formation, homeostasis, and transparency including the identification of novel transcription control pathways, autophagy remodeling pathways, and signal transduction pathways, among others.

Benchmarking multi-omics integration algorithms across single-cell RNA and ATAC data,"Recent advancements in single-cell sequencing technologies have generated extensive omics data in various modalities and revolutionized cell research, especially in the single-cell RNA and ATAC data. The joint analysis across scRNA-seq data and scATAC-seq data has paved the way to comprehending the cellular heterogeneity and complex cellular regulatory networks. Multi-omics integration is gaining attention as an important step in joint analysis, and the number of computational tools in this field is growing rapidly. In this paper, we benchmarked 12 multi-omics integration methods on three integration tasks via qualitative visualization and quantitative metrics, considering six main aspects that matter in multi-omics data analysis. Overall, we found that different methods have their own advantages on different aspects, while some methods outperformed other methods in most aspects.

[Identification of disease targets for precision medicine by integrative analysis of multi-omics data],"With the development and improvement of high-throughput sequencing technologies, the acquisition and processing approaches of various biological omics data on different levels are becoming more mature. Despite several new disease-associated factors have been discovered based on single omics data analysis, identification of disease targets by integrative analysis of multi-omics data is still growing. Since life is a complex regulatory system in which the regulation of gene mutations, epigenetic alterations, abnormal gene expression as well as anomalous variations in signal pathway are related with the occurrence and development of diseases, it is obvious that finding therapeutic factors using single omics data analysis has its limitation. Systematical studies of clinical and pathological mechanisms and identification of optimal therapeutic targets through integrative analysis of multi-omics data from different levels and resources have become an important research direction of precision medicine, which would provide innovative perspectives on disease study and new theoretical basis for early diagnosis, personalized treatment and medicine guide. In this review, we introduce new technologies and research progresses in screening therapeutic targets using systematic omics such as genomics, transcriptomics and epigenomics, and also discusse new strategies and advantages of integrative analysis among them.",26351165,,10.16288/j.yczz.15-061,0,Yi chuan = Hereditas,9436478,0.0
IMOVNN: incomplete multi-omics data integration variational neural networks for gut microbiome disease prediction and biomarker identification,"The gut microbiome has been regarded as one of the fundamental determinants regulating human health, and multi-omics data profiling has been increasingly utilized to bolster the deep understanding of this complex system. However, stemming from cost or other constraints, the integration of multi-omics often suffers from incomplete views, which poses a great challenge for the comprehensive analysis. In this work, a novel deep model named Incomplete Multi-Omics Variational Neural Networks (IMOVNN) is proposed for incomplete data integration, disease prediction application and biomarker identification. Benefiting from the information bottleneck and the marginal-to-joint distribution integration mechanism, the IMOVNN can learn the marginal latent representation of each individual omics and the joint latent representation for better disease prediction. Moreover, owing to the feature-selective layer predicated upon the concrete distribution, the model is interpretable and can identify the most relevant features. Experiments on inflammatory bowel disease multi-omics datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms several state-of-the-art methods for disease prediction. In addition, IMOVNN has identified significant biomarkers from multi-omics data sources.",37930027,,10.1093/bib/bbad394,0,Briefings in bioinformatics,100912837,13.994
Integrative Exploratory Analysis of Two or More Genomic Datasets,"Exploratory analysis is an essential step in the analysis of high throughput data. Multivariate approaches such as correspondence analysis (CA), principal component analysis, and multidimensional scaling are widely used in the exploratory analysis of single dataset. Modern biological studies often assay multiple types of biological molecules (e.g., mRNA, protein, phosphoproteins) on a same set of biological samples, thereby creating multiple different types of omics data or multiassay data. Integrative exploratory analysis of these multiple omics data is required to leverage the potential of multiple omics studies. In this chapter, we describe the application of co-inertia analysis (CIA; for analyzing two datasets) and multiple co-inertia analysis (MCIA; for three or more datasets) to address this problem. These methods are powerful yet simple multivariate approaches that represent samples using a lower number of variables, allowing a more easily identification of the correlated structure in and between multiple high dimensional datasets. Graphical representations can be employed to this purpose. In addition, the methods simultaneously project samples and variables (genes, proteins) onto the same lower dimensional space, so the most variant variables from each dataset can be selected and associated with samples, which can be further used to facilitate biological interpretation and pathway analysis. We applied CIA to explore the concordance between mRNA and protein expression in a panel of 60 tumor cell lines from the National Cancer Institute. In the same 60 cell lines, we used MCIA to perform a cross-platform comparison of mRNA gene expression profiles obtained on four different microarray platforms. Last, as an example of integrative analysis of multiassay or multi-omics data we analyzed transcriptomic, proteomic, and phosphoproteomic data from pluripotent (iPS) and embryonic stem (ES) cell lines.",27008008,,10.1007/978-1-4939-3578-9_2,3,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,0.0

Challenges in IBD Research: Precision Medicine,"Precision medicine is part of five focus areas of the Challenges in IBD research document, which also includes preclinical human IBD mechanisms, environmental triggers, novel technologies, and pragmatic clinical research. The Challenges in IBD Research document provides a comprehensive overview of current gaps in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) research and delivers actionable approaches to address them. It is the result of a multidisciplinary input from scientists, clinicians, patients, and funders, and represents a valuable resource for patient centric research prioritization. In particular, the precision medicine section is focused on highlighting the main gap areas that must be addressed to get closer to treatments tailored to the biological and clinical characteristics of each patient, which is the aim of precision medicine. The main gaps were identified in: 1) understanding and predicting the natural history of IBD: disease susceptibility, activity, and behavior; 2) predicting disease course and treatment response; and 3) optimizing current and developing new molecular technologies. Suggested approaches to bridge these gaps include prospective longitudinal cohort studies to identify and validate precision biomarkers for prognostication of disease course, and prediction and monitoring of treatment response. To achieve this, harmonization across studies is key as well as development of standardized methods and infrastructure. The implementation of state-of-the-art molecular technologies, systems biology and machine learning approaches for multi-omics and clinical data integration and analysis will be also fundamental. Finally, randomized biomarker-stratified trials will be critical to evaluate the clinical utility of validated signatures and biomarkers in improving patient outcomes and cost-effective care.",31095701,,10.1093/ibd/izz078,52,Inflammatory bowel diseases,9508162,7.29
Statistical and Machine-Learning Analyses in Nutritional Genomics Studies,"Nutritional compounds may have an influence on different OMICs levels, including genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and metagenomics. The integration of OMICs data is challenging but may provide new knowledge to explain the mechanisms involved in the metabolism of nutrients and diseases. Traditional statistical analyses play an important role in description and data association; however, these statistical procedures are not sufficiently enough powered to interpret the large integrated multiple OMICs (multi-OMICS) datasets. Machine learning (ML) approaches can play a major role in the interpretation of multi-OMICS in nutrition research. Specifically, ML can be used for data mining, sample clustering, and classification to produce predictive models and algorithms for integration of multi-OMICs in response to dietary intake. The objective of this review was to investigate the strategies used for the analysis of multi-OMICs data in nutrition studies. Sixteen recent studies aimed to understand the association between dietary intake and multi-OMICs data are summarized. Multivariate analysis in multi-OMICs nutrition studies is used more commonly for analyses. Overall, as nutrition research incorporated multi-OMICs data, the use of novel approaches of analysis such as ML needs to complement the traditional statistical analyses to fully explain the impact of nutrition on health and disease.",33066636,PMC7602401,10.3390/nu12103140,7,Nutrients,101521595,6.706
Single-cell multi-omics integration for unpaired data by a siamese network with graph-based contrastive loss,"Background:Single-cell omics technology is rapidly developing to measure the epigenome, genome, and transcriptome across a range of cell types. However, it is still challenging to integrate omics data from different modalities. Here, we propose a variation of the Siamese neural network framework called MinNet, which is trained to integrate multi-omics data on the single-cell resolution by using graph-based contrastive loss.Results:By training the model and testing it on several benchmark datasets, we showed its accuracy and generalizability in integrating scRNA-seq with scATAC-seq, and scRNA-seq with epitope data. Further evaluation demonstrated our model's unique ability to remove the batch effect, a common problem in actual practice. To show how the integration impacts downstream analysis, we established model-based smoothing and cis-regulatory element-inferring method and validated it with external pcHi-C evidence. Finally, we applied the framework to a COVID-19 dataset to bolster the original work with integration-based analysis, showing its necessity in single-cell multi-omics research.Conclusions:MinNet is a novel deep-learning framework for single-cell multi-omics sequencing data integration. It ranked top among other methods in benchmarking and is especially suitable for integrating datasets with batch and biological variances. With the single-cell resolution integration results, analysis of the interplay between genome and transcriptome can be done to help researchers understand their data and question.",36600199,PMC9812356,10.1186/s12859-022-05126-7,1,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,3.307
Advances in applying of multi-omics approaches in the research of systemic lupus erythematosus,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), an autoimmune disease that causes multiorgan injury, has an unclear etiology and complex pathogenesis. Numerous studies have found abnormal alterations in mRNAs, proteins and/or metabolites in SLE patients. These findings have extended our understanding of the pathogenesis of SLE. Novel omics techniques, such as transcriptome, proteome and metabolome profiling, can identify and quantify large numbers of biomarkers of human diseases. However, in most cases, biological reactions are the consequences of interactions among genes, proteomes, and metabolites. Single biomolecules or signaling pathways cannot fully explain biological traits or functions. Therefore, integrative multi-omics analysis can help us systematically comprehend the intrinsic molecular mechanisms underlying biological function and pathogenesis. Integrating transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome KEGG enrichment analysis data will expand our knowledge of the pathogenesis of SLE. This review discusses the application, research progress and outlook on integrative multi-omics analysis in SLE research.",32138562,,10.1080/08830185.2020.1736058,4,International reviews of immunology,8712260,5.078
Onco-Multi-OMICS Approach: A New Frontier in Cancer Research,"The acquisition of cancer hallmarks requires molecular alterations at multiple levels including genome, epigenome, transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome. In the past decade, numerous attempts have been made to untangle the molecular mechanisms of carcinogenesis involving single OMICS approaches such as scanning the genome for cancer-specific mutations and identifying altered epigenetic-landscapes within cancer cells or by exploring the differential expression of mRNA and protein through transcriptomics and proteomics techniques, respectively. While these single-level OMICS approaches have contributed towards the identification of cancer-specific mutations, epigenetic alterations, and molecular subtyping of tumors based on gene/protein-expression, they lack the resolving-power to establish the casual relationship between molecular signatures and the phenotypic manifestation of cancer hallmarks. In contrast, the multi-OMICS approaches involving the interrogation of the cancer cells/tissues in multiple dimensions have the potential to uncover the intricate molecular mechanism underlying different phenotypic manifestations of cancer hallmarks such as metastasis and angiogenesis. Moreover, multi-OMICS approaches can be used to dissect the cellular response to chemo- or immunotherapy as well as discover molecular candidates with diagnostic/prognostic value. In this review, we focused on the applications of different multi-OMICS approaches in the field of cancer research and discussed how these approaches are shaping the field of personalized oncomedicine. We have highlighted pioneering studies from ""The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)"" consortium encompassing integrated OMICS analysis of over 11,000 tumors from 33 most prevalent forms of cancer. Accumulation of huge cancer-specific multi-OMICS data in repositories like TCGA provides a unique opportunity for the systems biology approach to tackle the complexity of cancer cells through the unification of experimental data and computational/mathematical models. In future, systems biology based approach is likely to predict the phenotypic changes of cancer cells upon chemo-/immunotherapy treatment. This review is sought to encourage investigators to bring these different approaches together for interrogating cancer at molecular, cellular, and systems levels.",30402498,PMC6192166,10.1155/2018/9836256,120,BioMed research international,101600173,3.246
Pathway-level multi-omics analysis of the molecular mechanisms underlying the toxicity of long-term tacrolimus exposure,"Tacrolimus (TAC)-based treatment is associated with nephrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for this toxicity have not been fully explored. This study elucidated the molecular processes underlying the toxic effects of TAC using an integrative omics approach. Rats were sacrificed after 4 weeks of daily oral TAC administration at a dose of 5 mg/kg. The liver and kidney underwent genome-wide gene expression profiling and untargeted metabolomics assays. Molecular alterations were identified using individual data profiling modalities and further characterized by pathway-level transcriptomics-metabolomics integration analysis. Metabolic disturbances were mainly related to an imbalance in oxidant-antioxidant status, as well as in lipid and amino acid metabolism in the liver and kidney. Gene expression profiles also indicated profound molecular alterations, including in genes associated with a dysregulated immune response, proinflammatory signals, and programmed cell death in the liver and kidney. Joint-pathway analysis indicated that the toxicity of TAC was associated with DNA synthesis disruption, oxidative stress, and cell membrane permeabilization, as well as lipid and glucose metabolism. In conclusion, our pathway-level integration of transcriptome and metabolome and conventional analyses of individual omics profiles, provided a more comprehensive picture of the molecular changes resulting from TAC toxicity. This study also serves as a valuable resource for subsequent investigations aiming to understand the mechanism underlying the molecular toxicology of TAC.",37321324,,10.1016/j.taap.2023.116597,2,Toxicology and applied pharmacology,416575,4.46
Clustering single-cell multi-omics data via graph regularized multi-view ensemble learning,"Motivation:Single-cell clustering plays a crucial role in distinguishing between cell types, facilitating the analysis of cell heterogeneity mechanisms. While many existing clustering methods rely solely on gene expression data obtained from single-cell RNA sequencing techniques to identify cell clusters, the information contained in mono-omic data is often limited, leading to suboptimal clustering performance. The emergence of single-cell multi-omics sequencing technologies enables the integration of multiple omics data for identifying cell clusters, but how to integrate different omics data effectively remains challenging. In addition, designing a clustering method that performs well across various types of multi-omics data poses a persistent challenge due to the data's inherent characteristics.Results:In this paper, we propose a graph-regularized multi-view ensemble clustering (GRMEC-SC) model for single-cell clustering. Our proposed approach can adaptively integrate multiple omics data and leverage insights from multiple base clustering results. We extensively evaluate our method on five multi-omics datasets through a series of rigorous experiments. The results of these experiments demonstrate that our GRMEC-SC model achieves competitive performance across diverse multi-omics datasets with varying characteristics.Availability and implementation:Implementation of GRMEC-SC, along with examples, can be found on the GitHub repository: https://github.com/polarisChen/GRMEC-SC.",38547401,PMC11015955,10.1093/bioinformatics/btae169,0,"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",9808944,6.931
Role of arachidonic acid metabolism in intervertebral disc degeneration: identification of potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets via multi-omics analysis and artificial intelligence strategies,"Background:Intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD) is widely recognized as the primary etiological factor underlying low back pain, often necessitating surgical intervention as the sole recourse in severe cases. The metabolic pathway of arachidonic acid (AA), a pivotal regulator of inflammatory responses, influences the development and progression of IVDD.Methods:Initially, a comparative analysis was conducted to investigate the relationship between AA expression patterns and different stages of IVDD using single-cell sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. Additionally, three machine learning methods (LASSO, random forest, and support vector machine recursive feature elimination) were employed to identify hub genes associated with IVDD. Subsequently, a novel artificial intelligence prediction model was developed for IVDD based on an artificial neural network algorithm and validated using an independent dataset. The identified hub genes were further subjected to functional enrichment, immune infiltration, and Connectivity Map analysis. Moreover, external validation was performed using flow cytometry and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis.Results:Both scRNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq data revealed a positive correlation between the severity of IVDD and the AA metabolic pathway. They also revealed increased AA metabolic activity in macrophages and neutrophils, as well as enhanced intercellular communication with nucleus pulposus cells. Utilizing advanced machine learning algorithms, five hub genes (AKR1C3, ALOX5, CYP2B6, EPHX2, and PLB1) were identified, and an incipient diagnostic model was developed with an AUC of 0.961 in the training cohort and 0.72 in the validation cohort. An in-depth exploration of the functionality of these hub genes revealed their notable association with inflammatory responses and immune cell infiltration. Lastly, AH6809 was found to delay IVDD by inhibiting AKR1C3.Conclusions:This study offers comprehensive insights into potential biomarkers and small molecules associated with the early pathogenesis of IVDD. The identified biomarkers and the developed integrated diagnostic model hold great promise in predicting the onset of early IVDD. AH6809 was established as a therapeutic target for AKR1C3 in the treatment of IVDD, as evidenced by computer simulations and biological experiments.",38007425,PMC10675942,10.1186/s12944-023-01962-5,0,Lipids in health and disease,101147696,4.315

scMIC: A Deep Multi-Level Information Fusion Framework for Clustering Single-Cell Multi-Omics Data,"Cell type identification is a crucial step towards the study of cellular heterogeneity and biological processes. Advances in single-cell sequencing technology have enabled the development of a variety of clustering methods for cell type identification. However, most of existing methods are designed for clustering single omic data such as single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. The accumulation of single-cell multi-omics data provides a great opportunity to integrate different omics data for cell clustering, but also raise new computational challenges for existing methods. How to integrate multi-omics data and leverage their consensus and complementary information to improve the accuracy of cell clustering still remains a challenge. In this study, we propose a new deep multi-level information fusion framework, named scMIC, for clustering single-cell multi-omics data. Our model can integrate the attribute information of cells and the potential structural relationship among cells from local and global levels, and reduce redundant information between different omics from cell and feature levels, leading to more discriminative representations. Moreover, the proposed multiple collaborative supervised clustering strategy is able to guide the learning process of the core encoding part by learning the high-confidence target distribution, which facilitates the interaction between the clustering part and the representation learning part, as well as the information exchange between omics, and finally obtain more robust clustering results. Experiments on seven single-cell multi-omics datasets show the superiority of scMIC over existing state-of-the-art methods.",37725723,,10.1109/JBHI.2023.3317272,1,IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics,101604520,7.021
Molecular cluster mining of high-grade serous ovarian cancer via multi-omics data analysis aids precise medicine,"Purpose:HGSOC is a kind of gynecological cancer with high mortality and strong heterogeneity. The study used multi-omics and multiple algorithms to identify novel molecular subtypes, which can help patients obtain more personalized treatments.Methods:Firstly, the consensus clustering result was obtained using a consensus ensemble of ten classical clustering algorithms, based on mRNA, lncRNA, DNA methylation, and mutation data. The difference in signaling pathways was evaluated using the single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA). Meanwhile, the relationship between genetic alteration, response to immunotherapy, drug sensitivity, prognosis, and subtypes was further analyzed. Finally, the reliability of the new subtype was verified in three external datasets.Results:Three molecular subtypes were identified. Immune desert subtype (CS1) had little enrichment in the immune microenvironment and metabolic pathways. Immune/non-stromal subtype (CS2) was enriched in the immune microenvironment and metabolism of polyamines. Immune/stromal subtype (CS3) not only enriched anti-tumor immune microenvironment characteristics but also enriched pro-tumor stroma characteristics, glycosaminoglycan metabolism, and sphingolipid metabolism. The CS2 had the best overall survival and the highest response rate to immunotherapy. The CS3 had the worst prognosis and the lowest response rate to immunotherapy but was more sensitive to PARP and VEGFR molecular-targeted therapy. The similar differences among three subtypes were successfully validated in three external cohorts.Conclusion:We used ten clustering algorithms to comprehensively analyze four types of omics data, identified three biologically significant subtypes of HGSOC patients, and provided personalized treatment recommendations for each subtype.

Fast dimension reduction and integrative clustering of multi-omics data using low-rank approximation: application to cancer molecular classification,"Background:One major goal of large-scale cancer omics study is to identify molecular subtypes for more accurate cancer diagnoses and treatments. To deal with high-dimensional cancer multi-omics data, a promising strategy is to find an effective low-dimensional subspace of the original data and then cluster cancer samples in the reduced subspace. However, due to data-type diversity and big data volume, few methods can integrative and efficiently find the principal low-dimensional manifold of the high-dimensional cancer multi-omics data.Results:In this study, we proposed a novel low-rank approximation based integrative probabilistic model to fast find the shared principal subspace across multiple data types: the convexity of the low-rank regularized likelihood function of the probabilistic model ensures efficient and stable model fitting. Candidate molecular subtypes can be identified by unsupervised clustering hundreds of cancer samples in the reduced low-dimensional subspace. On testing datasets, our method LRAcluster (low-rank approximation based multi-omics data clustering) runs much faster with better clustering performances than the existing method. Then, we applied LRAcluster on large-scale cancer multi-omics data from TCGA. The pan-cancer analysis results show that the cancers of different tissue origins are generally grouped as independent clusters, except squamous-like carcinomas. While the single cancer type analysis suggests that the omics data have different subtyping abilities for different cancer types.Conclusions:LRAcluster is a very useful method for fast dimension reduction and unsupervised clustering of large-scale multi-omics data.

Identification of seven-gene marker to predict the survival of patients with lung adenocarcinoma using integrated multi-omics data analysis,"Background:The mechanism of cancer occurrence and development could be understood with multi-omics data analysis. Discovering genetic markers is highly necessary for predicting clinical outcome of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD).Methods:Clinical follow-up information, copy number variation (CNV) data, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), and RNA-Seq were acquired from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). To obtain robust biomarkers, prognostic-related genes, genes with SNP variation, and copy number differential genes in the training set were selected and further subjected to feature selection using random forests. Finally, a gene-based prediction model for LUAD was validated in validation datasets.Results:The study filtered 2071 prognostic-related genes and 230 genomic variants, 1878 copy deletions, and 438 significant mutations. 218 candidate genes were screened through integrating genomic variation genes and prognosis-related genes. 7 characteristic genes (RHOV, CSMD3, FBN2, MAGEL2, SMIM4, BCKDHB, and GANC) were identified by random forest feature selection, and many genes were found to be tumor progression-related. A 7-gene signature constructed by Cox regression analysis was an independent prognostic factor for LUAD patients, and at the same time a risk factor in the test set, external validation set, and training set. Noticeably, the 5-year AUC of survival in the validation set and training set was all ˃ 0.67. Similar results were obtained from multi-omics validation datasets.Conclusions:The study builds a novel 7-gene signature as a prognostic marker for the survival prediction of patients with LUAD.

A universal framework for single-cell multi-omics data integration with graph convolutional networks,"Single-cell omics data are growing at an unprecedented rate, whereas effective integration of them remains challenging due to different sequencing methods, quality, and expression pattern of each omics data. In this study, we propose a universal framework for the integration of single-cell multi-omics data based on graph convolutional network (GCN-SC). Among the multiple single-cell data, GCN-SC usually selects one data with the largest number of cells as the reference and the rest as the query dataset. It utilizes mutual nearest neighbor algorithm to identify cell-pairs, which provide connections between cells both within and across the reference and query datasets. A GCN algorithm further takes the mixed graph constructed from these cell-pairs to adjust count matrices from the query datasets. Finally, dimension reduction is performed by using non-negative matrix factorization before visualization. By applying GCN-SC on six datasets, we show that GCN-SC can effectively integrate sequencing data from multiple single-cell sequencing technologies, species or different omics, which outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, including Seurat, LIGER, GLUER and Pamona.",36929841,PMC10199767,10.1093/bib/bbad081,4,Briefings in bioinformatics,100912837,13.994
Integration of multi-omics data reveals cis-regulatory variants that are associated with phenotypic differentiation of eastern from western pigs,"Background:The genetic mechanisms that underlie phenotypic differentiation in breeding animals have important implications in evolutionary biology and agriculture. However, the contribution of cis-regulatory variants to pig phenotypes is poorly understood. Therefore, our aim was to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which non-coding variants cause phenotypic differences in pigs by combining evolutionary biology analyses and functional genomics.Results:We obtained a high-resolution phased chromosome-scale reference genome with a contig N50 of 18.03 Mb for the Luchuan pig breed (a representative eastern breed) and profiled potential selective sweeps in eastern and western pigs by resequencing the genomes of 234 pigs. Multi-tissue transcriptome and chromatin accessibility analyses of these regions suggest that tissue-specific selection pressure is mediated by promoters and distal cis-regulatory elements. Promoter variants that are associated with increased expression of the lysozyme (LYZ) gene in the small intestine might enhance the immunity of the gastrointestinal tract and roughage tolerance in pigs. In skeletal muscle, an enhancer-modulating single-nucleotide polymorphism that is associated with up-regulation of the expression of the troponin C1, slow skeletal and cardiac type (TNNC1) gene might increase the proportion of slow muscle fibers and affect meat quality.Conclusions:Our work sheds light on the molecular mechanisms by which non-coding variants shape phenotypic differences in pigs and provides valuable resources and novel perspectives to dissect the role of gene regulatory evolution in animal domestication and breeding.",36104777,PMC9476355,10.1186/s12711-022-00754-2,6,"Genetics, selection, evolution : GSE",9114088,5.1
Identification of candidate cancer drivers by integrative Epi-DNA and Gene Expression (iEDGE) data analysis,"The emergence of large-scale multi-omics data warrants method development for data integration. Genomic studies from cancer patients have identified epigenetic and genetic regulators - such as methylation marks, somatic mutations, and somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs), among others - as predictive features of cancer outcome. However, identification of ""driver genes"" associated with a given alteration remains a challenge. To this end, we developed a computational tool, iEDGE, to model cis and trans effects of (epi-)DNA alterations and identify potential cis driver genes, where cis and trans genes denote those genes falling within and outside the genomic boundaries of a given (epi-)genetic alteration, respectively. iEDGE first identifies the cis and trans gene expression signatures associated with the presence/absence of a particular epi-DNA alteration across samples. It then applies tests of statistical mediation to determine the cis genes predictive of the trans gene expression. Finally, cis and trans effects are annotated by pathway enrichment analysis to gain insights into the underlying regulatory networks. We used iEDGE to perform integrative analysis of SCNAs and gene expression data from breast cancer and 18 additional cancer types included in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Notably, cis gene drivers identified by iEDGE were found to be significantly enriched for known driver genes from multiple compendia of validated oncogenes and tumor suppressors, suggesting that the remainder are of equal importance. Furthermore, predicted drivers were enriched for functionally relevant cancer genes with amplification-driven dependencies, which are of potential prognostic and therapeutic value. All the analyses results are accessible at https://montilab.bu.edu/iEDGE. In summary, integrative analysis of SCNAs and gene expression using iEDGE successfully identified known cancer driver genes and putative cancer therapeutic targets across 19 cancer types in the TCGA. The proposed method can easily be applied to the integration of gene expression profiles with other epi-DNA assays in a variety of disease contexts.",31729402,PMC6858347,10.1038/s41598-019-52886-z,3,Scientific reports,101563288,4.996
"Genomic data integration tutorial, a plant case study","Background:The ongoing evolution of the Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies has led to the production of genomic data on a massive scale. While tools for genomic data integration and analysis are becoming increasingly available, the conceptual and analytical complexities still represent a great challenge in many biological contexts.Results:To address this issue, we describe a six-steps tutorial for the best practices in genomic data integration, consisting of (1) designing a data matrix; (2) formulating a specific biological question toward data description, selection and prediction; (3) selecting a tool adapted to the targeted questions; (4) preprocessing of the data; (5) conducting preliminary analysis, and finally (6) executing genomic data integration.Conclusion:The tutorial has been tested and demonstrated on publicly available genomic data generated from poplar (Populus L.), a woody plant model.

Transomics2cytoscape: an automated software for interpretable 2.5-dimensional visualization of trans-omic networks,"Biochemical network visualization is one of the essential technologies for mechanistic interpretation of omics data. In particular, recent advances in multi-omics measurement and analysis require the development of visualization methods that encompass multiple omics data. Visualization in 2.5 dimension (2.5D visualization), which is an isometric view of stacked X-Y planes, is a convenient way to interpret multi-omics/trans-omics data in the context of the conventional layouts of biochemical networks drawn on each of the stacked omics layers. However, 2.5D visualization of trans-omics networks is a state-of-the-art method that primarily relies on time-consuming human efforts involving manual drawing. Here, we present an R Bioconductor package 'transomics2cytoscape' for automated visualization of 2.5D trans-omics networks. We confirmed that transomics2cytoscape could be used for rapid visualization of trans-omics networks presented in published papers within a few minutes. Transomics2cytoscape allows for frequent update/redrawing of trans-omics networks in line with the progress in multi-omics/trans-omics data analysis, thereby enabling network-based interpretation of multi-omics data at each research step.

qtlXplorer: an online systems genetics browser in the Eucalyptus Genome Integrative Explorer (EucGenIE),"Background:Affordable high-throughput DNA and RNA sequencing technologies are allowing genomic analysis of plant and animal populations and as a result empowering new systems genetics approaches to study complex traits. The availability of intuitive tools to browse and analyze the resulting large-scale genetic and genomic datasets remain a significant challenge. Furthermore, these integrative genomics approaches require innovative methods to dissect the flow and interconnectedness of biological information underlying complex trait variation. The Plant Genome Integrative Explorer (PlantGenIE.org) is a multi-species database and domain that houses online tools for model and woody plant species including Eucalyptus. Since the Eucalyptus Genome Integrative Explorer (EucGenIE) is integrated within PlantGenIE, it shares genome and expression analysis tools previously implemented within the various subdomains (ConGenIE, PopGenIE and AtGenIE). Despite the success in setting up integrative genomics databases, online tools for systems genetics modelling and high-resolution dissection of complex trait variation in plant populations have been lacking.Results:We have developed qtlXplorer ( https://eucgenie.org/QTLXplorer ) for visualizing and exploring systems genetics data from genome-wide association studies including quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and expression-based QTL (eQTL) associations. This module allows users to, for example, find co-located QTLs and eQTLs using an interactive version of Circos, or explore underlying genes using JBrowse. It provides users with a means to build systems genetics models and generate hypotheses from large-scale population genomics data. We also substantially upgraded the EucGenIE resource and show how it enables users to combine genomics and systems genetics approaches to discover candidate genes involved in biotic stress responses and wood formation by focusing on two multigene families, laccases and peroxidases.Conclusions:qtlXplorer adds a new dimension, population genomics, to the EucGenIE and PlantGenIE environment. The resource will be of interest to researchers and molecular breeders working in Eucalyptus and other woody plant species. It provides an example of how systems genetics data can be integrated with functional genetics data to provide biological insight and formulate hypotheses. Importantly, integration within PlantGenIE enables novel comparative genomics analyses to be performed from population-scale data.",34911434,PMC8672637,10.1186/s12859-021-04514-9,0,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,3.307
Predicting censored survival data based on the interactions between meta-dimensional omics data in breast cancer,"Evaluation of survival models to predict cancer patient prognosis is one of the most important areas of emphasis in cancer research. A binary classification approach has difficulty directly predicting survival due to the characteristics of censored observations and the fact that the predictive power depends on the threshold used to set two classes. In contrast, the traditional Cox regression approach has some drawbacks in the sense that it does not allow for the identification of interactions between genomic features, which could have key roles associated with cancer prognosis. In addition, data integration is regarded as one of the important issues in improving the predictive power of survival models since cancer could be caused by multiple alterations through meta-dimensional genomic data including genome, epigenome, transcriptome, and proteome. Here we have proposed a new integrative framework designed to perform these three functions simultaneously: (1) predicting censored survival data; (2) integrating meta-dimensional omics data; (3) identifying interactions within/between meta-dimensional genomic features associated with survival. In order to predict censored survival time, martingale residuals were calculated as a new continuous outcome and a new fitness function used by the grammatical evolution neural network (GENN) based on mean absolute difference of martingale residuals was implemented. To test the utility of the proposed framework, a simulation study was conducted, followed by an analysis of meta-dimensional omics data including copy number, gene expression, DNA methylation, and protein expression data in breast cancer retrieved from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). On the basis of the results from breast cancer dataset, we were able to identify interactions not only within a single dimension of genomic data but also between meta-dimensional omics data that are associated with survival. Notably, the predictive power of our best meta-dimensional model was 73% which outperformed all of the other models conducted based on a single dimension of genomic data. Breast cancer is an extremely heterogeneous disease and the high levels of genomic diversity within/between breast tumors could affect the risk of therapeutic responses and disease progression. Thus, identifying interactions within/between meta-dimensional omics data associated with survival in breast cancer is expected to deliver direction for improved meta-dimensional prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets.",26048077,PMC4550096,10.1016/j.jbi.2015.05.019,15,Journal of biomedical informatics,100970413,8.0
Multi-omics network analysis on samples from sequential biopsies reveals vital role of proliferation arrest for Macrosteatosis related graft failure in rats after liver transplantation,"To investigate the molecular impact of graft MaS on post-transplant prognosis, based on multi-omics integrative analysis. Rats were fed by methionine-choline deficient diet (MCD) for MaS grafts. Samples were collected from grafts by sequential biopsies. Transcriptomic and metabolomic profilings were assayed. Post-transplant MaS status showed a close association with graft failure. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) for in-vivo MaS were mainly enriched on pathways of cell cycle and DNA replication. Post-transplant MaS caused arrests of graft regeneration via inhibiting the E2F1 centered network, which was confirmed by an in vitro experiment. Data from metabolomics assays found insufficient serine/creatine which is located on one‑carbon metabolism was responsible for MaS-related GF. Pre-transplant MaS caused severe fibrosis in long-term survivors. DEGs for grafts from long-term survivors with pre-transplant MaS were mainly enriched in pathways of ECM-receptor interaction and focal adhesion. Transcriptional regulatory network analysis confirmed SOX9 as a key transcription factor (TF) for MaS-related fibrosis. Metabolomic assays found elevation of aromatic amino acid (AAA) was a major feature of fibrosis in long-term survivors. Graft MaS in vivo increased post-transplant GF via negative regulations on graft regeneration. Pre-transplant MaS induced severe fibrosis in long-term survivors via activations on ECM-receptor interaction and AAA metabolism.",37984718,,10.1016/j.ygeno.2023.110748,0,Genomics,8800135,4.31
"An integrative multi-omics approach aimed to gain insight on the effect of composition, style, yeast, and wheat species on wheat craft beer flavour","This study was aimed to unravel the effect of raw materials (barley and wheat), wheat concentration (0, 25, 40, and 100 %), wheat species (common and durum), beer style (Blanche and Weiss), and yeast (US-05 and WB-06) on the chemical composition, volatiles, and sensory profile of wheat craft beers by using a multivariate statistical approach. Beer samples were analysed for their composition, volatiles and sensory profile and data were processed using unsupervised multivariate analyses, PLS regression and a multi-omics approach using multi-block PLS-DA. Multi-block variable sparsification was used as an embedded dimension reduction step. The adopted multi-omics approach permitted to correctly classify beers with different styles and wheat concentration, and to accurate classify (95 % accuracy) beers according to yeast type. Wheat species was of lower importance since it permitted a classification with 49 % accuracy which increased to 74 % in Blanche beers, thus suggesting that malting flattened differences determined by wheat species.",38211478,,10.1016/j.foodchem.2024.138387,0,Food chemistry,7702639,9.231
Multi-omics characterization and validation of MSI-related molecular features across multiple malignancies,"Headings aims:To establish a microsatellite instability (MSI) predictive model in pan-cancer and compare the multi-omics characterization of MSI-related molecular features.Materials and methods:We established a 15-gene signature for predicting MSI status and performed a systematic assessment of MSI-related molecular features including gene and miRNA expression, DNA methylation, and somatic mutation, in approximately 10,000 patients across 30 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas, Gene Expression Omnibus database, and our institution. Then we identified common MSI-associated dysregulated molecular features across six cancers and explored their mutual interfering relationships and the drug sensitivity.Key findings:we demonstrated the model's high prediction performance and found the samples with high-MSI were mainly distributed in six cancers: BRCA, COAD, LUAD, LIHC, STAD, and UCEC. We found RPL22L1 was up-regulated in the high-MSI group of 5/6 cancer types. CYP27A1 and RAI2 were down-regulated in 4/6 cancer types. More than 20 miRNAs and 39 DMGs were found up-regulated in MSI-H at least three cancers. We discovered some drugs, including OSI-027 and AZD8055 had a higher sensitivity in the high MSI-score group. Functional enrichment analysis revealed the correlation between MSI score and APM score, HLA score, or glycolysis score. The complicated regulatory mechanism of tumor MSI status in multiple dimensions was explored by an integrated analysis of the correlations among MSI-related genes, miRNAs, methylation, and drug response data.Significance:Our pan-cancer study provides a valuable predictive model and a comprehensive atlas of tumor MSI, which may guide more precise and personalized therapeutic strategies for tumor patients.",33516699,,10.1016/j.lfs.2021.119081,4,Life sciences,375521,6.78
Multiomics Screening Identifies Molecular Biomarkers Causally Associated With the Risk of Coronary Artery Disease,"Background:In this study, we aimed to investigate functional mechanisms underlying coronary artery disease (CAD) loci and find molecular biomarkers for CAD.Methods:We devised a multiomics data analysis approach based on Mendelian randomization and utilized it to search for molecular biomarkers causally associated with the risk of CAD within genomic regions known to be associated with CAD.Results:Through our CAD-centered multiomics data analysis approach, we identified 33 molecular biomarkers (probes) that were causally associated with the risk of CAD. The majority of these (N=19) were methylation probes; moreover, methylation was often behind the causal effect of expression/protein probes. We identified a number of novel loci that have a causal impact on CAD includingC5orf38,SF3A3,DHX36, andMRPL33. Furthermore, by integrating the risk factors of CAD in our analysis, we were able to investigate the clinical pathways whereby several of our probes exert their effect. We found that the SELE protein level in the blood is under the trans-regulatory impact of methylation sites within theABOgene and that SELE exerts its effect on CAD through immune, glycemic, and lipid metabolism, making it a candidate of interest for therapeutic interventions. We found the methylation site, cg05126514 within theBSNgene exert its effect on CAD through central nervous system-lifestyle risk factors. Finally, genes with a transcriptional regulatory role (SF3A3,ILF3, andN4BP2L2) exert their effect on CAD through height.Conclusions:We demonstrate that multiomics data analysis is a powerful approach to unravel the functional mechanisms underlying CAD loci and to identify novel molecular biomarkers. Our results indicate epigenetic modifications are important in the pathogenesis of CAD and identifying and targeting these sites is of potential therapeutic interest to address the detrimental effects of both environmental and genetic factors.",32969717,,10.1161/CIRCGEN.119.002876,8,Circulation.

Processing genome-wide association studies within a repository of heterogeneous genomic datasets,"Background:Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) are based on the observation of genome-wide sets of genetic variants - typically single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) - in different individuals that are associated with phenotypic traits. Research efforts have so far been directed to improving GWAS techniques rather than on making the results of GWAS interoperable with other genomic signals; this is currently hindered by the use of heterogeneous formats and uncoordinated experiment descriptions.Results:To practically facilitate integrative use, we propose to include GWAS datasets within the META-BASE repository, exploiting an integration pipeline previously studied for other genomic datasets that includes several heterogeneous data types in the same format, queryable from the same systems. We represent GWAS SNPs and metadata by means of the Genomic Data Model and include metadata within a relational representation by extending the Genomic Conceptual Model with a dedicated view. To further reduce the gap with the descriptions of other signals in the repository of genomic datasets, we perform a semantic annotation of phenotypic traits. Our pipeline is demonstrated using two important data sources, initially organized according to different data models: the NHGRI-EBI GWAS Catalog and FinnGen (University of Helsinki). The integration effort finally allows us to use these datasets within multi-sample processing queries that respond to important biological questions. These are then made usable for multi-omic studies together with, e.g., somatic and reference mutation data, genomic annotations, epigenetic signals.Conclusions:As a result of the our work on GWAS datasets, we enable 1) their interoperable use with several other homogenized and processed genomic datasets in the context of the META-BASE repository; 2) their big data processing by means of the GenoMetric Query Language and associated system. Future large-scale tertiary data analysis may extensively benefit from the addition of GWAS results to inform several different downstream analysis workflows.",36869294,PMC9985298,10.1186/s12863-023-01111-y,0,BMC genomic data,101775394,0.0
The endohyphal microbiome: current progress and challenges for scaling down integrative multi-omic microbiome research,"As microbiome research has progressed, it has become clear that most, if not all, eukaryotic organisms are hosts to microbiomes composed of prokaryotes, other eukaryotes, and viruses. Fungi have only recently been considered holobionts with their own microbiomes, as filamentous fungi have been found to harbor bacteria (including cyanobacteria), mycoviruses, other fungi, and whole algal cells within their hyphae. Constituents of this complex endohyphal microbiome have been interrogated using multi-omic approaches. However, a lack of tools, techniques, and standardization for integrative multi-omics for small-scale microbiomes (e.g., intracellular microbiomes) has limited progress towards investigating and understanding the total diversity of the endohyphal microbiome and its functional impacts on fungal hosts. Understanding microbiome impacts on fungal hosts will advance explorations of how ""microbiomes within microbiomes"" affect broader microbial community dynamics and ecological functions. Progress to date as well as ongoing challenges of performing integrative multi-omics on the endohyphal microbiome is discussed herein. Addressing the challenges associated with the sample extraction, sample preparation, multi-omic data generation, and multi-omic data analysis and integration will help advance current knowledge of the endohyphal microbiome and provide a road map for shrinking microbiome investigations to smaller scales.

Multi-omics integration with weighted affinity and self-diffusion applied for cancer subtypes identification,"Background:Characterizing cancer molecular subtypes is crucial for improving prognosis and individualized treatment. Integrative analysis of multi-omics data has become an important approach for disease subtyping, yielding better understanding of the complex biology. Current multi-omics integration tools and methods for cancer subtyping often suffer challenges of high computational efficiency as well as the problem of weight assignment on data types.Results:Here, we present an efficient multi-omics integration via weighted affinity and self-diffusion (MOSD) to dissect cancer heterogeneity. MOSD first construct local scaling affinity on each data type and then integrate all affinities by weighted linear combination, followed by the self-diffusion to further improve the patients' similarities for the downstream clustering analysis. To demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness for cancer subtyping, we apply MOSD across ten cancer types with three measurements (Gene expression, DNA methylation, miRNA).Conclusions:Our approach exhibits more significant differences in patient survival and computationally efficient benchmarking against several state-of-art integration methods and the identified molecular subtypes reveal strongly biological interpretability.

Prognostics lncRNA biomarkers for GC were identified by univariate Cox, LASSO and SVM-RFE analysis.Results:Three molecular subtypes with significant survival discrepancies, and their specific DEmRNAs and DElncRNAs were identified. Three reliable prognostic-associated lncRNA, including LINC00670, LINC00452 and LINC00160, were selected for GC.Conclusion:Our findings expanded the understanding on the regulatory network of lncRNAs in GC, providing potential targets for prognosis and treatment of GC patients.",38126139,,10.2217/epi-2023-0349,0,Epigenomics,101519720,4.357
Integrated multi-omics analysis reveals drought stress response mechanism in chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.),"Drought is one of the major constraints limiting chickpea productivity. To unravel complex mechanisms regulating drought response in chickpea, we generated transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics datasets from root tissues of four contrasting drought-responsive chickpea genotypes: ICC 4958, JG 11, and JG 11+ (drought-tolerant), and ICC 1882 (drought-sensitive) under control and drought stress conditions. Integration of transcriptomics and proteomics data identified enriched hub proteins encoding isoflavone 4'-O-methyltransferase, UDP-d-glucose/UDP-d-galactose 4-epimerase, and delta-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase. These proteins highlighted the involvement of pathways such as antibiotic biosynthesis, galactose metabolism, and isoflavonoid biosynthesis in activating drought stress response mechanisms. Subsequently, the integration of metabolomics data identified six metabolites (fructose, galactose, glucose, myoinositol, galactinol, and raffinose) that showed a significant correlation with galactose metabolism. Integration of root-omics data also revealed some key candidate genes underlying the drought-responsive ""QTL-hotspot"" region.

Twelve New Genomic Loci Associated With Bone Mineral Density,"Aiming to identify more genomic loci associated with bone mineral density (BMD), we conducted a joint association analysis of 2 genome-wide association study (GWAS) by the integrative association method multi-trait analysis of GWAS (MTAG). The first one is the single GWAS of estimated heel BMD (eBMD) in the UK biobank (UKB) cohort (N= 426,824), and the second one is the GWAS meta-analysis of total body BMD (TB-BMD) in 66,628 participants from 30 studies. Approximate conditional association analysis was performed in the identified novel loci to identify secondary association signal. Statistical fine-mapping was conducted to prioritize plausible credible risk variants (CRVs). Candidate genes were prioritized based on the analyses of cis- expression quantitative trait locus (cis-eQTL) and cis-protein QTL (cis-pQTL) information as well as the functional category of the SNP. By integrating the information carried in over 490,000 participants, this largest joint analysis of BMD GWAS identified 12 novel genomic loci at the genome-wide significance level (GWS,p= 5.0 × 10-8), nine of which were for eBMD and four were for TB-BMD, explaining an additional 0.11 and 0.23% heritability for the two traits, respectively. These loci include 1p33 (lead SNP rs10493130, peBMD= 3.19 × 10-8), 5q13.2 (rs4703589, peBMD= 4.78 × 10-8), 5q31.3 (rs9324887, pTB-BMD= 1.36 × 10-9), 6p21.32 (rs6905837, peBMD= 3.32 × 10-8), 6q14.1 (rs10806234, peBMD= 2.63 × 10-8), 7q21.11 (rs10806234, pTB-BMD= 3.37 × 10-8), 8q24.12 (rs11995866, peBMD= 6.72 × 10-9), 12p13.31 (rs1639122, peBMD= 4.43 × 10-8), 12p12.1 (rs58489179, peBMD= 4.74 × 10-8), 12q24.23 (rs75499226, peBMD= 1.44 × 10-8), 19q13.31 (rs7255083, pTB-BMD= 2.18 × 10-8) and 22q11.23 (rs13056137, pTB-BMD= 2.54 × 10-8). All lead SNPs in these 12 loci are nominally significant in both original studies as well as consistent in effect direction between them, providing solid evidence of replication. Approximate conditional analysis identified one secondary signal in 5q13.2 (rs11738874, pconditional= 5.06 × 10-9). Statistical fine-mapping analysis prioritized 269 CRVs. A total of 65 candidate genes were prioritized, including those with known biological function to bone development (such asFGF1, COL11A2andDEPTOR). Our findings provide novel insights into a better understanding of the genetic mechanism underlying bone development as well as candidate genes for future functional investigation.",32390946,PMC7188784,10.3389/fendo.2020.00243,7,Frontiers in endocrinology,101555782,6.055
A supervised Bayesian factor model for the identification of multi-omics signatures,"Motivation:Predictive biological signatures provide utility as biomarkers for disease diagnosis and prognosis, as well as prediction of responses to vaccination or therapy. These signatures are identified from high-throughput profiling assays through a combination of dimensionality reduction and machine learning techniques. The genes, proteins, metabolites, and other biological analytes that compose signatures also generate hypotheses on the underlying mechanisms driving biological responses, thus improving biological understanding. Dimensionality reduction is a critical step in signature discovery to address the large number of analytes in omics datasets, especially for multi-omics profiling studies with tens of thousands of measurements. Latent factor models, which can account for the structural heterogeneity across diverse assays, effectively integrate multi-omics data and reduce dimensionality to a small number of factors that capture correlations and associations among measurements. These factors provide biologically interpretable features for predictive modeling. However, multi-omics integration and predictive modeling are generally performed independently in sequential steps, leading to suboptimal factor construction. Combining these steps can yield better multi-omics signatures that are more predictive while still being biologically meaningful.Results:We developed a supervised variational Bayesian factor model that extracts multi-omics signatures from high-throughput profiling datasets that can span multiple data types. Signature-based multiPle-omics intEgration via lAtent factoRs (SPEAR) adaptively determines factor rank, emphasis on factor structure, data relevance and feature sparsity.

Exploring cell aggregation as a defense strategy against perchlorate stress in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii through multi-omics analysis,"Perchlorate (ClO4-) is a type of novel, widely distributed, and persistent inorganic pollutant. However, the impacts of perchlorate on freshwater algae remain unclear. In this study, the response and defense mechanisms of microalgae (Chlamydomonas reinhardtii) under perchlorate stress were investigated by integrating physiological and biochemical monitoring, transcriptomics, and metabolomics. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) of transcriptome data was used to analyze the relationship between genes and phenotype and screen the key pathways. C. reinhardtii exhibited aggregate behavior when exposed to 100- and 200-mM perchlorate but was restored to its unicellular lifestyle when transferred to fresh medium. WGCNA results found that the ""carbohydrate metabolism"" and ""lipid metabolism"" pathways were closely related to cell aggregation phenotype. The differential expression genes (DEGs) and differentially accumulated metabolites (DAMs) of these pathways were upregulated, indicating that the lipid and carbohydrate metabolisms were enhanced in aggregated cells. Additionally, most genes and metabolites related to phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway were significantly upregulated, indicating their crucial roles in the signal transmission of aggregated cells. Meanwhile, in aggregated cells, extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and lipid contents increased, photosynthesis activity decreased, and the antioxidant system was activated. These characteristics contributed to C. reinhardtii's improved resistance to perchlorate stress. Above results demonstrated that cell aggregation behavior was the principal defense strategy of C. reinhardtii against perchlorate. Overall, this study sheds new light on the impact mechanisms of perchlorate to aquatic microalgae and provides multi-omics insights into the research of multicellular-like aggregation as an adaptation strategy to abiotic stress. These results are beneficial for assessing the risk of perchlorate in aquatic environments.",37709088,,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.167045,0,The Science of the total environment,330500,10.753
scmFormer Integrates Large-Scale Single-Cell Proteomics and Transcriptomics Data by Multi-Task Transformer,"Transformer-based models have revolutionized single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data analysis. However, their applicability is challenged by the complexity and scale of single-cell multi-omics data. Here a novel single-cell multi-modal/multi-task transformer (scmFormer) is proposed to fill up the existing blank of integrating single-cell proteomics with other omics data. Through systematic benchmarking, it is demonstrated that scmFormer excels in integrating large-scale single-cell multimodal data and heterogeneous multi-batch paired multi-omics data, while preserving shared information across batchs and distinct biological information. scmFormer achieves 54.5% higher average F1 score compared to the second method in transferring cell-type labels from single-cell transcriptomics to proteomics data. Using COVID-19 datasets, it is presented that scmFormer successfully integrates over 1.48 million cells on a personal computer.

Integrated Transcriptomic-Proteomic Analysis Using a Proteogenomic Workflow Refines Rat Genome Annotation,"Proteogenomic re-annotation and mRNA splicing information can lead to the discovery of various protein forms for eukaryotic model organisms like rat. However, detection of novel proteoforms using mass spectrometry proteomics data remains a formidable challenge. We developed EuGenoSuite, an open source multiple algorithmic proteomic search tool and utilized it in our in-house integrated transcriptomic-proteomic pipeline to facilitate automated proteogenomic analysis. Using four proteogenomic pipelines (integrated transcriptomic-proteomic, Peppy, Enosi, and ProteoAnnotator) on publicly available RNA-sequence and MS proteomics data, we discovered 363 novel peptides in rat brain microglia representing novel proteoforms for 249 gene loci in the rat genome. These novel peptides aided in the discovery of novel exons, translation of annotated untranslated regions, pseudogenes, and splice variants for various loci; many of which have known disease associations, including neurological disorders like schizophrenia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, etc. Novel isoforms were also discovered for genes implicated in cardiovascular diseases and breast cancer for which rats are considered model organisms. Our integrative multi-omics data analysis not only enables the discovery of new proteoforms but also generates an improved reference for human disease studies in the rat model.",26560066,PMC4762527,10.1074/mcp.M114.047126,16,Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP,101125647,7.381
scMLC: an accurate and robust multiplex community detection method for single-cell multi-omics data,"Clustering cells based on single-cell multi-modal sequencing technologies provides an unprecedented opportunity to create high-resolution cell atlas, reveal cellular critical states and study health and diseases. However, effectively integrating different sequencing data for cell clustering remains a challenging task. Motivated by the successful application of Louvain in scRNA-seq data, we propose a single-cell multi-modal Louvain clustering framework, called scMLC, to tackle this problem. scMLC builds multiplex single- and cross-modal cell-to-cell networks to capture modal-specific and consistent information between modalities and then adopts a robust multiplex community detection method to obtain the reliable cell clusters. In comparison with 15 state-of-the-art clustering methods on seven real datasets simultaneously measuring gene expression and chromatin accessibility, scMLC achieves better accuracy and stability in most datasets. Synthetic results also indicate that the cell-network-based integration strategy of multi-omics data is superior to other strategies in terms of generalization. Moreover, scMLC is flexible and can be extended to single-cell sequencing data with more than two modalities.",38493339,PMC10944569,10.1093/bib/bbae101,0,Briefings in bioinformatics,100912837,13.994

To facilitate community-based annotation and mining of the rapidly accumulating functional genomics resources, we have initiated an international consortium and present a comprehensive multi-omics resource database named Nannochloropsis Design and Synthesis (NanDeSyn; http://nandesyn.single-cell.cn). Via the Tripal toolkit, it features user-friendly interfaces hosting genomic resources with gene annotations and transcriptomic and proteomic data for six Nannochloropsis species, including two updated genomes of Nannochloropsis oceanica IMET1 and Nannochloropsis salina CCMP1776.

Immu-Mela: An open resource for exploring immunotherapy-related multidimensional genomic profiles in melanoma,"There are increasing studies aimed to reveal genomic hallmarks predictive of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) treatment response, which generated a large number of data and provided an unprecedented opportunity to identify response-related features and evaluate their robustness across cohorts. However, those valuable data sets are not easily accessible to the research community. To take full advantage of existing large-scale immuno-genomic profiles, we developed Immu-Mela (http://bioinfo.vanderbilt.edu/database/Immu-Mela/), a multidimensional immuno-genomic portal that provides interactive exploration of associations between ICB responsiveness and multi-omics features in melanoma, including genetic, transcriptomics, immune cells, and single-cell populations. Immu-Mela also enables integrative analysis of any two genomic features. We demonstrated the value of Immu-Mela by identifying known and novel genomic features associated with ICB response. In addition, Immu-Mela allows users to upload their data sets (unrestricted to any cancer types) and co-analyze with existing data to identify and validate signatures of interest.

Deciphering the omicron variant: integrated omics analysis reveals critical biomarkers and pathophysiological pathways,"Background:The rapid emergence and global dissemination of the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 have posed formidable challenges in public health. This scenario underscores the urgent need for an enhanced understanding of Omicron's pathophysiological mechanisms to guide clinical management and shape public health strategies. Our study is aimed at deciphering the intricate molecular mechanisms underlying Omicron infections, particularly focusing on the identification of specific biomarkers.Methods:This investigation employed a robust and systematic approach, initially encompassing 15 Omicron-infected patients and an equal number of healthy controls, followed by a validation cohort of 20 individuals per group. The study's methodological framework included a comprehensive multi-omics analysis that integrated proteomics and metabolomics, augmented by extensive bioinformatics. Proteomic exploration was conducted via an advanced Ultra-High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (UHPLC) system linked with mass spectrometry. Concurrently, metabolomic profiling was executed using an Ultra-Performance Liquid Chromatography (UPLC) system. The bioinformatics component, fundamental to this research, entailed an exhaustive analysis of protein-protein interactions, pathway enrichment, and metabolic network dynamics, utilizing state-of-the-art tools such as the STRING database and Cytoscape software, ensuring a holistic interpretation of the data.Results:Our proteomic inquiry identified eight notably dysregulated proteins (THBS1, ACTN1, ACTC1, POTEF, ACTB, TPM4, VCL, ICAM1) in individuals infected with the Omicron variant. These proteins play critical roles in essential physiological processes, especially within the coagulation cascade and hemostatic mechanisms, suggesting their significant involvement in the pathogenesis of Omicron infection. Complementing these proteomic insights, metabolomic analysis discerned 146 differentially expressed metabolites, intricately associated with pivotal metabolic pathways such as tryptophan metabolism, retinol metabolism, and steroid hormone biosynthesis. This comprehensive metabolic profiling sheds light on the systemic implications of Omicron infection, underscoring profound alterations in metabolic equilibrium.Conclusions:This study substantially enriches our comprehension of the physiological ramifications induced by the Omicron variant, with a particular emphasis on the pivotal roles of coagulation and platelet pathways in disease pathogenesis. The discovery of these specific biomarkers illuminates their potential as critical targets for diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, providing invaluable insights for the development of tailored treatments and enhancing patient care in the dynamic context of the ongoing pandemic.",38424541,PMC10905948,10.1186/s12967-024-05022-z,0,Journal of translational medicine,101190741,8.44
Identification of prognostic and predictive biomarkers in high-dimensional data with PPLasso,"In clinical trials, identification of prognostic and predictive biomarkers has became essential to precision medicine. Prognostic biomarkers can be useful for the prevention of the occurrence of the disease, and predictive biomarkers can be used to identify patients with potential benefit from the treatment. Previous researches were mainly focused on clinical characteristics, and the use of genomic data in such an area is hardly studied. A new method is required to simultaneously select prognostic and predictive biomarkers in high dimensional genomic data where biomarkers are highly correlated. We propose a novel approach called PPLasso, that integrates prognostic and predictive effects into one statistical model. PPLasso also takes into account the correlations between biomarkers that can alter the biomarker selection accuracy. Our method consists in transforming the design matrix to remove the correlations between the biomarkers before applying the generalized Lasso. In a comprehensive numerical evaluation, we show that PPLasso outperforms the traditional Lasso and other extensions on both prognostic and predictive biomarker identification in various scenarios. Finally, our method is applied to publicly available transcriptomic and proteomic data.",36690931,PMC9869528,10.1186/s12859-023-05143-0,0,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,3.307
A multi-omic analysis of human naïve CD4+ T cells,"Background:Cellular function and diversity are orchestrated by complex interactions of fundamental biomolecules including DNA, RNA and proteins. Technological advances in genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics and proteomics have enabled massively parallel and unbiased measurements. Such high-throughput technologies have been extensively used to carry out broad, unbiased studies, particularly in the context of human diseases. Nevertheless, a unified analysis of the genome, epigenome, transcriptome and proteome of a single human cell type to obtain a coherent view of the complex interplay between various biomolecules has not yet been undertaken. Here, we report the first multi-omic analysis of human primary naïve CD4+ T cells isolated from a single individual.Results:Integrating multi-omics datasets allowed us to investigate genome-wide methylation and its effect on mRNA/protein expression patterns, extent of RNA editing under normal physiological conditions and allele specific expression in naïve CD4+ T cells. In addition, we carried out a multi-omic comparative analysis of naïve with primary resting memory CD4+ T cells to identify molecular changes underlying T cell differentiation. This analysis provided mechanistic insights into how several molecules involved in T cell receptor signaling are regulated at the DNA, RNA and protein levels. Phosphoproteomics revealed downstream signaling events that regulate these two cellular states. Availability of multi-omics data from an identical genetic background also allowed us to employ novel proteogenomics approaches to identify individual-specific variants and putative novel protein coding regions in the human genome.Conclusions:We utilized multiple high-throughput technologies to derive a comprehensive profile of two primary human cell types, naïve CD4+ T cells and memory CD4+ T cells, from a single donor. Through vertical as well as horizontal integration of whole genome sequencing, methylation arrays, RNA-Seq, miRNA-Seq, proteomics, and phosphoproteomics, we derived an integrated and comparative map of these two closely related immune cells and identified potential molecular effectors of immune cell differentiation following antigen encounter.",26542228,PMC4636073,10.1186/s12918-015-0225-4,22,BMC systems biology,101301827,0.0
A fair experimental comparison of neural network architectures for latent representations of multi-omics for drug response prediction,"Background:Recent years have seen a surge of novel neural network architectures for the integration of multi-omics data for prediction. Most of the architectures include either encoders alone or encoders and decoders, i.e., autoencoders of various sorts, to transform multi-omics data into latent representations. One important parameter is the depth of integration: the point at which the latent representations are computed or merged, which can be either early, intermediate, or late. The literature on integration methods is growing steadily, however, close to nothing is known about the relative performance of these methods under fair experimental conditions and under consideration of different use cases.Results:We developed a comparison framework that trains and optimizes multi-omics integration methods under equal conditions. We incorporated early integration, PCA and four recently published deep learning methods: MOLI, Super.FELT, OmiEmbed, and MOMA. Further, we devised a novel method, Omics Stacking, that combines the advantages of intermediate and late integration. Experiments were conducted on a public drug response data set with multiple omics data (somatic point mutations, somatic copy number profiles and gene expression profiles) that was obtained from cell lines, patient-derived xenografts, and patient samples. Our experiments confirmed that early integration has the lowest predictive performance. Overall, architectures that integrate triplet loss achieved the best results. Statistical differences can, overall, rarely be observed, however, in terms of the average ranks of methods, Super.FELT is consistently performing best in a cross-validation setting and Omics Stacking best in an external test set setting.Conclusions:We recommend researchers to follow fair comparison protocols, as suggested in the paper. When faced with a new data set, Super.FELT is a good option in the cross-validation setting as well as Omics Stacking in the external test set setting. Statistical significances are hardly observable, despite trends in the algorithms' rankings. Future work on refined methods for transfer learning tailored for this domain may improve the situation for external test sets.

scapGNN: A graph neural network-based framework for active pathway and gene module inference from single-cell multi-omics data,"Although advances in single-cell technologies have enabled the characterization of multiple omics profiles in individual cells, extracting functional and mechanistic insights from such information remains a major challenge. Here, we present scapGNN, a graph neural network (GNN)-based framework that creatively transforms sparse single-cell profile data into the stable gene-cell association network for inferring single-cell pathway activity scores and identifying cell phenotype-associated gene modules from single-cell multi-omics data. Systematic benchmarking demonstrated that scapGNN was more accurate, robust, and scalable than state-of-the-art methods in various downstream single-cell analyses such as cell denoising, batch effect removal, cell clustering, cell trajectory inference, and pathway or gene module identification. scapGNN was developed as a systematic R package that can be flexibly extended and enhanced for existing analysis processes.

Multi-omics analysis of niche specificity provides new insights into ecological adaptation in bacteria,"Different lifestyles, ranging from a saprophyte to a pathogen, have been reported in bacteria of one species. Here, we performed genome-wide survey of the ecological adaptation in four Burkholderia seminalis strains, distinguished by their origin as part of the saprophytic microbial community of soil or water but also including human and plant pathogens. The results indicated that each strain is separated from the others by increased fitness in medium simulating its original niche corresponding to the difference between strains in metabolic capacities. Furthermore, strain-specific metabolism and niche survival was generally linked with genomic variants and niche-dependent differential expression of the corresponding genes. In particular, the importance of iron, trehalose and d-arabitol utilization was highlighted by the involvement of DNA-methylation and horizontal gene transfer in niche-adapted regulation of the corresponding operons based on the integrated analysis of our multi-omics data. Overall, our results provided insights of niche-specific adaptation in bacteria.",26859773,PMC5029151,10.1038/ismej.2015.251,14,The ISME journal,101301086,11.217
Machine learning assists prediction of genes responsible for plant specialized metabolite biosynthesis by integrating multi-omics data,"Background:Plant specialized (or secondary) metabolites (PSM), also known as phytochemicals, natural products, or plant constituents, play essential roles in interactions between plants and environment. Although many research efforts have focused on discovering novel metabolites and their biosynthetic genes, the resolution of metabolic pathways and identified biosynthetic genes was limited by rudimentary analysis approaches and enormous number of candidate genes.Results:Here we integrated state-of-the-art automated machine learning (ML) frame AutoGluon-Tabular and multi-omics data from Arabidopsis to predict genes encoding enzymes involved in biosynthesis of plant specialized metabolite (PSM), focusing on the three main PSM categories: terpenoids, alkaloids, and phenolics. We found that the related features of genomics and proteomics were the top two crucial categories of features contributing to the model performance. Using only these key features, we built a new model in Arabidopsis, which performed better than models built with more features including those related with transcriptomics and epigenomics. Finally, the built models were validated in maize and tomato, and models tested for maize and trained with data from two other species exhibited either equivalent or superior performance to intraspecies predictions.Conclusions:Our external validation results in grape and poppy on the one hand implied the applicability of our model to the other species, and on the other hand showed enormous potential to improve the prediction of enzymes synthesizing PSM with the inclusion of valid data from a wider range of species.",38679745,PMC11057162,10.1186/s12864-024-10258-6,0,BMC genomics,100965258,4.547
eQTLs are key players in the integration of genomic and transcriptomic data for phenotype prediction,"Background:Multi-omics represent a promising link between phenotypes and genome variation. Few studies yet address their integration to understand genetic architecture and improve predictability.Results:Our study used 241 poplar genotypes, phenotyped in two common gardens, with xylem and cambium RNA sequenced at one site, yielding large phenotypic, genomic (SNP), and transcriptomic datasets. Prediction models for each trait were built separately for SNPs and transcripts, and compared to a third model integrated by concatenation of both omics. The advantage of integration varied across traits and, to understand such differences, an eQTL analysis was performed to characterize the interplay between the genome and transcriptome and classify the predicting features into cis or trans relationships. A strong, significant negative correlation was found between the change in predictability and the change in predictor ranking for trans eQTLs for traits evaluated in the site of transcriptomic sampling.Conclusions:Consequently, beneficial integration happens when the redundancy of predictors is decreased, likely leaving the stage to other less prominent but complementary predictors. An additional gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis appeared to corroborate such statistical output. To our knowledge, this is a novel finding delineating a promising method to explore data integration.",35764918,PMC9238188,10.1186/s12864-022-08690-7,2,BMC genomics,100965258,4.547
Predictive modeling of single-cell DNA methylome data enhances integration with transcriptome data,"Single-cell DNA methylation data has become increasingly abundant and has uncovered many genes with a positive correlation between expression and promoter methylation, challenging the common dogma based on bulk data. However, computational tools for analyzing single-cell methylome data are lagging far behind. A number of tasks, including cell type calling and integration with transcriptome data, requires the construction of a robust gene activity matrix as the prerequisite but challenging task. The advent of multi-omics data enables measurement of both DNA methylation and gene expression for the same single cells. Although such data is rather sparse, they are sufficient to train supervised models that capture the complex relationship between DNA methylation and gene expression and predict gene activities at single-cell level. Here, we present methylome association by predictive linkage to expression (MAPLE), a computational framework that learns the association between DNA methylation and expression using both gene- and cell-dependent statistical features. Using multiple data sets generated with different experimental protocols, we show that using predicted gene activity values significantly improves several analysis tasks, including clustering, cell type identification, and integration with transcriptome data. Application of MAPLE revealed several interesting biological insights into the relationship between methylation and gene expression, including asymmetric importance of methylation signals around transcription start site for predicting gene expression, and increased predictive power of methylation signals in promoters located outside CpG islands and shores. With the rapid accumulation of single-cell epigenomics data, MAPLE provides a general framework for integrating such data with transcriptome data.",33219054,PMC7849382,10.1101/gr.267047.120,10,Genome research,9518021,9.438
Complexity of enhancer networks predicts cell identity and disease genes revealed by single-cell multi-omics analysis,"Many enhancers exist as clusters in the genome and control cell identity and disease genes; however, the underlying mechanism remains largely unknown. Here, we introduce an algorithm, eNet, to build enhancer networks by integrating single-cell chromatin accessibility and gene expression profiles. The complexity of enhancer networks is assessed by two metrics: the number of enhancers and the frequency of predicted enhancer interactions (PEIs) based on chromatin co-accessibility. We apply eNet algorithm to a human blood dataset and find cell identity and disease genes tend to be regulated by complex enhancer networks. The network hub enhancers (enhancers with frequent PEIs) are the most functionally important. Compared with super-enhancers, enhancer networks show better performance in predicting cell identity and disease genes. eNet is robust and widely applicable in various human or mouse tissues datasets. Thus, we propose a model of enhancer networks containing three modes: Simple, Multiple and Complex, which are distinguished by their complexity in regulating gene expression. Taken together, our work provides an unsupervised approach to simultaneously identify key cell identity and disease genes and explore the underlying regulatory relationships among enhancers in single cells.",36464486,,10.1093/bib/bbac508,2,Briefings in bioinformatics,100912837,13.994
MBKbase for rice: an integrated omics knowledgebase for molecular breeding in rice,"To date, large amounts of genomic and phenotypic data have been accumulated in the fields of crop genetics and genomic research, and the data are increasing very quickly. However, the bottleneck to using big data in breeding is integrating the data and developing tools for revealing the relationship between genotypes and phenotypes. Here, we report a rice sub-database of an integrated omics knowledgebase (MBKbase-rice, www.mbkbase.org/rice), which integrates rice germplasm information, multiple reference genomes with a united set of gene loci, population sequencing data, phenotypic data, known alleles and gene expression data.

Cell fate conversion prediction by group sparse optimization method utilizing single-cell and bulk OMICs data,"Cell fate conversion by overexpressing defined factors is a powerful tool in regenerative medicine. However, identifying key factors for cell fate conversion requires laborious experimental efforts; thus, many of such conversions have not been achieved yet. Nevertheless, cell fate conversions found in many published studies were incomplete as the expression of important gene sets could not be manipulated thoroughly. Therefore, the identification of master transcription factors for complete and efficient conversion is crucial to render this technology more applicable clinically. In the past decade, systematic analyses on various single-cell and bulk OMICs data have uncovered numerous gene regulatory mechanisms, and made it possible to predict master gene regulators during cell fate conversion. By virtue of the sparse structure of master transcription factors and the group structure of their simultaneous regulatory effects on the cell fate conversion process, this study introduces a novel computational method predicting master transcription factors based on group sparse optimization technique integrating data from multi-OMICs levels, which can be applicable to both single-cell and bulk OMICs data with a high tolerance of data sparsity. When it is compared with current prediction methods by cross-referencing published and validated master transcription factors, it possesses superior performance. In short, this method facilitates fast identification of key regulators, give raise to the possibility of higher successful conversion rate and in the hope of reducing experimental cost.",34374760,,10.1093/bib/bbab311,8,Briefings in bioinformatics,100912837,13.994

"Single-cell transcriptomics and data analyses for prokaryotes-Past, present and future concepts","Transcriptomics, or more specifically mRNA sequencing, is a powerful tool to study gene expression at the single-cell level (scRNA-seq) which enables new insights into a plethora of biological processes. While methods for single-cell RNA-seq in eukaryotes are well established, application to prokaryotes is still challenging. Reasons for that are rigid and diverse cell wall structures hampering lysis, the lack of polyadenylated transcripts impeding mRNA enrichment, and minute amounts of RNA requiring amplification steps before sequencing. Despite those obstacles, several promising scRNA-seq approaches for bacteria have been published recently, albeit difficulties in the experimental workflow and data processing and analysis remain. In particular, bias is often introduced by amplification which makes it difficult to distinguish between technical noise and biological variation. Future optimization of experimental procedures and data analysis algorithms are needed for the improvement of scRNA-seq but also to aid in the emergence of prokaryotic single-cell multi-omics. to help address 21st century challenges in the biotechnology and health sector.",37400172,,10.1016/bs.aambs.2023.04.002,0,Advances in applied microbiology,370413,5.515
BRCA-Pathway: a structural integration and visualization system of TCGA breast cancer data on KEGG pathways,"Background:Bioinformatics research for finding biological mechanisms can be done by analysis of transcriptome data with pathway based interpretation. Therefore, researchers have tried to develop tools to analyze transcriptome data with pathway based interpretation. Over the years, the amount of omics data has become huge, e.g., TCGA, and the data types to be analyzed have come in many varieties, including mutations, copy number variations, and transcriptome. We also need to consider a complex relationship with regulators of genes, particularly Transcription Factors(TF). However, there has not been a system for pathway based exploration and analysis of TCGA multi-omics data. In this reason, We have developed a web based system BRCA-Pathway to fulfill the need for pathway based analysis of TCGA multi-omics data.Results:BRCA-Pathway is a structured integration and visual exploration system of TCGA breast cancer data on KEGG pathways. For data integration, a relational database is designed and used to integrate multi-omics data of TCGA-BRCA, KEGG pathway data, Hallmark gene sets, transcription factors, driver genes, and PAM50 subtypes. For data exploration, multi-omics data such as SNV, CNV and gene expression can be visualized simultaneously in KEGG pathway maps, together with transcription factors-target genes (TF-TG) correlation and relationships among cancer driver genes. In addition, 'Pathways summary' and 'Oncoprint' with mutual exclusivity sort can be generated dynamically with a request by the user. Data in BRCA-Pathway can be downloaded by REST API for further analysis.Conclusions:BRCA-Pathway helps researchers navigate omics data towards potentially important genes, regulators, and discover complex patterns involving mutations, CNV, and gene expression data of various patient groups in the biological pathway context. In addition, mutually exclusive genomic alteration patterns in a specific pathway can be generated. BRCA-Pathway can provide an integrative perspective on the breast cancer omics data, which can help researchers discover new insights on the biological mechanisms of breast cancer.",29504910,PMC5836821,10.1186/s12859-018-2016-6,14,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,3.307
A prognostic prediction model for ovarian cancer using a cross-modal view correlation discovery network,"Ovarian cancer is a tumor with different clinicopathological and molecular features, and the vast majority of patients have local or extensive spread at the time of diagnosis. Early diagnosis and prognostic prediction of patients can contribute to the understanding of the underlying pathogenesis of ovarian cancer and the improvement of therapeutic outcomes. The occurrence of ovarian cancer is influenced by multiple complex mechanisms, including the genome, transcriptome and proteome. Different types of omics analysis help predict the survival rate of ovarian cancer patients. Multi-omics data of ovarian cancer exhibit high-dimensional heterogeneity, and existing methods for integrating multi-omics data have not taken into account the variability and inter-correlation between different omics data. In this paper, we propose a deep learning model, MDCADON, which utilizes multi-omics data and cross-modal view correlation discovery network. We introduce random forest into LASSO regression for feature selection on mRNA expression, DNA methylation, miRNA expression and copy number variation (CNV), aiming to select important features highly correlated with ovarian cancer prognosis. A multi-modal deep neural network is used to comprehensively learn feature representations of each omics data and clinical data, and cross-modal view correlation discovery network is employed to construct the multi-omics discovery tensor, exploring the inter-relationships between different omics data. The experimental results demonstrate that MDCADON is superior to the existing methods in predicting ovarian cancer prognosis, which enables survival analysis for patients and facilitates the determination of follow-up treatment plans. Finally, we perform Gene Ontology (GO) term analysis and biological pathway analysis on the genes identified by MDCADON, revealing the underlying mechanisms of ovarian cancer and providing certain support for guiding ovarian cancer treatments.",38303441,,10.3934/mbe.2024031,1,Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE,101197794,2.194
A live-cell platform to isolate phenotypically defined subpopulations for spatial multi-omic profiling,"Numerous techniques have been employed to deconstruct the heterogeneity observed in normal and diseased cellular populations, including single cell RNA sequencing, in situ hybridization, and flow cytometry. While these approaches have revolutionized our understanding of heterogeneity, in isolation they cannot correlate phenotypic information within a physiologically relevant live-cell state with molecular profiles. This inability to integrate a live-cell phenotype-such as invasiveness, cell:cell interactions, and changes in spatial positioning-with multi-omic data creates a gap in understanding cellular heterogeneity. We sought to address this gap by employing lab technologies to design a detailed protocol, termed Spatiotemporal Genomic and Cellular Analysis (SaGA), for the precise imaging-based selection, isolation, and expansion of phenotypically distinct live cells. This protocol requires cells expressing a photoconvertible fluorescent protein and employs live cell confocal microscopy to photoconvert a user-defined single cell or set of cells displaying a phenotype of interest. The total population is then extracted from its microenvironment, and the optically highlighted cells are isolated using fluorescence activated cell sorting. SaGA-isolated cells can then be subjected to multi-omics analysis or cellular propagation for in vitro or in vivo studies. This protocol can be applied to a variety of conditions, creating protocol flexibility for user-specific research interests. The SaGA technique can be accomplished in one workday by non-specialists and results in a phenotypically defined cellular subpopulations for integration with multi-omics techniques. We envision this approach providing multi-dimensional datasets exploring the relationship between live cell phenotypes and multi-omic heterogeneity within normal and diseased cellular populations.",37819930,PMC10566726,10.1371/journal.pone.0292554,1,PloS one,101285081,3.752
Estimating gene expression from DNA methylation and copy number variation: A deep learning regression model for multi-omics integration,"Gene expression analysis plays a significant role for providing molecular insights in cancer. Various genetic and epigenetic factors (being dealt under multi-omics) affect gene expression giving rise to cancer phenotypes. A recent growth in understanding of multi-omics seems to provide a resource for integration in interdisciplinary biology since they altogether can draw the comprehensive picture of an organism's developmental and disease biology in cancers. Such large scale multi-omics data can be obtained from public consortium like The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and several other platforms. Integrating these multi-omics data from varied platforms is still challenging due to high noise and sensitivity of the platforms used. Currently, a robust integrative predictive model to estimate gene expression from these genetic and epigenetic data is lacking. In this study, we have developed a deep learning-based predictive model using Deep Denoising Auto-encoder (DDAE) and Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) that can quantitatively capture how genetic and epigenetic alterations correlate with directionality of gene expression for liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC). The DDAE used in the study has been trained to extract significant features from the input omics data to estimate the gene expression. These features have then been used for back-propagation learning by the multilayer perceptron for the task of regression and classification. We have benchmarked the proposed model against state-of-the-art regression models. Finally, the deep learning-based integration model has been evaluated for its disease classification capability, where an accuracy of 95.1% has been obtained.",32234433,,10.1016/j.ygeno.2020.03.021,16,Genomics,8800135,4.31
Machine Learning Identifies Robust Matrisome Markers and Regulatory Mechanisms in Cancer,"The expression and regulation of matrisome genes-the ensemble of extracellular matrix, ECM, ECM-associated proteins and regulators as well as cytokines, chemokines and growth factors-is of paramount importance for many biological processes and signals within the tumor microenvironment. The availability of large and diverse multi-omics data enables mapping and understanding of the regulatory circuitry governing the tumor matrisome to an unprecedented level, though such a volume of information requires robust approaches to data analysis and integration. In this study, we show that combining Pan-Cancer expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) with genomics, epigenomics and microenvironmental features from TCGA and other sources enables the identification of ""landmark"" matrisome genes and machine learning-based reconstruction of their regulatory networks in 74 clinical and molecular subtypes of human cancers and approx. 6700 patients. These results, enriched for prognostic genes and cross-validated markers at the protein level, unravel the role of genetic and epigenetic programs in governing the tumor matrisome and allow the prioritization of tumor-specific matrisome genes (and their regulators) for the development of novel therapeutic approaches.",33266472,PMC7700160,10.3390/ijms21228837,5,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,6.208
Unraveling plant-microbe interactions: can integrated omics approaches offer concrete answers?,"Advances in high throughput omics techniques provide avenues to decipher plant microbiomes. However, there is limited information on how integrated informatics can help provide deeper insights into plant-microbe interactions in a concerted way. Integrating multi-omics datasets can transform our understanding of the plant microbiome from unspecified genetic influences on interacting species to specific gene-by-gene interactions. Here, we highlight recent progress and emerging strategies in crop microbiome omics research and review key aspects of how the integration of host and microbial omics-based datasets can be used to provide a comprehensive outline of complex crop-microbe interactions. We describe how these technological advances have helped unravel crucial plant and microbial genes and pathways that control beneficial, pathogenic, and commensal plant-microbe interactions. We identify crucial knowledge gaps and synthesize current limitations in our understanding of crop microbiome omics approaches. We highlight recent studies in which multi-omics-based approaches have led to improved models of crop microbial community structure and function. Finally, we recommend holistic approaches in integrating host and microbial omics datasets to achieve precision and efficiency in data analysis, which is crucial for biotic and abiotic stress control and in understanding the contribution of the microbiota in shaping plant fitness.",37950741,PMC10901211,10.1093/jxb/erad448,1,Journal of experimental botany,9882906,7.298
GAGAM v1.2: An Improvement on Peak Labeling and Genomic Annotated Gene Activity Matrix Construction,"Single-cell Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (scATAC-seq) is rapidly becoming a powerful technology for assessing the epigenetic landscape of thousands of cells. However, the sparsity of the resulting data poses significant challenges to their interpretability and informativeness. Different computational methods are available, proposing ways to generate significant features from accessibility data and process them to obtain meaningful results. Foremost among them is the peak calling, which interprets the raw scATAC-seq data generating the peaks as features. However, scATAC-seq data are not trivially comparable with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, an increasingly pressing challenge since the necessity of multimodal experiments integration. For this reason, this study wants to improve the concept of the Gene Activity Matrix (GAM), which links the accessibility data to the genes, by proposing an improved version of the Genomic-Annotated Gene Activity Matrix (GAGAM) concept. Specifically, this paper presents GAGAM v1.2, a new and better version of GAGAM v1.0. GAGAM aims to label the peaks and link them to the genes through functional annotation of the whole genome. Using genes as features in scATAC-seq datasets makes different datasets comparable and allows linking gene accessibility and expression. This link is crucial for gene regulation understanding and fundamental for the increasing impact of multi-omics data. Results confirm that our method performs better than the previous GAMs and shows a preliminary comparison with scRNA-seq data.",36672856,PMC9858924,10.3390/genes14010115,3,Genes,101551097,4.141
Agronomic Linked Data (AgroLD): A knowledge-based system to enable integrative biology in agronomy,"Recent advances in high-throughput technologies have resulted in a tremendous increase in the amount of omics data produced in plant science. This increase, in conjunction with the heterogeneity and variability of the data, presents a major challenge to adopt an integrative research approach. We are facing an urgent need to effectively integrate and assimilate complementary datasets to understand the biological system as a whole. The Semantic Web offers technologies for the integration of heterogeneous data and their transformation into explicit knowledge thanks to ontologies. We have developed the Agronomic Linked Data (AgroLD- www.agrold.org), a knowledge-based system relying on Semantic Web technologies and exploiting standard domain ontologies, to integrate data about plant species of high interest for the plant science community e.g., rice, wheat, arabidopsis. We present some integration results of the project, which initially focused on genomics, proteomics and phenomics. AgroLD is now an RDF (Resource Description Format) knowledge base of 100M triples created by annotating and integrating more than 50 datasets coming from 10 data sources-such as Gramene.org and TropGeneDB-with 10 ontologies-such as the Gene Ontology and Plant Trait Ontology. Our evaluation results show users appreciate the multiple query modes which support different use cases. AgroLD's objective is to offer a domain specific knowledge platform to solve complex biological and agronomical questions related to the implication of genes/proteins in, for instances, plant disease resistance or high yield traits. We expect the resolution of these questions to facilitate the formulation of new scientific hypotheses to be validated with a knowledge-oriented approach.",30500839,PMC6269127,10.1371/journal.pone.0198270,7,PloS one,101285081,3.752

SVExpress: identifying gene features altered recurrently in expression with nearby structural variant breakpoints,"Background:Combined whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and RNA sequencing of cancers offer the opportunity to identify genes with altered expression due to genomic rearrangements. Somatic structural variants (SVs), as identified by WGS, can involve altered gene cis-regulation, gene fusions, copy number alterations, or gene disruption. The absence of computational tools to streamline integrative analysis steps may represent a barrier in identifying genes recurrently altered by genomic rearrangement.Results:Here, we introduce SVExpress, a set of tools for carrying out integrative analysis of SV and gene expression data. SVExpress enables systematic cataloging of genes that consistently show increased or decreased expression in conjunction with the presence of nearby SV breakpoints. SVExpress can evaluate breakpoints in proximity to genes for potential enhancer translocation events or disruption of topologically associated domains, two mechanisms by which SVs may deregulate genes. The output from any commonly used SV calling algorithm may be easily adapted for use with SVExpress. SVExpress can readily analyze genomic datasets involving hundreds of cancer sample profiles. Here, we used SVExpress to analyze SV and expression data across 327 cancer cell lines with combined SV and expression data in the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE). In the CCLE dataset, hundreds of genes showed altered gene expression in relation to nearby SV breakpoints. Altered genes involved TAD disruption, enhancer hijacking, and gene fusions. When comparing the top set of SV-altered genes from cancer cell lines with the top SV-altered genes previously reported for human tumors from The Cancer Genome Atlas and the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes datasets, a significant number of genes overlapped in the same direction for both cell lines and tumors, while some genes were significant for cell lines but not for human tumors and vice versa.Conclusion:Our SVExpress tools allow computational biologists with a working knowledge of R to integrate gene expression with SV breakpoint data to identify recurrently altered genes. SVExpress is freely available for academic or commercial use at https://github.com/chadcreighton/SVExpress . SVExpress is implemented as a set of Excel macros and R code.

Integration of multi-omics data of a genome-reduced bacterium: Prevalence of post-transcriptional regulation and its correlation with protein abundances,"We developed a comprehensive resource for the genome-reduced bacterium Mycoplasma pneumoniae comprising 1748 consistently generated '-omics' data sets, and used it to quantify the power of antisense non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), lysine acetylation, and protein phosphorylation in predicting protein abundance (11%, 24% and 8%, respectively). These factors taken together are four times more predictive of the proteome abundance than of mRNA abundance. In bacteria, post-translational modifications (PTMs) and ncRNA transcription were both found to increase with decreasing genomic GC-content and genome size. Thus, the evolutionary forces constraining genome size and GC-content modify the relative contributions of the different regulatory layers to proteome homeostasis, and impact more genomic and genetic features than previously appreciated. Indeed, these scaling principles will enable us to develop more informed approaches when engineering minimal synthetic genomes.",26773059,PMC4756857,10.1093/nar/gkw004,17,Nucleic acids research,411011,19.16
A systematic comparison of chloroplast genome assembly tools,"Background:Chloroplasts are intracellular organelles that enable plants to conduct photosynthesis. They arose through the symbiotic integration of a prokaryotic cell into an eukaryotic host cell and still contain their own genomes with distinct genomic information. Plastid genomes accommodate essential genes and are regularly utilized in biotechnology or phylogenetics. Different assemblers that are able to assess the plastid genome have been developed. These assemblers often use data of whole genome sequencing experiments, which usually contain reads from the complete chloroplast genome.Results:The performance of different assembly tools has never been systematically compared. Here, we present a benchmark of seven chloroplast assembly tools, capable of succeeding in more than 60% of known real data sets. Our results show significant differences between the tested assemblers in terms of generating whole chloroplast genome sequences and computational requirements. The examination of 105 data sets from species with unknown plastid genomes leads to the assembly of 20 novel chloroplast genomes.Conclusions:We create docker images for each tested tool that are freely available for the scientific community and ensure reproducibility of the analyses. These containers allow the analysis and screening of data sets for chloroplast genomes using standard computational infrastructure. Thus, large scale screening for chloroplasts within genomic sequencing data is feasible.",32988404,PMC7520963,10.1186/s13059-020-02153-6,32,Genome biology,100960660,17.906
"Metabolomics and Proteomics in Prostate Cancer Research: Overview, Analytical Techniques, Data Analysis, and Recent Clinical Applications","Prostate cancer (PCa) is a significant global contributor to mortality, predominantly affecting males aged 65 and above. The field of omics has recently gained traction due to its capacity to provide profound insights into the biochemical mechanisms underlying conditions like prostate cancer. This involves the identification and quantification of low-molecular-weight metabolites and proteins acting as crucial biochemical signals for early detection, therapy assessment, and target identification. A spectrum of analytical methods is employed to discern and measure these molecules, revealing their altered biological pathways within diseased contexts. Metabolomics and proteomics generate refined data subjected to detailed statistical analysis through sophisticated software, yielding substantive insights.

Multiomics data analyses to identify SLC25A17 as a novel biomarker to predict the prognosis and immune microenvironment in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,"Objective:This study aims to explore the predictive value of SLC25A17 in the prognosis and tumor microenvironment (TME) of patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and to provide ideas for individual clinical treatment.Methods:A pancancer analysis of the differential expression of SLC25A17 among different tumors was first conducted via the TIMER 2.0 database. Subsequently, the expression of SLC25A17 and related clinical information of HNSCC patients were obtained from the TCGA database, and patients were divided into two groups according to the median value of SLC25A17 expression. K‒M survival analysis was conducted to compare the overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) between the groups. The Wilcoxon test was used to compare the distribution of SLC25A17 in different clinical characteristics, and univariate Cox and multivariate Cox analyses were performed to analyze independent prognostic factors to establish a predictive nomogram. Calibration curves were generated to verify the reliability of predicting 1-year, 3-year and 5-year survival rates and another cohort (GSE65858) was used for external validation. Gene set enrichment analysis was conducted to compare the enriched pathways, and the immune microenvironment was assessed using the CIBERSORT and estimate packages. Furthermore, the expression levels of SLC25A17 in immune cells were also analyzed with single-cell RNA-seq via the TISCH. Moreover, the immunotherapeutic response and chemotherapy drug sensitivity were compared between the two groups to guide precise treatment. The TIDE database was applied to predict the possibility of immune escape in the TCGA-HNSC cohort.Results:Compared with normal samples, the expression of SLC25A17 was much higher in HNSCC tumor samples. For patients with high SLC25A17 expression, the OS and PFS were shorter than those with low SLC25A17 expression, indicating a worse prognosis. The expression of SLC25A17 varied in different clinical features. Univariate Cox and multivariate COX analyses showed that SLC25A17, age, and lymph node metastasis are independent prognostic risk factors for HNSCC, and the survival prediction model based on these factors had reliable predictive value. Patients in the low-expression group exhibited more immune cell infiltration, higher TME scores, higher IPS scores and lower TIDE scores than those in the high-expression groups, suggesting better immunotherapeutic response with lower SLC25A17 expression. Moreover, patients in the high-expression group were more sensitive to chemotherapy.Conclusions:SLC25A17 can effectively predict the prognosis of HNSCC patients and could be a precise individual-targeted indicator for the treatment of HNSCC patients.",37386359,PMC10308725,10.1186/s12859-023-05399-6,1,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,3.307
Predictive biomarkers for type 2 of diabetes mellitus: Bridging the gap between systems research and personalized medicine,"The global incidence of metabolic disorders like type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) has assumed epidemic proportions, leading to adverse health and socio-economic impacts. It is therefore of critical importance the early diagnosis of DM2 patients and the detection of those at increased risk of disease. In this respect, Precision Medicine (PM) is an emerging approach that includes practices, tests, decisions and treatments adapted to the characteristics of each patient. With regard to DM2, PM manages a wealth of ""omics"" data (genomic, metabolic, proteomic, environmental, clinical and paraclinical) to increase the number of clinically validated biomarkers in order to identify patients in early stage even before the prediabetic phase.Significance:In this paper, we discuss the epidemic dimension of metabolic disorders like type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) and the urgent demand for novel biomarkers to reduce the incidence or even delay the onset of DM2. Recent research data produced by ""multi-omics"" technologies (genomics/epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics), suggest that many potential biomarkers might be helpful in the prediction and early diagnosis of DM2. Predictive, Preventive and Personalized Medicine (PPPM) manages and integrates these data to apply personalized, preventive, and therapeutic approaches.

Integration of multi-omics approaches for functional characterization of muscle related selective sweep genes in Nanchukmacdon,"Pig as a food source serves daily dietary demand to a wide population around the world. Preference of meat depends on various factors with muscle play the central role. In this regards, selective breeding abled us to develop ""Nanchukmacdon"" a pig breeds with an enhanced variety of meat and high fertility rate. To identify genomic regions under selection we performed whole-genome resequencing, transcriptome, and whole-genome bisulfite sequencing from Nanchukmacdon muscles samples and used published data for three other breeds such as Landrace, Duroc, Jeju native pig and analyzed the functional characterization of candidate genes. In this study, we present a comprehensive approach to identify candidate genes by using multi-omics approaches. We performed two different methods XP-EHH, XP-CLR to identify traces of artificial selection for traits of economic importance. Moreover, RNAseq analysis was done to identify differentially expressed genes in the crossed breed population. Several genes (UGT8, ZGRF1, NDUFA10, EBF3, ELN, UBE2L6, NCALD, MELK, SERP2, GDPD5, and FHL2) were identified as selective sweep and differentially expressed in muscles related pathways. Furthermore, nucleotide diversity analysis revealed low genetic diversity in Nanchukmacdon for identified genes in comparison to related breeds and whole-genome bisulfite sequencing data shows the critical role of DNA methylation pattern in identified genes that leads to enhanced variety of meat.

An in-depth comparison of linear and non-linear joint embedding methods for bulk and single-cell multi-omics,"Multi-omic analyses are necessary to understand the complex biological processes taking place at the tissue and cell level, but also to make reliable predictions about, for example, disease outcome. Several linear methods exist that create a joint embedding using paired information per sample, but recently there has been a rise in the popularity of neural architectures that embed paired -omics into the same non-linear manifold. This work describes a head-to-head comparison of linear and non-linear joint embedding methods using both bulk and single-cell multi-modal datasets. We found that non-linear methods have a clear advantage with respect to linear ones for missing modality imputation. Performance comparisons in the downstream tasks of survival analysis for bulk tumor data and cell type classification for single-cell data lead to the following insights: First, concatenating the principal components of each modality is a competitive baseline and hard to beat if all modalities are available at test time. However, if we only have one modality available at test time, training a predictive model on the joint space of that modality can lead to performance improvements with respect to just using the unimodal principal components. Second, -omic profiles imputed by neural joint embedding methods are realistic enough to be used by a classifier trained on real data with limited performance drops. Taken together, our comparisons give hints to which joint embedding to use for which downstream task. Overall, product-of-experts performed well in most tasks and was reasonably fast, while early integration (concatenation) of modalities did quite poorly.",38018908,PMC10685331,10.1093/bib/bbad416,0,Briefings in bioinformatics,100912837,13.994

Non-invasive continuous blood pressure prediction based on ECG and PPG fusion map,"To achieve real-time blood pressure monitoring, a novel non-invasive method is proposed in this article. Electrocardiographic (ECG) and pulse wave signals (PPG) are fused from a multi-omics signal-level perspective.

The results demonstrate the efficacy of the fusion map model, with correlation values of 0.988 and 0.991 between the estimated BPBL and the true systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), respectively. The root mean square errors for SBP and DBP were 3.21 mmHg and 3.00 mmHg, respectively. The model validation showed that the fusion map method is capable of simultaneous highlighting of the respective characteristics of ECG and PPG and their correlation, improving the utilization of the information and the accuracy of BPBL.

A framework for identifying dysregulated chromatin regulators as master regulators in human cancer,"Motivation:Chromatin regulators (CRs) are frequently dysregulated to reprogram the epigenetic landscape of the cancer genome. However, the underpinnings of the dysregulation of CRs and their downstream effectors remain to be elucidated.Results:Here, we designed an integrated framework based on multi-omics data to identify candidate master regulatory CRs affected by genomic alterations across eight cancer types in The Cancer Genome Atlas. Most of them showed consistent activated or repressed (i.e. oncogenic or tumor-suppressive) roles in cancer initiation and progression. In order to further explore the insight mechanism of the dysregulated CRs, we developed an R package ModReg based on differential connectivity to identify CRs as modulators of transcription factors (TFs) involved in tumorigenesis. Our analysis revealed that the connectivity between TFs and their target genes (TGs) tended to be disrupted in the patients who had a high expression of oncogenic CRs or low-expression of tumor-suppressive CRs. As a proof-of-principle study, 14 (82.4%) of the top-ranked 17 driver CRs in liver cancer were able to be validated by literature mining or experiments including shRNA knockdown and dCas9-based epigenetic editing. Moreover, we confirmed that CR SIRT7 physically interacted with TF NFE2L2, and positively modulated the transcriptional program of NFE2L2 by affecting ∼64% of its TGs.Availability and implementation:ModReg is freely accessible at http://cis.hku.hk/software/ModReg.tar.gz.Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",30358822,,10.1093/bioinformatics/bty836,2,"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",9808944,6.931

Exploring the mechanism of Celastrol in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis based on systems pharmacology and multi-omics,"To explore the molecular network mechanism of Celastrol in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) based on a novel strategy (integrated systems pharmacology, proteomics, transcriptomics and single-cell transcriptomics). Firstly, the potential targets of Celastrol and RA genes were predicted through the database, and the Celastrol-RA targets were obtained by taking the intersection. Then, transcriptomic data and proteomic data of Celastrol treatment of RA were collected. Subsequently, Celastrol-RA targets, differentially expressed genes, and differentially expressed proteins were imported into Metascape for enrichment analysis, and related networks were constructed. Finally, the core targets of Celastrol-RA targets, differentially expressed genes, and differentially expressed proteins were mapped to synoviocytes of RA mice to find potential cell populations for Celastrol therapy. A total of 195 Celastrol-RA targets, 2068 differential genes, 294 differential proteins were obtained. The results of enrichment analysis showed that these targets, genes and proteins were mainly related to extracellular matrix organization, TGF-β signaling pathway, etc. The results of single cell sequencing showed that the main clusters of these targets, genes, and proteins could be mapped to RA synovial cells. For example, Mmp9 was mainly distributed in Hematopoietic cells, especially in Ptprn+fibroblast. The results of molecular docking also suggested that Celastrol could stably combine with molecules predicted by network pharmacology. In conclusion, this study used systems pharmacology, transcriptomics, proteomics, single-cell transcriptomics to reveal that Celastrol may regulate the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway by regulating key targets such as TNF and IL6, and then play an immune regulatory role.",38238321,PMC10796403,10.1038/s41598-023-48248-5,1,Scientific reports,101563288,4.996
Maize Feature Store: A centralized resource to manage and analyze curated maize multi-omics features for machine learning applications,"The big-data analysis of complex data associated with maize genomes accelerates genetic research and improves agronomic traits. As a result, efforts have increased to integrate diverse datasets and extract meaning from these measurements. Machine learning models are a powerful tool for gaining knowledge from large and complex datasets. However, these models must be trained on high-quality features to succeed. Currently, there are no solutions to host maize multi-omics datasets with end-to-end solutions for evaluating and linking features to target gene annotations. Our work presents the Maize Feature Store (MFS), a versatile application that combines features built on complex data to facilitate exploration, modeling and analysis. Feature stores allow researchers to rapidly deploy machine learning applications by managing and providing access to frequently used features. We populated the MFS for the maize reference genome with over 14 000 gene-based features based on published genomic, transcriptomic, epigenomic, variomic and proteomics datasets. Using the MFS, we created an accurate pan-genome classification model with an AUC-ROC score of 0.87. The MFS is publicly available through the maize genetics and genomics database.

QuanTP: A Software Resource for Quantitative Proteo-Transcriptomic Comparative Data Analysis and Informatics,"Next-generation sequencing technologies, coupled to advances in mass-spectrometry-based proteomics, have facilitated system-wide quantitative profiling of expressed mRNA transcripts and proteins. Proteo-transcriptomic analysis compares the relative abundance levels of transcripts and their corresponding proteins, illuminating discordant gene product responses to perturbations. These results reveal potential post-transcriptional regulation, providing researchers with important new insights into underlying biological and pathological disease mechanisms. To carry out proteo-transcriptomic analysis, researchers require software that statistically determines transcript-protein abundance correlation levels and provides results visualization and interpretation functionality, ideally within a flexible, user-friendly platform. As a solution, we have developed the QuanTP software within the Galaxy platform. The software offers a suite of tools and functionalities critical for proteo-transcriptomics, including statistical algorithms for assessing the correlation between single transcript-protein pairs as well as across two cohorts, outlier identification and clustering, along with a diverse set of results visualizations. It is compatible with analyses of results from single experiment data or from a two-cohort comparison of aggregated replicate experiments. The tool is available in the Galaxy Tool Shed through a cloud-based instance and a Docker container. In all, QuanTP provides an accessible and effective software resource, which should enable new multiomic discoveries from quantitative proteo-transcriptomic data sets.",30582332,,10.1021/acs.jproteome.8b00727,2,Journal of proteome research,101128775,5.37
moSCminer: a cell subtype classification framework based on the attention neural network integrating the single-cell multi-omics dataset on the cloud,"Single-cell omics sequencing has rapidly advanced, enabling the quantification of diverse omics profiles at a single-cell resolution. To facilitate comprehensive biological insights, such as cellular differentiation trajectories, precise annotation of cell subtypes is essential. Conventional methods involve clustering cells and manually assigning subtypes based on canonical markers, a labor-intensive and expert-dependent process. Hence, an automated computational prediction framework is crucial. While several classification frameworks for predicting cell subtypes from single-cell RNA sequencing datasets exist, these methods solely rely on single-omics data, offering insights at a single molecular level. They often miss inter-omic correlations and a holistic understanding of cellular processes. To address this, the integration of multi-omics datasets from individual cells is essential for accurate subtype annotation. This article introduces moSCminer, a novel framework for classifying cell subtypes that harnesses the power of single-cell multi-omics sequencing datasets through an attention-based neural network operating at the omics level. By integrating three distinct omics datasets-gene expression, DNA methylation, and DNA accessibility-while accounting for their biological relationships, moSCminer excels at learning the relative significance of each omics feature. It then transforms this knowledge into a novel representation for cell subtype classification. Comparative evaluations against standard machine learning-based classifiers demonstrate moSCminer's superior performance, consistently achieving the highest average performance on real datasets. The efficacy of multi-omics integration is further corroborated through an in-depth analysis of the omics-level attention module, which identifies potential markers for cell subtype annotation. To enhance accessibility and scalability, moSCminer is accessible as a user-friendly web-based platform seamlessly connected to a cloud system, publicly accessible at http://203.252.206.118:5568. Notably, this study marks the pioneering integration of three single-cell multi-omics datasets for cell subtype identification.",38426141,PMC10903350,10.7717/peerj.17006,0,PeerJ,101603425,3.061
"GSCA: an integrated platform for gene set cancer analysis at genomic, pharmacogenomic and immunogenomic levels","Cancer initiation and progression are likely caused by the dysregulation of biological pathways. Gene set analysis (GSA) could improve the signal-to-noise ratio and identify potential biological insights on the gene set level. However, platforms exploring cancer multi-omics data using GSA methods are lacking. In this study, we upgraded our GSCALite to GSCA (gene set cancer analysis, http://bioinfo.life.hust.edu.cn/GSCA) for cancer GSA at genomic, pharmacogenomic and immunogenomic levels. In this improved GSCA, we integrated expression, mutation, drug sensitivity and clinical data from four public data sources for 33 cancer types. We introduced useful features to GSCA, including associations between immune infiltration with gene expression and genomic variations, and associations between gene set expression/mutation and clinical outcomes. GSCA has four main functional modules for cancer GSA to explore, analyze and visualize expression, genomic variations, tumor immune infiltration, drug sensitivity and their associations with clinical outcomes. We used case studies of three gene sets: (i) seven cell cycle genes, (ii) tumor suppressor genes of PI3K pathway and (iii) oncogenes of PI3K pathway to prove the advantage of GSCA over single gene analysis. We found novel associations of gene set expression and mutation with clinical outcomes in different cancer types on gene set level, while on single gene analysis level, they are not significant associations. In conclusion, GSCA is a user-friendly web server and a useful resource for conducting hypothesis tests by using GSA methods at genomic, pharmacogenomic and immunogenomic levels.",36549921,,10.1093/bib/bbac558,76,Briefings in bioinformatics,100912837,13.994
Changes in the liver of Tinca tinca under successive domestication using an integrated multi-omics approach,"Domestication is the process of modifying the phenotype of a population through anthropic selection from human perspectives. Successive generations of domestication have influenced the physiological characteristics of tench Tinca tinca. In current study, we investigated gene and protein expression alterations in the liver of fifth-generation (F5). A total of 420 genes were found to be upregulated and 351 genes were downregulated, while 410 proteins were upregulated and 279 proteins were downregulated in domesticated T. tinca (DT). The integrated analysis of omics data revealed a total of 55 genes/proteins exhibiting consistent upregulation and 12 genes/proteins displaying consistent downregulation in DT. The upregulated genes/proteins in DT, such as SSR1, DERLIN2, OS9, DNAJB11, and HYOU1, exhibit enrichment in the protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum pathway. Additionally, upregulated genes/proteins such as IL2RB, F13B, and IRF3 are associated with immune response. Conversely, downregulated genes/proteins in DT, including HSD11B1, CYP24A1, and COMT, play roles in hormone metabolism. These findings indicate that domestication can have a substantial impact on the physiological modifications related to protein processing, immune response, and hormone metabolism in DT. These adaptations potentially enhance their ability to thrive in artificial aquaculture environments, leading to improved growth and development. The exploration of genetic changes in DT will not only improve aquaculture practices but also provide significant insights into the broader process of domestication and its effects on physiological functions.",37354750,,10.1016/j.cbd.2023.101107,0,"Comparative biochemistry and physiology.

Multi-Omics Driven Assembly and Annotation of the Sandalwood (Santalum album) Genome,"Indian sandalwood (Santalum album) is an important tropical evergreen tree known for its fragrant heartwood-derived essential oil and its valuable carving wood. Here, we applied an integrated genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic approach to assemble and annotate the Indian sandalwood genome. Our genome sequencing resulted in the establishment of a draft map of the smallest genome for any woody tree species to date (221 Mb). The genome annotation predicted 38,119 protein-coding genes and 27.42% repetitive DNA elements. In-depth proteome analysis revealed the identities of 72,325 unique peptides, which confirmed 10,076 of the predicted genes. The addition of transcriptomic and proteogenomic approaches resulted in the identification of 53 novel proteins and 34 gene-correction events that were missed by genomic approaches. Proteogenomic analysis also helped in reassigning 1,348 potential noncoding RNAs as bona fide protein-coding messenger RNAs. Gene expression patterns at the RNA and protein levels indicated that peptide sequencing was useful in capturing proteins encoded by nuclear and organellar genomes alike. Mass spectrometry-based proteomic evidence provided an unbiased approach toward the identification of proteins encoded by organellar genomes. Such proteins are often missed in transcriptome data sets due to the enrichment of only messenger RNAs that contain poly(A) tails. Overall, the use of integrated omic approaches enhanced the quality of the assembly and annotation of this nonmodel plant genome. The availability of genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data will enhance genomics-assisted breeding, germplasm characterization, and conservation of sandalwood trees.",29440596,PMC5884603,10.1104/pp.17.01764,15,Plant physiology,401224,8.005
The Widespread Occurrence and Potential Biological Roles of Endogenous Viral Elements in Insect Genomes,"Modern genomic sequencing and bioinformatics approaches have detected numerous examples of DNA sequences derived from DNA and RNA virus genomes integrated into both vertebrate and insect genomes. Retroviruses encode RNA-dependent DNA polymerases (reverse transcriptases) and integrases that convert their RNA viral genomes into DNA proviruses and facilitate proviral DNA integration into the host genome. Surprisingly, DNA sequences derived from RNA viruses that do not encode these enzymes also occur in host genomes. Non-retroviral integrated RNA virus sequences (NIRVS) occur at relatively high frequency in the genomes of the arboviral vectorsAedes aegyptiandAedes albopictus, are not distributed randomly and possibly contribute to mosquito antiviral immunity, suggesting these mosquitoes could serve as a model system for unravelling the function of NIRVS. Here we address the following questions: What drives DNA synthesis from the genomes of non-retroviral RNA viruses? How does integration of virus cDNA into host DNA occur, and what is its biological function (if any)? We review current knowledge of viral integrations in insect genomes, hypothesize mechanisms of NIRVS formation and their potential impact on insect biology, particularly antiviral immunity, and suggest directions for future research.",31167954,,10.21775/cimb.034.013,26,Current issues in molecular biology,100931761,2.976
"Single-cell multiomics revealed the dynamics of antigen presentation, immune response and T cell activation in the COVID-19 positive and recovered individuals","Introduction:Despite numerous efforts to describe COVID-19's immunological landscape, there is still a gap in our understanding of the virus's infections after-effects, especially in the recovered patients. This would be important to understand as we now have huge number of global populations infected by the SARS-CoV-2 as well as variables inclusive of VOCs, reinfections, and vaccination breakthroughs. Furthermore, single-cell transcriptome alone is often insufficient to understand the complex human host immune landscape underlying differential disease severity and clinical outcome.Methods:By combining single-cell multi-omics (Whole Transcriptome Analysis plus Antibody-seq) and machine learning-based analysis, we aim to better understand the functional aspects of cellular and immunological heterogeneity in the COVID-19 positive, recovered and the healthy individuals.Results:Based on single-cell transcriptome and surface marker study of 163,197 cells (124,726 cells after data QC) from the 33 individuals (healthy=4, COVID-19 positive=16, and COVID-19 recovered=13), we observed a reduced MHC Class-I-mediated antigen presentation and dysregulated MHC Class-II-mediated antigen presentation in the COVID-19 patients, with restoration of the process in the recovered individuals. B-cell maturation process was also impaired in the positive and the recovered individuals. Importantly, we discovered that a subset of the naive T-cells from the healthy individuals were absent from the recovered individuals, suggesting a post-infection inflammatory stage. Both COVID-19 positive patients and the recovered individuals exhibited a CD40-CD40LG-mediated inflammatory response in the monocytes and T-cell subsets. T-cells, NK-cells, and monocyte-mediated elevation of immunological, stress and antiviral responses were also seen in the COVID-19 positive and the recovered individuals, along with an abnormal T-cell activation, inflammatory response, and faster cellular transition of T cell subtypes in the COVID-19 patients. Importantly, above immune findings were used for a Bayesian network model, which significantly revealedFOS, CXCL8, IL1β, CST3, PSAP, CD45andCD74as COVID-19 severity predictors.Discussion:In conclusion, COVID-19 recovered individuals exhibited a hyper-activated inflammatory response with the loss of B cell maturation, suggesting an impeded post-infection stage, necessitating further research to delineate the dynamic immune response associated with the COVID-19. To our knowledge this is first multi-omic study trying to understand the differential and dynamic immune response underlying the sample subtypes.",36532041,PMC9755500,10.3389/fimmu.2022.1034159,4,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,8.786
Multilevel prioritization of gene regulators associated with consensus molecular subtypes of colorectal cancer,"Consensus molecular subtypes (CMSs) are emerging as critical factor for prognosis and treatment of colorectal cancer. Gene regulators, including chromatin regulator, RNA-binding protein and transcriptional factor, are critical modulators of cancer hallmark, yet little is known regarding the underlying functional mechanism in CMSs. Herein, we identified a core set of 235 functional gene regulators (FGRs) by integrating genome, epigenome, transcriptome and interactome of CMSs. FGRs exhibited significant multi-omics alterations and impacts on cell lines growth, as well as significantly enriched cancer driver genes and pathways. Moreover, common FGRs played different roles in the context of CMSs. In accordance with the immune characteristics of CMSs, we found that the anti-tumor immune pathways were mainly activated by FGRs (e.g. STAT1 and CREBBP) in CMS1, while inhibited by FGRs in CMS2-4. FGRs mediated aberrant expression of ligands, which bind to receptor on immune cells, and modulated tumor immune microenvironment of subtypes. Intriguingly, systematic exploration of datasets using genomic and transcriptome co-similarity reveals the coordinated manner in FGRs act in CMSs to orchestrate their pathways and patients' prognosis. Expression signatures of the FGRs revealed an optimized CMS classifier, which demonstrated 88% concordance with the gold-standard classifier, but avoiding the influence of sample composition. Overall, our integrative analysis identified FGRs to regulate core tumorigenic processes/pathways across CMSs.",33855351,,10.1093/bib/bbab077,2,Briefings in bioinformatics,100912837,13.994
Integrated multi-omics analyses and genome-wide association studies reveal prime candidate genes of metabolic and vegetative growth variation in canola,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified thousands of genetic loci associated with complex plant traits, including many traits of agronomical importance. However, functional interpretation of GWAS results remains challenging because of large candidate regions due to linkage disequilibrium. High-throughput omics technologies, such as genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics open new avenues for integrative systems biological analyses and help to nominate systems information supported (prime) candidate genes. In the present study, we capitalise on a diverse canola population with 477 spring-type lines which was previously analysed by high-throughput phenotyping of growth-related traits and by RNA sequencing and metabolite profiling for multi-omics-based hybrid performance prediction. We deepened the phenotypic data analysis, now providing 123 time-resolved image-based traits, to gain insight into the complex relations during early vegetative growth and reanalysed the transcriptome data based on the latest Darmor-bzh v10 genome assembly. Genome-wide association testing revealed 61 298 robust quantitative trait loci (QTL) including 187 metabolite QTL, 56814 expression QTL and 4297 phenotypic QTL, many clustered in pronounced hotspots. Combining information about QTL colocalisation across omics layers and correlations between omics features allowed us to discover prime candidate genes for metabolic and vegetative growth variation. Prioritised candidate genes for early biomass accumulation include A06p05760.1_BnaDAR (PIAL1), A10p16280.1_BnaDAR, C07p48260.1_BnaDAR (PRL1) and C07p48510.1_BnaDAR (CLPR4).

"GenoVi, an open-source automated circular genome visualizer for bacteria and archaea","The increase in microbial sequenced genomes from pure cultures and metagenomic samples reflects the current attainability of whole-genome and shotgun sequencing methods. However, software for genome visualization still lacks automation, integration of different analyses, and customizable options for non-experienced users. In this study, we introduce GenoVi, a Python command-line tool able to create custom circular genome representations for the analysis and visualization of microbial genomes and sequence elements. It is designed to work with complete or draft genomes, featuring customizable options including 25 different built-in color palettes (including 5 color-blind safe palettes), text formatting options, and automatic scaling for complete genomes or sequence elements with more than one replicon/sequence. Using a Genbank format file as the input file or multiple files within a directory, GenoVi (i) visualizes genomic features from the GenBank annotation file, (ii) integrates a Cluster of Orthologs Group (COG) categories analysis using DeepNOG, (iii) automatically scales the visualization of each replicon of complete genomes or multiple sequence elements, (iv) and generates COG histograms, COG frequency heatmaps and output tables including general stats of each replicon or contig processed. GenoVi's potential was assessed by analyzing single and multiple genomes of Bacteria and Archaea. Paraburkholderia genomes were analyzed to obtain a fast classification of replicons in large multipartite genomes. GenoVi works as an easy-to-use command-line tool and provides customizable options to automatically generate genomic maps for scientific publications, educational resources, and outreach activities.

OnPLS-Based Multi-Block Data Integration: A Multivariate Approach to Interrogating Biological Interactions in Asthma,"Integration of multiomics data remains a key challenge in fulfilling the potential of comprehensive systems biology. Multiple-block orthogonal projections to latent structures (OnPLS) is a projection method that simultaneously models multiple data matrices, reducing feature space without relying on a priori biological knowledge. In order to improve the interpretability of OnPLS models, the associated multi-block variable influence on orthogonal projections (MB-VIOP) method is used to identify variables with the highest contribution to the model. This study combined OnPLS and MB-VIOP with interactive visualization methods to interrogate an exemplar multiomics study, using a subset of 22 individuals from an asthma cohort. Joint data structure in six data blocks was assessed: transcriptomics; metabolomics; targeted assays for sphingolipids, oxylipins, and fatty acids; and a clinical block including lung function, immune cell differentials, and cytokines. The model identified seven components, two of which had contributions from all blocks (globally joint structure) and five that had contributions from two to five blocks (locally joint structure). Components 1 and 2 were the most informative, identifying differences between healthy controls and asthmatics and a disease-sex interaction, respectively. The interactions between features selected by MB-VIOP were visualized using chord plots, yielding putative novel insights into asthma disease pathogenesis, the effects of asthma treatment, and biological roles of uncharacterized genes. For example, the gene ATP6 V1G1, which has been implicated in osteoporosis, correlated with metabolites that are dysregulated by inhaled corticoid steroids (ICS), providing insight into the mechanisms underlying bone density loss in asthma patients taking ICS. These results show the potential for OnPLS, combined with MB-VIOP variable selection and interaction visualization techniques, to generate hypotheses from multiomics studies and inform biology.",30335973,PMC6256348,10.1021/acs.analchem.8b03205,18,Analytical chemistry,370536,8.008
SysBiolPGWAS: simplifying post-GWAS analysis through the use of computational technologies and integration of diverse omics datasets,"Motivation:Post-genome-wide association studies (pGWAS) analysis is designed to decipher the functional consequences of significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the era of GWAS. This can be translated into research insights and clinical benefits such as the effectiveness of strategies for disease screening, treatment and prevention. However, the setup of pGWAS (pGWAS) tools can be quite complicated, and it mostly requires big data. The challenge however is, scientists are required to have sufficient experience with several of these technically complex and complicated tools in order to complete the pGWAS analysis.Results:We present SysBiolPGWAS, a pGWAS web application that provides a comprehensive functionality for biologists and non-bioinformaticians to conduct several pGWAS analyses to overcome the above challenges.

Systematic characterization of m6A proteomics across 12 cancer types: a multi-omics integration study,"The modification patterns ofN6-methyladenosine (m6A) regulators and interacting genes are deeply involved in tumors. However, the effect of m6A modification patterns on human proteomics remains largely unknown. We evaluated the molecular characteristics and clinical relevance of m6A modification proteomics patterns among 1013 pan-cancer samples from the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC). More than half of the m6A proteins were expressed at higher levels in tumor tissues and presented oncogenic characteristics. Furthermore, we performed multi-omics analyses integrating with transcriptomics data of m6A regulators and interactive coding and non-coding RNAs and developed a m6A multi-omics signature to identify potential m6A modification target proteins across global proteomics. It was significantly associated with overall survival in nine cancer types, tumor mutation burden (P= 0.01), and immune checkpoints includingPD-L1(P= 4.9 × 10-8) andPD-1(P< 0.01). We identified 51 novel proteins associated with the multi-omics signature (PFDR< 0.05). These proteins were functional through pathway enrichment analyses. The protein with the highest hit frequency was CHORDC1, which was significantly up-regulated in tumor tissues in nine cancer types. Its higher abundance was significantly associated with a poorer prognosis in seven cancer types. The identified m6A target proteins might provide infomation for the study of molecular mechanism of cancer.",37942799,,10.1039/d3mo00171g,0,Molecular omics,101713384,4.212

Integration of multi-omics analyses highlights the secondary metabolism response of tomato fruit to low temperature storage,"Inappropriate low temperature storage usually leads to quality deterioration of harvested tomato fruits. In this study, we performed comparative metabolome, transcriptome, and proteome analyses to comprehensively understand the effects of low temperature on metabolic changes in tomato fruit (fresh fruit, C0d; 4 °C 8 days, C8d; 4 °C 7 days and then 25 °C 1 day, C7dS1). Large amounts of secondary metabolites (including flavonoids and phenolic acids) increased after low temperature treatment. The overlap differentially accumulated metabolites in three comparative groups (C0d vs. C8d, C0d vs. C7dS1, C8d vs. C7dS1) were mainly flavonoid metabolites. A total of 1438 differentially expressed genes identified in these three comparative groups were primarily enriched in metabolic pathways and secondary metabolites biosynthesis pathways. Similarly, proteomic analysis showed that the differentially expressed proteins were enriched in the secondary metabolites biosynthesis and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathways. There was a strong correlation between changes in flavonoid metabolites and the expression of chalcone synthase (SlCHS), chalcone isomerase-like (SlCHIL), and coumarate 3-hydroxylase (SlC3H), which are involved in the phenylpropanoid and flavonoid biosynthesis. Additionally, seven differentially expressed MYB transcription factors were identified; SlMYB91, SlMYB106, and SlMYB70 strongly correlated with flavonoid biosynthesis structural genes after low temperature treatment. Other genes involved in fruit ripening and quality were also affected by low temperature. The data generated in this study may unravel the transcriptional regulatory network of secondary metabolism associated with low-temperature storage and provide a solid foundation for future studies.",37803628,,10.1016/j.foodres.2023.113316,0,"Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",9210143,7.425
Blazing Signature Filter: a library for fast pairwise similarity comparisons,"Background:Identifying similarities between datasets is a fundamental task in data mining and has become an integral part of modern scientific investigation. Whether the task is to identify co-expressed genes in large-scale expression surveys or to predict combinations of gene knockouts which would elicit a similar phenotype, the underlying computational task is often a multi-dimensional similarity test. As datasets continue to grow, improvements to the efficiency, sensitivity or specificity of such computation will have broad impacts as it allows scientists to more completely explore the wealth of scientific data.Results:The Blazing Signature Filter (BSF) is a highly efficient pairwise similarity algorithm which enables extensive data mining within a reasonable amount of time. The algorithm transforms datasets into binary metrics, allowing it to utilize the computationally efficient bit operators and provide a coarse measure of similarity. We demonstrate the utility of our algorithm using two common bioinformatics tasks: identifying data sets with similar gene expression profiles, and comparing annotated genomes.Conclusions:The BSF is a highly efficient pairwise similarity algorithm that can scale to billions of comparisons without the need for specialized hardware.",29890950,PMC6047367,10.1186/s12859-018-2210-6,3,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,3.307
Predicting functions of putative fungal sesquiterpene synthase genes based on multiomics data analysis,"Sesquiterpenes (STs) are secondary metabolites, which mediate biotic interactions between different organisms. Predicting the species-specific ST repertoires can contribute to deciphering the language of communication between organisms of the same or different species. High biochemical plasticity and catalytic promiscuity of sesquiterpene synthases (STSs), however, challenge the homology-based prediction of the STS functions. Using integrated analyses of genomic, transcriptomic, volatilomic, and metabolomic data, we predict product profiles for 116 out of 146 putative STS genes identified in the genomes of 30 fungal species from different trophic groups. Our prediction method is based on the observation that STSs encoded by genes closely related phylogenetically are likely to share the initial enzymatic reactions of the ST biosynthesis pathways and, therefore, produce STs via the same reaction route. The classification by reaction routes allows to assign STs known to be emitted by a particular species to the putative STS genes from this species. Gene expression information helps to further specify these ST-to-STS assignments. Validation of the computational predictions of the STS functions using both in silico and experimental approaches shows that integrated multiomic analyses are able to correctly link cyclic STs of non-cadalane type to genes. In the process of the experimental validation, we characterized catalytic properties of several putative STS genes from the mycorrhizal fungus Laccaria bicolor. We show that the STSs encoded by the L.bicolor mycorrhiza-induced genes emit either nerolidol or α-cuprenene and α-cuparene, and discuss the possible roles of these STs in the mycorrhiza formation.",36706978,,10.1016/j.fgb.2023.103779,5,Fungal genetics and biology : FG & B,9607601,3.883
"PearMODB: a multiomics database for pear (Pyrus) genomics, genetics and breeding study","Pear (Pyrus ssp.) belongs to Rosaceae and is an important fruit tree widely cultivated around the world. Currently, challenges to cope with the burgeoning sets of multiomics data are rapidly increasing. Here, we constructed the Pear Multiomics Database (PearMODB) by integrating genome, transcriptome, epigenome and population variation data, and aimed to provide a portal for accessing and analyzing pear multiomics data. A variety of online tools were built including gene search, BLAST, JBrowse, expression heatmap, synteny analysis and primer design. The information of DNA methylation sites and single-nucleotide polymorphisms can be retrieved through the custom JBrowse, providing an opportunity to explore the genetic polymorphisms linked to phenotype variation. Moreover, different gene families involving transcription factors, transcription regulators and disease resistance (nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat) were identified and compiled for quick search. In particular, biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) were identified in pear genomes, and specialized webpages were set up to show detailed information of BGCs, laying a foundation for studying metabolic diversity among different pear varieties. Overall, PearMODB provides an important platform for pear genomics, genetics and breeding studies.

EndoQuad: a comprehensive genome-wide experimentally validated endogenous G-quadruplex database,"G-quadruplexes (G4s) are non-canonical four-stranded structures and are emerging as novel genetic regulatory elements. However, a comprehensive genomic annotation of endogenous G4s (eG4s) and systematic characterization of their regulatory network are still lacking, posing major challenges for eG4 research. Here, we present EndoQuad (https://EndoQuad.chenzxlab.cn/) to address these pressing issues by integrating high-throughput experimental data. First, based on high-quality genome-wide eG4s mapping datasets (human: 1181; mouse: 24; chicken: 2) generated by G4 ChIP-seq/CUT&Tag, we generate a reference set of genome-wide eG4s. Our multi-omics analyses show that most eG4s are identified in one or a few cell types. The eG4s with higher occurrences across samples are more structurally stable, evolutionarily conserved, enriched in promoter regions, mark highly expressed genes and associate with complex regulatory programs, demonstrating higher confidence level for further experiments. Finally, we integrate millions of functional genomic variants and prioritize eG4s with regulatory functions in disease and cancer contexts. These efforts have culminated in the comprehensive and interactive database of experimentally validated DNA eG4s. As such, EndoQuad enables users to easily access, download and repurpose these data for their own research. EndoQuad will become a one-stop resource for eG4 research and lay the foundation for future functional studies.",37904589,PMC10767823,10.1093/nar/gkad966,0,Nucleic acids research,411011,19.16
Defining multiple layers of intratumor heterogeneity based on variations of perturbations in multi-omics profiling,"Background:Intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) plays a crucial role in tumor progression, relapse, immune evasion, and drug resistance. Existing ITH quantification methods based on a single molecular level are inadequate to capture ITH evolving from genotype to phenotype.Methods:We designed a set of information entropy (IE)-based algorithms for quantifying ITH at the genome (somatic copy number alterations and mutations), mRNA, microRNA (miRNA), long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), protein, and epigenome level, respectively. We evaluated the performance of these algorithms by analyzing the correlations between their ITH scores and ITH-associated molecular and clinical features in 33 TCGA cancer types. Moreover, we evaluated the correlations between the ITH measures at different molecular levels by Spearman correlation and clustering analysis.Results:The IE-based ITH measures had significant correlations with unfavorable prognosis, tumor progression, genomic instability, antitumor immunosuppression, and drug resistance. The mRNA ITH showed stronger correlations with the miRNA, lncRNA, and epigenome ITH than with the genome ITH, supporting the regulatory relationships of miRNA, lncRNA, and DNA methylation towards mRNA. The protein-level ITH displayed stronger correlations with the transcriptome-level ITH than with the genome-level ITH, supporting the central dogma of molecular biology. Clustering analysis based on the ITH scores identified four subtypes of pan-cancer showing significantly different prognosis. Finally, the ITH integrating the seven ITH measures displayed more prominent properties of ITH than that at a single level.Conclusions:This analysis provides landscapes of ITH at various molecular levels. Combining the ITH observation from different molecule levels will improve personalized management for cancer patients.",37099972,,10.1016/j.compbiomed.2023.106964,1,Computers in biology and medicine,1250250,6.698
"The burdock database: a multi-omic database for Arctium lappa, a food and medicinal plant","Background:Burdock is a biennial herb of Asteraceae found in Northern Europe, Eurasia, Siberia, and China. Its mature dry fruits, called Niu Bang Zi, are recorded in various traditional Chinese medicine books. With the development of sequencing technology, the mitochondrial, chloroplast, and nuclear genomes, transcriptome, and sequence-related amplified polymorphism (SRAP) fingerprints of burdock have all been reported. To make better use of this data for further research and analysis, a burdock database was constructed.Results:This burdock multi-omics database contains two burdock genome datasets, two transcriptome datasets, eight burdock chloroplast genomes, one burdock mitochondrial genome, one A. tomentosum chloroplast genome, one A. tomentosum mitochondrial genome, 26 phenotypes of burdock varieties, burdock rhizosphere-associated microorganisms, and chemical constituents of burdock fruit, pericarp, and kernel at different growth stages (using UPLC-Q-TOF-MS). The wild and cultivation distribution of burdock in China was summarized, and the main active components and pharmacological effects of burdock currently reported were concluded. The database contains ten central functional modules: Home, Genome, Transcriptome, Jbrowse, Search, Tools, SRAP fingerprints, Associated microorganisms, Chemical, and Publications. Among these, the ""Tools"" module can be used to perform sequence homology alignment (Blast), multiple sequence alignment analysis (Muscle), homologous protein prediction (Genewise), primer design (Primer), large-scale genome analysis (Lastz), and GO and KEGG enrichment analyses (GO Enrichment and KEGG Enrichment).Conclusions:The database URL is http://210.22.121.250:41352/ .

"Maintaining High-Touch in High-Tech Digital Health Monitoring and Multi-Omics Prognostication: Ethical, Equity, and Societal Considerations in Precision Health for Palliative Care","Advances in digital health, systems biology, environmental monitoring, and artificial intelligence (AI) continue to revolutionize health care, ushering a precision health future. More than disease treatment and prevention, precision health aims at maintaining good health throughout the lifespan. However, how can precision health impact care for people with a terminal or life-limiting condition? We examine here the ethical, equity, and societal/relational implications of two precision health modalities, (1) integrated systems biology/multi-omics analysis for disease prognostication and (2) digital health technologies for health status monitoring and communication. We focus on three main ethical and societal considerations: benefits and risks associated with integration of these modalities into the palliative care system; inclusion of underrepresented and marginalized groups in technology development and deployment; and the impact of high-tech modalities on palliative care's highly personalized and ""high-touch"" practice. We conclude with 10 recommendations for ensuring that precision health technologies, such as multi-omics prognostication and digital health monitoring, for palliative care are developed, tested, and implemented ethically, inclusively, and equitably.",37861713,,10.1089/omi.2023.0120,0,Omics : a journal of integrative biology,101131135,3.978
NGS-Integrator: An efficient tool for combining multiple NGS data tracks using minimum Bayes' factors,"Background:Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is widely used for genome-wide identification and quantification of DNA elements involved in the regulation of gene transcription. Studies that generate multiple high-throughput NGS datasets require data integration methods for two general tasks: 1) generation of genome-wide data tracks representing an aggregate of multiple replicates of the same experiment; and 2) combination of tracks from different experimental types that provide complementary information regarding the location of genomic features such as enhancers.Results:NGS-Integrator is a Java-based command line application, facilitating efficient integration of multiple genome-wide NGS datasets. NGS-Integrator first transforms all input data tracks using the complement of the minimum Bayes' factor so that all values are expressed in the range [0,1] representing the probability of a true signal given the background noise. Then, NGS-Integrator calculates the joint probability for every genomic position to create an integrated track. We provide examples using real NGS data generated in our laboratory and from the mouse ENCODE database.Conclusions:Our results show that NGS-Integrator is both time- and memory-efficient. Our examples show that NGS-Integrator can integrate information to facilitate downstream analyses that identify functional regulatory domains along the genome.",33213365,PMC7678096,10.1186/s12864-020-07220-7,3,BMC genomics,100965258,4.547
How computer science can help in understanding the 3D genome architecture,"Chromosome conformation capture techniques are producing a huge amount of data about the architecture of our genome. These data can provide us with a better understanding of the events that induce critical regulations of the cellular function from small changes in the three-dimensional genome architecture. Generating a unified view of spatial, temporal, genetic and epigenetic properties poses various challenges of data analysis, visualization, integration and mining, as well as of high performance computing and big data management. Here, we describe the critical issues of this new branch of bioinformatics, oriented at the comprehension of the three-dimensional genome architecture, which we call 'Nucleome Bioinformatics', looking beyond the currently available tools and methods, and highlight yet unaddressed challenges and the potential approaches that could be applied for tackling them.

ENLIGHTENMENT: A Scalable Annotated Database of Genomics and NGS-Based Nucleotide Level Profiles,"The revolution in sequencing technologies has enabled human genomes to be sequenced at a very low cost and time leading to exponential growth in the availability of whole-genome sequences. However, the complete understanding of our genome and its association with cancer is a far way to go. Researchers are striving hard to detect new variants and find their association with diseases, which further gives rise to the need for aggregation of this Big Data into a common standard scalable platform. In this work, a database named Enlightenment has been implemented which makes the availability of genomic data integrated from eight public databases, and DNA sequencing profiles of H. sapiens in a single platform. Annotated results with respect to cancer specific biomarkers, pharmacogenetic biomarkers and its association with variability in drug response, and DNA profiles along with novel copy number variants are computed and stored, which are accessible through a web interface. In order to overcome the challenge of storage and processing of NGS technology-based whole-genome DNA sequences, Enlightenment has been extended and deployed to a flexible and horizontally scalable database HBase, which is distributed over a hadoop cluster, which would enable the integration of other omics data into the database for enlightening the path towards eradication of cancer.",38055361,,10.1109/TCBB.2023.3340067,0,IEEE/ACM transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics,101196755,3.702
Multi-omics and single-cell sequencing analyses reveal the potential significance of circadian pathways in cancer therapy,"Background:Circadian rhythm disturbance is an independent risk factor for cancer. However, few studies have been reported on circadian rhythm related genes (CRGs) in cancer, so it is important to further explore the impact of CRGs in pan-cancer.Research design and methods:The Cancer Genome Atlas database was used to collect cancer-related data such as copy number variation, single nucleotide variants, methylation, and survival differences. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to verify the expression of circadian rhythm hub genes. The circadian pathway scores (CRS) were calculated using single-sample gene enrichment analysis. TIMER and GEPIA databases were used for immune-cell integration and assessment. Single-cell sequencing data was used to evaluate the abundance of CRS in tumor microenvironment cells.Results:In this study, we found that the expression of circadian pathway varies between tumors. CSNK1E was significantly up-regulated in most tumors and CRY2 was significantly down-regulated in most tumors. The protein interaction network suggested CRY2 as the core gene and IHC verified its significant low expression in KIRC. In addition, CRGs were found to be protective factors in most tumors and have the potential to act as specific immune markers in different tumors. CRS was significantly lower in abundance in most tumors. CRS was significantly associated with overall survival in tumor patients and associated with the expression of many immune cells in the tumor immune microenvironment. CRS is significantly associated with tumor mutational burden and microsatellite instability scores in most tumors and may serve as a potential immunotherapeutic marker.Conclusions:The circadian rhythm pathway may be a breakthrough point in regulating the tumor microenvironment meanwhile a suitable immunotherapy method in the future.",38288973,,10.1080/14737159.2023.2296668,0,Expert review of molecular diagnostics,101120777,5.67
"Integrated cytogenetics and genomics analysis of transposable elements in the Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus","Integration of cytogenetics and genomics has become essential to a better view of architecture and function of genomes. Although the advances on genomic sequencing have contributed to study genes and genomes, the repetitive DNA fraction of the genome is still enigmatic and poorly understood. Among repeated DNAs, transposable elements (TEs) are major components of eukaryotic chromatin and their investigation has been hindered even after the availability of whole sequenced genomes. The cytogenetic mapping of TEs in chromosomes has proved to be of high value to integrate information from the micro level of nucleotide sequence to a cytological view of chromosomes. Different TEs have been cytogenetically mapped in cichlids; however, neither details about their genomic arrangement nor appropriated copy number are well defined by these approaches. The current study integrates TEs distribution in Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus genome based on cytogenetic and genomics/bioinformatics approach. The results showed that some elements are not randomly distributed and that some are genomic dependent on each other. Moreover, we found extensive overlap between genomics and cytogenetics data and that tandem duplication may be the major mechanism responsible for the genomic dynamics of TEs here analyzed. This paper provides insights in the genomic organization of TEs under an integrated view based on cytogenetics and genomics.",26860923,,10.1007/s00438-016-1176-1,0,Molecular genetics and genomics : MGG,101093320,2.98
Identifying core gene modules in glioblastoma based on multilayer factor-mediated dysfunctional regulatory networks through integrating multi-dimensional genomic data,"The driver genetic aberrations collectively regulate core cellular processes underlying cancer development. However, identifying the modules of driver genetic alterations and characterizing their functional mechanisms are still major challenges for cancer studies. Here, we developed an integrative multi-omics method CMDD to identify the driver modules and their affecting dysregulated genes through characterizing genetic alteration-induced dysregulated networks. Applied to glioblastoma (GBM), the CMDD identified a core gene module of 17 genes, including seven known GBM drivers, and their dysregulated genes. The module showed significant association with shorter survival of GBM. When classifying driver genes in the module into two gene sets according to their genetic alteration patterns, we found that one gene set directly participated in the glioma pathway, while the other indirectly regulated the glioma pathway, mostly, via their dysregulated genes. Both of the two gene sets were significant contributors to survival and helpful for classifying GBM subtypes, suggesting their critical roles in GBM pathogenesis. Also, by applying the CMDD to other six cancers, we identified some novel core modules associated with overall survival of patients. Together, these results demonstrate integrative multi-omics data can identify driver modules and uncover their dysregulated genes, which is useful for interpreting cancer genome.",25653168,PMC4344511,10.1093/nar/gkv074,21,Nucleic acids research,411011,19.16
Comparative Venom Multiomics Reveal the Molecular Mechanisms Driving Adaptation to Diverse Predator-Prey Ecosystems in Closely Related Sea Snakes,"Predator-prey arms races are ideal models for studying the natural selection and adaptive evolution that drive the formation of biological diversity. For venomous snakes, venom is a key bridge linking snakes with their prey, but whether and how venom evolves under the selection of diet remains unclear. Here, we focused on two closely related sea snakes, Hydrophis cyanocinctus and Hydrophis curtus, which show significant differences in prey preferences. Data-independent acquisition (DIA)-based proteomic analysis revealed different degrees of homogeneity in the venom composition of the two snakes, which was consistent with the differential phylogenetic diversity of their prey. By investigating the sequences and structures of three-finger toxins (3FTx), a predominant toxin family in elapid venom, we identified significant differences between the two sea snakes in the binding activity of 3FTx to receptors from different prey populations, which could explain the trophic specialization of H. cyanocinctus. Furthermore, we performed integrated multiomic profiling of the transcriptomes, microRNAs (miRNAs), long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), and proteomes of the venom glands; constructed venom-related mRNA-miRNA-lncRNA networks; and identified a series of noncoding RNAs involved in the regulation of toxin gene expression in the two species. These findings are highly informative for elucidating the molecular basis and regulatory mechanisms that account for discrepant venom evolution in response to divergent diets in closely related snakes, providing valuable evidence for the study of coselection and coevolution in predator-prey ecosystems.",37279580,PMC10265070,10.1093/molbev/msad125,0,Molecular biology and evolution,8501455,8.8
An integrative and applicable phylogenetic footprinting framework for cis-regulatory motifs identification in prokaryotic genomes,"Background:Phylogenetic footprinting is an important computational technique for identifying cis-regulatory motifs in orthologous regulatory regions from multiple genomes, as motifs tend to evolve slower than their surrounding non-functional sequences. Its application, however, has several difficulties for optimizing the selection of orthologous data and reducing the false positives in motif prediction.Results:Here we present an integrative phylogenetic footprinting framework for accurate motif predictions in prokaryotic genomes (MP(3)). The framework includes a new orthologous data preparation procedure, an additional promoter scoring and pruning method and an integration of six existing motif finding algorithms as basic motif search engines. Specifically, we collected orthologous genes from available prokaryotic genomes and built the orthologous regulatory regions based on sequence similarity of promoter regions. This procedure made full use of the large-scale genomic data and taxonomy information and filtered out the promoters with limited contribution to produce a high quality orthologous promoter set. The promoter scoring and pruning is implemented through motif voting by a set of complementary predicting tools that mine as many motif candidates as possible and simultaneously eliminate the effect of random noise. We have applied the framework to Escherichia coli k12 genome and evaluated the prediction performance through comparison with seven existing programs. This evaluation was systematically carried out at the nucleotide and binding site level, and the results showed that MP(3) consistently outperformed other popular motif finding tools. We have integrated MP(3) into our motif identification and analysis server DMINDA, allowing users to efficiently identify and analyze motifs in 2,072 completely sequenced prokaryotic genomes.Conclusion:The performance evaluation indicated that MP(3) is effective for predicting regulatory motifs in prokaryotic genomes. Its application may enhance progress in elucidating transcription regulation mechanism, thus provide benefit to the genomic research community and prokaryotic genome researchers in particular.",27507169,PMC4977642,10.1186/s12864-016-2982-x,6,BMC genomics,100965258,4.547
Integrating genomic and multiomic data for Angelica sinensis provides insights into the evolution and biosynthesis of pharmaceutically bioactive compounds,"Angelica sinensis roots (Angelica roots) are rich in many bioactive compounds, including phthalides, coumarins, lignans, and terpenoids. However, the molecular bases for their biosynthesis are still poorly understood. Here, an improved chromosome-scale genome for A. sinensis var. Qinggui1 is reported, with a size of 2.16 Gb, contig N50 of 4.96 Mb and scaffold N50 of 198.27 Mb, covering 99.8% of the estimated genome. Additionally, by integrating genome sequencing, metabolomic profiling, and transcriptome analysis of normally growing and early-flowering Angelica roots that exhibit dramatically different metabolite profiles, the pathways and critical metabolic genes for the biosynthesis of these major bioactive components in Angelica roots have been deciphered. Multiomic analyses have also revealed the evolution and regulation of key metabolic genes for the biosynthesis of pharmaceutically bioactive components; in particular, TPSs for terpenoid volatiles, ACCs for malonyl CoA, PKSs for phthalide, and PTs for coumarin biosynthesis were expanded in the A. sinensis genome. These findings provide new insights into the biosynthesis of pharmaceutically important compounds in Angelica roots for exploration of synthetic biology and genetic improvement of herbal quality.",38001348,PMC10674023,10.1038/s42003-023-05569-5,0,Communications biology,101719179,6.548
New candidates for regulated gene integrity revealed through precise mapping of integrative genetic elements,"Integrative genetic elements (IGEs) are mobile multigene DNA units that integrate into and excise from host bacterial genomes. Each IGE usually targets a specific site within a conserved host gene, integrating in a manner that preserves target gene function. However, a small number of bacterial genes are known to be inactivated upon IGE integration and reactivated upon excision, regulating phenotypes of virulence, mutation rate, and terminal differentiation in multicellular bacteria. The list of regulated gene integrity (RGI) cases has been slow-growing because IGEs have been challenging to precisely and comprehensively locate in genomes. We present software (TIGER) that maps IGEs with unprecedented precision and without attB site bias. TIGER uses a comparative genomic, ping-pong BLAST approach, based on the principle that the IGE integration module (i.e. its int-attP region) is cohesive. The resultant IGEs from 2168 genomes, along with integrase phylogenetic analysis and gene inactivation tests, revealed 19 new cases of genes whose integrity is regulated by IGEs (including dut, eccCa1, gntT, hrpB, merA, ompN, prkA, tqsA, traG, yifB, yfaT and ynfE), as well as recovering previously known cases (in sigK, spsM, comK, mlrA and hlb genes). It also recovered known clades of site-promiscuous integrases and identified possible new ones.",32182341,PMC7192596,10.1093/nar/gkaa156,12,Nucleic acids research,411011,19.16
Extensive complementarity between gene function prediction methods,"Motivation:The number of sequenced genomes rises steadily but we still lack the knowledge about the biological roles of many genes. Automated function prediction (AFP) is thus a necessity. We hypothesized that AFP approaches that draw on distinct genome features may be useful for predicting different types of gene functions, motivating a systematic analysis of the benefits gained by obtaining and integrating such predictions.Results:Our pipeline amalgamates 5 133 543 genes from 2071 genomes in a single massive analysis that evaluates five established genomic AFP methodologies. While 1227 Gene Ontology (GO) terms yielded reliable predictions, the majority of these functions were accessible to only one or two of the methods. Moreover, different methods tend to assign a GO term to non-overlapping sets of genes. Thus, inferences made by diverse genomic AFP methods display a striking complementary, both gene-wise and function-wise. Because of this, a viable integration strategy is to rely on a single most-confident prediction per gene/function, rather than enforcing agreement across multiple AFP methods. Using an information-theoretic approach, we estimate that current databases contain 29.2 bits/gene of known Escherichia coli gene functions. This can be increased by up to 5.5 bits/gene using individual AFP methods or by 11 additional bits/gene upon integration, thereby providing a highly-ranking predictor on the Critical Assessment of Function Annotation 2 community benchmark. Availability of more sequenced genomes boosts the predictive accuracy of AFP approaches and also the benefit from integrating them.Availability and implementation:The individual and integrated GO predictions for the complete set of genes are available from http://gorbi.irb.hr/ CONTACT: fran.supek@irb.hrSupplementary information: Supplementary materials are available at Bioinformatics online.",27522084,,10.1093/bioinformatics/btw532,7,"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",9808944,6.931
"al mena: a comprehensive resource of human genetic variants integrating genomes and exomes from Arab, Middle Eastern and North African populations","Middle East and North Africa (MENA) encompass very unique populations, with a rich history and encompasses characteristic ethnic, linguistic and genetic diversity. The genetic diversity of MENA region has been largely unknown. The recent availability of whole-exome and whole-genome sequences from the region has made it possible to collect population-specific allele frequencies. The integration of data sets from this region would provide insights into the landscape of genetic variants in this region. We integrated genetic variants from multiple data sets systematically, available from this region to create a compendium of over 26 million genetic variations. The variants were systematically annotated and their allele frequencies in the data sets were computed and available as a web interface which enables quick query. As a proof of principle for application of the compendium for genetic epidemiology, we analyzed the allele frequencies for variants in transglutaminase 1 (TGM1) gene, associated with autosomal recessive lamellar ichthyosis. Our analysis revealed that the carrier frequency of selected variants differed widely with significant interethnic differences. To the best of our knowledge, al mena is the first and most comprehensive repertoire of genetic variations from the Arab, Middle Eastern and North African region.

From Omics to Multi-Omics Approaches for In-Depth Analysis of the Molecular Mechanisms of Prostate Cancer,"Cancer arises following alterations at different cellular levels, including genetic and epigenetic modifications, transcription and translation dysregulation, as well as metabolic variations. High-throughput omics technologies that allow one to identify and quantify processes involved in these changes are now available and have been instrumental in generating a wealth of steadily increasing data from patient tumors, liquid biopsies, and from tumor models. Extensive investigation and integration of these data have led to new biological insights into the origin and development of multiple cancer types and helped to unravel the molecular networks underlying this complex pathology. The comprehensive and quantitative analysis of a molecule class in a biological sample is named omics and large-scale omics studies addressing different prostate cancer stages have been performed in recent years. Prostate tumors represent the second leading cancer type and a prevalent cause of cancer death in men worldwide. It is a very heterogenous disease so that evaluating inter- and intra-tumor differences will be essential for a precise insight into disease development and plasticity, but also for the development of personalized therapies. There is ample evidence for the key role of the androgen receptor, a steroid hormone-activated transcription factor, in driving early and late stages of the disease, and this led to the development and approval of drugs addressing diverse targets along this pathway. Early genomic and transcriptomic studies have allowed one to determine the genes involved in prostate cancer and regulated by androgen signaling or other tumor-relevant signaling pathways. More recently, they have been supplemented by epigenomic, cistromic, proteomic and metabolomic analyses, thus, increasing our knowledge on the intricate mechanisms involved, the various levels of regulation and their interplay. The comprehensive investigation of these omics approaches and their integration into multi-omics analyses have led to a much deeper understanding of the molecular pathways involved in prostate cancer progression, and in response and resistance to therapies. This brings the hope that novel vulnerabilities will be identified, that existing therapies will be more beneficial by targeting the patient population likely to respond best, and that bespoke treatments with increased efficacy will be available soon.",35682963,PMC9181488,10.3390/ijms23116281,8,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,6.208
DrDimont: explainable drug response prediction from differential analysis of multi-omics networks,"Motivation:While it has been well established that drugs affect and help patients differently, personalized drug response predictions remain challenging. Solutions based on single omics measurements have been proposed, and networks provide means to incorporate molecular interactions into reasoning. However, how to integrate the wealth of information contained in multiple omics layers still poses a complex problem.Results:We present DrDimont, Drug response prediction from Differential analysis of multi-omics networks. It allows for comparative conclusions between two conditions and translates them into differential drug response predictions. DrDimont focuses on molecular interactions. It establishes condition-specific networks from correlation within an omics layer that are then reduced and combined into heterogeneous, multi-omics molecular networks. A novel semi-local, path-based integration step ensures integrative conclusions. Differential predictions are derived from comparing the condition-specific integrated networks. DrDimont's predictions are explainable, i.e. molecular differences that are the source of high differential drug scores can be retrieved. We predict differential drug response in breast cancer using transcriptomics, proteomics, phosphosite and metabolomics measurements and contrast estrogen receptor positive and receptor negative patients. DrDimont performs better than drug prediction based on differential protein expression or PageRank when evaluating it on ground truth data from cancer cell lines. We find proteomic and phosphosite layers to carry most information for distinguishing drug response.Availability and implementation:DrDimont is available on CRAN: https://cran.r-project.org/package=DrDimont.Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",36124784,PMC9486584,10.1093/bioinformatics/btac477,0,"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",9808944,6.931
"Integrating Multi-Omics Data to Construct Reliable Interconnected Models of Signaling, Gene Regulatory, and Metabolic Pathways","Alteration of the status of the metabolic enzymes could be a probable way to regulate metabolic reprogramming, which is a critical cellular adaptation mechanism especially for cancer cells. Coordination among biological pathways, such as gene-regulatory, signaling, and metabolic pathways is crucial for regulating metabolic adaptation. Also, incorporation of resident microbial metabolic potential in human body can influence the interplay between the microbiome and the systemic or tissue metabolic environments. Systemic framework for model-based integration of multi-omics data can ultimately improve our understanding of metabolic reprogramming at holistic level. However, the interconnectivity and novel meta-pathway regulatory mechanisms are relatively lesser explored and understood. Hence, we propose a computational protocol that utilizes multi-omics data to identify probable cross-pathway regulatory and protein-protein interaction (PPI) links connecting signaling proteins or transcription factors or miRNAs to metabolic enzymes and their metabolites using network analysis and mathematical modeling. These cross-pathway links were shown to play important roles in metabolic reprogramming in cancer scenarios.",37074577,,10.1007/978-1-0716-3008-2_6,0,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,0.0
Multi-omics analysis reveals copper-induced growth inhibition mechanisms of earthworm (Eisenia fetida),"Exposure to high concentrations of copper can cause toxic effects on the growth and development of organisms, but the relevant toxic mechanisms are far from fully understood. This study investigated the changes of metabolites, genes, and gut microorganisms in earthworms (Eisenia fetida) exposed to 0 (control), 67.58 (low), 168.96 (medium), and 337.92 (high) mg/kg of Cu in soil for 60 days. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differential metabolites (DMs) at the low-, medium-, and high-level Cu exposure groups were identified and introduced into Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways. Integrated metabolomic and transcriptomic analysis revealed that amino acid metabolism, lipid metabolism, and carbohydrate metabolism are the major metabolic pathways disturbed by Cu exposure. Furthermore, Cu exposure significantly decreased the diversity of the intestinal bacterial community and affected the relative abundance (increased or decreased) of intestinal colonizing bacteria. This resulted in high energy expenditure, inhibited nutrient absorption and fatty acid synthesis, and weakened antioxidant and detoxification abilities, ultimately inhibiting the growth of E. fetida. These findings offer important clues and evidence for understanding the mechanism of Cu-induced growth and development toxicity in E. fetida and provide further data for risk assessment in terrestrial ecosystems.",36549452,,10.1016/j.envpol.2022.120862,0,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",8804476,9.988
PICan: An integromics framework for dynamic cancer biomarker discovery,"Modern cancer research on prognostic and predictive biomarkers demands the integration of established and emerging high-throughput technologies. However, these data are meaningless unless carefully integrated with patient clinical outcome and epidemiological information. Integrated datasets hold the key to discovering new biomarkers and therapeutic targets in cancer. We have developed a novel approach and set of methods for integrating and interrogating phenomic, genomic and clinical data sets to facilitate cancer biomarker discovery and patient stratification. Applied to a known paradigm, the biological and clinical relevance of TP53, PICan was able to recapitulate the known biomarker status and prognostic significance at a DNA, RNA and protein levels.",25814194,PMC5528750,10.1016/j.molonc.2015.02.002,9,Molecular oncology,101308230,7.449
Integrative analysis of DNA methylation and gene expression in papillary renal cell carcinoma,"Patterns of DNA methylation are significantly altered in cancers. Interpreting the functional consequences of DNA methylation requires the integration of multiple forms of data. The recent advancement in the next-generation sequencing can help to decode this relationship and in biomarker discovery. In this study, we investigated the methylation patterns of papillary renal cell carcinoma (PRCC) and its relationship with the gene expression using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) multi-omics data. We found that the promoter and body of tumor suppressor genes, microRNAs and gene clusters and families, including cadherins, protocadherins, claudins and collagens, are hypermethylated in PRCC. Hypomethylated genes in PRCC are associated with the immune function. The gene expression of several novel candidate genes, including interleukin receptor IL17RE and immune checkpoint genes HHLA2, SIRPA and HAVCR2, shows a significant correlation with DNA methylation. We also developed machine learning models using features extracted from single and multi-omics data to distinguish early and late stages of PRCC. A comparative study of different feature selection algorithms, predictive models, data integration techniques and representations of methylation data was performed. Integration of both gene expression and DNA methylation features improved the performance of models in distinguishing tumor stages. In summary, our study identifies PRCC driver genes and proposes predictive models based on both DNA methylation and gene expression. These results on PRCC will aid in targeted experiments and provide a strategy to improve the classification accuracy of tumor stages.",32185457,,10.1007/s00438-020-01664-y,14,Molecular genetics and genomics : MGG,101093320,2.98
Integrative Multi-omics Analysis Identifies Genetic Variants Contributing to Non-syndromic Cleft Lip with or without Cleft Palate,"Objective:To provide novel insights into the aetiology of non-syndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (NSCL/P) by integrating multi-omics data and exploring susceptibility genes associated with NSCL/P.Methods:A two-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS) of NSCL/P was performed, involving a total of 1,069 cases and 1,724 controls. Using promoter capture Hi-C (pCHi-C) datasets in human embryonic stem cells (hESC) and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) in craniofacial tissues, we filtered out single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with active cis-regulation and their target genes. Additionally, we employed expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis to identify candidate genes.Results:Thirteen SNPs were identified as cis-regulation units associated with the risk of NSCL/P. Five of these were proven to be active in chromatin states in early human craniofacial development (rs7218002: odds ratio [OR] 1.50, P = 8.14E-08; rs835367: OR 0.78, P = 3.48E- 05; rs77022994: OR 0.55, P = 1.05E-04; rs961470: OR 0.73, P = 1.38E-04; rs17314727: OR 0.73, P = 1.85E-04). Additionally, pCHi-C and eQTL analysis prioritised three candidate genes (rs7218002: NTN1, rs835367: FGGY, LINC01135). NTN1 and FGGY were expressed in mouse orofacial development. Deficiencies in NTN1, FGGY and LINC01135 were associated with cleft palate and cleft lip, abnormal facial shape and bifid uvula, and abnormality of the face, respectively.Conclusion:Our study identified five SNPs (rs7218002, rs835367, rs77022994, rs961470 and rs17314727) and three susceptibility genes (NTN1, FGGY and LINC01135) associated with NSCL/P.

A survey on single and multi omics data mining methods in cancer data classification,"Data analytics is routinely used to support biomedical research in all areas, with particular focus on the most relevant clinical conditions, such as cancer. Bioinformatics approaches, in particular, have been used to characterize the molecular aspects of diseases. In recent years, numerous studies have been performed on cancer based upon single and multi-omics data. For example, Single-omics-based studies have employed a diverse set of data, such as gene expression, DNA methylation, or miRNA, to name only a few instances. Despite that, a significant part of literature reports studies on gene expression with microarray datasets. Single-omics data have high numbers of attributes and very low sample counts. This characteristic makes them paradigmatic of an under-sampled, small-n large-p machine learning problem. An important goal of single-omics data analysis is to find the most relevant genes, in terms of their potential use in clinics and research, in the batch of available data. This problem has been addressed in gene selection as one of the pre-processing steps in data mining. An analysis that use only one type of data (single-omics) often miss the complexity of the landscape of molecular phenomena underlying the disease. As a result, they provide limited and sometimes poorly reliable information about the disease mechanisms. Therefore, in recent years, researchers have been eager to build models that are more complex, obtaining more reliable results using multi-omics data. However, to achieve this, the most important challenge is data integration. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of the challenges in single and multi-omics data analysis of cancer data, focusing on gene selection and data integration methods.",32525020,,10.1016/j.jbi.2020.103466,5,Journal of biomedical informatics,100970413,8.0
Consensus clustering with missing labels (ccml): a consensus clustering tool for multi-omics integrative prediction in cohorts with unequal sample coverage,"Multi-omics data integration is a complex and challenging task in biomedical research. Consensus clustering, also known as meta-clustering or cluster ensembles, has become an increasingly popular downstream tool for phenotyping and endotyping using multiple omics and clinical data. However, current consensus clustering methods typically rely on ensembling clustering outputs with similar sample coverages (mathematical replicates), which may not reflect real-world data with varying sample coverages (biological replicates). To address this issue, we propose a new consensus clustering with missing labels (ccml) strategy termed ccml, an R protocol for two-step consensus clustering that can handle unequal missing labels (i.e. multiple predictive labels with different sample coverages). Initially, the regular consensus weights are adjusted (normalized) by sample coverage, then a regular consensus clustering is performed to predict the optimal final cluster. We applied the ccml method to predict molecularly distinct groups based on 9-omics integration in the Karolinska COSMIC cohort, which investigates chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and 24-omics handprint integrative subgrouping of adult asthma patients of the U-BIOPRED cohort. We propose ccml as a downstream toolkit for multi-omics integration analysis algorithms such as Similarity Network Fusion and robust clustering of clinical data to overcome the limitations posed by missing data, which is inevitable in human cohorts consisting of multiple data modalities. The ccml tool is available in the R language (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ccml, https://github.com/pulmonomics-lab/ccml, or https://github.com/ZhoulabCPH/ccml).",38205966,PMC10782800,10.1093/bib/bbad501,0,Briefings in bioinformatics,100912837,13.994
A multi-omics systems vaccinology resource to develop and test computational models of immunity,"Systems vaccinology studies have identified factors affecting individual vaccine responses, but comparing these findings is challenging due to varying study designs. To address this lack of reproducibility, we established a community resource for comparing Bordetella pertussis booster responses and to host annual contests for predicting patients' vaccination outcomes. We report here on our experiences with the ""dry-run"" prediction contest. We found that, among 20+ models adopted from the literature, the most successful model predicting vaccination outcome was based on age alone. This confirms our concerns about the reproducibility of conclusions between different vaccinology studies. Further, we found that, for newly trained models, handling of baseline information on the target variables was crucial. Overall, multiple co-inertia analysis gave the best results of the tested modeling approaches. Our goal is to engage community in these prediction challenges by making data and models available and opening a public contest in August 2024.",38490204,PMC10985234,10.1016/j.crmeth.2024.100731,0,Cell reports methods,9918227360606676,0.0
Multi-omics approaches for comprehensive analysis and understanding of the immune response in the miniature pig breed,"The porcine immune system has an important role in pre-clinical studies together with understanding the biological response mechanisms before entering into clinical trials. The size distribution of the Korean minipig is an important feature that make this breed ideal for biomedical research and safe practice in post clinical studies. The extremely tiny (ET) minipig serves as an excellent model for various biomedical research studies, but the comparatively frail and vulnerable immune response to the environment over its Large (L) size minipig breed leads to additional after born care. To overcome this pitfall, comparative analysis of the genomic regions under selection in the L type breed could provide a better understanding at the molecular level and lead to the development of an enhanced variety of ET type minipig. In this study, we utilized whole genome sequencing (WGS) to identify traces of artificial selection and integrated them with transcriptome data generated from blood samples to find strongly selected and differentially expressed genes of interest. We identified a total of 35 common genes among which 7 were differentially expressed and showed selective sweep in the L type over the ET type minipig breed. The stabilization of these genes were further confirmed using nucleotide diversity analysis, and these genes could serve as potential biomarkers for the development of a better variety of ET type pig breed.",35587479,PMC9119490,10.1371/journal.pone.0263035,1,PloS one,101285081,3.752
Childhood exposure to non-persistent endocrine disrupting chemicals and multi-omic profiles: A panel study,"Background:Individuals are exposed to environmental pollutants with endocrine disrupting activity (endocrine disruptors, EDCs) and the early stages of life are particularly susceptible to these exposures. Previous studies have focused on identifying molecular signatures associated with EDCs, but none have used repeated sampling strategy and integrated multiple omics. We aimed to identify multi-omic signatures associated with childhood exposure to non-persistent EDCs.Methods:We used data from the HELIX Child Panel Study, which included 156 children aged 6 to 11. Children were followed for one week, in two time periods. Twenty-two non-persistent EDCs (10 phthalate, 7 phenol, and 5 organophosphate pesticide metabolites) were measured in two weekly pools of 15 urine samples each. Multi-omic profiles (methylome, serum and urinary metabolome, proteome) were measured in blood and in a pool urine samples. We developed visit-specific Gaussian Graphical Models based on pairwise partial correlations. The visit-specific networks were then merged to identify reproducible associations. Independent biological evidence was systematically sought to confirm some of these associations and assess their potential health implications.Results:950 reproducible associations were found among which 23 were direct associations between EDCs and omics. For 9 of them, we were able to find corroborating evidence from previous literature: DEP - serotonin, OXBE - cg27466129, OXBE - dimethylamine, triclosan - leptin, triclosan - serotonin, MBzP - Neu5AC, MEHP - cg20080548, oh-MiNP - kynurenine, oxo-MiNP - 5-oxoproline. We used these associations to explore possible mechanisms between EDCs and health outcomes, and found links to health outcomes for 3 analytes: serotonin and kynurenine in relation to neuro-behavioural development, and leptin in relation to obesity and insulin resistance.Conclusions:This multi-omics network analysis at two time points identified biologically relevant molecular signatures related to non-persistent EDC exposure in childhood, suggesting pathways related to neurological and metabolic outcomes.",36867994,,10.1016/j.envint.2023.107856,2,Environment international,7807270,13.352
A Multi-Omics Approach Revealed Common Dysregulated Pathways in Type One and Type Two Endometrial Cancers,"Endometrial cancer (EC) is the most frequent gynecologic cancer in postmenopausal women. Pathogenetic mechanisms that are related to the onset and progression of the disease are largely still unknown. A multi-omics strategy can help identify altered pathways that could be targeted for improving therapeutical approaches. In this study we used a multi-omics approach on four EC cell lines for the identification of common dysregulated pathways in type 1 and 2 ECs. We analyzed proteomics and metabolomics of AN3CA, HEC1A, KLE and ISHIKAWA cell lines by mass spectrometry. The bioinformatic analysis identified 22 common pathways that are in common with both types of EC. In addition, we identified five proteins and 13 metabolites common to both types of EC. Western blotting analysis on 10 patients with type 1 and type 2 EC and 10 endometria samples confirmed the altered abundance of NPEPPS. Our multi-omics analysis identified dysregulated proteins and metabolites involved in EC tumor growth. Further studies are needed to understand the role of these molecules in EC. Our data can shed light on common pathways to better understand the mechanisms involved in the development and growth of EC, especially for the development of new therapies.",38003247,PMC10671314,10.3390/ijms242216057,2,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,6.208
A proteomics sample metadata representation for multiomics integration and big data analysis,The amount of public proteomics data is rapidly increasing but there is no standardized format to describe the sample metadata and their relationship with the dataset files in a way that fully supports their understanding or reanalysis. Here we propose to develop the transcriptomics data format MAGE-TAB into a standard representation for proteomics sample metadata. We implement MAGE-TAB-Proteomics in a crowdsourcing project to manually curate over 200 public datasets. We also describe tools and libraries to validate and submit sample metadata-related information to the PRIDE repository. We expect that these developments will improve the reproducibility and facilitate the reanalysis and integration of public proteomics datasets.,34615866,PMC8494749,10.1038/s41467-021-26111-3,27,Nature communications,101528555,17.694
A Systemic Analysis of Transcriptomic and Epigenomic Data To Reveal Regulation Patterns for Complex Disease,"Integrating diverse genomics data can provide a global view of the complex biological processes related to the human complex diseases. Although substantial efforts have been made to integrate different omics data, there are at least three challenges for multi-omics integration methods: (i) How to simultaneously consider the effects of various genomic factors, since these factors jointly influence the phenotypes; (ii) How to effectively incorporate the information from publicly accessible databases and omics datasets to fully capture the interactions among (epi)genomic factors from diverse omics data; and (iii) Until present, the combination of more than two omics datasets has been poorly explored. Current integration approaches are not sufficient to address all of these challenges together. We proposed a novel integrative analysis framework by incorporating sparse model, multivariate analysis, Gaussian graphical model, and network analysis to address these three challenges simultaneously. Based on this strategy, we performed a systemic analysis for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) integrating genome-wide gene expression, DNA methylation, and miRNA expression data. We identified three regulatory modules of genomic factors associated with GBM survival time and revealed a global regulatory pattern for GBM by combining the three modules, with respect to the common regulatory factors. Our method can not only identify disease-associated dysregulated genomic factors from different omics, but more importantly, it can incorporate the information from publicly accessible databases and omics datasets to infer a comprehensive interaction map of all these dysregulated genomic factors. Our work represents an innovative approach to enhance our understanding of molecular genomic mechanisms underlying human complex diseases.",28500050,PMC5499134,10.1534/g3.117.042408,4,"G3 (Bethesda, Md.)",101566598,3.542
A transposable element annotation pipeline and expression analysis reveal potentially active elements in the microalga Tisochrysis lutea,"Background:Transposable elements (TEs) are mobile DNA sequences known as drivers of genome evolution. Their impacts have been widely studied in animals, plants and insects, but little is known about them in microalgae. In a previous study, we compared the genetic polymorphisms between strains of the haptophyte microalga Tisochrysis lutea and suggested the involvement of active autonomous TEs in their genome evolution.Results:To identify potentially autonomous TEs, we designed a pipeline named PiRATE (Pipeline to Retrieve and Annotate Transposable Elements, download: https://doi.org/10.17882/51795 ), and conducted an accurate TE annotation on a new genome assembly of T. lutea. PiRATE is composed of detection, classification and annotation steps. Its detection step combines multiple, existing analysis packages representing all major approaches for TE detection and its classification step was optimized for microalgal genomes. The efficiency of the detection and classification steps was evaluated with data on the model species Arabidopsis thaliana. PiRATE detected 81% of the TE families of A. thaliana and correctly classified 75% of them. We applied PiRATE to T. lutea genomic data and established that its genome contains 15.89% Class I and 4.95% Class II TEs. In these, 3.79 and 17.05% correspond to potentially autonomous and non-autonomous TEs, respectively. Annotation data was combined with transcriptomic and proteomic data to identify potentially active autonomous TEs. We identified 17 expressed TE families and, among these, a TIR/Mariner and a TIR/hAT family were able to synthesize their transposase. Both these TE families were among the three highest expressed genes in a previous transcriptomic study and are composed of highly similar copies throughout the genome of T. lutea. This sum of evidence reveals that both these TE families could be capable of transposing or triggering the transposition of potential related MITE elements.Conclusion:This manuscript provides an example of a de novo transposable element annotation of a non-model organism characterized by a fragmented genome assembly and belonging to a poorly studied phylum at genomic level. Integration of multi-omics data enabled the discovery of potential mobile TEs and opens the way for new discoveries on the role of these repeated elements in genomic evolution of microalgae.",29783941,PMC5963040,10.1186/s12864-018-4763-1,26,BMC genomics,100965258,4.547
Evidence Based on an Integrative Analysis of Multi-Omics Data on METTL7A as a Molecular Marker in Pan-Cancer,"Methyltransferase-like protein 7A (METTL7A), an RNA N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methyltransferase, has attracted much attention as it has been found to be closely associated with various types of tumorigenesis and progression. This study provides a comprehensive assessment of METTL7A from a pan-cancer perspective using multi-omics data. The gene ontology enrichment analysis of METTL7A-binding proteins revealed a close association with methylation and lipid metabolism. We then explored the expression of METTL7A in normal tissues, cell lines, different subtypes and cancers, and found that METTL7A was differentially expressed in various cancer species, tumor molecular subtypes and immune subtypes. Evaluation of the diagnostic and prognostic value of METTL7A in pan-cancer revealed that METTL7A had high accuracy in tumor prediction. Moreover, the low expression of METTL7A significantly correlated with the poor prognosis, including kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), mesothelioma and sarcoma, indicating that METTL7A could be a potential biomarker for tumor diagnosis and prognosis. We focused on KIRC after pre-screening and analyzed its expression and prognostic value in various clinical subgroups. We found that METTL7A was significantly related to tumor stage, metastasis stage, pathologic stage, primary therapy outcome, histologic grade and gender, and that low METTL7A expression was associated with poorer outcomes. Finally, we analyzed the immune infiltration and co-expressed genes of METTL7A as well as the differentially expressed genes in the high and low expression groups. In conclusion, METTL7A is a better molecular marker for pan-cancer diagnosis and prognosis and has high potential as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for KIRC.",36830565,PMC9952925,10.3390/biom13020195,4,Biomolecules,101596414,6.064
Linking genotype to phenotype in multi-omics data of small sample,"Background:Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) that link genotype to phenotype represent an effective means to associate an individual genetic background with a disease or trait. However, single-omics data only provide limited information on biological mechanisms, and it is necessary to improve the accuracy for predicting the biological association between genotype and phenotype by integrating multi-omics data. Typically, gene expression data are integrated to analyze the effect of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on phenotype. Such multi-omics data integration mainly follows two approaches: multi-staged analysis and meta-dimensional analysis, which respectively ignore intra-omics and inter-omics associations. Moreover, both approaches require omics data from a single sample set, and the large feature set of SNPs necessitates a large sample size for model establishment, but it is difficult to obtain multi-omics data from a single, large sample set.Results:To address this problem, we propose a method of genotype-phenotype association based on multi-omics data from small samples. The workflow of this method includes clustering genes using a protein-protein interaction network and gene expression data, screening gene clusters with group lasso, obtaining SNP clusters corresponding to the selected gene clusters through expression quantitative trait locus data, integrating SNP clusters and corresponding gene clusters and phenotypes into three-layer network blocks, analyzing and predicting based on each block, and obtaining the final prediction by taking the average.Conclusions:We compare this method to others using two datasets and find that our method shows better results in both cases. Our method can effectively solve the prediction problem in multi-omics data of small sample, and provide valuable resources for further studies on the fusion of more omics data.",34256701,PMC8278664,10.1186/s12864-021-07867-w,6,BMC genomics,100965258,4.547
Serverless computing in omics data analysis and integration,"A comprehensive analysis of omics data can require vast computational resources and access to varied data sources that must be integrated into complex, multi-step analysis pipelines. Execution of many such analyses can be accelerated by applying the cloud computing paradigm, which provides scalable resources for storing data of different types and parallelizing data analysis computations. Moreover, these resources can be reused for different multi-omics analysis scenarios. Traditionally, developers are required to manage a cloud platform's underlying infrastructure, configuration, maintenance and capacity planning. The serverless computing paradigm simplifies these operations by automatically allocating and maintaining both servers and virtual machines, as required for analysis tasks. This paradigm offers highly parallel execution and high scalability without manual management of the underlying infrastructure, freeing developers to focus on operational logic. This paper reviews serverless solutions in bioinformatics and evaluates their usage in omics data analysis and integration. We start by reviewing the application of the cloud computing model to a multi-omics data analysis and exposing some shortcomings of the early approaches. We then introduce the serverless computing paradigm and show its applicability for performing an integrative analysis of multiple omics data sources in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.",34505137,PMC8499876,10.1093/bib/bbab349,5,Briefings in bioinformatics,100912837,13.994
Multi-omics reveals functional genomic and metabolic mechanisms of milk production and quality in dairy cows,"Motivation:Enhancing the utilization of human-inedible crop by-products by ruminants to produce high-quality milk for human consumption is an emerging global task. We performed a multi-omics-based study to decipher the regulatory biological processes of milk production when cows fed low-quality crop by-products with the aim to improve their utilization.Results:Seven types of different high-throughput omics data were generated across three central organs [rumen, liver and mammary gland (MG)] and biofluids (rumen fluid and blood) that involved in milk production. The integrated multi-omics analysis including metabolomics, metagenomics and transcriptomics showed altered microbiome at compositional and functional levels, microbial metabolites in the rumen, down-regulated genes and associated functions in liver and MG. These changes simultaneously contributed to down-regulated three key metabolic nodes (propionate, glucose and amino acid) across these organs and biofluids that led to lowered milk yield and quality when cows consumed corn stover (CS). Hippuric acid was identified as a biomarker that led to low milk production in CS-fed cows, suggesting a future evaluation parameter related to the metabolic mechanism of low-quality forage utilization. This study unveils the milk production-related biological mechanism across different biofluids and tissues under a low-quality forage diet, which provides a novel understanding and potential improvement strategies for future crop by-products utilization and sustainable ruminant production.Availability and implementation:The raw files of metagenomics, metabolomics, and transcriptomics data can be accessed at NCBI SRA (No. SRR5028206), EMBI-EBI (No. MTBLS411), and GEO (NO.

Network approaches to systems biology analysis of complex disease: integrative methods for multi-omics data,"In the past decade, significant progress has been made in complex disease research across multiple omics layers from genome, transcriptome and proteome to metabolome. There is an increasing awareness of the importance of biological interconnections, and much success has been achieved using systems biology approaches. However, because of the typical focus on one single omics layer at a time, existing systems biology findings explain only a modest portion of complex disease. Recent advances in multi-omics data collection and sharing present us new opportunities for studying complex diseases in a more comprehensive fashion, and yet simultaneously create new challenges considering the unprecedented data dimensionality and diversity. Here, our goal is to review extant and emerging network approaches that can be applied across multiple biological layers to facilitate a more comprehensive and integrative multilayered omics analysis of complex diseases.",28679163,PMC6454489,10.1093/bib/bbx066,127,Briefings in bioinformatics,100912837,13.994

EDomics: a comprehensive and comparative multi-omics database for animal evo-devo,"Evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo) has been among the most fascinating interdisciplinary fields for decades, which aims to elucidate the origin and evolution of diverse developmental processes. The rapid accumulation of omics data provides unprecedented opportunities to answer many interesting but unresolved evo-devo questions.

Here, we establish a comparative multi-omics database for animal evo-devo (EDomics, http://edomics.qnlm.ac) containing comprehensive genomes, bulk transcriptomes, and single-cell data across 40 representative species, many of which are generally used as model organisms for animal evo-devo study. EDomics provides a systematic view of genomic/transcriptomic information from various aspects, including genome assembly statistics, gene features and families, transcription factors, transposable elements, and gene expressional profiles/networks. It also exhibits spatiotemporal gene expression profiles at a single-cell level, such as cell atlas, cell markers, and spatial-map information. Moreover, EDomics provides highly valuable, customized datasets/resources for evo-devo research, including gene family expansion/contraction, inferred core gene repertoires, macrosynteny analysis for karyotype evolution, and cell type evolution analysis.

Discovery of Bladder Cancer-related Genes Using Integrative Heterogeneous Network Modeling of Multi-omics Data,"In human health, a fundamental challenge is the identification of disease-related genes. Bladder cancer (BC) is a worldwide malignant tumor, which has resulted in 170,000 deaths in 2010 up from 114,000 in 1990. Moreover, with the emergence of multi-omics data, more comprehensive analysis of human diseases become possible. In this study, we propose a multi-step approach for the identification of BC-related genes by using integrative Heterogeneous Network Modeling of Multi-Omics data (iHNMMO). The heterogeneous network model properly and comprehensively reflects the multiple kinds of relationships between genes in the multi-omics data of BC, including general relationships, unique relationships under BC condition, correlational relationships within each omics and regulatory relationships between different omics. Besides, a network-based propagation algorithm with resistance is utilized to quantize the relationships between genes and BC precisely. The results of comprehensive performance evaluation suggest that iHNMMO significantly outperforms other approaches. Moreover, further analysis suggests that the top ranked genes may be functionally implicated in BC, which also confirms the superiority of iHNMMO. In summary, this study shows that disease-related genes can be better identified through reasonable integration of multi-omics data.",29142286,PMC5688092,10.1038/s41598-017-15890-9,7,Scientific reports,101563288,4.996
ADAS-viewer: web-based application for integrative analysis of multi-omics data in Alzheimer's disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder and is represented by complicated biological mechanisms and complexity of brain tissue. Our understanding of the complicated molecular architecture that contributes to AD progression benefits from performing comprehensive and systemic investigations with multi-layered molecular and biological data from different brain regions. Since recently different independent studies generated various omics data in different brain regions of AD patients, multi-omics data integration can be a useful resource for better comprehensive understanding of AD. Here we present a web platform, ADAS-viewer, that provides researchers with the ability to comprehensively investigate and visualize multi-omics data from multiple brain regions of AD patients. ADAS-viewer offers means to identify functional changes in transcript and exon expression (i.e., alternative splicing) along with associated genetic or epigenetic regulatory effects. Specifically, it integrates genomic, transcriptomic, methylation, and miRNA data collected from seven different brain regions (cerebellum, temporal cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, frontal pole, inferior frontal gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus, and superior temporal gyrus) across three independent cohort datasets. ADAS-viewer is particularly useful as a web-based application for analyzing and visualizing multi-omics data across multiple brain regions at both transcript and exon level, allowing the identification of candidate biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease.",33741983,PMC7979890,10.1038/s41540-021-00177-7,4,NPJ systems biology and applications,101677786,4.671
Pan-cancer onco-signatures reveal a novel mitochondrial subtype of luminal breast cancer with specific regulators,"Background:Somatic alterations in cancer cause dysregulation of signaling pathways that control cell-cycle progression, apoptosis, and cell growth. The effect of individual alterations in these pathways differs between individual tumors and tumor types. Recognizing driver events is a complex task requiring integrating multiple molecular data, including genomics, epigenomics, and functional genomics. A common hypothesis is that these driver events share similar effects on the hallmarks of cancer. The availability of large-scale multi-omics studies allows for inferring these common effects from data. Once these effects are known, one can then deconvolve in every individual patient whether a given genomics alteration is a driver event.Methods:Here, we develop a novel data-driven approach to identify shared oncogenic expression signatures among tumors. We aim to identify gene onco-signature for classifying tumor patients in homogeneous subclasses with distinct prognoses and specific genomic alterations. We derive expression pan-cancer onco-signatures from TCGA gene expression data using a discovery set of 9107 primary pan-tumor samples together with respective matched mutational data and a list of known cancer-related genes from COSMIC database.Results:We use the derived ono-signatures to state their prognostic significance and apply them to the TCGA breast cancer dataset as proof of principle of our approach. We uncover a ""mitochondrial"" sub-group of Luminal patients characterized by its biological features and regulated by specific genetic modulators. Collectively, our results demonstrate the effectiveness of onco-signatures-based methodologies, and they also contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the metabolic heterogeneity of Luminal tumors.Conclusions:These findings provide novel genomics evidence for developing personalized breast cancer patient treatments. The onco-signature approach, demonstrated here on breast cancer, is general and can be applied to other cancer types.",36717859,PMC9885701,10.1186/s12967-023-03907-z,0,Journal of translational medicine,101190741,8.44
Meta-analysis Integrated With Multi-omics Data Analysis to Elucidate Pathogenic Mechanisms of Age-Related Knee Osteoarthritis in Mice,"Increased mechanistic insight into the pathogenesis of knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is needed to develop efficacious disease-modifying treatments. Though age-related pathogenic mechanisms are most relevant to the majority of clinically presenting KOA, the bulk of our mechanistic understanding of KOA has been derived using surgically induced posttraumatic OA (PTOA) models. Here, we took an integrated approach of meta-analysis and multi-omics data analysis to elucidate pathogenic mechanisms of age-related KOA in mice. Protein-level data were integrated with transcriptomic profiling to reveal inflammation, autophagy, and cellular senescence as primary hallmarks of age-related KOA. Importantly, the molecular profiles of cartilage aging were unique from those observed following PTOA, with less than 3% overlap between the 2 models. At the nexus of the 3 aging hallmarks, advanced glycation end product (AGE)/receptor for AGE (RAGE) emerged as the most statistically robust pathway associated with age-related KOA. This pathway was further supported by analysis of mass spectrometry data. Notably, the change in AGE-RAGE signaling over time was exclusively observed in male mice, suggesting sexual dimorphism in the pathogenesis of age-induced KOA in murine models. Collectively, these findings implicate dysregulation of AGE-RAGE signaling as a sex-dependent driver of age-related KOA.",34979545,PMC9255692,10.1093/gerona/glab386,4,"The journals of gerontology.

A Comprehensive Bioinformatics Resource Guide for Genome-Based Antimicrobial Resistance Studies,"The use of high-throughput sequencing technologies and bioinformatic tools has greatly transformed microbial genome research. With the help of sophisticated computational tools, it has become easier to perform whole genome assembly, identify and compare different species based on their genomes, and predict the presence of genes responsible for proteins, antimicrobial resistance, and toxins. These bioinformatics resources are likely to continuously improve in quality, become more user-friendly to analyze the multiple genomic data, efficient in generating information and translating it into meaningful knowledge, and enhance our understanding of the genetic mechanism of AMR. In this manuscript, we provide an essential guide for selecting the popular resources for microbial research, such as genome assembly and annotation, antibiotic resistance gene profiling, identification of virulence factors, and drug interaction studies. In addition, we discuss the best practices in computer-oriented microbial genome research, emerging trends in microbial genomic data analysis, integration of multi-omics data, the appropriate use of machine-learning algorithms, and open-source bioinformatics resources for genome data analytics.",37861712,,10.1089/omi.2023.0140,0,Omics : a journal of integrative biology,101131135,3.978
Identification of potential COPD genes based on multi-omics data at the functional level,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a complex disease, which involves dysfunctions in multi-omics. The changes in biological processes, such as adhesion junction, signaling transduction, transcriptional regulation, and cell proliferation, will lead to the occurrence of COPD. A novel systematic approach MMMG (Methylation-MicroRNA-MRNA-GO) was proposed to identify potential COPD genes by integrating function information with a methylation profile, a microRNA expression profile and an mRNA expression profile. 8 co-functional classes and 102 potential COPD genes were identified. These genes displayed a high performance in classifying COPD patients and normal samples, revealed COPD-related pathways, and have been confirmed to be associated with COPD by Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC)-values, literature, an independent data set, and pathways. The MMMG method that analyzed multi-omics data at the functional level could effectively identify potential COPD genes. These potential COPD genes would provide in-depth insights into understanding the complexity of COPD genome landscapes, improve the early diagnostics, and guide new efforts to develop therapeutics in the future.",26575263,,10.1039/c5mb00577a,4,Molecular bioSystems,101251620,0.0
Milletdb: a multi-omics database to accelerate the research of functional genomics and molecular breeding of millets,"Millets are a class of nutrient-rich coarse cereals with high resistance to abiotic stress; thus, they guarantee food security for people living in areas with extreme climatic conditions and provide stress-related genetic resources for other crops. However, no platform is available to provide a comprehensive and systematic multi-omics analysis for millets, which seriously hinders the mining of stress-related genes and the molecular breeding of millets. Here, a free, web-accessible, user-friendly millets multi-omics database platform (Milletdb, http://milletdb.novogene.com) has been developed. The Milletdb contains six millets and their one related species genomes, graph-based pan-genomics of pearl millet, and stress-related multi-omics data, which enable Milletdb to be the most complete millets multi-omics database available. We stored GWAS (genome-wide association study) results of 20 yield-related trait data obtained under three environmental conditions [field (no stress), early drought and late drought] for 2 years in the database, allowing users to identify stress-related genes that support yield improvement. Milletdb can simplify the functional genomics analysis of millets by providing users with 20 different tools (e.g., 'Gene mapping', 'Co-expression', 'KEGG/GO Enrichment' analysis, etc.). On the Milletdb platform, a gene PMA1G03779.1 was identified through 'GWAS', which has the potential to modulate yield and respond to different environmental stresses. Using the tools provided by Milletdb, we found that the stress-related PLATZs TFs (transcription factors) family expands in 87.5% of millet accessions and contributes to vegetative growth and abiotic stress responses. Milletdb can effectively serve researchers in the mining of key genes, genome editing and molecular breeding of millets.",37530223,PMC10579705,10.1111/pbi.14136,6,Plant biotechnology journal,101201889,13.263
BreakAlign: a Perl program to align chimaeric (split) genomic NGS reads and allow visual confirmation of novel retroviral integrations,"Background:Retroviruses replicate by integrating a DNA copy into a host chromosome. Detecting novel retroviral integrations (ones not in the reference genome sequence of the host) from genomic NGS data is bioinformatically challenging and frequently produces many false positives. One common method of confirmation is visual inspection of an alignment of the chimaeric (split) reads that span a putative novel retroviral integration site. We perceived the need for a program that would facilitate this by producing a multiple alignment containing both the viral and host regions that flank an integration.Results:BreakAlign is a Perl program that uses blastn to produce such a multiple alignment. In addition to the NGS dataset and a reference viral sequence, the program requires either (a) the ~ 500nt host genome sequence that spans the putative integration or (b) coordinates of this putative integration in an installed copy of the reference human genome (multiple integrations can be processed automatically). BreakAlign is freely available from https://github.com/marchiem/breakalign and is accompanied by example files allowing a test run.Conclusion:BreakAlign will confirm and facilitate characterisation of both (a) germline integrations of endogenous retroviruses and (b) somatic integrations of exogenous retroviruses such as HIV and HTLV. Although developed for use with genomic short-read NGS (second generation) data and retroviruses, it should also be useful for long-read (third generation) data and any mobile element with at least one conserved flanking region.",35428171,PMC9013057,10.1186/s12859-022-04621-1,2,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,3.307
Integrative omics analysis reveals epigenomic and transcriptomic signatures underlying brain structural deficits in major depressive disorder,"Several lines of evidence support the involvement of transcriptomic and epigenetic mechanisms in the brain structural deficits of major depressive disorder (MDD) separately. However, research in these two areas has remained isolated. In this study, we proposed an integrative strategy that combined neuroimaging, brain-wide gene expression, and peripheral DNA methylation data to investigate the genetic basis of gray matter abnormalities in MDD. The MRI T1-weighted images and Illumina 850 K DNA methylation microarrays were obtained from 269 patients and 416 healthy controls, and brain-wide transcriptomic data were collected from Allen Human Brain Atlas. The between-group differences in gray matter volume (GMV) and differentially methylated CpG positions (DMPs) were examined. The genes with their expression patterns spatially related to GMV changes and genes with DMPs were overlapped and selected. Using principal component regression, the associations between DMPs in overlapped genes and GMV across individual patients were investigated, and the region-specific correlations between methylation status and gene expression were examined. We found significant associations between the decreased GMV and DMPs methylation status in the anterior cingulate cortex, inferior frontal cortex, and fusiform face cortex regions. These DMPs genes were primarily enriched in the neurodevelopmental and synaptic transmission process. There was a significant negative correlation between DNA methylation and gene expression in genes associated with GMV changes of the frontal cortex in MDD. Our findings suggest that GMV abnormalities in MDD may have a transcriptomic and epigenetic basis. This imaging-transcriptomic-epigenetic integrative analysis provides spatial and biological links between cortical morphological deficits and peripheral epigenetic signatures in MDD.",38195555,PMC10776753,10.1038/s41398-023-02724-8,0,Translational psychiatry,101562664,7.989
Comprehensive characterization of immune- and inflammation-associated biomarkers based on multi-omics integration in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma,"Background:Kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) is the most common type of kidney cancer in adults, and it is responsible for approximately 90-95% of cases. Although extensive evidence has suggested that many immune- and inflammation-related genes could serve as effective biomarkers in KIRC, the potential associations among immune-, inflammation- and KIRC-related genes has not been sufficiently understood.Methods:Here, we integrated multiple levels of data to construct an immune-, inflammation- or KIRC-directed neighbour network (IIKDN network) and a KIRC-related gene-directed network (KIRCD network).Results:Our analysis suggested that immune- and inflammation-related genes in the network have special topological characteristics and expression patterns related to KIRC. We further identified five core clusters that showed a tighter network structure and stronger correlation of expression from the KIRCD network. Specifically, multiple-level molecular characteristics were systematically portrayed, including somatic mutation, copy-number variant and DNA methylation for the genes in five core clusters. We discovered that the genes showed strong correlation with respect to the expression and methylation levels in these five core clusters. These five core clusters could become special prognostic biomarkers for KIRC, and functional analysis showed that they were associated with activation of the immune and inflammation systems and cancer progression.Conclusions:Our findings highlighted the novel role of the immune and inflammation genes in KIRC.",31133033,PMC6537414,10.1186/s12967-019-1927-y,10,Journal of translational medicine,101190741,8.44
Predicting Deep Learning Based Multi-Omics Parallel Integration Survival Subtypes in Lung Cancer Using Reverse Phase Protein Array Data,"Mortality attributed to lung cancer accounts for a large fraction of cancer deaths worldwide. With increasing mortality figures, the accurate prediction of prognosis has become essential. In recent years, multi-omics analysis has emerged as a useful survival prediction tool. However, the methodology relevant to multi-omics analysis has not yet been fully established and further improvements are required for clinical applications. In this study, we developed a novel method to accurately predict the survival of patients with lung cancer using multi-omics data. With unsupervised learning techniques, survival-associated subtypes in non-small cell lung cancer were first detected using the multi-omics datasets from six categories in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The new subtypes, referred to as integration survival subtypes, clearly divided patients into longer and shorter-surviving groups (log-rank test:p= 0.003) and we confirmed that this is independent of histopathological classification (Chi-square test of independence:p= 0.94). Next, an attempt was made to detect the integration survival subtypes using only one categorical dataset. Our machine learning model that was only trained on the reverse phase protein array (RPPA) could accurately predict the integration survival subtypes (AUC = 0.99). The predicted subtypes could also distinguish between high and low risk patients (log-rank test:p= 0.012). Overall, this study explores novel potentials of multi-omics analysis to accurately predict the prognosis of patients with lung cancer.",33086649,PMC7603376,10.3390/biom10101460,28,Biomolecules,101596414,6.064
Multi-Omics Analysis of Gut Microbiota and Host Transcriptomics Reveal Dysregulated Immune Response and Metabolism in Young Adults with Irritable Bowel Syndrome,"The integrated dysbiosis of gut microbiota and altered host transcriptomics in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is yet to be known. This study investigated the associations among gut microbiota and host transcriptomics in young adults with IBS. Stool and peripheral blood samples from 20 IBS subjects and 21 healthy controls (HCs) collected at the baseline visit of an RCT were sequenced to depict the gut microbiota and transcriptomic profiles, respectively. The diversities, composition, and predicted metabolic pathways of gut microbiota significantly differed between IBS subjects and HCs. Nine genera were significantly abundant in IBS stool samples, includingAkkermansia,Blautia,Coprococcus,Granulicatella,Holdemania,Oribacterium,Oscillospira,Parabacteroides, andSutterella. There were 2264 DEGs found between IBS subjects and HCs; 768 were upregulated, and 1496 were downregulated in IBS participants compared with HCs. The enriched gene ontology included the immune system process and immune response. The pathway of antigen processing and presentation (hsa04612) in gut microbiota was also significantly different in the RNA-seq data.Akkermansia,Blautia,Holdemania, andSutterellawere significantly correlated withANXA2P2(upregulated, positive correlations),PCSK1N(downregulated, negative correlations), andGLTPD2(downregulated, negative correlations). This study identified the dysregulated immune response and metabolism in IBS participants revealed by the altered gut microbiota and transcriptomic profiles.",38542485,PMC10970623,10.3390/ijms25063514,0,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,6.208
Multi-omics integrative modelling for stereotactic body radiotherapy in early-stage non-small cell lung cancer: clinical trial protocol of the MONDRIAN study,"Background:Currently, main treatment strategies for early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (ES-NSCLC) disease are surgery or stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), with successful local control rates for both approaches. However, regional and distant failure remain critical in SBRT, and it is paramount to identify predictive factors of response to identify high-risk patients who may benefit from more aggressive approaches. The main endpoint of the MONDRIAN trial is to identify multi-omic biomarkers of SBRT response integrating information from the individual fields of radiomics, genomics and proteomics.Methods:MONDRIAN is a prospective observational explorative cohort clinical study, with a data-driven, bottom-up approach. It is expected to enroll 100 ES-NSCLC SBRT candidates treated at an Italian tertiary cancer center with well-recognized expertise in SBRT and thoracic surgery. To identify predictors specific to SBRT, MONDRIAN will include data from 200 patients treated with surgery, in a 1:2 ratio, with comparable clinical characteristics. The project will have an overall expected duration of 60 months, and will be structured into five main tasks: (i) Clinical Study; (ii) Imaging/ Radiomic Study, (iii) Gene Expression Study, (iv) Proteomic Study, (v) Integrative Model Building.Discussion:Thanks to its multi-disciplinary nature, MONDRIAN is expected to provide the opportunity to characterize ES-NSCLC from a multi-omic perspective, with a Radiation Oncology-oriented focus. Other than contributing to a mechanistic understanding of the disease, the study will assist the identification of high-risk patients in a largely unexplored clinical setting. Ultimately, this would orient further clinical research efforts on the combination of SBRT and systemic treatments, such as immunotherapy, with the perspective of improving oncological outcomes in this subset of patients.Trial registration:The study was prospectively registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT05974475).",38102575,PMC10722797,10.1186/s12885-023-11701-9,0,BMC cancer,100967800,4.638
A directed learning strategy integrating multiple omic data improves genomic prediction,"Genomic prediction (GP) aims to construct a statistical model for predicting phenotypes using genome-wide markers and is a promising strategy for accelerating molecular plant breeding. However, current progress of phenotype prediction using genomic data alone has reached a bottleneck, and previous studies on transcriptomic and metabolomic predictions ignored genomic information. Here, we designed a novel strategy of GP called multilayered least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (MLLASSO) by integrating multiple omic data into a single model that iteratively learns three layers of genetic features (GFs) supervised by observed transcriptome and metabolome. Significantly, MLLASSO learns higher order information of gene interactions, which enables us to achieve a significant improvement of predictability of yield in rice from 0.1588 (GP alone) to 0.2451 (MLLASSO). In the prediction of the first two layers, some genes were found to be genetically predictable genes (GPGs) as their expressions were accurately predicted with genetic markers. Interestingly, we made three dramatic discoveries for the GPGs: (i) GPGs are good predictors for highly complex traits like yield; (ii) GPGs are mostly eQTL genes (cis or trans); and (iii) trait-related transcriptional factor families are enriched in GPGs. These findings support the notion that learned GFs not only are good predictors for traits but also have specific biological implications regarding regulation of gene expressions. To differentiate the new method from conventional GP models, we called MLLASSO a directed learning strategy supervised by intermediate omic data. This new prediction model appears to be more reliable and more robust than conventional GP models.",30950198,PMC6737184,10.1111/pbi.13117,15,Plant biotechnology journal,101201889,13.263

Deep structure integrative representation of multi-omics data for cancer subtyping,"Motivation:Cancer is a heterogeneous group of diseases. Cancer subtyping is a crucial and critical step to diagnosis, prognosis and treatment. Since high-throughput sequencing technologies provide an unprecedented opportunity to rapidly collect multi-omics data for the same individuals, an urgent need in current is how to effectively represent and integrate these multi-omics data to achieve clinically meaningful cancer subtyping.Results:We propose a novel deep learning model, called Deep Structure Integrative Representation (DSIR), for cancer subtypes dentification by integrating representation and clustering multi-omics data. DSIR simultaneously captures the global structures in sparse subspace and local structures in manifold subspace from multi-omics data and constructs a consensus similarity matrix by utilizing deep neural networks.

GraphOmics: an interactive platform to explore and integrate multi-omics data,"Background:An increasing number of studies now produce multiple omics measurements that require using sophisticated computational methods for analysis. While each omics data can be examined separately, jointly integrating multiple omics data allows for deeper understanding and insights to be gained from the study. In particular, data integration can be performed horizontally, where biological entities from multiple omics measurements are mapped to common reactions and pathways. However, data integration remains a challenge due to the complexity of the data and the difficulty in interpreting analysis results.Results:Here we present GraphOmics, a user-friendly platform to explore and integrate multiple omics datasets and support hypothesis generation. Users can upload transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics data to GraphOmics. Relevant entities are connected based on their biochemical relationships, and mapped to reactions and pathways from Reactome. From the Data Browser in GraphOmics, mapped entities and pathways can be ranked, sorted and filtered according to their statistical significance (p values) and fold changes. Context-sensitive panels provide information on the currently selected entities, while interactive heatmaps and clustering functionalities are also available. As a case study, we demonstrated how GraphOmics was used to interactively explore multi-omics data and support hypothesis generation using two complex datasets from existing Zebrafish regeneration and Covid-19 human studies.Conclusions:GraphOmics is fully open-sourced and freely accessible from https://graphomics.glasgowcompbio.org/ .

"Identification, semantic annotation and comparison of combinations of functional elements in multiple biological conditions","Motivation:Approaches such as chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) represent the standard for the identification of binding sites of DNA-associated proteins, including transcription factors and histone marks. Public repositories of omics data contain a huge number of experimental ChIP-seq data, but their reuse and integrative analysis across multiple conditions remain a daunting task.Results:We present the Combinatorial and Semantic Analysis of Functional Elements (CombSAFE), an efficient computational method able to integrate and take advantage of the valuable and numerous, but heterogeneous, ChIP-seq data publicly available in big data repositories. Leveraging natural language processing techniques, it integrates omics data samples with semantic annotations from selected biomedical ontologies; then, using hidden Markov models, it identifies combinations of static and dynamic functional elements throughout the genome for the corresponding samples. CombSAFE allows analyzing the whole genome, by clustering patterns of regions with similar functional elements and through enrichment analyses to discover ontological terms significantly associated with them. Moreover, it allows comparing functional states of a specific genomic region to analyze their different behavior throughout the various semantic annotations. Such findings can provide novel insights by identifying unexpected combinations of functional elements in different biological conditions.Availability and implementation:The Python implementation of the CombSAFE pipeline is freely available for non-commercial use at: https://github.com/DEIB-GECO/CombSAFE.Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",34864898,,10.1093/bioinformatics/btab815,1,"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",9808944,6.931
A Practical Guide for Comparative Genomics of Mobile Genetic Elements in Prokaryotic Genomes,"Mobile genetic elements (MGEs) are an important feature of prokaryote genomes but are seldom well annotated and, consequently, are often underestimated. MGEs include transposons (Tn), insertion sequences (ISs), prophages, genomic islands (GEIs), integrons, and integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs). They are intimately involved in genome evolution and promote phenomena such as genomic expansion and rearrangement, emergence of virulence and pathogenicity, and symbiosis. In spite of the annotation bottleneck, there are so far at least 75 different programs and databases dedicated to prokaryotic MGE analysis and annotation, and this number is rapidly growing. Here, we present a practical guide to explore, compare, and visualize prokaryote MGEs using a combination of available software and databases tailored to small scale genome analyses. This protocol can be coupled with expert MGE annotation and exploited for evolutionary and comparative genomic analyses.",29277867,,10.1007/978-1-4939-7463-4_7,10,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,0.0
Tear nanoDSF Denaturation Profile Is Predictive of Glaucoma,"Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is a frequent blindness-causing neurodegenerative disorder characterized by optic nerve and retinal ganglion cell damage most commonly due to a chronic increase in intraocular pressure. The preservation of visual function in patients critically depends on the timeliness of detection and treatment of the disease, which is challenging due to its asymptomatic course at early stages and lack of objective diagnostic approaches. Recent studies revealed that the pathophysiology of glaucoma includes complex metabolomic and proteomic alterations in the eye liquids, including tear fluid (TF). Although TF can be collected by a non-invasive procedure and may serve as a source of the appropriate biomarkers, its multi-omics analysis is technically sophisticated and unsuitable for clinical practice. In this study, we tested a novel concept of glaucoma diagnostics based on the rapid high-performance analysis of the TF proteome by differential scanning fluorimetry (nanoDSF). An examination of the thermal denaturation of TF proteins in a cohort of 311 ophthalmic patients revealed typical profiles, with two peaks exhibiting characteristic shifts in POAG. Clustering of the profiles according to peaks maxima allowed us to identify glaucoma in 70% of cases, while the employment of artificial intelligence (machine learning) algorithms reduced the amount of false-positive diagnoses to 13.5%. The POAG-associated alterations in the core TF proteins included an increase in the concentration of serum albumin, accompanied by a decrease in lysozyme C, lipocalin-1, and lactotransferrin contents. Unexpectedly, these changes were not the only factor affecting the observed denaturation profile shifts, which considerably depended on the presence of low-molecular-weight ligands of tear proteins, such as fatty acids and iron. Overall, we recognized the TF denaturation profile as a novel biomarker of glaucoma, which integrates proteomic, lipidomic, and metallomic alterations in tears, and monitoring of which could be adapted for rapid non-invasive screening of the disease in a clinical setting.",37108298,PMC10139145,10.3390/ijms24087132,0,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,6.208
Diagnosis and treatment of cancer using genomics,"The field of cancer diagnostics is in constant flux as a result of the rapid discovery of new genes associated with cancer, improvements in laboratory techniques for identifying disease causing events, and novel analytic methods that enable the integration of many different types of data. These advances have helped in the identification of novel, informative biomarkers. As more whole genome sequence data are generated and analyzed, emerging information on the baseline variability of the human genome has shown the importance of the ancestral genomic background in patients with a potential disease causing variant. The recent discovery of many novel DNA sequence variants, advances in sequencing and genomic technology, and improved analytic methods enable the impact of germline and somatic genome variation on tumorigenesis and metastasis to be determined.

A Multi-Omics Common Data Model for Primary Immunodeficiencies,"Primary Immunodeficiencies (PIDs) are associated with more than 400 rare monogenic diseases affecting various biological functions (e.g., development, regulation of the immune response) with a heterogeneous clinical expression (from no symptom to severe manifestations). To better understand PIDs, the ATRACTion project aims to perform a multi-omics analysis of PIDs cases versus a control group patients, including single-cell transcriptomics, epigenetics, proteomics, metabolomics, metagenomics and lipidomics. In this study, our goal is to develop a common data model integrating clinical and omics data, which can be used to obtain standardized information necessary for characterization of PIDs patients and for further systematic analysis. For that purpose, we extend the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM) and propose a multi-omics ATRACTion OMOP-CDM to integrate multi-omics data. This model, available for the community, is customizable for other types of rare diseases (https://framagit.org/imagine-plateforme-bdd/pub-rhu4-atraction).",35672970,,10.3233/SHTI220031,1,Studies in health technology and informatics,9214582,0.0
Whole-Genome Annotation with BRAKER,"BRAKER is a pipeline for highly accurate and fully automated gene prediction in novel eukaryotic genomes. It combines two major tools: GeneMark-ES/ET and AUGUSTUS. GeneMark-ES/ET learns its parameters from a novel genomic sequence in a fully automated fashion; if available, it uses extrinsic evidence for model refinement. From the protein-coding genes predicted by GeneMark-ES/ET, we select a set for training AUGUSTUS, one of the most accurate gene finding tools that, in contrast to GeneMark-ES/ET, integrates extrinsic evidence already into the gene prediction step. The first published version, BRAKER1, integrated genomic footprints of unassembled RNA-Seq reads into the training as well as into the prediction steps. The pipeline has since been extended to the integration of data on mapped cross-species proteins, and to the usage of heterogeneous extrinsic evidence, both RNA-Seq and protein alignments. In this book chapter, we briefly summarize the pipeline methodology and describe how to apply BRAKER in environments characterized by various combinations of external evidence.",31020555,PMC6635606,10.1007/978-1-4939-9173-0_5,271,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,0.0
An integrative imputation method based on multi-omics datasets,"Background:Integrative analysis of multi-omics data is becoming increasingly important to unravel functional mechanisms of complex diseases. However, the currently available multi-omics datasets inevitably suffer from missing values due to technical limitations and various constrains in experiments. These missing values severely hinder integrative analysis of multi-omics data. Current imputation methods mainly focus on using single omics data while ignoring biological interconnections and information imbedded in multi-omics data sets.Results:In this study, a novel multi-omics imputation method was proposed to integrate multiple correlated omics datasets for improving the imputation accuracy. Our method was designed to: 1) combine the estimates of missing value from individual omics data itself as well as from other omics, and 2) simultaneously impute multiple missing omics datasets by an iterative algorithm. We compared our method with five imputation methods using single omics data at different noise levels, sample sizes and data missing rates. The results demonstrated the advantage and efficiency of our method, consistently in terms of the imputation error and the recovery of mRNA-miRNA network structure.Conclusions:We concluded that our proposed imputation method can utilize more biological information to minimize the imputation error and thus can improve the performance of downstream analysis such as genetic regulatory network construction.",27329642,PMC4915152,10.1186/s12859-016-1122-6,17,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,3.307
Multi-Omics Characterization of Colon Mucosa and Submucosa/Wall from Crohn's Disease Patients,"Crohn's disease (CD) is a subtype of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) characterized by transmural disease. The concept of transmural healing (TH) has been proposed as an indicator of deep clinical remission of CD and as a predictor of favorable treatment endpoints. Understanding the pathophysiology involved in transmural disease is critical to achieving these endpoints. However, most studies have focused on the intestinal mucosa, overlooking the contribution of the intestinal wall in Crohn's disease. Multi-omics approaches have provided new avenues for exploring the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease and identifying potential biomarkers. We aimed to use transcriptomic and proteomic technologies to compare immune and mesenchymal cell profiles and pathways in the mucosal and submucosa/wall compartments to better understand chronic refractory disease elements to achieve transmural healing. The results revealed similarities and differences in gene and protein expression profiles, metabolic mechanisms, and immune and non-immune pathways between these two compartments. Additionally, the identification of protein isoforms highlights the complex molecular mechanisms underlying this disease, such as decreased RTN4 isoforms (RTN4B2 and RTN4C) in the submucosa/wall, which may be related to the dysregulation of enteric neural processes. These findings have the potential to inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies to achieve TH.",38791146,PMC11121447,10.3390/ijms25105108,0,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,6.208
Inter-kingdom interactions and stability of methanogens revealed by machine-learning guided multi-omics analysis of industrial-scale biogas plants,"Multi-omics analysis is a powerful tool for the detection and study of inter-kingdom interactions, such as those between bacterial and archaeal members of complex biogas-producing microbial communities. In the present study, the microbiomes of three industrial-scale biogas digesters, each fed with different substrates, were analysed using a machine-learning guided genome-centric metagenomics framework complemented with metatranscriptome data. This data permitted us to elucidate the relationship between abundant core methanogenic communities and their syntrophic bacterial partners. In total, we detected 297 high-quality, non-redundant metagenome-assembled genomes (nrMAGs). Moreover, the assembled 16 S rRNA gene profiles of these nrMAGs showed that the phylum Firmicutes possessed the highest copy number, while the representatives of the archaeal domain had the lowest. Further investigation of the three anaerobic microbial communities showed characteristic alterations over time but remained specific to each industrial-scale biogas plant. The relative abundance of various microorganisms as revealed by metagenome data was independent from corresponding metatranscriptome activity data. Archaea showed considerably higher activity than was expected from their abundance. We detected 51 nrMAGs that were present in all three biogas plant microbiomes with different abundances. The core microbiome correlated with the main chemical fermentation parameters, and no individual parameter emerged as a predominant shaper of community composition. Various interspecies H2/electron transfer mechanisms were assigned to hydrogenotrophic methanogens in the biogas plants that ran on agricultural biomass and wastewater. Analysis of metatranscriptome data revealed that methanogenesis pathways were the most active of all main metabolic pathways.",37286740,PMC10356833,10.1038/s41396-023-01448-3,2,The ISME journal,101301086,11.217
Dissecting the molecular features of bovine-arrested eight-cell embryos using single-cell multi-omics sequencing†,"The regulation of mammalian early-embryonic development is a complex, coordinated process that involves widespread transcriptomic and epigenetic remodeling. The main cause of developmental failure in preimplantation embryos after in vitro fertilization is the irreversible arrested-at-cleavage stage. To deepen our understanding of this embryonic block, we profiled a single-cell multi-omics map of copy number variations (CNVs), the transcriptome, the DNA methylome, and the chromatin state of bovine eight-cell embryos with a two-cell fate that either arrested or developed into blastocysts. To do this, we sequenced a biopsied blastomere and tracked the developmental potential of the remaining cells. Aneuploid embryos inferred by CNVs from DNA- and RNA-library data tended to lose their developmental potency. Analysis of distinct genomic regions of DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility revealed that enrichment of gene function and signaling pathways, such as the MAPK signaling pathway, was altered in arrested euploid eight-cell embryos compared with blastocyst-developed euploid eight-cell embryos. Moreover, the RNA expression and chromatin accessibility of embryonic genome activation-associated genes were lower in arrested euploid embryos than in blastocyst-developed embryos. Taken together, our results indicate that the developmental block of eight-cell embryos can be caused by multiple molecular layers, including CNVs, abnormality of DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility, and insufficient expression of embryonic genome activation-associated genes. Our integrated and comprehensive data set provides a valuable resource to further dissect the exact mechanisms underlying the arrest of bovine eight-cell embryos in vitro.",36961504,,10.1093/biolre/ioad038,1,Biology of reproduction,207224,4.161
"Synthetic lethality prediction in DNA damage repair, chromatin remodeling and the cell cycle using multi-omics data from cell lines and patients","Discovering synthetic lethal (SL) gene partners of cancer genes is an important step in developing cancer therapies. However, identification of SL interactions is challenging, due to a large number of possible gene pairs, inherent noise and confounding factors in the observed signal. To discover robust SL interactions, we devised SLIDE-VIP, a novel framework combining eight statistical tests, including a new patient data-based test iSurvLRT. SLIDE-VIP leverages multi-omics data from four different sources: gene inactivation cell line screens, cancer patient data, drug screens and gene pathways. We applied SLIDE-VIP to discover SL interactions between genes involved in DNA damage repair, chromatin remodeling and cell cycle, and their potentially druggable partners. The top 883 ranking SL candidates had strong evidence in cell line and patient data, 250-fold reducing the initial space of 200K pairs. Drug screen and pathway tests provided additional corroboration and insights into these interactions. We rediscovered well-known SL pairs such as RB1 and E2F3 or PRKDC and ATM, and in addition, proposed strong novel SL candidates such as PTEN and PIK3CB. In summary, SLIDE-VIP opens the door to the discovery of SL interactions with clinical potential. All analysis and visualizations are available via the online SLIDE-VIP WebApp.",37120674,PMC10148866,10.1038/s41598-023-34161-4,0,Scientific reports,101563288,4.996
New Genome Similarity Measures based on Conserved Gene Adjacencies,"Many important questions in molecular biology, evolution, and biomedicine can be addressed by comparative genomic approaches. One of the basic tasks when comparing genomes is the definition of measures of similarity (or dissimilarity) between two genomes, for example, to elucidate the phylogenetic relationships between species. The power of different genome comparison methods varies with the underlying formal model of a genome. The simplest models impose the strong restriction that each genome under study must contain the same genes, each in exactly one copy. More realistic models allow several copies of a gene in a genome. One speaks of gene families, and comparative genomic methods that allow this kind of input are called gene family-based. The most powerful-but also most complex-models avoid this preprocessing of the input data and instead integrate the family assignment within the comparative analysis. Such methods are called gene family-free. In this article, we study an intermediate approach between family-based and family-free genomic similarity measures. Introducing this simpler model, called gene connections, we focus on the combinatorial aspects of gene family-free genome comparison. While in most cases, the computational costs to the general family-free case are the same, we also find an instance where the gene connections model has lower complexity. Within the gene connections model, we define three variants of genomic similarity measures that have different expression powers. We give polynomial-time algorithms for two of them, while we show NP-hardness for the third, most powerful one. We also generalize the measures and algorithms to make them more robust against recent local disruptions in gene order. Our theoretical findings are supported by experimental results, proving the applicability and performance of our newly defined similarity measures.",28590847,,10.1089/cmb.2017.0065,2,Journal of computational biology : a journal of computational molecular cell,9433358,1.549
CoreCruncher: Fast and Robust Construction of Core Genomes in Large Prokaryotic Data Sets,"The core genome represents the set of genes shared by all, or nearly all, strains of a given population or species of prokaryotes. Inferring the core genome is integral to many genomic analyses, however, most methods rely on the comparison of all the pairs of genomes; a step that is becoming increasingly difficult given the massive accumulation of genomic data. Here, we present CoreCruncher; a program that robustly and rapidly constructs core genomes across hundreds or thousands of genomes. CoreCruncher does not compute all pairwise genome comparisons and uses a heuristic based on the distributions of identity scores to classify sequences as orthologs or paralogs/xenologs. Although it is much faster than current methods, our results indicate that our approach is more conservative than other tools and less sensitive to the presence of paralogs and xenologs. CoreCruncher is freely available from: https://github.com/lbobay/CoreCruncher. CoreCruncher is written in Python 3.7 and can also run on Python 2.7 without modification. It requires the python library Numpy and either Usearch or Blast.

GALLO: An R package for genomic annotation and integration of multiple data sources in livestock for positional candidate loci,"Background:The development of high-throughput sequencing and genotyping methodologies has enabled the identification of thousands of genomic regions associated with several complex traits. The integration of multiple sources of biological information is a crucial step required to better understand patterns regulating the development of these traits.Findings:Genomic Annotation in Livestock for positional candidate LOci (GALLO) is an R package developed for the accurate annotation of genes and quantitative trait loci (QTLs) located in regions identified in common genomic analyses performed in livestock, such as genome-wide association studies and transcriptomics using RNA sequencing. Moreover, GALLO allows the graphical visualization of gene and QTL annotation results, data comparison among different grouping factors (e.g., methods, breeds, tissues, statistical models, studies), and QTL enrichment in different livestock species such as cattle, pigs, sheep, and chickens.Conclusions:Consequently, GALLO is a useful package for annotation, identification of hidden patterns across datasets, and data mining previously reported associations, as well as the efficient examination of the genetic architecture of complex traits in livestock.",33377911,PMC7772745,10.1093/gigascience/giaa149,58,GigaScience,101596872,7.658
scMNMF: a novel method for single-cell multi-omics clustering based on matrix factorization,"Motivation:The technology for analyzing single-cell multi-omics data has advanced rapidly and has provided comprehensive and accurate cellular information by exploring cell heterogeneity in genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, metabolomics and proteomics data. However, because of the high-dimensional and sparse characteristics of single-cell multi-omics data, as well as the limitations of various analysis algorithms, the clustering performance is generally poor. Matrix factorization is an unsupervised, dimensionality reduction-based method that can cluster individuals and discover related omics variables from different blocks. Here, we present a novel algorithm that performs joint dimensionality reduction learning and cell clustering analysis on single-cell multi-omics data using non-negative matrix factorization that we named scMNMF. We formulate the objective function of joint learning as a constrained optimization problem and derive the corresponding iterative formulas through alternating iterative algorithms. The major advantage of the scMNMF algorithm remains its capability to explore hidden related features among omics data. Additionally, the feature selection for dimensionality reduction and cell clustering mutually influence each other iteratively, leading to a more effective discovery of cell types. We validated the performance of the scMNMF algorithm using two simulated and five real datasets. The results show that scMNMF outperformed seven other state-of-the-art algorithms in various measurements.Availability and implementation:scMNMF code can be found at https://github.com/yushanqiu/scMNMF.",38754408,PMC11097994,10.1093/bib/bbae228,0,Briefings in bioinformatics,100912837,13.994
A multi-omic analysis reveals the esophageal dysbiosis as the predominant trait of eosinophilic esophagitis,"Background:Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic immune-mediated rare disease, characterized by esophageal dysfunctions. It is likely to be primarily activated by food antigens and is classified as a chronic disease for most patients. Therefore, a deeper understanding of the pathogenetic mechanisms underlying EoE is needed to implement and improve therapeutic lines of intervention and ameliorate overall patient wellness.Methods:RNA-seq data of 18 different studies on EoE, downloaded from NCBI GEO with faster-qdump ( https://github.com/ncbi/sra-tools ), were batch-corrected and analyzed for transcriptomics and metatranscriptomics profiling as well as biological process functional enrichment. The EoE TaMMA web app was designed with plotly and dash. Tabula Sapiens raw data were downloaded from the UCSC Cell Browser. Esophageal single-cell raw data analysis was performed within the Automated Single-cell Analysis Pipeline. Single-cell data-driven bulk RNA-seq data deconvolution was performed with MuSiC and CIBERSORTx. Multi-omics integration was performed with MOFA.Results:The EoE TaMMA framework pointed out disease-specific molecular signatures, confirming its reliability in reanalyzing transcriptomic data, and providing new EoE-specific molecular markers including CXCL14, distinguishing EoE from gastroesophageal reflux disorder. EoE TaMMA also revealed microbiota dysbiosis as a predominant characteristic of EoE pathogenesis. Finally, the multi-omics analysis highlighted the presence of defined classes of microbial entities in subsets of patients that may participate in inducing the antigen-mediated response typical of EoE pathogenesis.Conclusions:Our study showed that the complex EoE molecular network may be unraveled through advanced bioinformatics, integrating different components of the disease process into an omics-based network approach. This may implement EoE management and treatment in the coming years.",36698146,PMC9875471,10.1186/s12967-023-03898-x,16,Journal of translational medicine,101190741,8.44
Multi-omics analysis reveals Mn exposure affects ferroptosis pathway in zebrafish brain,"Manganese (Mn) accumulates in the central nervous system and can cause neurotoxicity, but the mechanisms of Mn-induced neurotoxicity remain unclear. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of zebrafish brain after Mn exposure and identified 10 cell types by marker genes: cholinergic neurons, dopaminergic (DA) neurons, glutaminergic neurons, GABAergic neurons, neuronal precursors, other neurons, microglia, oligodendrocyte, radial glia, and undefined cells. Each cell type has its distinct transcriptome profile. Pseudotime analysis revealed that DA neurons had a critical role in Mn-induced neurological damage. Combined with metabolomic data, chronic Mn exposure significantly impaired amino acid and lipid metabolic processes in the brain. Furthermore, we found that Mn exposure disrupted the ferroptosis signaling pathway in the DA neurons in zebrafish. Overall, our study employed joint analysis of multi-omics and revealed ferroptosis signaling pathway is a novel potential mechanism of Mn neurotoxicity.",36796209,,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2023.114616,3,Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,7805381,7.129
TACCO unifies annotation transfer and decomposition of cell identities for single-cell and spatial omics,"Transferring annotations of single-cell-, spatial- and multi-omics data is often challenging owing both to technical limitations, such as low spatial resolution or high dropout fraction, and to biological variations, such as continuous spectra of cell states. Based on the concept that these data are often best described as continuous mixtures of cells or molecules, we present a computational framework for the transfer of annotations to cells and their combinations (TACCO), which consists of an optimal transport model extended with different wrappers to annotate a wide variety of data. We apply TACCO to identify cell types and states, decipher spatiomolecular tissue structure at the cell and molecular level and resolve differentiation trajectories using synthetic and biological datasets. While matching or exceeding the accuracy of specialized tools for the individual tasks, TACCO reduces the computational requirements by up to an order of magnitude and scales to larger datasets (for example, considering the runtime of annotation transfer for 1 M simulated dropout observations).",36797494,PMC10513360,10.1038/s41587-023-01657-3,7,Nature biotechnology,9604648,68.164
Predicting brain-regional gene regulatory networks from multi-omics for Alzheimer's disease phenotypes and Covid-19 severity,"Neuroinflammation and immune dysregulation play a key role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and are also associated with severe Covid-19 and neurological symptoms. Also, genome-wide association studies found many risk single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for AD and Covid-19. However, our understanding of underlying gene regulatory mechanisms from risk SNPs to AD, Covid-19 and phenotypes is still limited. To this end, we performed an integrative multi-omics analysis to predict gene regulatory networks for major brain regions from population data in AD. Our networks linked transcription factors (TFs) to TF binding sites (TFBSs) on regulatory elements to target genes. Comparative network analyses revealed cross-region-conserved and region-specific regulatory networks, in which many immunological genes are present. Furthermore, we identified a list of AD-Covid genes using our networks involving known and Covid-19 genes. Our machine learning analysis prioritized 36 AD-Covid candidate genes for predicting Covid severity. Our independent validation analyses found that these genes outperform known genes for classifying Covid-19 severity and AD. Finally, we mapped genome-wide association study SNPs of AD and severe Covid that interrupt TFBSs on our regulatory networks, revealing potential mechanistic insights of those disease risk variants. Our analyses and results are open-source available, providing an AD-Covid functional genomic resource at the brain region level.",36648426,PMC10196687,10.1093/hmg/ddad009,2,Human molecular genetics,9208958,5.121
"Integration of transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics data to reveal HER2-associated metabolic heterogeneity in gastric cancer with response to immunotherapy and neoadjuvant chemotherapy","Background:Currently available prognostic tools and focused therapeutic methods result in unsatisfactory treatment of gastric cancer (GC). A deeper understanding of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-coexpressed metabolic pathways may offer novel insights into tumour-intrinsic precision medicine.Methods:The integrated multi-omics strategies (including transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics) were applied to develop a novel metabolic classifier for gastric cancer. We integrated TCGA-STAD cohort (375 GC samples and 56753 genes) and TCPA-STAD cohort (392 GC samples and 218 proteins), and rated them as transcriptomics and proteomics data, resepectively. 224 matched blood samples of GC patients and healthy individuals were collected to carry out untargeted metabolomics analysis.Results:In this study, pan-cancer analysis highlighted the crucial role of ERBB2 in the immune microenvironment and metabolic remodelling. In addition, the metabolic landscape of GC indicated that alanine, aspartate and glutamate (AAG) metabolism was significantly associated with the prevalence and progression of GC. Weighted metabolite correlation network analysis revealed that glycolysis/gluconeogenesis (GG) and AAG metabolism served as HER2-coexpressed metabolic pathways. Consensus clustering was used to stratify patients with GC into four subtypes with different metabolic characteristics (i.e. quiescent, GG, AAG and mixed subtypes). The GG subtype was characterised by a lower level of ERBB2 expression, a higher proportion of the inflammatory phenotype and the worst prognosis. However, contradictory features were found in the mixed subtype with the best prognosis. The GG and mixed subtypes were found to be highly sensitive to chemotherapy, whereas the quiescent and AAG subtypes were more likely to benefit from immunotherapy.Conclusions:Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses highlighted the close association of HER-2 level with the immune status and metabolic features of patients with GC. Metabolomics analysis highlighted the co-expressed relationship between alanine, aspartate and glutamate and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis metabolisms and HER2 level in GC. The novel integrated multi-omics strategy used in this study may facilitate the development of a more tailored approach to GC therapy.",35990657,PMC9389544,10.3389/fimmu.2022.951137,43,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,8.786
FractBias: a graphical tool for assessing fractionation bias following polyploidy,"Summary:Following polyploidy events, genomes undergo massive reduction in gene content through a process known as fractionation. Importantly, the fractionation process is not always random, and a bias as to which homeologous chromosome retains or loses more genes can be observed in some species. The process of characterizing whole genome fractionation requires identifying syntenic regions across genomes followed by post-processing of those syntenic datasets to identify and plot gene retention patterns. We have developed a tool, FractBias, to calculate and visualize gene retention and fractionation patterns across whole genomes. Through integration with SynMap and its parent platform CoGe, assembled genomes are pre-loaded and available for analysis, as well as letting researchers integrate their own data with security options to keep them private or make them publicly available.Availability and implementation:FractBias is freely available as a web application at https://genomevolution.org/CoGe/SynMap.pl .

RGmatch: matching genomic regions to proximal genes in omics data integration,"Background:The integrative analysis of multiple genomics data often requires that genome coordinates-based signals have to be associated with proximal genes. The relative location of a genomic region with respect to the gene (gene area) is important for functional data interpretation; hence algorithms that match regions to genes should be able to deliver insight into this information.Results:In this work we review the tools that are publicly available for making region-to-gene associations. We also present a novel method, RGmatch, a flexible and easy-to-use Python tool that computes associations either at the gene, transcript, or exon level, applying a set of rules to annotate each region-gene association with the region location within the gene. RGmatch can be applied to any organism as long as genome annotation is available. Furthermore, we qualitatively and quantitatively compare RGmatch to other tools.Conclusions:RGmatch simplifies the association of a genomic region with its closest gene. At the same time, it is a powerful tool because the rules used to annotate these associations are very easy to modify according to the researcher's specific interests. Some important differences between RGmatch and other similar tools already in existence are RGmatch's flexibility, its wide range of user options, compatibility with any annotatable organism, and its comprehensive and user-friendly output.",28185573,PMC5133492,10.1186/s12859-016-1293-1,8,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,3.307
Building pan-genome infrastructures for crop plants and their use in association genetics,"Pan-genomic studies aim at representing the entire sequence diversity within a species to provide useful resources for evolutionary studies, functional genomics and breeding of cultivated plants. Cost reductions in high-throughput sequencing and advances in sequence assembly algorithms have made it possible to create multiple reference genomes along with a catalogue of all forms of genetic variations in plant species with large and complex or polyploid genomes. In this review, we summarize the current approaches to building pan-genomes as an in silico representation of plant sequence diversity and outline relevant methods for their effective utilization in linking structural with phenotypic variation.

GliomaDB: A Web Server for Integrating Glioma Omics Data and Interactive Analysis,"Gliomas are one of the most common types of brain cancers. Numerous efforts have been devoted to studying the mechanisms of glioma genesis and identifying biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment. To help further investigations, we present a comprehensive database named GliomaDB. GliomaDB includes 21,086 samples from 4303 patients and integrates genomic, transcriptomic, epigenomic, clinical, and gene-drug association data regarding glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and low-grade glioma (LGG) from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA), the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets (MSK-IMPACT), the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and PharmGKB.

Hound: a novel tool for automated mapping of genotype to phenotype in bacterial genomes assembled de novo,"Increasing evidence suggests that microbial species have a strong within species genetic heterogeneity. This can be problematic for the analysis of prokaryote genomes, which commonly relies on a reference genome to guide the assembly process. Differences between reference and sample genomes will therefore introduce errors in final assembly, jeopardizing the detection from structural variations to point mutations-critical for genomic surveillance of antibiotic resistance. Here we present Hound, a pipeline that integrates publicly available tools to assemble prokaryote genomes de novo, detect user-given genes by similarity to report mutations found in the coding sequence, promoter, as well as relative gene copy number within the assembly. Importantly, Hound can use the query sequence as a guide to merge contigs, and reconstruct genes that were fragmented by the assembler. To showcase Hound, we screened through 5032 bacterial whole-genome sequences isolated from farmed animals and human infections, using the amino acid sequence encoded by blaTEM-1, to detect and predict resistance to amoxicillin/clavulanate which is driven by over-expression of this gene. We believe this tool can facilitate the analysis of prokaryote species that currently lack a reference genome, and can be scaled either up to build automated systems for genomic surveillance or down to integrate into antibiotic susceptibility point-of-care diagnostics.",38385882,PMC10883467,10.1093/bib/bbae057,1,Briefings in bioinformatics,100912837,13.994
Multi-omics discovery of exome-derived neoantigens in hepatocellular carcinoma,"Background:Although mutated HLA ligands are considered ideal cancer-specific immunotherapy targets, evidence for their presentation is lacking in hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs). Employing a unique multi-omics approach comprising a neoepitope identification pipeline, we assessed exome-derived mutations naturally presented as HLA class I ligands in HCCs.Methods:In-depth multi-omics analyses included whole exome and transcriptome sequencing to define individual patient-specific search spaces of neoepitope candidates. Evidence for the natural presentation of mutated HLA ligands was investigated through an in silico pipeline integrating proteome and HLA ligandome profiling data.Results:The approach was successfully validated in a state-of-the-art dataset from malignant melanoma, and despite multi-omics evidence for somatic mutations, mutated naturally presented HLA ligands remained elusive in HCCs. An analysis of extensive cancer datasets confirmed fundamental differences of tumor mutational burden in HCC and malignant melanoma, challenging the notion that exome-derived mutations contribute relevantly to the expectable neoepitope pool in malignancies with only few mutations.Conclusions:This study suggests that exome-derived mutated HLA ligands appear to be rarely presented in HCCs, inter alia resulting from a low mutational burden as compared to other malignancies such as malignant melanoma. Our results therefore demand widening the target scope for personalized immunotherapy beyond this limited range of mutated neoepitopes, particularly for malignancies with similar or lower mutational burden.",31039795,PMC6492406,10.1186/s13073-019-0636-8,62,Genome medicine,101475844,15.266
Focal adhesion is associated with lithium response in bipolar disorder: evidence from a network-based multi-omics analysis,"Lithium (Li) is one of the most effective drugs for treating bipolar disorder (BD), however, there is presently no way to predict response to guide treatment. The aim of this study is to identify functional genes and pathways that distinguish BD Li responders (LR) from BD Li non-responders (NR). An initial Pharmacogenomics of Bipolar Disorder study (PGBD) GWAS of lithium response did not provide any significant results. As a result, we then employed network-based integrative analysis of transcriptomic and genomic data. In transcriptomic study of iPSC-derived neurons, 41 significantly differentially expressed (DE) genes were identified in LR vs NR regardless of lithium exposure. In the PGBD, post-GWAS gene prioritization using the GWA-boosting (GWAB) approach identified 1119 candidate genes. Following DE-derived network propagation, there was a highly significant overlap of genes between the top 500- and top 2000-proximal gene networks and the GWAB gene list (Phypergeometric= 1.28E-09 and 4.10E-18, respectively). Functional enrichment analyses of the top 500 proximal network genes identified focal adhesion and the extracellular matrix (ECM) as the most significant functions. Our findings suggest that the difference between LR and NR was a much greater effect than that of lithium. The direct impact of dysregulation of focal adhesion on axon guidance and neuronal circuits could underpin mechanisms of response to lithium, as well as underlying BD. It also highlights the power of integrative multi-omics analysis of transcriptomic and genomic profiling to gain molecular insights into lithium response in BD.",36991131,PMC11078741,10.1038/s41380-022-01909-9,7,Molecular psychiatry,9607835,13.437
An integrative analysis of the age-associated multi-omic landscape across cancers,"Age is the most important risk factor for cancer, as cancer incidence and mortality increase with age. However, how molecular alterations in tumours differ among patients of different age remains largely unexplored. Here, using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we comprehensively characterise genomic, transcriptomic and epigenetic alterations in relation to patients' age across cancer types. We show that tumours from older patients present an overall increase in genomic instability, somatic copy-number alterations (SCNAs) and somatic mutations. Age-associated SCNAs and mutations are identified in several cancer-driver genes across different cancer types. The largest age-related genomic differences are found in gliomas and endometrial cancer. We identify age-related global transcriptomic changes and demonstrate that these genes are in part regulated by age-associated DNA methylation changes. This study provides a comprehensive, multi-omics view of age-associated alterations in cancer and underscores age as an important factor to consider in cancer research and clinical practice.",33879792,PMC8058097,10.1038/s41467-021-22560-y,41,Nature communications,101528555,17.694
Multi-omics data integration reveals the complexity and diversity of host factors associated with influenza virus infection,"Influenza viruses pose a significant and ongoing threat to human health. Many host factors have been identified to be associated with influenza virus infection. However, there is currently a lack of an integrated resource for these host factors. This study integrated human genes and proteins associated with influenza virus infections for 14 subtypes of influenza A viruses, as well as influenza B and C viruses, and built a database named H2Flu to store and organize these genes or proteins. The database includes 28,639 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), 1,850 differentially expressed proteins, and 442 proteins with differential posttranslational modifications after influenza virus infection, as well as 3,040 human proteins that interact with influenza virus proteins and 57 human susceptibility genes. Further analysis showed that the dynamic response of human cells to virus infection, cell type and strain specificity contribute significantly to the diversity of DEGs. Additionally, large heterogeneity was also observed in protein-protein interactions between humans and different types or subtypes of influenza viruses. Overall, the study deepens our understanding of the diversity and complexity of interactions between influenza viruses and humans, and provides a valuable resource for further studies on such interactions.",37842064,PMC10569165,10.7717/peerj.16194,0,PeerJ,101603425,3.061
MSProGene: integrative proteogenomics beyond six-frames and single nucleotide polymorphisms,"Ongoing advances in high-throughput technologies have facilitated accurate proteomic measurements and provide a wealth of information on genomic and transcript level. In proteogenomics, this multi-omics data is combined to analyze unannotated organisms and to allow more accurate sample-specific predictions. Existing analysis methods still mainly depend on six-frame translations or reference protein databases that are extended by transcriptomic information or known single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). However, six-frames introduce an artificial sixfold increase of the target database and SNP integration requires a suitable database summarizing results from previous experiments. We overcome these limitations by introducing MSProGene, a new method for integrative proteogenomic analysis based on customized RNA-Seq driven transcript databases. MSProGene is independent from existing reference databases or annotated SNPs and avoids large six-frame translated databases by constructing sample-specific transcripts. In addition, it creates a network combining RNA-Seq and peptide information that is optimized by a maximum-flow algorithm. It thereby also allows resolving the ambiguity of shared peptides for protein inference. We applied MSProGene on three datasets and show that it facilitates a database-independent reliable yet accurate prediction on gene and protein level and additionally identifies novel genes.Availability and implementation:MSProGene is written in Java and Python. It is open source and available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/msprogene/.",26072472,PMC4765881,10.1093/bioinformatics/btv236,20,"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",9808944,6.931
Integrating genomics and transcriptomics to identify candidate genes for subcutaneous fat deposition in beef cattle,"Fat deposition is a complex economic trait regulated by polygenic genetic basis and environmental factors. Therefore, integrating multi-omics data to uncover its internal regulatory mechanism has attracted extensive attention. Here, we performed genomics and transcriptomics analysis to detect candidates affecting subcutaneous fat (SCF) deposition in beef cattle. The association of 770K SNPs with the backfat thickness captured nine significant SNPs within or near 11 genes. Additionally, 13 overlapping genes regarding fat deposition were determined via the analysis of differentially expressed genes and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). We then calculated the correlations of these genes with BFT and constructed their interaction network. Finally, seven biomarkers including ACACA, SCD, FASN, ACOX1, ELOVL5, HACD2, and HSD17B12 were screened. Notably, ACACA, identified by the integration of genomics and transcriptomics, was more likely to exert profound effects on SCF deposition. These findings provided novel insights into the regulation mechanism underlying bovine fat accumulation.",35709924,,10.1016/j.ygeno.2022.110406,7,Genomics,8800135,4.31
shinyGISPA: A web application for characterizing phenotype by gene sets using multiple omics data combinations,"While many methods exist for integrating multi-omics data or defining gene sets, there is no one single tool that defines gene sets based on merging of multiple omics data sets. We present shinyGISPA, an open-source application with a user-friendly web-based interface to define genes according to their similarity in several molecular changes that are driving a disease phenotype. This tool was developed to help facilitate the usability of a previously published method, Gene Integrated Set Profile Analysis (GISPA), among researchers with limited computer-programming skills. The GISPA method allows the identification of multiple gene sets that may play a role in the characterization, clinical application, or functional relevance of a disease phenotype.

Gramene: A Resource for Comparative Analysis of Plants Genomes and Pathways,"Gramene is an integrated bioinformatics resource for accessing, visualizing, and comparing plant genomes and biological pathways. Originally targeting grasses, Gramene has grown to host annotations for over 90 plant genomes including agronomically important cereals (e.g., maize, sorghum, wheat, teff), fruits and vegetables (e.g., apple, watermelon, clementine, tomato, cassava), specialty crops (e.g., coffee, olive tree, pistachio, almond), and plants of special or emerging interest (e.g., cotton, tobacco, cannabis, or hemp). For some species, the resource includes multiple varieties of the same species, which has paved the road for the creation of species-specific pan-genome browsers. The resource also features plant research models, including Arabidopsis and C4 warm-season grasses and brassicas, as well as other species that fill phylogenetic gaps for plant evolution studies. Its strength derives from the application of a phylogenetic framework for genome comparison and the use of ontologies to integrate structural and functional annotation data. This chapter outlines system requirements for end-users and database hosting, data types and basic navigation within Gramene, and provides examples of how to (1) explore Gramene's search results, (2) explore gene-centric comparative genomics data visualizations in Gramene, and (3) explore genetic variation associated with a gene locus. This is the first publication describing in detail Gramene's integrated search interface-intended to provide a simplified entry portal for the resource's main data categories (genomic location, phylogeny, gene expression, pathways, and external references) to the most complete and up-to-date set of plant genome and pathway annotations.",35037202,,10.1007/978-1-0716-2067-0_5,16,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,0.0
Multi-omics analysis identifies potential microbial and metabolite diagnostic biomarkers of bacterial vaginosis,"Background:Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common clinical manifestation of a perturbed vaginal ecology associated with adverse sexual and reproductive health outcomes if left untreated. The existing diagnostic modalities are either cumbersome or require skilled expertise, warranting alternate tests. Application of machine-learning tools to heterogeneous and high-dimensional multi-omics datasets finds promising potential in data integration and may aid biomarker discovery.Objectives:The present study aimed to evaluate the potential of the microbiome and metabolome-derived biomarkers in BV diagnosis. Interpretable machine-learning algorithms were used to evaluate the utility of an integrated-omics-derived classification model.Methods:Vaginal samples obtained from reproductive-age group women with (n = 40) and without BV (n = 40) were subjected to 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and LC-MS-based metabolomics. The vaginal microbiome and metabolome were characterized, and machine-learning analysis was performed to build a classification model using biomarkers with the highest diagnostic accuracy.Results:Microbiome-based diagnostic model exhibited a ROC-AUC (10-fold CV) of 0.84 ± 0.21 and accuracy of 0.79 ± 0.18, and important features were Aerococcus spp., Mycoplasma hominis, Sneathia spp., Lactobacillus spp., Prevotella spp., Gardnerella spp. and Fannyhessea vaginae. The metabolome-derived model displayed superior performance with a ROC-AUC of 0.97 ± 0.07 and an accuracy of 0.92 ± 0.08. Beta-leucine, methylimidazole acetaldehyde, dimethylethanolamine, L-arginine and beta cortol were among key predictive metabolites for BV. A predictive model combining both microbial and metabolite features exhibited a high ROC-AUC of 0.97 ± 0.07 and accuracy of 0.94 ± 0.08 with diagnostic performance only slightly superior to the metabolite-based model.Conclusion:Application of machine-learning tools to multi-omics datasets aid biomarker discovery with high predictive performance. Metabolome-derived classification models were observed to have superior diagnostic performance in predicting BV than microbiome-based biomarkers.",38284174,,10.1111/jdv.19805,0,Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology : JEADV,9216037,9.228
A Bayesian framework for pathway-guided identification of cancer subgroups by integrating multiple types of genomic data,"In recent years, comprehensive cancer genomics platforms, such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), provide access to an enormous amount of high throughput genomic datasets for each patient, including gene expression, DNA copy number alterations, DNA methylation, and somatic mutation. While the integration of these multi-omics datasets has the potential to provide novel insights that can lead to personalized medicine, most existing approaches only focus on gene-level analysis and lack the ability to facilitate biological findings at the pathway-level. In this article, we propose Bayes-InGRiD (Bayesian Integrative Genomics Robust iDentification of cancer subgroups), a novel pathway-guided Bayesian sparse latent factor model for the simultaneous identification of cancer patient subgroups (clustering) and key molecular features (variable selection) within a unified framework, based on the joint analysis of continuous, binary, and count data. By utilizing pathway (gene set) information, Bayes-InGRiD does not only enhance the accuracy and robustness of cancer patient subgroup and key molecular feature identification, but also promotes biological understanding and interpretation. Finally, to facilitate an efficient posterior sampling, an alternative Gibbs sampler for logistic and negative binomial models is proposed using Pólya-Gamma mixtures of normal to represent latent variables for binary and count data, which yields a conditionally Gaussian representation of the posterior. The R package ""INGRID"" implementing the proposed approach is currently available in our research group GitHub webpage (https://dongjunchung.github.io/INGRID/).",37715500,,10.1002/sim.9911,0,Statistics in medicine,8215016,2.497
Survey and comparative assessments of computational multi-omics integrative methods with multiple regulatory networks identifying distinct tumor compositions across pan-cancer data sets,"The significance of pan-cancer categories has recently been recognized as widespread in cancer research. Pan-cancer categorizes a cancer based on its molecular pathology rather than an organ. The molecular similarities among multi-omics data found in different cancer types can play several roles in both biological processes and therapeutic developments. Therefore, an integrated analysis for various genomic data is frequently used to reveal novel genetic and molecular mechanisms. However, a variety of algorithms for multi-omics clustering have been proposed in different fields. The comparison of different computational clustering methods in pan-cancer analysis performance remains unclear. To increase the utilization of current integrative methods in pan-cancer analysis, we first provide an overview of five popular computational integrative tools: similarity network fusion, integrative clustering of multiple genomic data types (iCluster), cancer integration via multi-kernel learning (CIMLR), perturbation clustering for data integration and disease subtyping (PINS) and low-rank clustering (LRACluster). Then, a priori interactions in multi-omics data were incorporated to detect prominent molecular patterns in pan-cancer data sets. Finally, we present comparative assessments of these methods, with discussion over key issues in applying these algorithms. We found that all five methods can identify distinct tumor compositions. The pan-cancer samples can be reclassified into several groups by different proportions. Interestingly, each method can classify the tumors into categories that are different from original cancer types or subtypes, especially for ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma (OV) and breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA) tumors. In addition, all clusters of the five computational methods show notable prognostic values. Furthermore, both the 9 recurrent differential genes and the 15 common pathway characteristics were identified across all the methods. The results and discussion can help the community select appropriate integrative tools according to different research tasks or aims in pan-cancer analysis.",32533167,,10.1093/bib/bbaa102,5,Briefings in bioinformatics,100912837,13.994

Genomic and transcriptomic analyses reveal a tandem amplification unit of 11 genes and mutations in mismatch repair genes in methotrexate-resistant HT-29 cells,"DHFR gene amplification is commonly present in methotrexate (MTX)-resistant colon cancer cells and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In this study, we proposed an integrative framework to characterize the amplified region by using a combination of single-molecule real-time sequencing, next-generation optical mapping, and chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C). We identified an amplification unit spanning 11 genes, from the DHFR gene to the ATP6AP1L gene position, with high adjusted interaction frequencies on chromosome 5 (~2.2 Mbp) and a twenty-fold tandemly amplified region, and novel inversions at the start and end positions of the amplified region as well as frameshift insertions in most of the MSH and MLH genes were detected. These mutations might stimulate chromosomal breakage and cause the dysregulation of mismatch repair. Characterizing the tandem gene-amplified unit may be critical for identifying the mechanisms that trigger genomic rearrangements. These findings may provide new insight into the mechanisms underlying the amplification process and the evolution of drug resistance.",34521988,PMC8492700,10.1038/s12276-021-00668-x,3,Experimental & molecular medicine,9607880,12.153
Multi-omics reveals that alkaline mineral water improves the respiratory health and growth performance of transported calves,"Background:Long-distance transportation, a frequent practice in the cattle industry, stresses calves and results in morbidity, mortality, and growth suppression, leading to welfare concerns and economic losses. Alkaline mineral water (AMW) is an electrolyte additive containing multiple mineral elements and shows stress-mitigating effects on humans and bovines.Results:Here, we monitored the respiratory health status and growth performance of 60 Simmental calves subjected to 30 hours of road transportation using a clinical scoring system. Within the three days of commingling before the transportation and 30 days after the transportation, calves in the AMW group (n = 30) were supplied with AMW, while calves in the Control group (n = 29) were not. On three specific days, namely the day before transportation (day -3), the 30thday (day 30), and the 60thday (day 60) after transportation, sets of venous blood, serum, and nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected from 20 calves (10 from each group) for routine blood testing, whole blood transcriptomic sequencing, serology detection, serum untargeted metabolic sequencing, and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The field data showed that calves in the AMW group displayed lower rectal temperatures (38.967 ℃ vs. 39.022 ℃; p = 0.004), respiratory scores (0.079 vs. 0.144; p < 0.001), appetite scores (0.024 vs. 0.055; p < 0.001), ocular and ear scores (0.185 vs. 0.338; p < 0.001), nasal discharge scores (0.143 vs. 0.241; p < 0.001), and higher body weight gains (30.870 kg vs. 7.552 kg; p < 0.001). The outcomes of laboratory and high throughput sequencing data revealed that the calves in the AMW group demonstrated higher cellular and humoral immunities, antioxidant capacities, lower inflammatory levels, and intestinal absorption and lipogenesis on days -3 and 60. The nasopharynx 16S rRNA gene microbiome analysis revealed the different composition and structure of the nasopharyngeal microflora in the two groups of calves on day 30. Joint analysis of multi-omics revealed that on days -3 and 30, bile secretion was a shared pathway enriched by differentially expressed genes and metabolites, and there were strong correlations between the differentially expressed metabolites and the main genera in the nasopharynx.Conclusions:These results suggest that AMW supplementation enhances peripheral immunity, nutrition absorption, and metabolic processes, subsequently affecting the nasopharyngeal microbiota and improving the respiratory health and growth performance of transported calves. This investigation provided a practical approach to mitigate transportation stress and explored its underlying mechanisms, which are beneficial for the development of the livestock industry.

DROEG: a method for cancer drug response prediction based on omics and essential genes integration,"Predicting therapeutic responses in cancer patients is a major challenge in the field of precision medicine due to high inter- and intra-tumor heterogeneity. Most drug response models need to be improved in terms of accuracy, and there is limited research to assess therapeutic responses of particular tumor types. Here, we developed a novel method DROEG (Drug Response based on Omics and Essential Genes) for prediction of drug response in tumor cell lines by integrating genomic, transcriptomic and methylomic data along with CRISPR essential genes, and revealed that the incorporation of tumor proliferation essential genes can improve drug sensitivity prediction. Concisely, DROEG integrates literature-based and statistics-based methods to select features and uses Support Vector Regression for model construction. We demonstrate that DROEG outperforms most state-of-the-art algorithms by both qualitative (prediction accuracy for drug-sensitive/resistant) and quantitative (Pearson correlation coefficient between the predicted and actual IC50) evaluation in Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer and Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia datasets. In addition, DROEG is further applied to the pan-gastrointestinal tumor with high prevalence and mortality as a case study at both cell line and clinical levels to evaluate the model efficacy and discover potential prognostic biomarkers in Cisplatin and Epirubicin treatment. Interestingly, the CRISPR essential gene information is found to be the most important contributor to enhance the accuracy of the DROEG model. To our knowledge, this is the first study to integrate essential genes with multi-omics data to improve cancer drug response prediction and provide insights into personalized precision treatment.",36715269,,10.1093/bib/bbad003,0,Briefings in bioinformatics,100912837,13.994
Integrated multi-omics analysis of brain aging in female nonhuman primates reveals altered signaling pathways relevant to age-related disorders,"The prefrontal cortex (PFC) has been implicated as a key brain region responsible for age-related cognitive decline. Little is known about aging-related molecular changes in PFC that may mediate these effects. To date, no studies have used untargeted discovery methods with integrated analyses to determine PFC molecular changes in healthy female primates. We quantified PFC changes associated with healthy aging in female baboons by integrating multiple omics data types (transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics) from samples across the adult age span. Our integrated omics approach using unbiased weighted gene co-expression network analysis to integrate data and treat age as a continuous variable, revealed highly interconnected known and novel pathways associated with PFC aging. We found Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) tissue content associated with these signaling pathways, providing 1 potential biomarker to assess PFC changes with age. These highly coordinated pathway changes during aging may represent early steps for aging-related decline in PFC functions, such as learning and memory, and provide potential biomarkers to assess cognitive status in humans.",37797463,,10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2023.08.009,2,Neurobiology of aging,8100437,5.133
"Multiblock variable influence on orthogonal projections (MB-VIOP) for enhanced interpretation of total, global, local and unique variations in OnPLS models","Background:For multivariate data analysis involving only two input matrices (e.g., X and Y), the previously published methods for variable influence on projection (e.g., VIPOPLSor VIPO2PLS) are widely used for variable selection purposes, including (i) variable importance assessment, (ii) dimensionality reduction of big data and (iii) interpretation enhancement of PLS, OPLS and O2PLS models. For multiblock analysis, the OnPLS models find relationships among multiple data matrices (more than two blocks) by calculating latent variables; however, a method for improving the interpretation of these latent variables (model components) by assessing the importance of the input variables was not available up to now.Results:A method for variable selection in multiblock analysis, called multiblock variable influence on orthogonal projections (MB-VIOP) is explained in this paper. MB-VIOP is a model based variable selection method that uses the data matrices, the scores and the normalized loadings of an OnPLS model in order to sort the input variables of more than two data matrices according to their importance for both simplification and interpretation of the total multiblock model, and also of the unique, local and global model components separately. MB-VIOP has been tested using three datasets: a synthetic four-block dataset, a real three-block omics dataset related to plant sciences, and a real six-block dataset related to the food industry.Conclusions:We provide evidence for the usefulness and reliability of MB-VIOP by means of three examples (one synthetic and two real-world cases). MB-VIOP assesses in a trustable and efficient way the importance of both isolated and ranges of variables in any type of data. MB-VIOP connects the input variables of different data matrices according to their relevance for the interpretation of each latent variable, yielding enhanced interpretability for each OnPLS model component. Besides, MB-VIOP can deal with strong overlapping of types of variation, as well as with many data blocks with very different dimensionality. The ability of MB-VIOP for generating dimensionality reduced models with high interpretability makes this method ideal for big data mining, multi-omics data integration and any study that requires exploration and interpretation of large streams of data.",33812384,PMC8019512,10.1186/s12859-021-04015-9,1,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,3.307
DeepICSH: a complex deep learning framework for identifying cell-specific silencers and their strength from the human genome,"Silencers are noncoding DNA sequence fragments located on the genome that suppress gene expression. The variation of silencers in specific cells is closely related to gene expression and cancer development. Computational approaches that exclusively rely on DNA sequence information for silencer identification fail to account for the cell specificity of silencers, resulting in diminished accuracy. Despite the discovery of several transcription factors and epigenetic modifications associated with silencers on the genome, there is still no definitive biological signal or combination thereof to fully characterize silencers, posing challenges in selecting suitable biological signals for their identification. Therefore, we propose a sophisticated deep learning framework called DeepICSH, which is based on multiple biological data sources. Specifically, DeepICSH leverages a deep convolutional neural network to automatically capture biologically relevant signal combinations strongly associated with silencers, originating from a diverse array of biological signals. Furthermore, the utilization of attention mechanisms facilitates the scoring and visualization of these signal combinations, whereas the employment of skip connections facilitates the fusion of multilevel sequence features and signal combinations, thereby empowering the accurate identification of silencers within specific cells. Extensive experiments on HepG2 and K562 cell line data sets demonstrate that DeepICSH outperforms state-of-the-art methods in silencer identification. Notably, we introduce for the first time a deep learning framework based on multi-omics data for classifying strong and weak silencers, achieving favorable performance. In conclusion, DeepICSH shows great promise for advancing the study and analysis of silencers in complex diseases.

Multi-Omics of Familial Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm and Dissection: Calcium Transport Impairment Predisposes Aortas to Dissection,"Several genetic defects, including a mutation in myosin heavy chain 11 (Myh11), are reported to cause familial thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection (FTAAD). We recently showed that mice lacking K1256 of Myh11 developed aortic dissection when stimulated with angiotensin II, despite the absence of major pathological phenotypic abnormalities prior to stimulation. In this study, we used a comprehensive, data-driven, unbiased, multi-omics approach to find underlying changes in transcription and metabolism that predispose the aorta to dissection in mice harboring the Myh11 K1256del mutation. Pathway analysis of transcriptomes showed that genes involved in membrane transport were downregulated in homozygous mutant (Myh11ΔK/ΔK) aortas. Furthermore, expanding the analysis with metabolomics showed that two mechanisms that raise the cytosolic Ca2+concentration-multiple calcium channel expression and ADP-ribose synthesis-were attenuated inMyh11ΔK/ΔKaortas.

While cuproptosis and mitochondria dysfunction have been demonstrated to exert a crucial role in tumor progression and development, the mechanisms by which they are regulated in OSA still await clarification.Methods:Two independent OSA cohorts containing transcriptome data and clinical information were collected from public databases. The heterogeneity of OSA were evaluated by single cell RNA (scRNA) analysis. To identify a newly molecular subtype, unsupervised consensus clustering was conducted. Cox relevant regression methods were utilized to establish a prognostic gene signature. Wet lab experiments were performed to confirm the effect of model gene in OSA cells.Results:We determined 30 distinct cell clusters and assessed OSA heterogeneity and stemness scRNA analysis. Then, univariate Cox analysis identified 24 candidate genes which were greatly associated with the prognosis of OSA. Based on these prognostic genes, we obtained two molecular subgroups. After conducting step Cox regression, three model genes were selected to construct a signature showing a favorable performance to forecast clinical outcome. Our proposed signature could also evaluate the response to chemotherapy and immunotherapy of OSA cases.Conclusion:We generated a novel risk model based on cuproptosis and mitochondria-related genes in OSA with powerful predictive ability in prognosis and immune landscape.",38250070,PMC10796547,10.3389/fimmu.2023.1280945,0,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,8.786
Ten years of maintaining and expanding a microbial genome and metagenome analysis system,"Launched in March 2005, the Integrated Microbial Genomes (IMG) system is a comprehensive data management system that supports multidimensional comparative analysis of genomic data. At the core of the IMG system is a data warehouse that contains genome and metagenome datasets sequenced at the Joint Genome Institute or provided by scientific users, as well as public genome datasets available at the National Center for Biotechnology Information Genbank sequence data archive. Genomes and metagenome datasets are processed using IMG's microbial genome and metagenome sequence data processing pipelines and are integrated into the data warehouse using IMG's data integration toolkits. Microbial genome and metagenome application specific data marts and user interfaces provide access to different subsets of IMG's data and analysis toolkits. This review article revisits IMG's original aims, highlights key milestones reached by the system during the past 10 years, and discusses the main challenges faced by a rapidly expanding system, in particular the complexity of maintaining such a system in an academic setting with limited budgets and computing and data management infrastructure.",26439299,,10.1016/j.tim.2015.07.012,11,Trends in microbiology,9310916,18.23
The era of the ARG: An introduction to ancestral recombination graphs and their significance in empirical evolutionary genomics,"In the presence of recombination, the evolutionary relationships between a set of sampled genomes cannot be described by a single genealogical tree. Instead, the genomes are related by a complex, interwoven collection of genealogies formalized in a structure called an ancestral recombination graph (ARG). An ARG extensively encodes the ancestry of the genome(s) and thus is replete with valuable information for addressing diverse questions in evolutionary biology. Despite its potential utility, technological and methodological limitations, along with a lack of approachable literature, have severely restricted awareness and application of ARGs in evolution research. Excitingly, recent progress in ARG reconstruction and simulation have made ARG-based approaches feasible for many questions and systems. In this review, we provide an accessible introduction and exploration of ARGs, survey recent methodological breakthroughs, and describe the potential for ARGs to further existing goals and open avenues of inquiry that were previously inaccessible in evolutionary genomics. Through this discussion, we aim to more widely disseminate the promise of ARGs in evolutionary genomics and encourage the broader development and adoption of ARG-based inference.",38236805,PMC10796009,10.1371/journal.pgen.1011110,4,PLoS genetics,101239074,6.02
Integration of multi-omics datasets enables molecular classification of COPD,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an umbrella diagnosis caused by a multitude of underlying mechanisms, and molecular sub-phenotyping is needed to develop molecular diagnostic/prognostic tools and efficacious treatments.The objective of these studies was to investigate whether multi-omics integration improves the accuracy of molecular classification of COPD in small cohorts.Nine omics data blocks (comprising mRNA, micro RNA, proteomes and metabolomes) collected from several anatomical locations from 52 female subjects were integrated by similarity network fusion (SNF). Multi-omics integration significantly improved the accuracy of group classification of COPD patients from healthy never-smokers and from smokers with normal spirometry, reducing required group sizes from n=30 to n=6 at 95% power. Seven different combinations of four to seven omics platforms achieved >95% accuracy.For the first time, a quantitative relationship between multi-omics data integration and accuracy of data-driven classification power has been demonstrated across nine omics data blocks. Integrating five to seven omics data blocks enabled 100% correct classification of COPD diagnosis with groups as small as n=6 individuals, despite strong confounding effects of current smoking. These results can serve as guidelines for the design of future systems-based multi-omics investigations, with indications that integrating five to six data blocks from several molecular levels and anatomical locations suffices to facilitate unsupervised molecular classification in small cohorts.",29545283,,10.1183/13993003.01930-2017,47,The European respiratory journal,8803460,33.795
Enhanced bovine genome annotation through integration of transcriptomics and epi-transcriptomics datasets facilitates genomic biology,"Background:The accurate identification of the functional elements in the bovine genome is a fundamental requirement for high-quality analysis of data informing both genome biology and genomic selection. Functional annotation of the bovine genome was performed to identify a more complete catalog of transcript isoforms across bovine tissues.Results:A total of 160,820 unique transcripts (50% protein coding) representing 34,882 unique genes (60% protein coding) were identified across tissues. Among them, 118,563 transcripts (73% of the total) were structurally validated by independent datasets (PacBio isoform sequencing data, Oxford Nanopore Technologies sequencing data, de novo assembled transcripts from RNA sequencing data) and comparison with Ensembl and NCBI gene sets. In addition, all transcripts were supported by extensive data from different technologies such as whole transcriptome termini site sequencing, RNA Annotation and Mapping of Promoters for the Analysis of Gene Expression, chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing, and assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing. A large proportion of identified transcripts (69%) were unannotated, of which 86% were produced by annotated genes and 14% by unannotated genes. A median of two 5' untranslated regions were expressed per gene. Around 50% of protein-coding genes in each tissue were bifunctional and transcribed both coding and noncoding isoforms. Furthermore, we identified 3,744 genes that functioned as noncoding genes in fetal tissues but as protein-coding genes in adult tissues. Our new bovine genome annotation extended more than 11,000 annotated gene borders compared to Ensembl or NCBI annotations. The resulting bovine transcriptome was integrated with publicly available quantitative trait loci data to study tissue-tissue interconnection involved in different traits and construct the first bovine trait similarity network.Conclusions:These validated results show significant improvement over current bovine genome annotations.",38626724,PMC11020238,10.1093/gigascience/giae019,0,GigaScience,101596872,7.658
Integrative Analysis of Cancer Omics Data for Prognosis Modeling,"Prognosis modeling plays an important role in cancer studies. With the development of omics profiling, extensive research has been conducted to search for prognostic markers for various cancer types. However, many of the existing studies share a common limitation by only focusing on a single cancer type and suffering from a lack of sufficient information. With potential molecular similarity across cancer types, one cancer type may contain information useful for the analysis of other types. The integration of multiple cancer types may facilitate information borrowing so as to more comprehensively and more accurately describe prognosis. In this study, we conduct marginal and joint integrative analysis of multiple cancer types, effectively introducing integration in the discovery process. For accommodating high dimensionality and identifying relevant markers, we adopt the advanced penalization technique which has a solid statistical ground. Gene expression data on nine cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) are analyzed, leading to biologically sensible findings that are different from the alternatives. Overall, this study provides a novel venue for cancer prognosis modeling by integrating multiple cancer types.",31405076,PMC6727084,10.3390/genes10080604,3,Genes,101551097,4.141
"Analysis, identification and visualization of subgroups in genomics","Motivation:Cancer is a complex and heterogeneous disease involving multiple somatic mutations that accumulate during its progression. In the past years, the wide availability of genomic data from patients' samples opened new perspectives in the analysis of gene mutations and alterations. Hence, visualizing and further identifying genes mutated in massive sets of patients are nowadays a critical task that sheds light on more personalized intervention approaches.Results:Here, we extensively review existing tools for visualization and analysis of alteration data. We compare different approaches to study mutual exclusivity and sample coverage in large-scale omics data. We complement our review with the standalone software AVAtar ('analysis and visualization of alteration data') that integrates diverse aspects known from different tools into a comprehensive platform. AVAtar supplements customizable alteration plots by a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm for subset identification and provides an innovative and user-friendly interface for the evaluation of concurrent solutions.

Utility of multi-omics data to inform genomic prediction of heifer fertility traits,"Biologically informed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) impact genomic prediction accuracy of the target traits. Our previous genomics, proteomics, and transcriptomics work identified candidate genes related to puberty and fertility in Brahman heifers. We aimed to test this biological information for capturing heritability and predicting heifer fertility traits in another breed i.e., Tropical Composite. The SNP from the identified genes including 10 kilobases (kb) region on either side were selected as biologically informed SNP set. The SNP from the rest of the Bos taurus genes including 10-kb region on either side were selected as biologically uninformed SNP set. Bovine high-density (HD) complete SNP set (628,323 SNP) was used as a control. Two populations-Tropical Composites (N = 1331) and Brahman (N = 2310)-had records for three traits: pregnancy after first mating season (PREG1, binary), first conception score (FCS, score 1 to 3), and rebreeding score (REB, score 1 to 3.5). Using the best linear unbiased prediction method, effectiveness of each SNP set to predict the traits was tested in two scenarios: a 5-fold cross-validation within Tropical Composites using biological information from Brahman studies, and application of prediction equations from one breed to the other. The accuracy of prediction was calculated as the correlation between genomic estimated breeding values and adjusted phenotypes. Results show that biologically informed SNP set estimated heritabilities not significantly better than the control HD complete SNP set in Tropical Composites; however, it captured all the observed genetic variance in PREG1 and FCS when modeled together with the biologically uninformed SNP set. In 5-fold cross-validation within Tropical Composites, the biologically informed SNP set performed marginally better (statistically insignificant) in terms of prediction accuracies (PREG1: 0.20, FCS: 0.13, and REB: 0.12) as compared to HD complete SNP set (PREG1: 0.17, FCS: 0.10, and REB: 0.11), and biologically uninformed SNP set (PREG1: 0.16, FCS: 0.10, and REB: 0.11). Across-breed use of prediction equations still remained a challenge: accuracies by all SNP sets dropped to around zero for all traits. The performance of biologically informed SNP was not significantly better than other sets in Tropical Composites. However, results indicate that biological information obtained from Brahman was successful to predict the fertility traits in Tropical Composite population.",36239447,PMC9733504,10.1093/jas/skac340,1,Journal of animal science,8003002,3.338
Analyzing Prokaryotic Transcriptomics in the Light of Genome Data with the MicroScope Platform,"Large-scale genome sequencing and the increasingly massive use of high-throughput approaches produce a vast amount of new information that completely transforms our understanding of thousands of microbial species occurring in our environment. However, despite the development of powerful bioinformatics approaches, full interpretation of the content of these genomes remains a difficult task. To address this challenge, the MicroScope platform has been developed. It is an integrated Web platform for management, annotation, comparative analysis, and visualization of microbial genomes ( https://mage.genoscope.cns.fr/microscope ). Launched in 2005, the platform has been under continuous development and provides analyzes for complete and ongoing genome projects together with metabolic network reconstruction and transcriptomic experiments allowing users to improve the understanding of gene functions. MicroScope platform is widely used by microbiologists from academia and industry all around the world for collaborative studies and expert annotation. It enables collaborative work in a rich comparative genomic context and improves community-based curation efforts. Here, we describe the protocol to follow for the integration and analysis of transcriptomics data in the Microscope platform. The chapter reviews each key step from the experimental design to the analysis and interpretation of the experiment data and results.

ORIO (Online Resource for Integrative Omics): a web-based platform for rapid integration of next generation sequencing data,"Established and emerging next generation sequencing (NGS)-based technologies allow for genome-wide interrogation of diverse biological processes. However, accessibility of NGS data remains a problem, and few user-friendly resources exist for integrative analysis of NGS data from different sources and experimental techniques. Here, we present Online Resource for Integrative Omics (ORIO; https://orio.niehs.nih.gov/), a web-based resource with an intuitive user interface for rapid analysis and integration of NGS data. To use ORIO, the user specifies NGS data of interest along with a list of genomic coordinates. Genomic coordinates may be biologically relevant features from a variety of sources, such as ChIP-seq peaks for a given protein or transcription start sites from known gene models. ORIO first iteratively finds read coverage values at each genomic feature for each NGS dataset. Data are then integrated using clustering-based approaches, giving hierarchical relationships across NGS datasets and separating individual genomic features into groups. In focusing its analysis on read coverage, ORIO makes limited assumptions about the analyzed data; this allows the tool to be applied across data from a variety of experiments and techniques. Results from analysis are presented in dynamic displays alongside user-controlled statistical tests, supporting rapid statistical validation of observed results. We emphasize the versatility of ORIO through diverse examples, ranging from NGS data quality control to characterization of enhancer regions and integration of gene expression information. Easily accessible on a public web server, we anticipate wide use of ORIO in genome-wide investigations by life scientists.",28402545,PMC5449597,10.1093/nar/gkx270,7,Nucleic acids research,411011,19.16
A multi-omics integrative analysis based on CRISPR screens re-defines the pluripotency regulatory network in ESCs,"A comprehensive and precise definition of the pluripotency gene regulatory network (PGRN) is crucial for clarifying the regulatory mechanisms in embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Here, after a CRISPR/Cas9-based functional genomics screen and integrative analysis with other functional genomes, transcriptomes, proteomes and epigenome data, an expanded pluripotency-associated gene set is obtained, and a new PGRN with nine sub-classes is constructed. By integrating the DNA binding, epigenetic modification, chromatin conformation, and RNA expression profiles, the PGRN is resolved to six functionally independent transcriptional modules (CORE, MYC, PAF, PRC, PCGF and TBX). Spatiotemporal transcriptomics reveal activated CORE/MYC/PAF module activity and repressed PRC/PCGF/TBX module activity in both mouse ESCs (mESCs) and pluripotent cells of early embryos. Moreover, this module activity pattern is found to be shared by human ESCs (hESCs) and cancers. Thus, our results provide novel insights into elucidating the molecular basis of ESC pluripotency.",37059858,PMC10104827,10.1038/s42003-023-04700-w,0,Communications biology,101719179,6.548

From single-omics to interactomics: How can ligand-induced perturbations modulate single-cell phenotypes?,"Cells suffer from perturbations by different stimuli, which, consequently, rise to individual alterations in their profile and function that may end up affecting the tissue as a whole. This is no different if we consider the effect of a therapeutic agent on a biological system. As cells are exposed to external ligands their profile can change at different single-omics levels. Detecting how these changes take place through different sequencing technologies is key to a better understanding of the effects of therapeutic agents. Single-cell RNA-sequencing stands out as one of the most common approaches for cell profiling and perturbation analysis. As a result, single-cell transcriptomics data can be integrated with other omics data sources, such as proteomics and epigenomics data, to clarify the perturbation effects and mechanism at the cell level. Appropriate computational tools are key to process and integrate the available information. This chapter focuses on the recent advances on ligand-induced perturbation and single-cell omics computational tools and algorithms, their current limitations, and how the deluge of data can be used to improve the current process of drug research and development.",35871896,,10.1016/bs.apcsb.2022.05.006,1,Advances in protein chemistry and structural biology,101497281,5.447
PaintOmics 4: new tools for the integrative analysis of multi-omics datasets supported by multiple pathway databases,"PaintOmics is a web server for the integrative analysis and visualisation of multi-omics datasets using biological pathway maps. PaintOmics 4 has several notable updates that improve and extend analyses. Three pathway databases are now supported: KEGG, Reactome and MapMan, providing more comprehensive pathway knowledge for animals and plants. New metabolite analysis methods fill gaps in traditional pathway-based enrichment methods. The metabolite hub analysis selects compounds with a high number of significant genes in their neighbouring network, suggesting regulation by gene expression changes. The metabolite class activity analysis tests the hypothesis that a metabolic class has a higher-than-expected proportion of significant elements, indicating that these compounds are regulated in the experiment. Finally, PaintOmics 4 includes a regulatory omics module to analyse the contribution of trans-regulatory layers (microRNA and transcription factors, RNA-binding proteins) to regulate pathways.

Assisted clustering of gene expression data using regulatory data from partially overlapping sets of individuals,"Background:As omics measurements profiled on different molecular layers are interconnected, integrative approaches that incorporate the regulatory effect from multi-level omics data are needed. When the multi-level omics data are from the same individuals, gene expression (GE) clusters can be identified using information from regulators like genetic variants and DNA methylation. When the multi-level omics data are from different individuals, the choice of integration approaches is limited.Methods:We developed an approach to improve GE clustering from microarray data by integrating regulatory data from different but partially overlapping sets of individuals. We achieve this through (1) decomposing gene expression into the regulated component and the other component that is not regulated by measured factors, (2) optimizing the clustering goodness-of-fit objective function. We do not require the availability of different omics measurements on all individuals. A certain amount of individual overlap between GE data and the regulatory data is adequate for modeling the regulation, thus improving GE clustering.Results:A simulation study shows that the performance of the proposed approach depends on the strength of the GE-regulator relationship, degree of missingness, data dimensionality, sample size, and the number of clusters. Across the various simulation settings, the proposed method shows competitive performance in terms of accuracy compared to the alternative K-means clustering method, especially when the clustering structure is due mostly to the regulated component, rather than the unregulated component. We further validate the approach with an application to 8,902 Framingham Heart Study participants with data on up to 17,873 genes and regulation information of DNA methylation and genotype from different but partially overlapping sets of participants. We identify clustering structures of genes associated with pulmonary function while incorporating the predicted regulation effect from the measured regulators. We further investigate the over-representation of these GE clusters in pathways of other diseases that may be related to lung function and respiratory health.Conclusion:We propose a novel approach for clustering GE with the assistance of regulatory data that allowed for different but partially overlapping sets of individuals to be included in different omics data.",36496393,PMC9734806,10.1186/s12864-022-09026-1,0,BMC genomics,100965258,4.547

Phenotypic subgrouping and multi-omics analyses reveal reduced diazepam-binding inhibitor (DBI) protein levels in autism spectrum disorder with severe language impairment,"Background:The mechanisms underlying autism spectrum disorder (ASD) remain unclear, and clinical biomarkers are not yet available for ASD. Differences in dysregulated proteins in ASD have shown little reproducibility, which is partly due to ASD heterogeneity. Recent studies have demonstrated that subgrouping ASD cases based on clinical phenotypes is useful for identifying candidate genes that are dysregulated in ASD subgroups. However, this strategy has not been employed in proteome profiling analyses to identify ASD biomarker proteins for specific subgroups.Methods:We therefore conducted a cluster analysis of the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) scores from 85 individuals with ASD to predict subgroups and subsequently identified dysregulated genes by reanalyzing the transcriptome profiles of individuals with ASD and unaffected individuals. Proteome profiling of lymphoblastoid cell lines from these individuals was performed via 2D-gel electrophoresis, and then mass spectrometry. Disrupted proteins were identified and compared to the dysregulated transcripts and reported dysregulated proteins from previous proteome studies. Biological functions were predicted using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) program. Selected proteins were also analyzed by Western blotting.Results:The cluster analysis of ADI-R data revealed four ASD subgroups, including ASD with severe language impairment, and transcriptome profiling identified dysregulated genes in each subgroup. Screening via proteome analysis revealed 82 altered proteins in the ASD subgroup with severe language impairment. Eighteen of these proteins were further identified by nano-LC-MS/MS. Among these proteins, fourteen were predicted by IPA to be associated with neurological functions and inflammation. Among these proteins, diazepam-binding inhibitor (DBI) protein was confirmed by Western blot analysis to be expressed at significantly decreased levels in the ASD subgroup with severe language impairment, and the DBI expression levels were correlated with the scores of several ADI-R items.Conclusions:By subgrouping individuals with ASD based on clinical phenotypes, and then performing an integrated transcriptome-proteome analysis, we identified DBI as a novel candidate protein for ASD with severe language impairment. The mechanisms of this protein and its potential use as an ASD biomarker warrant further study.",30921354,PMC6438570,10.1371/journal.pone.0214198,11,PloS one,101285081,3.752
Acute depletion of CTCF rewires genome-wide chromatin accessibility,"Background:The transcription factor CTCF appears indispensable in defining topologically associated domain boundaries and maintaining chromatin loop structures within these domains, supported by numerous functional studies. However, acute depletion of CTCF globally reduces chromatin interactions but does not significantly alter transcription.Results:Here, we systematically integrate multi-omics data including ATAC-seq, RNA-seq, WGBS, Hi-C, Cut&Run, and CRISPR-Cas9 survival dropout screens, and time-solved deep proteomic and phosphoproteomic analyses in cells carrying auxin-induced degron at endogenous CTCF locus. Acute CTCF protein degradation markedly rewires genome-wide chromatin accessibility. Increased accessible chromatin regions are frequently located adjacent to CTCF-binding sites at promoter regions and insulator sites associated with enhanced transcription of nearby genes. In addition, we use CTCF-associated multi-omics data to establish a combinatorial data analysis pipeline to discover CTCF co-regulatory partners. We successfully identify 40 candidates, including multiple established partners. Interestingly, many CTCF co-regulators that have alterations of their respective downstream gene expression do not show changes of their own expression levels across the multi-omics measurements upon acute CTCF loss, highlighting the strength of our system to discover hidden co-regulatory partners associated with CTCF-mediated transcription.Conclusions:This study highlights that CTCF loss rewires genome-wide chromatin accessibility, which plays a critical role in transcriptional regulation.",34429148,PMC8386078,10.1186/s13059-021-02466-0,21,Genome biology,100960660,17.906

To enable integration of omic data from distinct platforms and species, a specific ontology was applied to tie together and harmonise multi-level omic studies based on gene and protein clusters (CluSO) and mapping of orthologous genes (OMAP) across species. CAD continues to be a leading cause of death in the population worldwide, and it is generally thought to be an age-related disease. However, CAD incidence rates are now known to be highly influenced by environmental factors and interactions, in addition to genetic determinants. With the complexity of CAD aetiology, there is a difficulty in research studies to elucidate general elements compared to other cardiovascular diseases. Data from 92 studies, covering 13945 molecular entries (4353 unique molecules) is described, including data descriptors for experimental setup, study design, discovery-validation sample size and associated fold-changes of the differentially expressed molecular features (p-value<0.05). A dedicated interactive web interface, equipped with a multi-parametric search engine, data export and indexing menus are provided for a user-accessible browsing experience. The main aim of this work was the development of a data repository linking clinical information and molecular differential expression in several CVD-related traits from multi-omics studies (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics). As an example case of how to query and identify data sets within the database framework and concomitantly demonstrate the database utility, we queried CAD-associated studies and performed a systems-level integrative analysis.

Cancer whole-genome sequencing: present and future,"Recent explosive advances in next-generation sequencing technology and computational approaches to massive data enable us to analyze a number of cancer genome profiles by whole-genome sequencing (WGS). To explore cancer genomic alterations and their diversity comprehensively, global and local cancer genome-sequencing projects, including ICGC and TCGA, have been analyzing many types of cancer genomes mainly by exome sequencing. However, there is limited information on somatic mutations in non-coding regions including untranslated regions, introns, regulatory elements and non-coding RNAs, and rearrangements, sometimes producing fusion genes, and pathogen detection in cancer genomes remain widely unexplored. WGS approaches can detect these unexplored mutations, as well as coding mutations and somatic copy number alterations, and help us to better understand the whole landscape of cancer genomes and elucidate functions of these unexplored genomic regions. Analysis of cancer genomes using the present WGS platforms is still primitive and there are substantial improvements to be made in sequencing technologies, informatics and computer resources. Taking account of the extreme diversity of cancer genomes and phenotype, it is also required to analyze much more WGS data and integrate these with multi-omics data, functional data and clinical-pathological data in a large number of sample sets to interpret them more fully and efficiently.",25823020,,10.1038/onc.2015.90,46,Oncogene,8711562,8.756
Multi-Omics Profiling Reveals Phenotypic and Functional Heterogeneity of Neutrophils in COVID-19,"Accumulating evidence has revealed unexpected phenotypic heterogeneity and diverse functions of neutrophils in several diseases. Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) can alter the leukocyte phenotype based on disease severity, including neutrophil activation in severe cases. However, the plasticity of neutrophil phenotypes and their relative impact on COVID-19 pathogenesis has not been well addressed. This study aimed to identify and validate the heterogeneity of neutrophils in COVID-19 and evaluate the functions of each subpopulation. We analyzed public single-cell RNA-seq, bulk RNA-seq, and proteome data from healthy donors and patients with COVID-19 to investigate neutrophil subpopulations and their response to disease pathogenesis. We identified eight neutrophil subtypes: pro-neutrophil, pre-neutrophil, immature neutrophil, and five mature neutrophil subpopulations. The subtypes exhibited distinct features, including diverse activation signatures and multiple enriched pathways. The pro-neutrophil subtype was associated with severe and fatal disease, while the pre-neutrophil subtype was particularly abundant in mild/moderate disease. One of the mature neutrophil subtypes showed consistently large fractions in patients with different disease severity. Bulk RNA-seq dataset analyses using a cellular deconvolution approach validated the relative abundances of neutrophil subtypes and the expansion of pro-neutrophils in severe COVID-19 patients. Cell-cell communication analysis revealed representative ligand-receptor interactions among the identified neutrophil subtypes. Further investigation into transcription factors and differential protein abundance revealed the regulatory network differences between healthy donors and patients with severe COVID-19. Overall, we demonstrated the complex interactions among heterogeneous neutrophil subtypes and other blood cell types during COVID-19 disease. Our work has great value in terms of both clinical and public health as it furthers our understanding of the phenotypic and functional heterogeneity of neutrophils and other cell populations in multiple diseases.",38612651,PMC11011481,10.3390/ijms25073841,0,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,6.208
Gcluster: a simple-to-use tool for visualizing and comparing genome contexts for numerous genomes,"Motivation:Comparing the organization of gene, gene clusters and their flanking genomic contexts is of critical importance to the determination of gene function and evolutionary basis of microbial traits. Currently, user-friendly and flexible tools enabling to visualize and compare genomic contexts for numerous genomes are still missing.Results:We here present Gcluster, a stand-alone Perl tool that allows researchers to customize and create high-quality linear maps of the genomic region around the genes of interest across large numbers of completed and draft genomes.

Designation of optimal reference strains representing the infant gut bifidobacterial species through a comprehensive multi-omics approach,"The genomic era has resulted in the generation of a massive amount of genetic data concerning the genomic diversity of bacterial taxa. As a result, the microbiological community is increasingly looking for ways to define reference bacterial strains to perform experiments that are representative of the entire bacterial species. Despite this, there is currently no established approach allowing a reliable identification of reference strains based on a comprehensive genomic, ecological, and functional context. In the current study, we developed a comprehensive multi-omics approach that will allow the identification of the optimal reference strains using the Bifidobacterium genus as test case. Strain tracking analysis based on 1664 shotgun metagenomics datasets of healthy infant faecal samples were employed to identify bifidobacterial strains suitable for in silico and in vitro analyses. Subsequently, an ad hoc bioinformatic tool was developed to screen local strain collections for the most suitable species-representative strain alternative. The here presented approach was validated using in vitro trials followed by metagenomics and metatranscriptomics analyses. Altogether, these results demonstrated the validity of the proposed model for reference strain selection, thus allowing improved in silico and in vitro investigations both in terms of cross-laboratory reproducibility and relevance of research findings.",36123315,PMC10092070,10.1111/1462-2920.16205,7,Environmental microbiology,100883692,5.476
GMIEC: a shiny application for the identification of gene-targeted drugs for precision medicine,"Background:Precision medicine is a medical approach that takes into account individual genetic variability and often requires Next Generation Sequencing data in order to predict new treatments. Here we present GMIEC, Genomic Modules Identification et Characterization for genomics medicine, an application that is able to identify specific drugs at the level of single patient integrating multi-omics data such as RNA-sequencing, copy-number variation, methylation, Chromatin Immuno-Precipitation and Exome/Whole Genome sequencing. It is also possible to include clinical data related to each patient. GMIEC has been developed as a web-based R-Shiny platform and gives as output a table easy to use and explore.Results:We present GMIEC, a Shiny application for genomics medicine. The tool allows the users the integration of two or more multiple omics datasets (e.g. gene-expression, copy-number), at sample level, to identify groups of genes that share common genomic and corresponding drugs. We demonstrate the characteristics of our application by using it to analyze a prostate cancer data set.Conclusions:GMIEC provides a simple interface for genomics medicine.

"Status and perspectives of biomarker validation for diagnosis, stratification, and treatment","Objectives:The aim of this study was to discuss the status of and perspective for biomarker validation in view of the challenges imposed on national healthcare systems due to an increasing number of citizens with chronic diseases and new expensive drugs with effects that are sometimes poorly documented. The demand for a paradigm shift toward stratification of patients or even 'personalized medicine' (PM) is rising, and the implementation of such novel strategies has the potential to increase patient outcomes and cost efficiency of treatments. The implementation of PM depends on relevant and reliable biomarkers correlated to disease states, prognosis, or effect of treatment. Beyond biomarkers of disease, personalized prevention strategies (such as individualized nutrition guidance) are likely to depend on novel biomarkers.Study design:We discuss the current status of the use of biomarkers and the need for standardization and integration of biomarkers based on multi-omics approaches.Methods:We present representative cases from laboratory medicine, oncology, and nutrition, where present and emerging biomarkers have or may present opportunities for PM or prevention.Results:Biomarkers vary greatly in complexity, from single genomic mutations to metagenomic analyses of the composition of the gut microbiota and comprehensive analyses of metabolites, metabolomics. Using biomarkers for decision-making has previously often relied on measurements of single biomolecules. The current development now moves toward the use of multiple biomarkers requiring the use of machine learning or artificial intelligence. Still, the usefulness of biomarkers is often challenged by suboptimal validation, and the discovery of new biomarkers moves much faster than standardization efforts. To reap the potential benefits of personalization of treatment and prevention, healthcare systems and regulatory authorities need to focus on validation and standardization of biomarkers.Conclusion:There is a great public health need for better understanding of the usefulness, but also limitations, of biomarkers among policy makers, clinicians, and scientists, and efforts securing effective validation are key to the future use of novel sets of complex biomarkers.",33309006,,10.1016/j.puhe.2020.11.002,1,Public health,376507,4.984
bitacora: A comprehensive tool for the identification and annotation of gene families in genome assemblies,"Gene annotation is a critical bottleneck in genomic research, especially for the comprehensive study of very large gene families in the genomes of nonmodel organisms. Despite the recent progress in automatic methods, state-of-the-art tools used for this task often produce inaccurate annotations, such as fused, chimeric, partial or even completely absent gene models for many family copies, errors that require considerable extra efforts to be corrected. Here we present bitacora, a bioinformatics solution that integrates popular sequence similarity-based search tools and Perl scripts to facilitate both the curation of these inaccurate annotations and the identification of previously undetected gene family copies directly in genomic DNA sequences. We tested the performance of bitacora in annotating the members of two chemosensory gene families with different repertoire size in seven available genome sequences, and compared its performance with that of augustus-ppx, a tool also designed to improve automatic annotations using a sequence similarity-based approach. Despite the relatively high fragmentation of some of these drafts, bitacora was able to improve the annotation of many members of these families and detected thousands of new chemoreceptors encoded in genome sequences. The program creates general feature format (GFF) files, with both curated and newly identified gene models, and FASTA files with the predicted proteins. These outputs can be easily integrated in genomic annotation editors, greatly facilitating subsequent manual annotation and downstream evolutionary analyses.",32492257,,10.1111/1755-0998.13202,23,Molecular ecology resources,101465604,8.678
Integrative Methods and Practical Challenges for Single-Cell Multi-omics,"Fast-developing single-cell multimodal omics (scMulti-omics) technologies enable the measurement of multiple modalities, such as DNA methylation, chromatin accessibility, RNA expression, protein abundance, gene perturbation, and spatial information, from the same cell. scMulti-omics can comprehensively explore and identify cell characteristics, while also presenting challenges to the development of computational methods and tools for integrative analyses. Here, we review these integrative methods and summarize the existing tools for studying a variety of scMulti-omics data. The various functionalities and practical challenges in using the available tools in the public domain are explored through several case studies.

ASCIIGenome: a command line genome browser for console terminals,"Summary:Current genome browsers are designed to work via graphical user interfaces (GUIs), which, however intuitive, are not amenable to operate within console terminals and therefore are difficult to streamline or integrate in scripts. To circumvent these limitations, ASCIIGenome runs exclusively via command line interface to display genomic data directly in a terminal window. By following the same philosophy of UNIX tools, ASCIIGenome aims to be easily integrated with the command line, including batch processing of data, and therefore enables an effective exploration of the data.Implementation:ASCIIGenome is written in Java. Consequently, it is a cross-platform tool and requires minimal or no installation. Some of the common genomic data types are supported and data access on remote ftp servers is possible. Speed and memory footprint are comparable to or better than those of common genome browsers.Availability and implementation:Software and source code (MIT License) are available at https://github.com/dariober/ASCIIGenome with detailed documentation at http://asciigenome.readthedocs.io .Contact:Dario.beraldi@cruk.cam.ac.uk.Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",28119307,PMC5423454,10.1093/bioinformatics/btx007,1,"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",9808944,6.931
Translating genomic advances into biodiversity conservation,"A key action of the new Global Biodiversity Framework is the maintenance of genetic diversity in all species to safeguard their adaptive potential. To achieve this goal, a translational mindset, which aims to convert results of basic research into direct practical benefits, needs to be applied to biodiversity conservation. Despite much discussion on the value of genomics to conservation, a disconnect between those generating genomic resources and those applying it to biodiversity management remains. As global efforts to generate reference genomes for non-model species increase, investment into practical biodiversity applications is critically important. Applications such as understanding population and multispecies diversity and longitudinal monitoring need support alongside education for policymakers on integrating the data into evidence-based decisions. Without such investment, the opportunity to revolutionize global biodiversity conservation using genomics will not be fully realized.",38012268,,10.1038/s41576-023-00671-0,0,Nature reviews.

Integrated genome sizing (IGS) approach for the parallelization of whole genome analysis,"Background:The use of whole genome sequence has increased recently with rapid progression of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies. However, storing raw sequence reads to perform large-scale genome analysis pose hardware challenges. Despite advancement in genome analytic platforms, efficient approaches remain relevant especially as applied to the human genome. In this study, an Integrated Genome Sizing (IGS) approach is adopted to speed up multiple whole genome analysis in high-performance computing (HPC) environment. The approach splits a genome (GRCh37) into 630 chunks (fragments) wherein multiple chunks can simultaneously be parallelized for sequence analyses across cohorts.Results:IGS was integrated on Maha-Fs (HPC) system, to provide the parallelization required to analyze 2504 whole genomes. Using a single reference pilot genome, NA12878, we compared the NGS process time between Maha-Fs (NFS SATA hard disk drive) and SGI-UV300 (solid state drive memory). It was observed that SGI-UV300 was faster, having 32.5 mins of process time, while that of the Maha-Fs was 55.2 mins.Conclusions:The implementation of IGS can leverage the ability of HPC systems to analyze multiple genomes simultaneously. We believe this approach will accelerate research advancement in personalized genomic medicine. Our method is comparable to the fastest methods for sequence alignment.",30509173,PMC6276166,10.1186/s12859-018-2499-1,0,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,3.307

Two independent reviewers assessed the relevance of the publications to the objective of this review.Study selection:Studies that employed omics technologies to investigate dental caries were selected from the initial pool of identified publications. A total of 922 publications with one or more omics technologies adopted were included for comprehensive bibliographic analysis. (Meta)genomics (676/922, 73 %) is the predominant omics technology applied for cariology research in the included studies. Other applied omics technologies are metabolomics (108/922, 12 %), proteomics (105/922, 11 %), and transcriptomics (76/922, 8 %).Conclusion:This study identified an emerging trend in the application of multiple omics technologies in cariology research. Omics technologies possess significant potential in developing strategies for the detection, staging evaluation, risk assessment, prevention, and management of dental caries. Despite the numerous challenges that lie ahead, the integration of multi-omics data obtained from individual biological samples, in conjunction with artificial intelligence technology, may offer potential avenues for further exploration in caries research.Clinical significance:This review presented a comprehensive overview of the application of omics technologies in cariology research and discussed the advantages and challenges of using these methods to detect, assess, predict, prevent, and treat dental caries.

Computational identification of epigenetically regulated lncRNAs and their associated genes based on integrating genomic data,"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are new players in various biological processes. However, understanding of lncRNAs is still in its infancy. Here, we proposed an integrative method to identify epigenetically regulated lncRNAs and their associated genes. By combining RNA-seq data and ChIP-seq data for histone H3 trimethylated at lysine 4 (H3K4me3) and H3K27me3, we identified 699 H3K4me3-regulated and 235 H3K27me3-regulated lncRNAs, each with an average of 238 and 307 associated genes, respectively. By analyzing Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) binding maps, we observed that the negatively related genes of most epigenetically regulated lncRNAs were enriched for PRC2-binding genes. In addition, through enrichment analysis, we inferred some lncRNAs with aberrant epigenetic modifications in glioblastoma and Alzheimer's disease. Together, we describe a method for the analysis of lncRNAs and demonstrate how integration of multi-omics data can improve understanding of lncRNAs.",25616131,,10.1016/j.febslet.2015.01.013,15,FEBS letters,155157,3.864

Deep-Learning Algorithm and Concomitant Biomarker Identification for NSCLC Prediction Using Multi-Omics Data Integration,"Early diagnosis of lung cancer to increase the survival rate, which is currently at a low range of mid-30%, remains a critical need. Despite this, multi-omics data have rarely been applied to non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) diagnosis. We developed a multi-omics data-affinitive artificial intelligence algorithm based on the graph convolutional network that integrates mRNA expression, DNA methylation, and DNA sequencing data. This NSCLC prediction model achieved a 93.7% macro F1-score, indicating that values for false positives and negatives were substantially low, which is desirable for accurate classification. Gene ontology enrichment and pathway analysis of features revealed that two major subtypes of NSCLC, lung adenocarcinoma and lung squamous cell carcinoma, have both specific and common GO biological processes. Numerous biomarkers (i.e., microRNA, long non-coding RNA, differentially methylated regions) were newly identified, whereas some biomarkers were consistent with previous findings in NSCLC (e.g.,SPRR1B).

Multi-omics analysis of human mesenchymal stem cells shows cell aging that alters immunomodulatory activity through the downregulation of PD-L1,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) possess potent immunomodulatory activity and have been extensively investigated for their therapeutic potential in treating inflammatory disorders. However, the mechanisms underlying the immunosuppressive function of MSCs are not fully understood, hindering the development of standardized MSC-based therapies for clinical use. In this study, we profile the single-cell transcriptomes of MSCs isolated from adipose tissue (AD), bone marrow (BM), placental chorionic membrane (PM), and umbilical cord (UC). Our results demonstrate that MSCs undergo a progressive aging process and that the cellular senescence state influences their immunosuppressive activity by downregulating PD-L1 expression. Through integrated analysis of single-cell transcriptomic and proteomic data, we identify GATA2 as a regulator of MSC senescence and PD-L1 expression. Overall, our findings highlight the roles of cell aging and PD-L1 expression in modulating the immunosuppressive efficacy of MSCs and implicating perinatal MSC therapy for clinical applications in inflammatory disorders.",37474525,PMC10359415,10.1038/s41467-023-39958-5,6,Nature communications,101528555,17.694
Genomic technologies to improve variation identification in undiagnosed diseases,"Human genome variation has increasingly posed challenges and opportunities for patients, medical providers, and an increasing group of stakeholders including advocacy groups, disadvantaged communities, public health experts, and scientists. Here, advances in genomic sequencing and mapping technologies are discussed with particular attention to the increasing ability to detect personal and population genome variation and the potential for accurate integration of variation into health and disease-related care. Genome mapping, one technique used to create genome map scaffolds, has now been combined with long read sequencing. New technologies have led to improved variation detection, including cryptic structural variation and diverse variants with different degrees of disease association. Combined with advances in automated and medical interpretations, variation detection is increasingly being applied in healthcare. These advances promise to make disease diagnostics more rapid, and potentially more accessible, to those with medical needs.

Detecting virus integration sites based on multiple related sequencing data by VirTect,"Background:Since tumor often has a high level of intra-tumor heterogeneity, multiple tumor samples from the same patient at different locations or different time points are often sequenced to study tumor intra-heterogeneity or tumor evolution. In virus-related tumors such as human papillomavirus- and Hepatitis B Virus-related tumors, virus genome integrations can be critical driving events. It is thus important to investigate the integration sites of the virus genomes. Currently, a few algorithms for detecting virus integration sites based on high-throughput sequencing have been developed, but their insufficient performance in their sensitivity, specificity and computational complexity hinders their applications in multiple related tumor sequencing.Results:We develop VirTect for detecting virus integration sites simultaneously from multiple related-sample data. This algorithm is mainly based on the joint analysis of short reads spanning breakpoints of integration sites from multiple samples. To achieve high specificity and breakpoint accuracy, a local precise sandwich alignment algorithm is used. Simulation and real data analyses show that, compared with other algorithms, VirTect is significantly more sensitive and has a similar or lower false discovery rate.Conclusions:VirTect can provide more accurate breakpoint position and is computationally much more efficient in terms both memory requirement and computational time.",30704462,PMC6357354,10.1186/s12920-018-0461-8,11,BMC medical genomics,101319628,3.622

Multi-omic insight into the molecular networks of mitochondrial dysfunction in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease,"Background:Mitochondrial dysfunction has been linked to the development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but the genetic pathophysiology was not fully elucidated. We employed Mendelian randomization and colocalization analyses to investigate the associations between mitochondrial-related genes and IBD via integrating multi-omics.Methods:Summary-level data of mitochondrial gene methylation, expression and protein abundance levels were obtained from corresponding methylation, expression and protein quantitative trait loci studies, respectively. We obtained genetic associations with IBD and its two subtypes from the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Genetics Consortium (discovery), the UK Biobank (replication), and the FinnGen study (replication). We performed summary-data-based Mendelian randomization analysis to assess the associations of mitochondrial gene-related molecular features with IBD. Colocalization analysis was further conducted to assess whether the identified signal pairs shared a causal genetic variant.Findings:After integrating the multi-omics data between mQTL-eQTL and eQTL-pQTL, we identified two mitochondrial genes, i.e., PARK7 and ACADM, with tier 1 evidence for their associations with IBD and ulcerative colitis (UC). PDK1 and FISI genes were associated with UC risk with tier 2 and tier 3 evidence, respectively. The methylation of cg05467918 in ACADM was associated with lower expression of ACADM, which fits with the positive effect of cg05467918 methylation on UC risk. Consistently, the inverse associations between gene methylation and gene expression were also observed in PARK7 (cg10385390) and PDK1 (cg17679246), which were corroborated with the protective role in UC. At circulating protein level, genetically predicted higher levels of PARK7 (OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.25-0.52) and HINT1 (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.30-0.74) were inversely associated with IBD risk; genetically predicted higher level of HINT1 was associated with a decreased risk of Crohn's disease (CD) (OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.14-0.49) and a higher level of ACADM (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.55-0.83), PDK1 (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.49-0.81), FIS1 (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.47-0.83) was associated with a decreased risk of UC.Interpretation:We found that the mitochondrial PARK7 gene was putatively associated with IBD risk, and mitochondrial FIS1, PDK1, and ACADM genes were associated with UC risk with evidence from multi-omics levels.

KEGG for taxonomy-based analysis of pathways and genomes,"KEGG (https://www.kegg.jp) is a manually curated database resource integrating various biological objects categorized into systems, genomic, chemical and health information. Each object (database entry) is identified by the KEGG identifier (kid), which generally takes the form of a prefix followed by a five-digit number, and can be retrieved by appending /entry/kid in the URL. The KEGG pathway map viewer, the Brite hierarchy viewer and the newly released KEGG genome browser can be launched by appending /pathway/kid, /brite/kid and /genome/kid, respectively, in the URL. Together with an improved annotation procedure for KO (KEGG Orthology) assignment, an increasing number of eukaryotic genomes have been included in KEGG for better representation of organisms in the taxonomic tree. Multiple taxonomy files are generated for classification of KEGG organisms and viruses, and the Brite hierarchy viewer is used for taxonomy mapping, a variant of Brite mapping in the new KEGG Mapper suite. The taxonomy mapping enables analysis of, for example, how functional links of genes in the pathway and physical links of genes on the chromosome are conserved among organism groups.",36300620,PMC9825424,10.1093/nar/gkac963,1315,Nucleic acids research,411011,19.16
Applications of artificial intelligence multiomics in precision oncology,"Cancer is the second leading worldwide disease that depends on oncogenic mutations and non-mutated genes for survival. Recent advancements in next-generation sequencing (NGS) have transformed the health care sector with big data and machine learning (ML) approaches. NGS data are able to detect the abnormalities and mutations in the oncogenes. These multi-omics analyses are used for risk prediction, early diagnosis, accurate prognosis, and identification of biomarkers in cancer patients. The availability of these cancer data and their analysis may provide insights into the biology of the disease, which can be used for the personalized treatment of cancer patients. Bioinformatics tools are delivering this promise by managing, integrating, and analyzing these complex datasets. The clinical outcomes of cancer patients are improved by the use of various innovative methods implicated particularly for diagnosis and therapeutics. ML-based artificial intelligence (AI) applications are solving these issues to a great extent. AI techniques are used to update the patients on a personalized basis about their treatment procedures, progress, recovery, therapies used, dietary changes in lifestyles patterns along with the survival summary of previously recovered cancer patients. In this way, the patients are becoming more aware of their diseases and the entire clinical treatment procedures. Though the technology has its own advantages and disadvantages, we hope that the day is not so far when AI techniques will provide personalized treatment to cancer patients tailored to their needs in much quicker ways.",35796775,,10.1007/s00432-022-04161-4,4,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,4.322
"Murine allele and transgene symbols: ensuring unique, concise, and informative nomenclature","In addition to naturally occurring sequence variation and spontaneous mutations, a wide array of technologies exist for modifying the mouse genome. Standardized nomenclature, including allele, transgene, and other mutation nomenclature, as well as persistent unique identifiers (PUID) are critical for effective scientific communication, comparison of results, and integration of data into knowledgebases such as Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI), Alliance for Genome Resources, and International Mouse Strain Resource (IMSR). As well as being the authoritative source for mouse gene, allele, and strain nomenclature, MGI integrates published and unpublished genomic, phenotypic, and expression data while linking to other online resources for a complete view of the mouse as a valuable model organism. The International Committee on Standardized Genetic Nomenclature for Mice has developed allele nomenclature rules and guidelines that take into account the number of genes impacted, the method of allele generation, and the nature of the sequence alteration. To capture details that cannot be included in allele symbols, MGI has further developed allele to gene relationships using sequence ontology (SO) definitions for mutations that provide links between alleles and the genes affected. MGI is also using (HGVS) variant nomenclature for variants associated with alleles that will enhance searching for mutations and will improve cross-species comparison. With the ability to assign unique and informative symbols as well as to link alleles with more than one gene, allele and transgene nomenclature rules and guidelines provide an unambiguous way to represent alterations in the mouse genome and facilitate data integration among multiple resources such the Alliance of Genome Resources and International Mouse Strain Resource.",34389871,PMC8913455,10.1007/s00335-021-09902-3,1,Mammalian genome : official journal of the International Mammalian Genome Society,9100916,3.224

Multi-omics analysis revealed the brain dysfunction induced by energy metabolism in Pelteobagrus vachelli under hypoxia stress,"Hypoxia in water environment has become increasingly frequent and serious due to global warming and environmental pollution. Revealing the molecular mechanism of fish hypoxia adaptation will help to develop markers of environmental pollution caused by hypoxia. Here, we used a multi-omics method to identify the hypoxia-associated mRNA, miRNA, protein, and metabolite involved in various biological processes in Pelteobagrus vachelli brain. The results showed that hypoxia stress caused brain dysfunction by inhibiting energy metabolism. Specifically, the biological processes involved in energy synthesis and energy consumption are inhibited in P. vachelli brain under hypoxia, such as oxidative phosphorylation, carbohydrate metabolism and protein metabolism. Brain dysfunction is mainly manifested as blood-brain barrier injury accompanied by neurodegenerative diseases and autoimmune diseases. In addition, compared with previous studies, we found that P. vachelli has tissue specificity in response to hypoxia stress and the muscle suffers more damage than the brain. This is the first report to the integrated analysis of the transcriptome, miRNAome, proteome, and metabolome in fish brain. Our findings could provide insights into the molecular mechanisms of hypoxia, and the approach could also be applied to other fish species.

"AnnoView enables large-scale analysis, comparison, and visualization of microbial gene neighborhoods","The analysis and comparison of gene neighborhoods is a powerful approach for exploring microbial genome structure, function, and evolution. Although numerous tools exist for genome visualization and comparison, genome exploration across large genomic databases or user-generated datasets remains a challenge. Here, we introduce AnnoView, a web server designed for interactive exploration of gene neighborhoods across the bacterial and archaeal tree of life. Our server offers users the ability to identify, compare, and visualize gene neighborhoods of interest from 30 238 bacterial genomes and 1672 archaeal genomes, through integration with the comprehensive Genome Taxonomy Database and AnnoTree databases. Identified gene neighborhoods can be visualized using pre-computed functional annotations from different sources such as KEGG, Pfam and TIGRFAM, or clustered based on similarity. Alternatively, users can upload and explore their own custom genomic datasets in GBK, GFF or CSV format, or use AnnoView as a genome browser for relatively small genomes (e.g. viruses and plasmids).

Proteogenomics for understanding oncology: recent advances and future prospects,"The concept of proteogenomics has emerged rapidly as a valuable approach to integrate mass spectrometry-derived proteomic data with genomic and transcriptomic data. It is used to harness the full potential of the former dataset in the discovery of potential biomarkers, therapeutic targets and novel proteins associated with various biological processes including diseases. Proteogenomic strategies have been successfully utilized to identify novel genes and redefine annotation of existing gene models in various genomes. In recent years, this approach has been extended to the field of cancer biology to unravel complexities in the tumor genomes and proteomes. Standard proteomics workflows employing translated cancer genomes and transcriptomes can potentially identify peptides from mutant proteins, splice variants and fusion proteins in the tumor proteome, which in addition to the currently available biomarker panels can serve as potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, besides having therapeutic utility. This review focuses on the role of proteogenomics to understand cancer biology.",26697917,,10.1586/14789450.2016.1136217,9,Expert review of proteomics,101223548,4.25
"MicroScope: an integrated platform for the annotation and exploration of microbial gene functions through genomic, pangenomic and metabolic comparative analysis","Large-scale genome sequencing and the increasingly massive use of high-throughput approaches produce a vast amount of new information that completely transforms our understanding of thousands of microbial species.

Multi-omics analysis identifies EcCS4 is negatively regulated in response to phytotoxin isovaleric acid stress in Echinochloa crus-galli,"Background:Knowledge of herbicidal targets is critical for weed management and food safety. The phytotoxin isovaleric acid (ISA) is effective against weeds with a broad spectrum, carries low environmental risks, and is thus an excellent herbicide lead. However, the biochemical and molecular mechanisms underlying the action of ISA remain unclear.Results:Multi-omics data showed that acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) was the key affected metabolite, and that citrate synthase (CS) 4 was substantially down-regulated under ISA treatment in Echinochloa crus-galli leaves. In particular, the transcript level of EcCS4 was the most significantly regulated among the six genes involved in the top 10 different pathways. The EcCS4 encodes a protein of 472 amino acids and is localized to the cell membrane and mitochondria, similar to the CS4s of other plants. The protein content of EcCS4 was down-regulated after ISA treatment at 0.5 h. ISA markedly inhibited the CS4 activity in vitro in a concentration-dependent manner (IC50= 41.35 μM). In addition, the transgenic rice plants overexpressing EcCS4 (IC50= 111.8 mM for OECS4-8 line) were more sensitive, whereas loss-of-function rice mutant lines (IC50= 746.5 mM for oscs4-19) were more resistant to ISA, compared to wild type (WT) plants (IC50= 355.6 mM).Conclusion:CS4 was first reported as a negative regulator of plant responses to ISA. These results highlight that CS4 is a candidate target gene for the development of novel herbicides and for breeding herbicide-resistant crops. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.",38088480,,10.1002/ps.7927,0,Pest management science,100898744,4.462
National single-step genomic method that integrates multi-national genomic information,"The aim of this paper was to develop a national single-step genomic BLUP that integrates multi-national genomic estimated breeding values (EBV) and associated reliabilities without double counting dependent data contributions from the different evaluations. Simultaneous use of all data, including phenotypes, pedigree, and genotypes, is a condition to obtain unbiased EBV. However, this condition is not always fully met, mainly due to unavailability of foreign raw data for imported animals. In dairy cattle genetic evaluations, this issue is traditionally tackled through the multiple across-country evaluation (MACE) of sires, performed by Interbull Centre (Uppsala, Sweden). Multiple across-country evaluation regresses all the available national information onto a joint pedigree to obtain country-specific rankings of all sires without sharing the raw data. In the context of genomic selection, the issue is handled by exchanging sire genotypes and by using MACE information (i.e., MACE EBV and reliabilities), as a valuable source of ""phenotypic"" data. Although all the available data are considered, these ""multi-national"" genomic evaluations use multi-step methods assuming independence of various sources of information, which is not met in all situations. We developed a method that handles this by single-step genomic evaluation that jointly (1) uses national phenotypic, genomic, and pedigree data; (2) uses multi-national genomic information; and (3) avoids double counting dependent data contributions from an animal's own records and relatives' records. The method was demonstrated by integrating multi-national genomic EBV and reliabilities of Brown Swiss sires, included in the InterGenomics consortium at Interbull Centre, into the national evaluation in Slovenia. The results showed that the method could (1) increase reliability of a national (genomic) evaluation; (2) provide consistent ranking of all animals: bulls, cows, and young animals; and (3) increase the size of a genomic training population. These features provide more efficient and transparent selection throughout a breeding program.",27865486,,10.3168/jds.2016-11733,5,Journal of dairy science,2985126R,0.0
Integrative multi-omics analysis reveals the crucial biological pathways involved in the adaptive response to NaCl stress in peanut seedlings,"Plant growth is restricted by salt stress, which is a significant abiotic factor, particularly during the seedling stage. The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanisms underlying peanut adaptation to salt stress by transcriptomic and metabolomic analysis during the seedling stage. In this study, phenotypic variations of FH23 and NH5, two peanut varieties with contrasting tolerance to salt, changed obviously, with the strongest differences observed at 24 h. FH23 leaves wilted and the membrane system was seriously damaged. A total of 1470 metabolites were identified, with flavonoids being the most common (21.22%). Multi-omics analyses demonstrated that flavonoid biosynthesis (ko00941), isoflavones biosynthesis (ko00943), and plant hormone signal transduction (ko04075) were key metabolic pathways. The comparison of metabolites in isoflavone biosynthesis pathways of peanut varieties with different salt tolerant levels demonstrated that the accumulation of naringenin and formononetin may be the key metabolite leading to their different tolerance. Using our transcriptomic data, we identified three possible reasons for the difference in salt tolerance between the two varieties: (1) differential expression of LOC112715558 (HIDH) and LOC112709716 (HCT), (2) differential expression of LOC112719763 (PYR/PYL) and LOC112764051 (ABF) in the abscisic acid (ABA) signal transduction pathway, then (3) differential expression of genes encoding JAZ proteins (LOC112696383 and LOC112790545). Key metabolites and candidate genes related to improving the salt tolerance in peanuts were screened to promote the study of the responses of peanuts to NaCl stress and guide their genetic improvement.",38558467,,10.1111/ppl.14266,0,Physiologia plantarum,1256322,5.081
Generalized machine learning based on multi-omics data to profile the effect of ferroptosis pathway on prognosis and immunotherapy response in patients with bladder cancer,"Introduction:Bladder cancer (BLCA) affects millions of people worldwide, with high rates of incidence and mortality. Ferroptosis proves to be a novel form of cell death process that is triggered by oxidative stress.Methods:We procured a total of 25 single nuclear RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) samples from GSE169379 in GEO database. We obtained different cohorts of BLCA patients from the TCGA and GEO databases for model training and validation. A total of 369 ferroptosis-related genes (FRGs) were selected from the FerrDb database. AUCell analysis was performed to assign ferroptosis scores to all the cell types. Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis (WGCNA), COX, and LASSO regression analysis were conducted to retain and finalize the genes of prognostic values. Various bioinformatic approaches were utilized to depict immune infiltration profile. We conducted a series of colony formation analysis, flow cytometry and western blot (WB) analysis to determine the role of SKAP1 in BLCA.Results:We divided the cells into high ferroptosis group and low ferroptosis group according to ferroptosis activity score, and then screened 2150 genes most associated with ferroptosis by differential expression analysis, which are related to UV-induced DNA damage, male hormone response, fatty acid metabolism and hypoxia. Subsequently, WGCNA algorithm further screened 741 ferroptosis related genes from the 2150 genes for the construction of prognostic model. Lasso-Cox regression analysis was used to construct the prognostic model, and the prognostic model consisting of 6 genes was obtained, namely JUN, SYT1, MAP3K8, GALNT14, TCIRG1, and SKAP1. Next, we constructed a nomogram model that integrated clinical factors to improving the accuracy. In addition, we performed drug sensitivity analyses in different subgroups and found that Staurosporine, Rapamycin, Gemcitabine, and BI-2536 may be candidates for the drugs treatment in high-risk populations. The ESTIMATE results showed higher stromal scores, immune scores, and ESTIMATE scores in the low-risk group, indicating a higher overall immunity level and immunogenicity of tumor microenvironment (TME) in this group, and tumor immune dysfunction and exclusion (TIDE) analysis confirmed a better response to immunotherapy in the low-risk group. Finally, we selected the oncogene SKAP1 in the prognostic gene for in vitro validation, and found that SKAP1 directly regulated BLCA cell proliferation and apoptosis.Conclusion:We identified a set of six genes, JUN, SYT1, MAP3K8, GALNT14, TCIRG1, and SKAP1, that exhibited significant potential in stratification of BLCA patients with varying prognosis. In addition, we uncovered the direct regulatory effect of SKAP1 on BLCA cell proliferation and apoptosis, shedding some light on the role of FRGs in pathogenesis of BLCA.",37647346,,10.1002/tox.23949,1,Environmental toxicology,100885357,4.109

"Framework for the Integration of Genomics, Epigenomics and Transcriptomics in Complex Diseases","Objectives:Different types of '-omics' data are becoming available in the post-genome era; still a single -omics assessment provides limited insights to understand the biological mechanism of complex diseases. Genomics, epigenomics and transcriptomics data provide insight into the molecular dysregulation of neoplastic diseases, among them urothelial bladder cancer (UBC). Here, we propose a detailed analytical framework necessary to achieve an adequate integration of the three sets of -omics data to ultimately identify previously hidden genetic mechanisms in UBC.Methods:We built a multi-staged framework to study possible pair-wise combinations and integrated the data in three-way relationships. SNP genotypes, CpG methylation levels and gene expression levels were determined for a total of 70 individuals with UBC and with fresh tumour tissue available.Results:We suggest two main hypothesis-based scenarios for gene regulation based on the -omics integration analysis, where DNA methylation affects gene expression and genetic variants co-regulate gene expression and DNA methylation. We identified several three-way trans-association 'hotspots' that are found at the molecular level and that deserve further studies.Conclusions:The proposed integrative framework allowed us to identify relationships at the whole-genome level providing some new biological insights and highlighting the importance of integrating -omics data.",26201698,,10.1159/000381184,9,Human heredity,200525,1.455
Flexible comparative genomics of prokaryotic transcriptional regulatory networks,"Background:Comparative genomics methods enable the reconstruction of bacterial regulatory networks using available experimental data. In spite of their potential for accelerating research into the composition and evolution of bacterial regulons, few comparative genomics suites have been developed for the automated analysis of these regulatory systems. Available solutions typically rely on precomputed databases for operon and ortholog predictions, limiting the scope of analyses to processed complete genomes, and several key issues such as the transfer of experimental information or the integration of regulatory information in a probabilistic setting remain largely unaddressed.Results:Here we introduce CGB, a flexible platform for comparative genomics of prokaryotic regulons. CGB has few external dependencies and enables fully customized analyses of newly available genome data. The platform automates the merging of experimental information and uses a gene-centered, Bayesian framework to generate and integrate easily interpretable results. We demonstrate its flexibility and power by analyzing the evolution of type III secretion system regulation in pathogenic Proteobacteria and by characterizing the SOS regulon of a new bacterial phylum, the Balneolaeota.Conclusions:Our results demonstrate the applicability of the CGB pipeline in multiple settings. CGB's ability to automatically integrate experimental information from multiple sources and use complete and draft genomic data, coupled with its non-reliance on precomputed databases and its easily interpretable display of gene-centered posterior probabilities of regulation provide users with an unprecedented level of flexibility in launching comparative genomics analyses of prokaryotic transcriptional regulatory networks. The analyses of type III secretion and SOS response regulatory networks illustrate instances of convergent and divergent evolution of these regulatory systems, showcasing the power of formal ancestral state reconstruction at inferring the evolutionary history of regulatory networks.",33327941,PMC7739468,10.1186/s12864-020-06838-x,2,BMC genomics,100965258,4.547
"Pan-cancer evidence of prognosis, immune infiltration, and immunotherapy efficacy for annexin family using multi-omics data","The annexin superfamily (ANXA) is made up of 12 calcium (Ca2+) and phospholipid binding protein members that have a high structural homology and play a key function in cancer cells. However, little research has been done on the annexin family's function in pan-cancer. We examined the ANXA family's expression in various tumors through public databases using bioinformatics analysis, assessed the differences in ANXA expression between tumor and normal tissues in pan-cancer, and then investigated the relationship between ANXA expression and patient survival, prognosis, and clinicopathologic traits. Additionally, we investigated the relationships among TCGA cancers' mutations, tumor mutation burden (TMB), microsatellite instability (MSI), immunological subtypes, immune infiltration, tumor microenvironment, immune checkpoint genes, chemotherapeutics sensitivity, and ANXAs expression. cBioPortal was also used to uncover pan-cancer genomic anomalies in the ANXA family, study relationships between pan-cancer ANXA mRNA expression and copy number or somatic mutations, and assess the prognostic values of these variations. Moreover, we investigated the relationship between ANXAs expression and effectiveness of immunotherapy in multiple cohorts, including one melanoma (GSE78220), one renal cell carcinoma (GSE67501), and three bladder cancer cohorts (GSE111636, IMvigor210 and our own sequencing dataset (TRUCE-01)), and further analyzed the changes of ANXAs expression before and after treatment (tislelizumab combined with nab-paclitaxel) of bladder cancer. Then, we explored the biological function and potential signaling pathway of ANXAs using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), and first conducted immune infiltration analysis with ANXAs family genes expression, copy number, or somatic mutations of bladder cancer by TIMER 2.0. Most cancer types and surrounding normal tissues expressed ANXA differently. ANXA expression was linked to patient survival, prognosis, clinicopathologic features, mutations, TMB, MSI, immunological subtypes, tumor microenvironment, immune cell infiltration, and immune checkpoint gene expression in 33 TCGA cancers, with ANXA family members varied. The anticancer drug sensitivity analysis showed that ANXAs family members were significantly related to a variety of drug sensitivities. In addition, we also discovered that the expression level of ANXA1/2/3/4/5/7/9/10 was positively or negatively correlated with objective responses to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 across multiple immunotherapy cohorts. The immune infiltration analysis of bladder cancer further showed the significant relationships between ANXAs copy number variations or mutation status, and infiltration level of different immune cells. Overall, our analyses confirm the importance of ANXAs expression or genomic alterations in prognosis and immunological features of various cancer and identified ANXA-associated genes that may serve as potential therapeutic targets.",37358720,,10.1007/s10142-023-01106-z,0,Functional & integrative genomics,100939343,3.674
EMT network-based feature selection improves prognosis prediction in lung adenocarcinoma,"Various feature selection algorithms have been proposed to identify cancer prognostic biomarkers. In recent years, however, their reproducibility is criticized. The performance of feature selection algorithms is shown to be affected by the datasets, underlying networks and evaluation metrics. One of the causes is the curse of dimensionality, which makes it hard to select the features that generalize well on independent data. Even the integration of biological networks does not mitigate this issue because the networks are large and many of their components are not relevant for the phenotype of interest. With the availability of multi-omics data, integrative approaches are being developed to build more robust predictive models. In this scenario, the higher data dimensions create greater challenges. We proposed a phenotype relevant network-based feature selection (PRNFS) framework and demonstrated its advantages in lung cancer prognosis prediction. We constructed cancer prognosis relevant networks based on epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) and integrated them with different types of omics data for feature selection. With less than 2.5% of the total dimensionality, we obtained EMT prognostic signatures that achieved remarkable prediction performance (average AUC values >0.8), very significant sample stratifications, and meaningful biological interpretations. In addition to finding EMT signatures from different omics data levels, we combined these single-omics signatures into multi-omics signatures, which improved sample stratifications significantly. Both single- and multi-omics EMT signatures were tested on independent multi-omics lung cancer datasets and significant sample stratifications were obtained.",30703089,PMC6354965,10.1371/journal.pone.0204186,5,PloS one,101285081,3.752

A brief review of software tools for pangenomics,"Since the proposal for pangenomic study, there have been a dozen software tools actively in use for pangenomic analysis. By the end of 2014, Panseq and the pan-genomes analysis pipeline (PGAP) ranked as the top two most popular packages according to cumulative citations of peer-reviewed scientific publications. The functions of the software packages and tools, albeit variable among them, include categorizing orthologous genes, calculating pangenomic profiles, integrating gene annotations, and constructing phylogenies. As epigenomic elements are being gradually revealed in prokaryotes, it is expected that pangenomic databases and toolkits have to be extended to handle information of detailed functional annotations for genes and non-protein-coding sequences including non-coding RNAs, insertion elements, and conserved structural elements. To develop better bioinformatic tools, user feedback and integration of novel features are both of essence.",25721608,PMC4411478,10.1016/j.gpb.2015.01.007,23,"Genomics, proteomics & bioinformatics",101197608,6.409
Multi-omics indicators of long-term survival benefits after immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy,"Molecular indicators of long-term survival (LTS) in response to immune-checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatment have the potential to provide both mechanistic and therapeutic insights. In this study, we construct predictive models of LTS following ICI therapy based on data from 158 clinical trials involving 21,023 patients of 25 cancer types with available 1-year overall survival (OS) rates. We present evidence for the use of 1-year OS rate as a surrogate for LTS. Based on these and corresponding TCGA multi-omics data, total neoantigen, metabolism score, CD8+T cell, and MHC_score were identified as predictive biomarkers. These were integrated into a Gaussian process regression model that estimates ""long-term survival predictive score of immunotherapy"" (iLSPS). We found that iLSPS outperformed the predictive capabilities of individual biomarkers and successfully predicted LTS of patient groups with melanoma and lung cancer. Our study explores the feasibility of modeling LTS based on multi-omics indicators and machine-learning methods.",37738982,PMC10626191,10.1016/j.crmeth.2023.100596,1,Cell reports methods,9918227360606676,0.0
Dynamic molecular choreography induced by acute heat exposure in human males: a longitudinal multi-omics profiling study,"Introduction:Extreme heat events caused by occupational exposure and heat waves are becoming more common. However, the molecular changes underlying the response to heat exposure in humans remain to be elucidated.Methods:This study used longitudinal multi-omics profiling to assess the impact of acute heat exposure (50°C for 30 min) in 24 subjects from a mine rescue team. Intravenous blood samples were collected before acute heat exposure (baseline) and at 5 min, 30 min, 1 h, and 24 h after acute heat exposure (recovery). In-depth multi-omics profiling was performed on each sample, including plasma proteomics (untargeted) and metabolomics (untargeted).Results:After data curation and annotation, the final dataset contained 2,473 analytes, including 478 proteins and 1995 metabolites. Time-series analysis unveiled an orchestrated molecular choreography of changes involving the immune response, coagulation, acid-base balance, oxidative stress, cytoskeleton, and energy metabolism. Further analysis through protein-protein interactions and network analysis revealed potential regulators of acute heat exposure. Moreover, novel blood-based analytes that predicted change in cardiopulmonary function after acute heat exposure were identified.Conclusion:This study provided a comprehensive investigation of the dynamic molecular changes that underlie the complex physiological processes that occur in human males who undergo heat exposure. Our findings will help health impact assessment of extreme high temperature and inspire future mechanistic and clinical studies.",38813424,PMC11135052,10.3389/fpubh.2024.1384544,0,Frontiers in public health,101616579,6.461
IMG/VR v.2.0: an integrated data management and analysis system for cultivated and environmental viral genomes,"The Integrated Microbial Genome/Virus (IMG/VR) system v.2.0 (https://img.jgi.doe.gov/vr/) is the largest publicly available data management and analysis platform dedicated to viral genomics. Since the last report published in the 2016, NAR Database Issue, the data has tripled in size and currently contains genomes of 8389 cultivated reference viruses, 12 498 previously published curated prophages derived from cultivated microbial isolates, and 735 112 viral genomic fragments computationally predicted from assembled shotgun metagenomes. Nearly 60% of the viral genomes and genome fragments are clustered into 110 384 viral Operational Taxonomic Units (vOTUs) with two or more members. To improve data quality and predictions of host specificity, IMG/VR v.2.0 now separates prokaryotic and eukaryotic viruses, utilizes known prophage sequences to improve taxonomic assignments, and provides viral genome quality scores based on the estimated genome completeness. New features also include enhanced BLAST search capabilities for external queries. Finally, geographic map visualization to locate user-selected viral genomes or genome fragments has been implemented and download options have been extended.

DICEP: An integrative approach to augmenting genomic island detection,"Mobilization of clusters of genes called genomic islands (GIs) across bacterial lineages facilitates dissemination of traits, such as, resistance against antibiotics, virulence or hypervirulence, and versatile metabolic capabilities. Robust delineation of GIs is critical to understanding bacterial evolution that has a vast impact on different life forms. Methods for identification of GIs exploit different evolutionary features or signals encoded within the genomes of bacteria, however, the current state-of-the-art in GI detection still leaves much to be desired. Here, we have taken a combinatorial approach that accounted for GI specific features such as compositional bias, aberrant phyletic pattern, and marker gene enrichment within an integrative framework to delineate GIs in bacterial genomes. Our GI prediction tool, DICEP, was assessed on simulated genomes and well-characterized bacterial genomes. DICEP compared favorably with current GI detection tools on real and synthetic datasets.",38641137,,10.1016/j.jbiotec.2024.04.011,0,Journal of biotechnology,8411927,3.595
"Links between melanoma germline risk loci, driver genes and comorbidities: insight from a tissue-specific multi-omic analysis","Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have associated 76 loci with the risk of developing melanoma. However, understanding the molecular basis of such associations has remained a challenge because most of these loci are in non-coding regions of the genome. Here, we integrated data on epigenomic markers, three-dimensional (3D) genome organization, and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) from melanoma-relevant tissues and cell types to gain novel insights into the mechanisms underlying melanoma risk. This integrative approach revealed a total of 151 target genes, both near and far away from the risk loci in linear sequence, with known and novel roles in the etiology of melanoma. Using protein-protein interaction networks, we identified proteins that interact-directly or indirectly-with the products of the target genes. The interacting proteins were enriched for known melanoma driver genes. Further integration of these target genes into tissue-specific gene regulatory networks revealed patterns of gene regulation that connect melanoma to its comorbidities. Our study provides novel insights into the biological implications of genetic variants associated with melanoma risk.",38308491,PMC10994230,10.1002/1878-0261.13599,0,Molecular oncology,101308230,7.449
Effect of genomic and cellular environments on gene expression noise,"Background:Individual cells from isogenic populations often display large cell-to-cell differences in gene expression. This ""noise"" in expression derives from several sources, including the genomic and cellular environment in which a gene resides. Large-scale maps of genomic environments have revealed the effects of epigenetic modifications and transcription factor occupancy on mean expression levels, but leveraging such maps to explain expression noise will require new methods to assay how expression noise changes at locations across the genome.Results:To address this gap, we present Single-cell Analysis of Reporter Gene Expression Noise and Transcriptome (SARGENT), a method that simultaneously measures the noisiness of reporter genes integrated throughout the genome and the global mRNA profiles of individual reporter-gene-containing cells. Using SARGENT, we perform the first comprehensive genome-wide survey of how genomic locations impact gene expression noise. We find that the mean and noise of expression correlate with different histone modifications. We quantify the intrinsic and extrinsic components of reporter gene noise and, using the associated mRNA profiles, assign the extrinsic component to differences between the CD24+ ""stem-like"" substate and the more ""differentiated"" substate. SARGENT also reveals the effects of transgene integrations on endogenous gene expression, which will help guide the search for ""safe-harbor"" loci.Conclusions:Taken together, we show that SARGENT is a powerful tool to measure both the mean and noise of gene expression at locations across the genome and that the data generatd by SARGENT reveals important insights into the regulation of gene expression noise genome-wide.",38790076,PMC11127367,10.1186/s13059-024-03277-9,0,Genome biology,100960660,17.906
Darwinian genomics and diversity in the tree of life,"Genomics encompasses the entire tree of life, both extinct and extant, and the evolutionary processes that shape this diversity. To date, genomic research has focused on humans, a small number of agricultural species, and established laboratory models. Fewer than 18,000 of ∼2,000,000 eukaryotic species (<1%) have a representative genome sequence in GenBank, and only a fraction of these have ancillary information on genome structure, genetic variation, gene expression, epigenetic modifications, and population diversity. This imbalance reflects a perception that human studies are paramount in disease research. Yet understanding how genomes work, and how genetic variation shapes phenotypes, requires a broad view that embraces the vast diversity of life. We have the technology to collect massive and exquisitely detailed datasets about the world, but expertise is siloed into distinct fields. A new approach, integrating comparative genomics with cell and evolutionary biology, ecology, archaeology, anthropology, and conservation biology, is essential for understanding and protecting ourselves and our world. Here, we describe potential for scientific discovery when comparative genomics works in close collaboration with a broad range of fields as well as the technical, scientific, and social constraints that must be addressed.",35042807,PMC8795533,10.1073/pnas.2115644119,9,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,12.779
"Smart breeding driven by big data, artificial intelligence, and integrated genomic-enviromic prediction","The first paradigm of plant breeding involves direct selection-based phenotypic observation, followed by predictive breeding using statistical models for quantitative traits constructed based on genetic experimental design and, more recently, by incorporation of molecular marker genotypes. However, plant performance or phenotype (P) is determined by the combined effects of genotype (G), envirotype (E), and genotype by environment interaction (GEI). Phenotypes can be predicted more precisely by training a model using data collected from multiple sources, including spatiotemporal omics (genomics, phenomics, and enviromics across time and space). Integration of 3D information profiles (G-P-E), each with multidimensionality, provides predictive breeding with both tremendous opportunities and great challenges. Here, we first review innovative technologies for predictive breeding. We then evaluate multidimensional information profiles that can be integrated with a predictive breeding strategy, particularly envirotypic data, which have largely been neglected in data collection and are nearly untouched in model construction. We propose a smart breeding scheme, integrated genomic-enviromic prediction (iGEP), as an extension of genomic prediction, using integrated multiomics information, big data technology, and artificial intelligence (mainly focused on machine and deep learning). We discuss how to implement iGEP, including spatiotemporal models, environmental indices, factorial and spatiotemporal structure of plant breeding data, and cross-species prediction. A strategy is then proposed for prediction-based crop redesign at both the macro (individual, population, and species) and micro (gene, metabolism, and network) scales. Finally, we provide perspectives on translating smart breeding into genetic gain through integrative breeding platforms and open-source breeding initiatives. We call for coordinated efforts in smart breeding through iGEP, institutional partnerships, and innovative technological support.",36081348,,10.1016/j.molp.2022.09.001,28,Molecular plant,101465514,21.949
Genome puzzle master (GPM): an integrated pipeline for building and editing pseudomolecules from fragmented sequences,"Motivation:Next generation sequencing technologies have revolutionized our ability to rapidly and affordably generate vast quantities of sequence data. Once generated, raw sequences are assembled into contigs or scaffolds. However, these assemblies are mostly fragmented and inaccurate at the whole genome scale, largely due to the inability to integrate additional informative datasets (e.g. physical, optical and genetic maps). To address this problem, we developed a semi-automated software tool-Genome Puzzle Master (GPM)-that enables the integration of additional genomic signposts to edit and build 'new-gen-assemblies' that result in high-quality 'annotation-ready' pseudomolecules.Results:With GPM, loaded datasets can be connected to each other via their logical relationships which accomplishes tasks to 'group,' 'merge,' 'order and orient' sequences in a draft assembly. Manual editing can also be performed with a user-friendly graphical interface. Final pseudomolecules reflect a user's total data package and are available for long-term project management. GPM is a web-based pipeline and an important part of a Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) which can be easily deployed on local servers for any genome research laboratory.Availability and implementation:The GPM (with LIMS) package is available at https://github.com/Jianwei-Zhang/LIMS CONTACTS: jzhang@mail.hzau.edu.cn or rwing@mail.arizona.eduSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",27318200,PMC5048067,10.1093/bioinformatics/btw370,14,"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",9808944,6.931
HySA: a Hybrid Structural variant Assembly approach using next-generation and single-molecule sequencing technologies,"Achieving complete, accurate, and cost-effective assembly of human genomes is of great importance for realizing the promise of precision medicine. The abundance of repeats and genetic variations in human genomes and the limitations of existing sequencing technologies call for the development of novel assembly methods that can leverage the complementary strengths of multiple technologies. We propose a Hybrid Structural variant Assembly (HySA) approach that integrates sequencing reads from next-generation sequencing and single-molecule sequencing technologies to accurately assemble and detect structural variants (SVs) in human genomes. By identifying homologous SV-containing reads from different technologies through a bipartite-graph-based clustering algorithm, our approach turns a whole genome assembly problem into a set of independent SV assembly problems, each of which can be effectively solved to enhance the assembly of structurally altered regions in human genomes. We used data generated from a haploid hydatidiform mole genome (CHM1) and a diploid human genome (NA12878) to test our approach. The result showed that, compared with existing methods, our approach had a low false discovery rate and substantially improved the detection of many types of SVs, particularly novel large insertions, small indels (10-50 bp), and short tandem repeat expansions and contractions. Our work highlights the strengths and limitations of current approaches and provides an effective solution for extending the power of existing sequencing technologies for SV discovery.",28104618,PMC5411774,10.1101/gr.214767.116,16,Genome research,9518021,9.438
MMCL-CDR: enhancing cancer drug response prediction with multi-omics and morphology images contrastive representation learning,"Motivation:Cancer is a complex disease that results in a significant number of global fatalities. Treatment strategies can vary among patients, even if they have the same type of cancer. The application of precision medicine in cancer shows promise for treating different types of cancer, reducing healthcare expenses, and improving recovery rates. To achieve personalized cancer treatment, machine learning models have been developed to predict drug responses based on tumor and drug characteristics. However, current studies either focus on constructing homogeneous networks from single data source or heterogeneous networks from multiomics data. While multiomics data have shown potential in predicting drug responses in cancer cell lines, there is still a lack of research that effectively utilizes insights from different modalities. Furthermore, effectively utilizing the multimodal knowledge of cancer cell lines poses a challenge due to the heterogeneity inherent in these modalities.Results:To address these challenges, we introduce MMCL-CDR (Multimodal Contrastive Learning for Cancer Drug Responses), a multimodal approach for cancer drug response prediction that integrates copy number variation, gene expression, morphology images of cell lines, and chemical structure of drugs. The objective of MMCL-CDR is to align cancer cell lines across different data modalities by learning cell line representations from omic and image data, and combined with structural drug representations to enhance the prediction of cancer drug responses (CDR). We have carried out comprehensive experiments and show that our model significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in CDR prediction. The experimental results also prove that the model can learn more accurate cell line representation by integrating multiomics and morphological data from cell lines, thereby improving the accuracy of CDR prediction. In addition, the ablation study and qualitative analysis also confirm the effectiveness of each part of our proposed model. Last but not least, MMCL-CDR opens up a new dimension for cancer drug response prediction through multimodal contrastive learning, pioneering a novel approach that integrates multiomics and multimodal drug and cell line modeling.Availability and implementation:MMCL-CDR is available at https://github.com/catly/MMCL-CDR.",38070154,PMC10756335,10.1093/bioinformatics/btad734,0,"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",9808944,6.931
Cntnap2-dependent molecular networks in autism spectrum disorder revealed through an integrative multi-omics analysis,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a major neurodevelopmental disorder in which patients present with core symptoms of social communication impairment, restricted interest, and repetitive behaviors. Although various studies have been performed to identify ASD-related mechanisms, ASD pathology is still poorly understood. CNTNAP2 genetic variants have been found that represent ASD genetic risk factors, and disruption of Cntnap2 expression has been associated with ASD phenotypes in mice. In this study, we performed an integrative multi-omics analysis by combining quantitative proteometabolomic data obtained with Cntnap2 knockout (KO) mice with multi-omics data obtained from ASD patients and forebrain organoids to elucidate Cntnap2-dependent molecular networks in ASD. To this end, a mass spectrometry-based proteometabolomic analysis of the medial prefrontal cortex in Cntnap2 KO mice led to the identification of Cntnap2-associated molecular features, and these features were assessed in combination with multi-omics data obtained on the prefrontal cortex in ASD patients to identify bona fide ASD cellular processes. Furthermore, a reanalysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data obtained from forebrain organoids derived from patients with CNTNAP2-associated ASD revealed that the aforementioned identified ASD processes were mainly linked to excitatory neurons. On the basis of these data, we constructed Cntnap2-associated ASD network models showing mitochondrial dysfunction, axonal impairment, and synaptic activity. Our results may shed light on the Cntnap2-dependent molecular networks in ASD.",36253443,PMC9908544,10.1038/s41380-022-01822-1,6,Molecular psychiatry,9607835,13.437
Integrative pathway-based survival prediction utilizing the interaction between gene expression and DNA methylation in breast cancer,"Background:Integrative analysis on multi-omics data has gained much attention recently. To investigate the interactive effect of gene expression and DNA methylation on cancer, we propose a directed random walk-based approach on an integrated gene-gene graph that is guided by pathway information.Methods:Our approach first extracts a single pathway profile matrix out of the gene expression and DNA methylation data by performing the random walk over the integrated graph. We then apply a denoising autoencoder to the pathway profile to further identify important pathway features and genes. The extracted features are validated in the survival prediction task for breast cancer patients.Results:The results show that the proposed method substantially improves the survival prediction performance compared to that of other pathway-based prediction methods, revealing that the combined effect of gene expression and methylation data is well reflected in the integrated gene-gene graph combined with pathway information. Furthermore, we show that our joint analysis on the methylation features and gene expression profile identifies cancer-specific pathways with genes related to breast cancer.Conclusions:In this study, we proposed a DRW-based method on an integrated gene-gene graph with expression and methylation profiles in order to utilize the interactions between them. The results showed that the constructed integrated gene-gene graph can successfully reflect the combined effect of methylation features on gene expression profiles. We also found that the selected features by DA can effectively extract topologically important pathways and genes specifically related to breast cancer.",30255812,PMC6157196,10.1186/s12920-018-0389-z,11,BMC medical genomics,101319628,3.622
Multi-omics data integration for the identification of biomarkers for bull fertility,"Bull fertility is an important economic trait, and the use of subfertile semen for artificial insemination decreases the global efficiency of the breeding sector. Although the analysis of semen functional parameters can help to identify infertile bulls, no tools are currently available to enable precise predictions and prevent the commercialization of subfertile semen. Because male fertility is a multifactorial phenotype that is dependent on genetic, epigenetic, physiological and environmental factors, we hypothesized that an integrative analysis might help to refine our knowledge and understanding of bull fertility. We combined -omics data (genotypes, sperm DNA methylation at CpGs and sperm small non-coding RNAs) and semen parameters measured on a large cohort of 98 Montbéliarde bulls with contrasting fertility levels. Multiple Factor Analysis was conducted to study the links between the datasets and fertility. Four methodologies were then considered to identify the features linked to bull fertility variation: Logistic Lasso, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting and Neural Networks. Finally, the features selected by these methods were annotated in terms of genes, to conduct functional enrichment analyses. The less relevant features in -omics data were filtered out, and MFA was run on the remaining 12,006 features, including the 11 semen parameters and a balanced proportion of each type of-omics data. The results showed that unlike the semen parameters studied the-omics datasets were related to fertility. Biomarkers related to bull fertility were selected using the four methodologies mentioned above. The most contributory CpGs, SNPs and miRNAs targeted genes were all found to be involved in development. Interestingly, fragments derived from ribosomal RNAs were overrepresented among the selected features, suggesting roles in male fertility. These markers could be used in the future to identify subfertile bulls in order to increase the global efficiency of the breeding sector.",38394258,PMC10890740,10.1371/journal.pone.0298623,0,PloS one,101285081,3.752
Molluscan phylogenomics requires strategically selected genomes,"The extraordinary diversity in molluscan body plans, and the genomic mechanisms that enable it, remains one of the great questions of evolution. The eight distinct living taxonomic classes of molluscs are each unambiguously monophyletic; however, significant controversy remains about the phylogenetic relationships among those eight branches. Molluscs are the second-largest animal phylum, with over 100 000 living species with broad biological, economic and medical interest. To date, only around 53 genome assemblies have been accessioned to NCBI GenBank covering only four of the eight living molluscan classes. Furthermore, the molluscan taxa where partial or whole-genome assemblies are available are often aberrantly fast evolving or recently derived lineages. Characteristic adaptations provide interesting targets for whole-genome projects, in animals like the scaly-foot snail or octopus, but without basal-branching lineages for comparison, the context of recently derived features cannot be assessed. The currently available genomes also create a non-optimal set of taxa for resolving deeper phylogenetic branches: they are a small sample representing a large group, and those that are available come primarily from a rarefied pool. Thoughtful selection of taxa for future projects should focus on the blank areas of the molluscan tree, which are ripe with opportunities to delve into peculiarities of genome evolution, and reveal the biology and evolutionary history of molluscs.

Integration of single sample and population analysis for understanding immune evasion mechanisms of lung cancer,"A deep understanding of the complex interaction mechanism between the various cellular components in tumor microenvironment (TME) of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is a prerequisite for understanding its drug resistance, recurrence, and metastasis. In this study, we proposed two complementary computational frameworks for integrating multi-source and multi-omics data, namely ImmuCycReg framework (single sample level) and L0Reg framework (population or subtype level), to carry out difference analysis between the normal population and different LUAD subtypes. Then, we aimed to identify the possible immune escape pathways adopted by patients with different LUAD subtypes, resulting in immune deficiency which may occur at different stages of the immune cycle. More importantly, combining the research results of the single sample level and population level can improve the credibility of the regulatory network analysis results. In addition, we also established a prognostic scoring model based on the risk factors identified by Lasso-Cox method to predict survival of LUAD patients. The experimental results showed that our frameworks could reliably identify transcription factor (TF) regulating immune-related genes and could analyze the dominant immune escape pathways adopted by each LUAD subtype or even a single sample. Note that the proposed computational framework may be also applicable to the immune escape mechanism analysis of pan-cancer.",36765073,PMC9918494,10.1038/s41540-023-00267-8,0,NPJ systems biology and applications,101677786,4.671
MAE-seq refines regulatory elements across the genome,"Proper cell fate determination relies on precise spatial and temporal genome-wide cooperation between regulatory elements (REs) and their targeted genes. However, the lengths of REs defined using different methods vary, which indicates that there is sequence redundancy and that the context of the genome may be unintelligible. We developed a method called MAE-seq (Massive Active Enhancers by Sequencing) to experimentally identify functional REs at a 25-bp scale. In this study, MAE-seq was used to identify 626879, 541617 and 554826 25-bp enhancers in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), C2C12 and HEK 293T, respectively. Using ∼1.6 trillion 25 bp DNA fragments and screening 12 billion cells, we identified 626879 as active enhancers in mESCs as an example. Comparative analysis revealed that most of the histone modification datasets were annotated by MAE-Seq loci. Furthermore, 33.85% (212195) of the identified enhancers were identified as de novo ones with no epigenetic modification. Intriguingly, distinct chromatin states dictate the requirement for dissimilar cofactors in governing novel and known enhancers. Validation results show that these 25-bp sequences could act as a functional unit, which shows identical or similar expression patterns as the previously defined larger elements, Enhanced resolution facilitated the identification of numerous cell-specific enhancers and their accurate annotation as super enhancers. Moreover, we characterized novel elements capable of augmenting gene activity. By integrating with high-resolution Hi-C data, over 55.64% of novel elements may have a distal association with different targeted genes. For example, we found that the Cdh1 gene interacts with one novel and two known REs in mESCs. The biological effects of these interactions were investigated using CRISPR-Cas9, revealing their role in coordinating Cdh1 gene expression and mESC proliferation. Our study presents an experimental approach to refine the REs at 25-bp resolution, advancing the precision of genome annotation and unveiling the underlying genome context. This novel approach not only advances our understanding of gene regulation but also opens avenues for comprehensive exploration of the genomic landscape.",38038259,PMC10810209,10.1093/nar/gkad1129,0,Nucleic acids research,411011,19.16
MODEC: an unsupervised clustering method integrating omics data for identifying cancer subtypes,"The identification of cancer subtypes can help researchers understand hidden genomic mechanisms, enhance diagnostic accuracy and improve clinical treatments. With the development of high-throughput techniques, researchers can access large amounts of data from multiple sources. Because of the high dimensionality and complexity of multiomics and clinical data, research into the integration of multiomics data is needed, and developing effective tools for such purposes remains a challenge for researchers. In this work, we proposed an entirely unsupervised clustering method without harnessing any prior knowledge (MODEC). We used manifold optimization and deep-learning techniques to integrate multiomics data for the identification of cancer subtypes and the analysis of significant clinical variables. Since there is nonlinearity in the gene-level datasets, we used manifold optimization methodology to extract essential information from the original omics data to obtain a low-dimensional latent subspace. Then, MODEC uses a deep learning-based clustering module to iteratively define cluster centroids and assign cluster labels to each sample by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence loss. MODEC was applied to six public cancer datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas database and outperformed eight competing methods in terms of the accuracy and reliability of the subtyping results. MODEC was extremely competitive in the identification of survival patterns and significant clinical features, which could help doctors monitor disease progression and provide more suitable treatment strategies.",36094092,,10.1093/bib/bbac372,3,Briefings in bioinformatics,100912837,13.994
DrugTargetInspector: An assistance tool for patient treatment stratification,"Cancer is a large class of diseases that are characterized by a common set of features, known as the Hallmarks of cancer. One of these hallmarks is the acquisition of genome instability and mutations. This, combined with high proliferation rates and failure of repair mechanisms, leads to clonal evolution as well as a high genotypic and phenotypic diversity within the tumor. As a consequence, treatment and therapy of malignant tumors is still a grand challenge. Moreover, under selective pressure, e.g., caused by chemotherapy, resistant subpopulations can emerge that then may lead to relapse. In order to minimize the risk of developing multidrug-resistant tumor cell populations, optimal (combination) therapies have to be determined on the basis of an in-depth characterization of the tumor's genetic and phenotypic makeup, a process that is an important aspect of stratified medicine and precision medicine. We present DrugTargetInspector (DTI), an interactive assistance tool for treatment stratification. DTI analyzes genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic datasets and provides information on deregulated drug targets, enriched biological pathways, and deregulated subnetworks, as well as mutations and their potential effects on putative drug targets and genes of interest. To demonstrate DTI's broad scope of applicability, we present case studies on several cancer types and different types of input -omics data. DTI's integrative approach allows users to characterize the tumor under investigation based on various -omics datasets and to elucidate putative treatment options based on clinical decision guidelines, but also proposing additional points of intervention that might be neglected otherwise.

Clustering analysis revealed the autophagy classification and potential autophagy regulators' sensitivity of pancreatic cancer based on multi-omics data,"Background:Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a lethal malignancy and is unresponsive to conventional therapeutic modalities due to its high heterogeneity, expounding the necessity, and priority of searching for effective biomarkers and drugs. Autophagy, as an evolutionarily conserved biological process, is upregulated in PDAC and its regulation is linked to a poor prognosis. Increased autophagy sequestered MHC-I on PDAC cells and weaken the antigen presentation and antitumor immune response, indicating the potential therapeutic strategies of autophagy inhibitors.Methods:By performing 10 state-of-the-art multi-omics clustering algorithms, we constructed a robust PDAC classification model to reveal the autophagy-related genes among different subgroups.Outcomes:After building a more comprehensive regulating network for potential autophagy regulators exploration, we concluded the top 20 autophagy-related hub genes (GAPDH, MAPK3, RHEB, SQSTM1, EIF2S1, RAB5A, CTSD, MAP1LC3B, RAB7A, RAB11A, FADD, CFKN2A, HSP90AB1, VEGFA, RELA, DDIT3, HSPA5, BCL2L1, BAG3, and ERBB2), six miRNAs, five transcription factors, and five immune infiltrated cells as biomarkers. The drug sensitivity database was screened based on the biomarkers to predict possible drug-targeting signal pathways, hoping to yield novel insights, and promote the progress of the anticancer therapeutic strategy.Conclusion:We succefully constructed an autophagy-related mRNA/miRNA/TF/Immune cells network based on a 10 state-of art algorithm multi-omics analysis, and screened the drug sensitivity dataset for detecting potential signal pathway which might be possible autophagy modulators' targets.",35684936,PMC9844610,10.1002/cam4.4932,3,Cancer medicine,101595310,4.711
Supporting community annotation and user collaboration in the integrated microbial genomes (IMG) system,"Background:The exponential growth of genomic data from next generation technologies renders traditional manual expert curation effort unsustainable. Many genomic systems have included community annotation tools to address the problem. Most of these systems adopted a ""Wiki-based"" approach to take advantage of existing wiki technologies, but encountered obstacles in issues such as usability, authorship recognition, information reliability and incentive for community participation.Results:Here, we present a different approach, relying on tightly integrated method rather than ""Wiki-based"" method, to support community annotation and user collaboration in the Integrated Microbial Genomes (IMG) system. The IMG approach allows users to use existing IMG data warehouse and analysis tools to add gene, pathway and biosynthetic cluster annotations, to analyze/reorganize contigs, genes and functions using workspace datasets, and to share private user annotations and workspace datasets with collaborators. We show that the annotation effort using IMG can be part of the research process to overcome the user incentive and authorship recognition problems thus fostering collaboration among domain experts. The usability and reliability issues are addressed by the integration of curated information and analysis tools in IMG, together with DOE Joint Genome Institute (JGI) expert review.Conclusion:By incorporating annotation operations into IMG, we provide an integrated environment for users to perform deeper and extended data analysis and annotation in a single system that can lead to publications and community knowledge sharing as shown in the case studies.",27118214,PMC4847265,10.1186/s12864-016-2629-y,31,BMC genomics,100965258,4.547
Multi-omics integration to explore the molecular insight into the volatile organic compounds in watermelon,"A range of volatile organic compounds played an important role in the formation of watermelon fruit aroma, while due to the low content and difficulty in detection, it is often neglected in watermelon breeding programs, resulting in a decline in fruit flavor. VOCs in the flesh of 194 watermelon accessions and seven cultivars at four developmental stages were determined by SPME-GC-MS. Ten metabolites with significant differences in the natural population and positive accumulation during fruit development are considered to be the key metabolite related to watermelon fruit aroma. And the link between metabolite and, flesh color and sugar content by correlation analysis was established. The results of the genome-wide association study showed that (5E)-6,10-dimethylundeca-5,9-dien-2-one, and 1-(4-methylphenyl) ethanone were colocalized with watermelon flesh color on chromosome 4, which may be regulated by LCYB and CCD. (E)-4-(2,6,6-trimethylcyclohexen-1-yl)but-3-en-2-one is the VOC produced by the cleavage of carotenoids, which has a positive correlation with the sugar content of the fruit, and the candidate gene Cla97C05G092490 on chromosome 5 may interact with PSY to influence the accumulation of this metabolite. In addition, Cla97C02G049790 (enol reductase), Cla97C03G051490 (omega-3 fatty acid desaturase gene), LOX, and ADH may play important roles in the synthesis of fatty acids and their derived VOCs. Taken together, our findings provide molecular insights into the accumulation and natural variation of VOCs in watermelon, and give data support for breeding watermelon cultivars with better flavor.",36914327,,10.1016/j.foodres.2023.112603,0,"Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",9210143,7.425

Molecular mechanism of drought resistance in soybean roots revealed using physiological and multi-omics analyses,"Soybeans are one of the most cultivated crops worldwide and drought can seriously affect their growth and development. Many studies have elucidated the mechanisms through which soybean leaves respond to drought; however, little is known about these mechanisms in roots. We used two soybean varieties with different drought tolerances to study the morphological, physiological, and molecular response mechanisms of the root system to drought stress in seedlings. We found that drought stress led to a significant decrease in the root traits and an increase in antioxidant enzyme activity in the two varieties. Drought-resistant varieties accumulate large amounts of flavonoids and phenolic acids at the metabolic level, which causes variations in drought resistance. Additionally, differences in gene expression and drought-resistance pathways between the two varieties were clarified using transcriptome analysis. Through a multi-omics joint analysis, phenylpropanoid and isoflavonoid biosynthesis were identified as the core drought resistance pathways in soybean roots. Candidate genes and marker metabolites affecting drought resistance were identified. The phenylpropanoid pathway confers drought tolerance to roots by maintaining a high level of POD activity and mediates the biosynthesis of various secondary drought-resistant metabolites to resist drought stress. This study provides useful data for investigating plant root drought responses and offers theoretical support for plant breeding for drought resistance.",38402799,,10.1016/j.plaphy.2024.108451,1,Plant physiology and biochemistry : PPB,9882449,5.437
MapMan4: A Refined Protein Classification and Annotation Framework Applicable to Multi-Omics Data Analysis,"Genome sequences from over 200 plant species have already been published, with this number expected to increase rapidly due to advances in sequencing technologies. Once a new genome has been assembled and the genes identified, the functional annotation of their putative translational products, proteins, using ontologies is of key importance as it places the sequencing data in a biological context. Furthermore, to keep pace with rapid production of genome sequences, this functional annotation process must be fully automated. Here we present a redesigned and significantly enhanced MapMan4 framework, together with a revised version of the associated online Mercator annotation tool. Compared with the original MapMan, the new ontology has been expanded almost threefold and enforces stricter assignment rules. This framework was then incorporated into Mercator4, which has been upgraded to reflect current knowledge across the land plant group, providing protein annotations for all embryophytes with a comparably high quality. The annotation process has been optimized to allow a plant genome to be annotated in a matter of minutes. The output results continue to be compatible with the established MapMan desktop application.",30639314,,10.1016/j.molp.2019.01.003,166,Molecular plant,101465514,21.949
Low-density lipoprotein receptor promotes crosstalk between cell stemness and tumor immune microenvironment in breast cancer: a large data-based multi-omics study,"Background:Tumor cells with stemness in breast cancer might facilitate the immune microenvironment's suppression process and led to anti-tumor immune effects. The primary objective of this study was to identify potential targets to disrupt the communication between cancer cell stemness and the immune microenvironment.Methods:In this study, we initially isolated tumor cells with varying degrees of stemness using a spheroid formation assay. Subsequently, we employed RNA-seq and proteomic analyses to identify genes associated with stemness through gene trend analysis. These stemness-related genes were then subjected to pan-cancer analysis to elucidate their functional roles in a broader spectrum of cancer types. RNA-seq data of 3132 patients with breast cancer with clinical data were obtained from public databases. Using the identified stemness genes, we constructed two distinct stemness subtypes, denoted as C1 and C2. We subsequently conducted a comprehensive analysis of the differences between these subtypes using pathway enrichment methodology and immune infiltration algorithms. Furthermore, we identified key immune-related stemness genes by employing lasso regression analysis and a Cox survival regression model. We conducted in vitro experiments to ascertain the regulatory impact of the key gene on cell stemness. Additionally, we utilized immune infiltration analysis and pan-cancer analysis to delineate the functions attributed to this key gene. Lastly, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was employed to conduct a more comprehensive examination of the key gene's role within the microenvironment.Results:In our study, we initially identified a set of 65 stemness-related genes in breast cancer cells displaying varying stemness capabilities. Subsequently, through survival analysis, we pinpointed 41 of these stemness genes that held prognostic significance. We observed that the C2 subtype exhibited a higher stemness capacity compared to the C1 subtype and displayed a more aggressive malignancy profile. Further analysis using Lasso-Cox algorithm identified LDLR as a pivotal immune-related stemness gene. It became evident that LDLR played a crucial role in shaping the immune microenvironment. In vitro experiments demonstrated that LDLR regulated the cell stemness of breast cancer. Immune infiltration analysis and pan-cancer analysis determined that LDLR inhibited the proliferation of immune cells and might promote tumor cell progression. Lastly, in our scRNA-seq analysis, we discovered that LDLR exhibited associations with stemness marker genes within breast cancer tissues. Moreover, LDLR demonstrated higher expression levels in tumor cells compared to immune cells, further emphasizing its relevance in the context of breast cancer.Conclusion:LDLR is an important immune stemness gene that regulates cell stemness and enhances the crosstalk between breast cancer cancer cell stemness and tumor immune microenvironment.",38037058,PMC10691045,10.1186/s12967-023-04699-y,4,Journal of translational medicine,101190741,8.44
VIRIDIC-A Novel Tool to Calculate the Intergenomic Similarities of Prokaryote-Infecting Viruses,"Nucleotide-based intergenomic similarities are useful to understand how viruses are related with each other and to classify them. Here we have developed VIRIDIC, which implements the traditional algorithm used by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV), Bacterial and Archaeal Viruses Subcommittee, to calculate virus intergenomic similarities. When compared with other software, VIRIDIC gave the best agreement with the traditional algorithm, which is based on the percent identity between two genomes determined by BLASTN. Furthermore, VIRIDIC proved best at estimating the relatedness between more distantly-related phages, relatedness that other tools can significantly overestimate. In addition to the intergenomic similarities, VIRIDIC also calculates three indicators of the alignment ability to capture the relatedness between viruses: the aligned fractions for each genome in a pair and the length ratio between the two genomes. The main output of VIRIDIC is a heatmap integrating the intergenomic similarity values with information regarding the genome lengths and the aligned genome fraction. Additionally, VIRIDIC can group viruses into clusters, based on user-defined intergenomic similarity thresholds. The sensitivity of VIRIDIC is given by the BLASTN. Thus, it is able to capture relationships between viruses having in common even short genomic regions, with as low as 65% similarity. Below this similarity level, protein-based analyses should be used, as they are the best suited to capture distant relationships. VIRIDIC is available at viridic.icbm.de, both as a web-service and a stand-alone tool. It allows fast analysis of large phage genome datasets, especially in the stand-alone version, which can be run on the user's own servers and can be integrated in bioinformatics pipelines. VIRIDIC was developed having viruses ofBacteriaandArchaeain mind; however, it could potentially be used for eukaryotic viruses as well, as long as they are monopartite.",33172115,PMC7694805,10.3390/v12111268,232,Viruses,101509722,5.818
"Targeted proteomic analysis of cognitive dysfunction in remitted major depressive disorder: Opportunities of multi-omics approaches towards predictive, preventive, and personalized psychiatry","In order to accelerate the understanding of pathophysiological mechanisms and clinical biomarker discovery and in psychiatry, approaches that integrate multiple -omics platforms are needed. We introduce a workflow that investigates a narrowly defined psychiatric phenotype, makes use of the potent and cost-effective discovery technology of gene expression microarrays, applies Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) to better capture complex and polygenic traits, and finally explores gene expression findings on the proteomic level using targeted mass-spectrometry (MS) technologies. To illustrate the effectiveness of the workflow, we present a proteomic analysis of peripheral blood plasma from patient's remitted major depressive disorder (MDD) who experience ongoing cognitive deficits. We show that co-expression patterns previous detected on the transcript level could be replicated for plasma proteins, as could the module eigengene correlation with cognitive performance. Further, we demonstrate that functional analysis of multi-omics data has the potential to point to cellular mechanisms and candidate biomarkers for cognitive dysfunction in MDD, implicating cell cycle regulation by cyclin D3 (CCND3), regulation of protein processing in the endoplasmatic reticulum by Thioredoxin domain-containing protein 5 (TXND5), and modulation of inflammatory cytokines by Tripartite Motif Containing 26 (TRI26).Significance:This paper discusses how data from multiple -omics platforms can be integrated to accelerate biomarker discovery in psychiatry. Using the phenotype of cognitive impairment in remitted major depressive disorder (MDD) as an example, we show that the application of a systems biology approach - weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) - in the discovery phase, and targeted proteomic follow-up of results, provides a structured avenue towards uncovering novel candidate markers and pathways for personalized clinical psychiatry.",29474866,,10.1016/j.jprot.2018.02.023,9,Journal of proteomics,101475056,3.855
Multi-Omics Analysis Reveals Intricate Gene Networks Involved in Female Development in Melon,"Sexual differentiation is an important developmental phenomenon in cucurbits that directly affects fruit yield. The natural existence of multiple flower types in melon offers an inclusive structure for studying the molecular basis of sexual differentiation. The current study aimed to identify and characterize the molecular network involved in sex determination and female development in melon. Male and female pools separated by the F2segregated generation were used for sequencing. The comparative multi-omics data revealed 551 DAPs and 594 DEGs involved in multiple pathways of melon growth and development, and based on functional annotation and enrichment analysis, we summarized four biological process modules, including ethylene biosynthesis, flower organ development, plant hormone signaling, and ubiquitinated protein metabolism, that are related to female development. Furthermore, the detailed analysis of the female developmental regulatory pathway model of ethylene biosynthesis, signal transduction, and target gene regulation identified some important candidates that might have a crucial role in female development. Two CMTs ((cytosine-5)-methyltransferase), one AdoHS (adenosylhomocysteinase), four ACSs (1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase), three ACOs (ACC oxidase), two ARFs (auxin response factor), four ARPs (auxin-responsive protein), and six ERFs (Ethylene responsive factor) were identified based on various female developmental regulatory models. Our data offer new and valuable insights into female development and hold the potential to offer a deeper comprehension of sex differentiation mechanisms in melon.",38069227,PMC10706797,10.3390/ijms242316905,0,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,6.208
A Fast and Quantitative Method for Post-translational Modification and Variant Enabled Mapping of Peptides to Genomes,"Cross-talk between genes, transcripts, and proteins is the key to cellular responses; hence, analysis of molecular levels as distinct entities is slowly being extended to integrative studies to enhance the understanding of molecular dynamics within cells. Current tools for the visualization and integration of proteomics with other omics datasets are inadequate for large-scale studies. Furthermore, they only capture basic sequence identify, discarding post-translational modifications and quantitation. To address these issues, we developed PoGo to map peptides with associated post-translational modifications and quantification to reference genome annotation. In addition, the tool was developed to enable the mapping of peptides identified from customized sequence databases incorporating single amino acid variants. While PoGo is a command line tool, the graphical interface PoGoGUI enables non-bioinformatics researchers to easily map peptides to 25 species supported by Ensembl genome annotation. The generated output borrows file formats from the genomics field and, therefore, visualization is supported in most genome browsers. For large-scale studies, PoGo is supported by TrackHubGenerator to create web-accessible repositories of data mapped to genomes that also enable an easy sharing of proteogenomics data. With little effort, this tool can map millions of peptides to reference genomes within only a few minutes, outperforming other available sequence-identity based tools. This protocol demonstrates the best approaches for proteogenomics mapping through PoGo with publicly available datasets of quantitative and phosphoproteomics, as well as large-scale studies.",29889196,PMC6101353,10.3791/57633,2,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,101313252,1.424
SesameFG: an integrated database for the functional genomics of sesame,"Sesame (Sesamum indicum L.) has high oil content, a small diploid genome and a short growth period, making it an attractive species for genetic studies on oilseed crops. With the advancement of next-generation sequencing technology, genomics and functional genomics research of sesame has developed quickly in the last few years, and large amounts of data have been generated. However, these results are distributed in many different publications, and there is a lack of integration.

Oxeiptosis core genes and their multi-omics analysis in hepatocellular carcinoma,"Oxeiptosis is a recently discovered caspase-independent, non-inflammatory programmed cell death modality. Current studies suggest that oxeiptosis has crucial effects on biological processes in a variety of diseases. However, the mechanism of oxeiptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear and no relevant studies have been published. Therefore, this study is intended to investigate the mechanism and prognostic role of oxeiptosis-related genes in HCC. We explored the mechanisms and molecular phenotypes underlying the role of oxeiptosis in HCC through multi-omics analysis. Firstly, we obtained RNA-sequencing and clinical data from public database and divided the samples into trial and validation cohorts in subsequent analyses. We then screened oxeiptosis core genes (OCGs) and screened prognosis-related genes. Based on different molecular markers, we identified the molecular phenotypes of HCC, and the potential OCGs molecular mechanisms were explored. Subsequently, we construct a prognostic prediction system for HCC. Finally, we analyzed the tumor microenvironment and the immune escape phenomenon. We screened a total of 69 OCGs, most of which were prognostic risk factors for HCC. A majority of OCGs were enriched in cell cycle regulation and mitotic processes, which were related to both tumor cell proliferation and death. We identified 2 different molecular typing options with significant differences in prognosis, function, and signaling pathway enrichment between different molecular subtypes. The prognostic prediction model combined with molecular phenotypes and had a good predictive effect. Finally, we found CD4 + T-cell exhaustion in samples with specific molecular phenotypes. Through multi-omics analysis of OCGs, we not only revealed the possible molecular mechanisms of OCGs in HCC but also provided a prognostic prediction system for clinical application through molecular typing and risk scoring model. Meanwhile, we found immune escape mechanisms in HCC.",37960791,PMC10637422,10.1097/MD.0000000000036051,0,Medicine,2985248R,0.0
Network-based integrative analysis of single-cell transcriptomic and epigenomic data for cell types,"Advances in single-cell biotechnologies simultaneously generate the transcriptomic and epigenomic profiles at cell levels, providing an opportunity for investigating cell fates. Although great efforts have been devoted to either of them, the integrative analysis of single-cell multi-omics data is really limited because of the heterogeneity, noises and sparsity of single-cell profiles. In this study, a network-based integrative clustering algorithm (aka NIC) is present for the identification of cell types by fusing the parallel single-cell transcriptomic (scRNA-seq) and epigenomic profiles (scATAC-seq or DNA methylation). To avoid heterogeneity of multi-omics data, NIC automatically learns the cell-cell similarity graphs, which transforms the fusion of multi-omics data into the analysis of multiple networks. Then, NIC employs joint non-negative matrix factorization to learn the shared features of cells by exploiting the structure of learned cell-cell similarity networks, providing a better way to characterize the features of cells. The graph learning and integrative analysis procedures are jointly formulated as an optimization problem, and then the update rules are derived. Thirteen single-cell multi-omics datasets from various tissues and organisms are adopted to validate the performance of NIC, and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of various measurements. The proposed algorithm provides an effective strategy for the integrative analysis of single-cell multi-omics data (The software is coded using Matlab, and is freely available for academic https://github.com/xkmaxidian/NIC ).",35043143,,10.1093/bib/bbab546,4,Briefings in bioinformatics,100912837,13.994
Bayesian integrative model for multi-omics data with missingness,"Motivation:Integrative analysis of multi-omics data from different high-throughput experimental platforms provides valuable insight into regulatory mechanisms associated with complex diseases, and gains statistical power to detect markers that are otherwise overlooked by single-platform omics analysis. In practice, a significant portion of samples may not be measured completely due to insufficient tissues or restricted budget (e.g. gene expression profile are measured but not methylation). Current multi-omics integrative methods require complete data. A common practice is to ignore samples with any missing platform and perform complete case analysis, which leads to substantial loss of statistical power.Methods:In this article, inspired by the popular Integrative Bayesian Analysis of Genomics data (iBAG), we propose a full Bayesian model that allows incorporation of samples with missing omics data.Results:Simulation results show improvement of the new full Bayesian approach in terms of outcome prediction accuracy and feature selection performance when sample size is limited and proportion of missingness is large. When sample size is large or the proportion of missingness is low, incorporating samples with missingness may introduce extra inference uncertainty and generate worse prediction and feature selection performance. To determine whether and how to incorporate samples with missingness, we propose a self-learning cross-validation (CV) decision scheme. Simulations and a real application on child asthma dataset demonstrate superior performance of the CV decision scheme when various types of missing mechanisms are evaluated.Availability and implementation:Freely available on the GitHub at https://github.com/CHPGenetics/FBM.Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",30184058,PMC6223369,10.1093/bioinformatics/bty775,12,"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",9808944,6.931
MHSNMF: multi-view hessian regularization based symmetric nonnegative matrix factorization for microbiome data analysis,"Background:With the rapid development of high-throughput technique, multiple heterogeneous omics data have been accumulated vastly (e.g., genomics, proteomics and metabolomics data). Integrating information from multiple sources or views is challenging to obtain a profound insight into the complicated relations among micro-organisms, nutrients and host environment. In this paper we propose a multi-view Hessian regularization based symmetric nonnegative matrix factorization algorithm (MHSNMF) for clustering heterogeneous microbiome data. Compared with many existing approaches, the advantages of MHSNMF lie in: (1) MHSNMF combines multiple Hessian regularization to leverage the high-order information from the same cohort of instances with multiple representations; (2) MHSNMF utilities the advantages of SNMF and naturally handles the complex relationship among microbiome samples; (3) uses the consensus matrix obtained by MHSNMF, we also design a novel approach to predict the classification of new microbiome samples.Results:We conduct extensive experiments on two real-word datasets (Three-source dataset and Human Microbiome Plan dataset), the experimental results show that the proposed MHSNMF algorithm outperforms other baseline and state-of-the-art methods. Compared with other methods, MHSNMF achieves the best performance (accuracy: 95.28%, normalized mutual information: 91.79%) on microbiome data. It suggests the potential application of MHSNMF in microbiome data analysis.Conclusions:Results show that the proposed MHSNMF algorithm can effectively combine the phylogenetic, transporter, and metabolic profiles into a unified paradigm to analyze the relationships among different microbiome samples. Furthermore, the proposed prediction method based on MHSNMF has been shown to be effective in judging the types of new microbiome samples.",33203357,PMC7672850,10.1186/s12859-020-03555-w,0,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,3.307
Pan-cancer analyses reveal multi-omic signatures and clinical implementations of the forkhead-box gene family,"Background:Forkhead box (FOX) proteins belong to one of the largest transcription factor families and play crucial roles in the initiation and progression of cancer. Prior research has linked several FOX genes, such as FOXA1 and FOXM1, to the crucial process of carcinogenesis. However, the overall picture of FOX gene family across human cancers is far from clear.Methods:To investigate the broad molecular signatures of the FOX gene family, we conducted study on multi-omics data (including genomics, epigenomics and transcriptomics) from over 11,000 patients with 33 different types of human cancers.Results:Pan-cancer analysis reveals that FOX gene mutations were found in 17.4% of tumor patients with a substantial cancer type-dependent pattern. Additionally, high expression heterogeneity of FOX genes across cancer types was discovered, which can be partially attributed to the genomic or epigenomic alteration. Co-expression network analysis reveals that FOX genes may exert functions by regulating the expression of both their own and target genes. For a clinical standpoint, we provided 103 FOX gene-drug target-drug predictions and found FOX gene expression have potential survival predictive value. All of the results have been included in the FOX2Cancer database, which is freely accessible at http://hainmu-biobigdata.com/FOX2Cancer.Conclusion:Our findings may provide a better understanding of roles FOX genes played in the development of tumors, and help to offer new avenues for uncovering tumorigenesis and unprecedented therapeutic targets.",37401400,PMC10501247,10.1002/cam4.6312,1,Cancer medicine,101595310,4.711

Phenome and genome based studies into human ageing and longevity: An overview,"Human ageing is an extremely personal process leading across the life course of individuals to large population heterogeneity in the decline of functional capacity, health and lifespan. The extremes of this process are witnessed by the healthy vital 100-year-olds on one end and the 60-year-olds suffering from multiple morbid conditions on the other end of the spectrum. Molecular studies into the basis of this heterogeneity have focused on a range of endpoints and methodological approaches. The phenotype definitions most prominently investigated in these studies are either lifespan-related or biomarker based indices of the biological ageing rate of individuals and their tissues. Unlike for many complex, age-related diseases, consensus on the ultimate set of multi-biomarker ageing or lifespan-related phenotypes for genetic and genomic studies has not been reached yet. Comparable to animal models, hallmarks of age-related disease risk, healthy ageing and longevity include immune and metabolic pathways. Potentially novel genomic regions and pathways have been identified among many (epi)genomic studies into chronological age and studies into human lifespan regulation, with APOE and FOXO3A representing yet the most robust loci. Functional analysis of a handful of genes in cell-based and animal models is ongoing. The way forward in human ageing and longevity studies seems through improvements in the interpretation of the biology of the genome, in application of computational and systems biology, integration with animal models and by harmonization of repeated phenotypic and omics measures in longitudinal and intervention studies.

Genome-Wide Analysis of Transposon and Retroviral Insertions Reveals Preferential Integrations in Regions of DNA Flexibility,"DNA transposons and retroviruses are important transgenic tools for genome engineering. An important consideration affecting the choice of transgenic vector is their insertion site preferences. Previous large-scale analyses of Ds transposon integration sites in plants were done on the basis of reporter gene expression or germ-line transmission, making it difficult to discern vertebrate integration preferences. Here, we compare over 1300 Ds transposon integration sites in zebrafish with Tol2 transposon and retroviral integration sites. Genome-wide analysis shows that Ds integration sites in the presence or absence of marker selection are remarkably similar and distributed throughout the genome. No strict motif was found, but a preference for structural features in the target DNA associated with DNA flexibility (Twist, Tilt, Rise, Roll, Shift, and Slide) was observed. Remarkably, this feature is also found in transposon and retroviral integrations in maize and mouse cells. Our findings show that structural features influence the integration of heterologous DNA in genomes, and have implications for targeted genome engineering.",26818075,PMC4825651,10.1534/g3.115.026849,15,"G3 (Bethesda, Md.)",101566598,3.542
JSNMF enables effective and accurate integrative analysis of single-cell multiomics data,"The single-cell multiomics technologies provide an unprecedented opportunity to study the cellular heterogeneity from different layers of transcriptional regulation. However, the datasets generated from these technologies tend to have high levels of noise, making data analysis challenging. Here, we propose jointly semi-orthogonal nonnegative matrix factorization (JSNMF), which is a versatile toolkit for the integrative analysis of transcriptomic and epigenomic data profiled from the same cell. JSNMF enables data visualization and clustering of the cells and also facilitates downstream analysis, including the characterization of markers and functional pathway enrichment analysis. The core of JSNMF is an unsupervised method based on JSNMF, where it assumes different latent variables for the two molecular modalities, and integrates the information of transcriptomic and epigenomic data with consensus graph fusion, which better tackles the distinct characteristics and levels of noise across different molecular modalities in single-cell multiomics data. We applied JSNMF to single-cell multiomics datasets from different tissues and different technologies. The results demonstrate the superior performance of JSNMF in clustering and data visualization of the cells. JSNMF also allows joint analysis of multiple single-cell multiomics experiments and single-cell multiomics data with more than two modalities profiled on the same cell. JSNMF also provides rich biological insight on the markers, cell-type-specific region-gene associations and the functions of the identified cell subpopulation.",35380624,,10.1093/bib/bbac105,6,Briefings in bioinformatics,100912837,13.994
OmicsAnalyst: a comprehensive web-based platform for visual analytics of multi-omics data,"Data analysis and interpretation remain a critical bottleneck in current multi-omics studies. Here, we introduce OmicsAnalyst, a user-friendly, web-based platform that allows users to perform a wide range of well-established data-driven approaches for multi-omics integration, and visually explore their results in a clear and meaningful manner. To help navigate complex landscapes of multi-omics analysis, these approaches are organized into three visual analytics tracks: (i) the correlation network analysis track, where users choose among univariate and multivariate methods to identify important features and explore their relationships in 2D or 3D networks; (ii) the cluster heatmap analysis track, where users apply several cutting-edge multi-view clustering algorithms and explore their results via interactive heatmaps; and (iii) the dimension reduction analysis track, where users choose among several recent multivariate techniques to reveal global data structures, and explore corresponding scores, loadings and biplots in interactive 3D scatter plots. The three visual analytics tracks are equipped with comprehensive options for parameter customization, view customization and targeted analysis. OmicsAnalyst lowers the access barriers to many well-established methods for multi-omics integration via novel visual analytics.

Integrating genomic resources of flatfish (Pleuronectiformes) to boost aquaculture production,"Flatfish have a high market acceptance thus representing a profitable aquaculture production. The main farmed species is the turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) followed by Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceous) and tongue sole (Cynoglossus semilaevis), but other species like Atlantic halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus), Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis) and common sole (Solea solea) also register an important production and are very promising for farming. Important genomic resources are available for most of these species including whole genome sequencing projects, genetic maps and transcriptomes. In this work, we integrate all available genomic information of these species within a common framework, taking as reference the whole assembled genomes of turbot and tongue sole (>210× coverage). New insights related to the genetic basis of productive traits and new data useful to understand the evolutionary origin and diversification of this group were obtained. Despite a general 1:1 chromosome syntenic relationship between species, the comparison of turbot and tongue sole genomes showed huge intrachromosomic reorganizations. The integration of available mapping information supported specific chromosome fusions along flatfish evolution and facilitated the comparison between species of previously reported genetic associations for productive traits. When comparing transcriptomic resources of the six species, a common set of ~2500 othologues and ~150 common miRNAs were identified, and specific sets of putative missing genes were detected in flatfish transcriptomes, likely reflecting their evolutionary diversification.",28063346,,10.1016/j.cbd.2016.12.001,9,"Comparative biochemistry and physiology.

Multi-omics analysis reveals the molecular basis of flavonoid accumulation in fructus of Gardenia (Gardenia jasminoides Ellis),"Background:The fruits of Gardenia are rich in flavonoids and geniposides, which have various pharmacological effects such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anticancer. In this study, we analyzed the transcriptome and metabolome of gardenia peel and kernel at different growth stages, revealed the regulatory network related to flavonoid synthesis, and identified the key regulatory genes.Results:The results showed that in terms of flavonoid metabolic pathways, gardenia fruits mainly synthesized cinnamic acid through the phenylpropanoid pathway, and then synthesized flavonoids through the action of catalytic enzymes such as 4-coumaroyl-CoA ligase, chalcone synthase, chalcone isomerase and flavanol synthase, respectively. In addition, we found that the metabolomics data showed a certain spatial and temporal pattern in the expression of genes related to the flavonoid metabolism pathway and the relative content of metabolites, which was related to the development and ripening process of the fruit.Conclusions:In summary, this study successfully screened out the key genes related to the biosynthesis metabolism of flavonoids in gardenia through the joint analysis of transcriptome and metabolome. This is of certain significance to the in-depth study of the formation mechanism of gardenia efficacy components and the improvement of quality.",37794356,PMC10548582,10.1186/s12864-023-09666-x,0,BMC genomics,100965258,4.547
Genome organization and botanical diversity,"The rich diversity of angiosperms, both the planet's dominant flora and the cornerstone of agriculture, is integrally intertwined with a distinctive evolutionary history. Here, we explore the interplay between angiosperm genome organization and botanical diversity, empowered by genomic approaches ranging from genetic linkage mapping to analysis of gene regulation. Commonality in the genetic hardware of plants has enabled robust comparative genomics that has provided a broad picture of angiosperm evolution and implicated both general processes and specific elements in contributing to botanical diversity. We argue that the hardware of plant genomes-both in content and in dynamics-has been shaped by selection for rather substantial differences in gene regulation between plants and animals such as maize and human, organisms of comparable genome size and gene number. Their distinctive genome content and dynamics may reflect in part the indeterminate development of plants that puts strikingly different demands on gene regulation than in animals. Repeated polyploidization of plant genomes and multiplication of individual genes together with extensive rearrangement and differential retention provide rich raw material for selection of morphological and/or physiological variations conferring fitness in specific niches, whether natural or artificial. These findings exemplify the burgeoning information available to employ in increasing knowledge of plant biology and in modifying selected plants to better meet human needs.",38382084,,10.1093/plcell/koae045,2,The Plant cell,9208688,12.085
Multi-omics analysis reveals that ferroptosis-related gene CISD2 is a prognostic biomarker of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,"Background:Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a prevalent malignancy, with high mortality rate and unavailability of accurate therapies. However, its early prevention remains a challenge. In the purview of predictive, preventive, and personalized medicine (PPPM), it is paramount to identify novel and powerful biomarkers. CISD2 is a crucial regulator of iron homeostasis and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Recent studies showed that the NEET protein (NAF-1) encoded by CISD2 is involved in regulating the proliferation and metastasis of tumor cells. Nevertheless, the prognostic value and immunological correlations of CISD2 remain unclear.Methods:Bioinformatics analyses conducted utilizing data from comprehensive databases The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). All statistical evaluations were executed employing R software.Results:Our investigation of biological function, enrichment pathway, and immune correlation revealed a discernable linkage between CISD2 and the immune response. Moreover, we found that the suppression of CISD2 is associated with immune cell infiltration and various immune signatures.Conclusions:The present study successfully revealed the potential prognostic and biological function of CISD2 in HNSCC. High expression of CISD2 are linked to gender, race, grade, etc., can notably enhance the early detection, prognosis, and prediction for individuals afflicted with HNSCC.",37581006,,10.1002/jgm.3580,0,The journal of gene medicine,9815764,4.152
Multilevel omics for the discovery of biomarkers and therapeutic targets for stroke,"Despite many years of research, no biomarkers for stroke are available to use in clinical practice. Progress in high-throughput technologies has provided new opportunities to understand the pathophysiology of this complex disease, and these studies have generated large amounts of data and information at different molecular levels. The integration of these multi-omics data means that thousands of proteins (proteomics), genes (genomics), RNAs (transcriptomics) and metabolites (metabolomics) can be studied simultaneously, revealing interaction networks between the molecular levels. Integrated analysis of multi-omics data will provide useful insight into stroke pathogenesis, identification of therapeutic targets and biomarker discovery. In this Review, we detail current knowledge on the pathology of stroke and the current status of biomarker research in stroke. We summarize how proteomics, metabolomics, transcriptomics and genomics are all contributing to the identification of new candidate biomarkers that could be developed and used in clinical stroke management.",32322099,,10.1038/s41582-020-0350-6,106,Nature reviews.

Integration of Genomic and Transcriptomic Data to Elucidate Molecular Processes in Babesia divergens,"Emerging pathogens have developed ingenious life cycles to facilitate their growth and survival in the host organism. Detailed knowledge of the life cycle of these pathogens is increasingly necessary if we are to design new strategies to prevent infection and transmission. Multi-omics platforms provide useful data at different biological levels, and integration of these data into current approaches can facilitate holistic assessment of emerging pathogens. In this chapter, we bring together various methods and apply an integrative approach for analysis of genomic and transcriptomic data in Babesia divergens, an Apicomplexa emerging parasite that invades red blood cells and causes redwater fever in cattle and the most severe form of babesiosis in humans in Europe. The integrative methodology described herein can be helpful to identify genes active at specific points during life cycle of Apicomplexa parasites.",34313991,,10.1007/978-1-0716-1681-9_12,1,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,0.0
Integrative analysis of genome-wide association studies and gene expression analysis identifies pathways associated with rheumatoid arthritis,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a complex and systematic autoimmune disease, which is usually influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Pathway analyses based on a single data type such as microarray data or SNP data have successfully revealed some biology pathways associated with RA. However, we found that the pathway analysis based on a single data type only provide limited understanding about the pathogenesis of RA. Gene-disease association is usually caused by many ways, such as genotype, gene expression and so on. Therefore, the integrative analysis method combining multiple levels of evidence can more precisely and comprehensively identify the pathway associations. In this study, we performed a pathway analysis by integrating GWAS and gene expression analysis to detect the RA-related pathways. The integrative analysis identified 28 pathways associated with RA. Among these pathways, 18 pathways were also found by both GWAS and gene expression analysis, 7 pathways are novel RA-related pathways, such as B cell receptor signaling pathway, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, Fc gamma R-mediated phagocytosis and so on. Compared with pathway analyses using only one type genomic data, we found integrative analysis can increase the power to identify the real associations and provided more stable and accurate results. We believe these results will contribute to perform future genetic studies in RA pathogenesis and may promote the development of new therapeutic strategies by targeting these pathways.",26885899,PMC4890988,10.18632/oncotarget.7390,6,Oncotarget,101532965,0.0
Systems-level multi-omics characterization provides novel molecular insights into indomethacin toxicity,"The mechanism of indomethacin toxicity at the systemic level is largely unknown. In this study, multi-specimen molecular characterization was conducted in rats treated with three doses of indomethacin (2.5, 5, and 10 mg/kg) for 1 week. Kidney, liver, urine, and serum samples were collected and analyzed using untargeted metabolomics. The kidney and liver transcriptomics data (10 mg indomethacin/kg and control) were subjected to a comprehensive omics-based analysis. Indomethacin exposure at 2.5 and 5 mg/kg doses did not cause significant metabolome changes, whereas considerable alterations in the metabolic profile compared to the control were induced by a dose of 10 mg/kg. Decreased levels of metabolites and an increased creatine level in the urine metabolome indicated injury to the kidney. The integrated omics analysis in both liver and kidney revealed an oxidant-antioxidant imbalance due to an excess of reactive oxygen species, likely originating from dysfunctional mitochondria. Specifically, indomethacin exposure induced changes in metabolites related to the citrate cycle, cell membrane composition, and DNA synthesis in the kidney. The dysregulation of genes related to ferroptosis and suppression of amino acid and fatty acid metabolism were evidence of indomethacin-induced nephrotoxicity. In conclusion, a multi-specimen omics investigation provided important insights into the mechanism of indomethacin toxicity. The identification of targets that ameliorate indomethacin toxicity will enhance the therapeutic utility of this drug.",36868495,,10.1016/j.cbi.2023.110430,0,Chemico-biological interactions,227276,5.168
The Many Faces of Gene Regulation in Cancer: A Computational Oncogenomics Outlook,"Cancer is a complex disease at many different levels. The molecular phenomenology of cancer is also quite rich. The mutational and genomic origins of cancer and their downstream effects on processes such as the reprogramming of the gene regulatory control and the molecular pathways depending on such control have been recognized as central to the characterization of the disease. More important though is the understanding of their causes, prognosis, and therapeutics. There is a multitude of factors associated with anomalous control of gene expression in cancer. Many of these factors are now amenable to be studied comprehensively by means of experiments based on diverse omic technologies. However, characterizing each dimension of the phenomenon individually has proven to fall short in presenting a clear picture of expression regulation as a whole. In this review article, we discuss some of the more relevant factors affecting gene expression control both, under normal conditions and in tumor settings. We describe the different omic approaches that we can use as well as the computational genomic analysis needed to track down these factors. Then we present theoretical and computational frameworks developed to integrate the amount of diverse information provided by such single-omic analyses. We contextualize this within a systems biology-based multi-omic regulation setting, aimed at better understanding the complex interplay of gene expression deregulation in cancer.",31671657,PMC6896122,10.3390/genes10110865,15,Genes,101551097,4.141
Functional Annotation of Animal Genomes (FAANG): Current Achievements and Roadmap,"Functional annotation of genomes is a prerequisite for contemporary basic and applied genomic research, yet farmed animal genomics is deficient in such annotation. To address this, the FAANG (Functional Annotation of Animal Genomes) Consortium is producing genome-wide data sets on RNA expression, DNA methylation, and chromatin modification, as well as chromatin accessibility and interactions. In addition to informing our understanding of genome function, including comparative approaches to elucidate constrained sequence or epigenetic elements, these annotation maps will improve the precision and sensitivity of genomic selection for animal improvement. A scientific community-driven effort has already created a coordinated data collection and analysis enterprise crucial for the success of this global effort. Although it is early in this continuing process, functional data have already been produced and application to genetic improvement reported. The functional annotation delivered by the FAANG initiative will add value and utility to the greatly improved genome sequences being established for domesticated animal species.",30427726,,10.1146/annurev-animal-020518-114913,88,Annual review of animal biosciences,101614024,13.341
"STATegra, a comprehensive multi-omics dataset of B-cell differentiation in mouse","Multi-omics approaches use a diversity of high-throughput technologies to profile the different molecular layers of living cells. Ideally, the integration of this information should result in comprehensive systems models of cellular physiology and regulation. However, most multi-omics projects still include a limited number of molecular assays and there have been very few multi-omic studies that evaluate dynamic processes such as cellular growth, development and adaptation. Hence, we lack formal analysis methods and comprehensive multi-omics datasets that can be leveraged to develop true multi-layered models for dynamic cellular systems. Here we present the STATegra multi-omics dataset that combines measurements from up to 10 different omics technologies applied to the same biological system, namely the well-studied mouse pre-B-cell differentiation. STATegra includes high-throughput measurements of chromatin structure, gene expression, proteomics and metabolomics, and it is complemented with single-cell data.

Here, we present Matilda, a multi-task learning method for integrative analysis of multimodal single-cell omics data. By leveraging the interrelationship among tasks, Matilda learns to perform data simulation, dimension reduction, cell type classification, and feature selection in a single unified framework. We compare Matilda with other state-of-the-art methods on datasets generated from some of the most popular multimodal single-cell omics technologies.

"Exploring the underlying molecular mechanism of tri(1,3-dichloropropyl) phosphate-induced neurodevelopmental toxicity via thyroid hormone disruption in zebrafish by multi-omics analysis","Tri(1,3-dichloropropyl) phosphate (TDCPP) is widespread in the environment as a typical thyroid hormone-disrupting chemical. Here, we aimed to explore the toxicological mechanisms of the thyroid hormone-disrupting effects induced by TDCPP in zebrafish embryos/larvae using multi-omics analysis. The results showed that TDCPP (400 and 600 µg/L) induced phenotypic alteration and thyroid hormone imbalance in zebrafish larvae. It resulted in behavioral abnormalities during zebrafish embryonic development, suggesting that this chemical might exhibit neurodevelopmental toxicity. Transcriptomic and proteomic analysis provided consistent evidence at the gene and protein levels that neurodevelopmental disorders were significantly enhanced by TDCPP exposure (p < 0.05). Additionally, multi-omics data indicated that membrane thyroid hormone receptor (mTR)-mediated non-genomic pathways, including cell communication (ECM-receptor interactions, focal adhesion, etc.) and signal transduction pathways (MAPK signaling pathway, calcium signaling pathway, neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction pathway, etc.), were significantly disturbed (p < 0.05) and might contribute to the neurodevelopmental toxicity induced by TDCPP. Therefore, behavioral abnormalities and neurodevelopmental disorders might be important phenotypic characteristics of TDCPP-induced thyroid hormone disruption, and mTR-mediated non-genomic networks might participate in the disruptive effects of this chemical. This study provides new insights into the toxicological mechanisms of TDCPP-induced thyroid hormone disruption and proposes a theoretical basis for risk management of this chemical.",37003012,,10.1016/j.aquatox.2023.106510,0,"Aquatic toxicology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",8500246,5.202

Group Lasso Regularized Deep Learning for Cancer Prognosis from Multi-Omics and Clinical Features,"Accurate prognosis of patients with cancer is important for the stratification of patients, the optimization of treatment strategies, and the design of clinical trials. Both clinical features and molecular data can be used for this purpose, for instance, to predict the survival of patients censored at specific time points. Multi-omics data, including genome-wide gene expression, methylation, protein expression, copy number alteration, and somatic mutation data, are becoming increasingly common in cancer studies. To harness the rich information in multi-omics data, we developed GDP (Group lass regularized Deep learning for cancer Prognosis), a computational tool for survival prediction using both clinical and multi-omics data. GDP integrated a deep learning framework and Cox proportional hazard model (CPH) together, and applied group lasso regularization to incorporate gene-level group prior knowledge into the model training process. We evaluated its performance in both simulated and real data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project. In simulated data, our results supported the importance of group prior information in the regularization of the model. Compared to the standard lasso regularization, we showed that group lasso achieved higher prediction accuracy when the group prior knowledge was provided. We also found that GDP performed better than CPH for complex survival data. Furthermore, analysis on real data demonstrated that GDP performed favorably against other methods in several cancers with large-scale omics data sets, such as glioblastoma multiforme, kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, and bladder urothelial carcinoma. In summary, we demonstrated that GDP is a powerful tool for prognosis of patients with cancer, especially when large-scale molecular features are available.",30901858,PMC6471789,10.3390/genes10030240,30,Genes,101551097,4.141
Plant Genome DataBase Japan (PGDBj),"A portal website that integrates a variety of information related to genomes of model and crop plants from databases (DBs) and the literature was generated.

Short-term predictor for COVID-19 severity from a longitudinal multi-omics study for practical application in intensive care units,"Background:The COVID-19 pandemic challenged the management of technical and human resources in intensive care units (ICU) across the world. Several long-term predictors for COVID-19 disease progression have been discovered. However, predictors to support short-term planning of resources and medication that can be translated to future pandemics are still missing. A workflow was established to identify a predictor for short-term COVID-19 disease progression in the acute phase of intensive care patients to support clinical decision-making.Methods:Thirty-two patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were recruited on admission to the ICU and clinical data collected. During their hospitalization, plasma samples were acquired from each patient on multiple occasions, excepting one patient for which only one time point was possible, and the proteome (Inflammation, Immune Response and Organ Damage panels from Olink® Target 96), metabolome and lipidome (flow injection analysis and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry) analyzed for each sample. Patient visits were grouped according to changes in disease severity based on their respiratory and organ function, and evaluated using a combination of statistical analysis and machine learning. The resulting short-term predictor from this multi-omics approach was compared to the human assessment of disease progression. Furthermore, the potential markers were compared to the baseline levels of 50 healthy subjects with no known SARS-CoV-2 or other viral infections.Results:A total of 124 clinical parameters, 271 proteins and 782 unique metabolites and lipids were assessed. The dimensionality of the dataset was reduced, selecting 47 from the 1177 parameters available following down-selection, to build the machine learning model. Subsequently, two proteins (C-C motif chemokine 7 (CCL7) and carbonic anhydrase 14 (CA14)) and one lipid (hexosylceramide 18:2; O2/20:0) were linked to disease progression in the studied SARS-CoV-2 infections. Thus, a predictor delivering the prognosis of an upcoming worsening of the patient's condition up to five days in advance with a reasonable accuracy (79 % three days prior to event, 84 % four to five days prior to event) was found. Interestingly, the predictor's performance was complementary to the clinicians' capabilities to foresee a worsening of a patient.Conclusion:This study presents a workflow to identify omics-based biomarkers to support clinical decision-making and resource management in the ICU. This was successfully applied to develop a short-term predictor for aggravation of COVID-19 symptoms.

An integrated machine-learning model to predict prokaryotic essential genes,"Essential genes are indispensable for the target organism's survival. Large-scale identification and characterization of essential genes has shown to be beneficial in both fundamental biology and medicine fields. Current existing genome-scale experimental screenings of essential genes are time consuming and costly, also sometimes confer erroneous essential gene annotations. To circumvent these difficulties, many research groups turn to computational approaches as the alternative to identify essential genes. Here, we developed an integrative machine-learning based statistical framework to accurately predict essential genes in microorganisms. First we extracted a variety of relevant features derived from different aspects of an organism's genomic sequences. Then we selected a subset of features have high predictive power of gene essentiality through a carefully designed feature selection system. Using the selected features as input, we constructed an ensemble classifier and trained the model on a well-studied microorganism. After fine-tuning the model parameters in cross-validation, we tested the model on the other microorganism. We found that the tenfold cross-validation results within the same organism achieves a high predictive accuracy (AUC ~0.9), and cross-organism predictions between distant related organisms yield the AUC scores from 0.69 to 0.89, which significantly outperformed homology mapping.",25636617,,10.1007/978-1-4939-2398-4_9,6,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,0.0
Accurate and complete genomes from metagenomes,"Genomes are an integral component of the biological information about an organism; thus, the more complete the genome, the more informative it is. Historically, bacterial and archaeal genomes were reconstructed from pure (monoclonal) cultures, and the first reported sequences were manually curated to completion. However, the bottleneck imposed by the requirement for isolates precluded genomic insights for the vast majority of microbial life. Shotgun sequencing of microbial communities, referred to initially as community genomics and subsequently as genome-resolved metagenomics, can circumvent this limitation by obtaining metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs); but gaps, local assembly errors, chimeras, and contamination by fragments from other genomes limit the value of these genomes. Here, we discuss genome curation to improve and, in some cases, achieve complete (circularized, no gaps) MAGs (CMAGs). To date, few CMAGs have been generated, although notably some are from very complex systems such as soil and sediment. Through analysis of about 7000 published complete bacterial isolate genomes, we verify the value of cumulative GC skew in combination with other metrics to establish bacterial genome sequence accuracy. The analysis of cumulative GC skew identified potential misassemblies in some reference genomes of isolated bacteria and the repeat sequences that likely gave rise to them. We discuss methods that could be implemented in bioinformatic approaches for curation to ensure that metabolic and evolutionary analyses can be based on very high-quality genomes.",32188701,PMC7111523,10.1101/gr.258640.119,155,Genome research,9518021,9.438
Multi-omics facilitated variable selection in Cox-regression model for cancer prognosis prediction,"Motivation:New developments in high-throughput genomic technologies have enabled the measurement of diverse types of omics biomarkers in a cost-efficient and clinically-feasible manner. Developing computational methods and tools for analysis and translation of such genomic data into clinically-relevant information is an ongoing and active area of investigation. For example, several studies have utilized an unsupervised learning framework to cluster patients by integrating omics data. Despite such recent advances, predicting cancer prognosis using integrated omics biomarkers remains a challenge. There is also a shortage of computational tools for predicting cancer prognosis by using supervised learning methods. The current standard approach is to fit a Cox regression model by concatenating the different types of omics data in a linear manner, while penalty could be added for feature selection. A more powerful approach, however, would be to incorporate data by considering relationships among omics datatypes.Methods:Here we developed two methods: a SKI-Cox method and a wLASSO-Cox method to incorporate the association among different types of omics data. Both methods fit the Cox proportional hazards model and predict a risk score based on mRNA expression profiles. SKI-Cox borrows the information generated by these additional types of omics data to guide variable selection, while wLASSO-Cox incorporates this information as a penalty factor during model fitting.Results:We show that SKI-Cox and wLASSO-Cox models select more true variables than a LASSO-Cox model in simulation studies. We assess the performance of SKI-Cox and wLASSO-Cox using TCGA glioblastoma multiforme and lung adenocarcinoma data. In each case, mRNA expression, methylation, and copy number variation data are integrated to predict the overall survival time of cancer patients. Our methods achieve better performance in predicting patients' survival in glioblastoma and lung adenocarcinoma.",28627406,,10.1016/j.ymeth.2017.06.010,20,"Methods (San Diego, Calif.)",9426302,4.647

Multiomics profiling of the impact of an angiotensin (1-7)-expressing probiotic combined with exercise training in aged male rats,"Angiotensin (1-7) [Ang (1-7)] is an active heptapeptide of the noncanonical arm of the renin-angiotensin system that modulates molecular signaling pathways associated with vascular and cellular inflammation, vasoconstriction, and fibrosis. Preclinical evidence suggests that Ang (1-7) is a promising therapeutic target that may ameliorate physical and cognitive function in late life. However, treatment pharmacodynamics limits its clinical applicability. Therefore, this study explored the underlying mechanisms altered by a genetically modified probiotic (GMP) that expresses Ang (1-7) combined with and without exercise training in an aging male rat model as a potential adjunct strategy to exercise training to counteract the decline of physical and cognitive function. We evaluated cross-tissue (prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, colon, liver, and skeletal muscle) multi-omics responses. After 12 wk of intervention, the 16S mRNA microbiome analysis revealed a main effect of probiotic treatment within- and between groups. The probiotic treatment enhanced α diversity (Inverse Simpson (F[2,56] = 4.44;P= 0.02); Shannon-Wiener (F[2,56] = 4.27;P= 0.02)) and β-diversity (F[2,56] = 2.66;P= 0.01) among rats receiving our GMP. The analysis of microbes' composition revealed three genera altered by our GMP (Enterorhabdus,Muribaculaceae unclassified, andFaecalitalea). The mRNA multi-tissue data analysis showed that our combined intervention upregulated neuroremodeling pathways on prefrontal cortex (i.e., 140 genes), inflammation gene expression in the liver (i.e., 63 genes), and circadian rhythm signaling on skeletal muscle. Finally, the integrative network analysis detected different communities of tightly (|r| > 0.8 andP< 0.05) correlated metabolites,genera, and genes in these tissues.NEW & NOTEWORTHYThis manuscript uses a multiomics approach (i.e., microbiome, metabolomics, and transcriptomics) to explore the underlying mechanisms driven by a genetically modified probiotic (GMP) designed to express angiotensin (1-7) combined with moderate exercise training in an aged male rat model. After 12 wk of intervention, our findings suggest that our GMP enhanced gut microbial diversity while exercise training altered the transcriptional response in relevant neuroremodeling genes, inflammation, and circadian rhythm signaling pathways in an aging animal model.",36892893,PMC10125028,10.1152/japplphysiol.00508.2022,2,"Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. : 1985)",8502536,3.88
Integrative multi-omics analyses unravel the immunological implication and prognostic significance of CXCL12 in breast cancer,"Background:CXCL12 is a vital factor in physiological and pathological processes, by inducing migration of multiple cells. We aimed to comprehensively detect the role of CXCL12 in breast cancer, and explore novel CXCL12-related biomarkers through integrative multi-omics analyses to build a powerful prognostic model for breast cancer patients.Methods:Immunohistochemistry analysis of the tissue microarray was performed to evaluate the correlation between CXCL12 expression levels and breast cancer patient outcomes. Combined single-nucleus and spatial transcriptomics data was used to uncover the expression distribution of CXCL12 in breast cancer microenvironment. CXCL12-related genes were identified by WGCNA analysis. Univariate Cox and LASSO regression analyses were then conducted to screen prognostic genes from above CXCL12-related genes, followed by the construction of the CXCL12-related prognostic signature, identification of risk groups, and external validation of the prognostic signature. Analyses of biological function, mutation landscape, immune checkpoint genes and immune cells, were performed to further reveal the differences between high/low-risk groups. Paired single-cell RNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq were analyzed to further disclose the association between the risk score and the complex tumor immune microenvironment. To screen potential therapeutic agents for breast cancer patients, analyses of gene-drug correlation and sensitivity to immunotherapy were conducted.Results:High expression of CXCL12 was linked with a prolonged survival in breast cancer. A total of 402 genes were identified by WGCNA analysis and 11 genes, coveringVAT1L, TMEM92, SDC1, RORB, PCSK9, NRN1, NACAD, JPH3, GJA1, BMP8BandADAMTS2, were screened as the candidate prognostic genes. Next, the prognostic signature was built and validated using these genes to predict the outcomes of breast cancers. The high-risk group patients exhibited significantly inferior prognoses. The combination of the risk score and tumor mutational burden (TMB) had remarkably improved performance in predicting patient outcomes. Besides, high-risk group patients showed higher infiltration of M2-like macrophages. Finally, several potential anticancer drugs were identified. The high-risk group patients were more sensitive to immunotherapy but resistant to docetaxel.Conclusions:CXCL12 has important immunological implication and prognostic significance in breast cancer. The CXCL12-related prognostic model could well predict the prognosis and treatment response of breast cancers.",37564657,PMC10410148,10.3389/fimmu.2023.1188351,1,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,8.786
Population Genomics of Infectious and Integrated Wolbachia pipientis Genomes in Drosophila ananassae,"Coevolution between Drosophila and its endosymbiont Wolbachia pipientis has many intriguing aspects. For example, Drosophila ananassae hosts two forms of W. pipientis genomes: One being the infectious bacterial genome and the other integrated into the host nuclear genome. Here, we characterize the infectious and integrated genomes of W. pipientis infecting D. ananassae (wAna), by genome sequencing 15 strains of D. ananassae that have either the infectious or integrated wAna genomes. Results indicate evolutionarily stable maternal transmission for the infectious wAna genome suggesting a relatively long-term coevolution with its host. In contrast, the integrated wAna genome showed pseudogene-like characteristics accumulating many variants that are predicted to have deleterious effects if present in an infectious bacterial genome. Phylogenomic analysis of sequence variation together with genotyping by polymerase chain reaction of large structural variations indicated several wAna variants among the eight infectious wAna genomes. In contrast, only a single wAna variant was found among the seven integrated wAna genomes examined in lines from Africa, south Asia, and south Pacific islands suggesting that the integration occurred once from a single infectious wAna genome and then spread geographically. Further analysis revealed that for all D. ananassae we examined with the integrated wAna genomes, the majority of the integrated wAna genomic regions is represented in at least two copies suggesting a double integration or single integration followed by an integrated genome duplication. The possible evolutionary mechanism underlying the widespread geographical presence of the duplicate integration of the wAna genome is an intriguing question remaining to be answered.",26254486,PMC4558871,10.1093/gbe/evv158,16,Genome biology and evolution,101509707,4.065
Integrating Kinetic Model of E. coli with Genome Scale Metabolic Fluxes Overcomes Its Open System Problem and Reveals Bistability in Central Metabolism,"An understanding of the dynamics of the metabolic profile of a bacterial cell is sought from a dynamical systems analysis of kinetic models. This modelling formalism relies on a deterministic mathematical description of enzyme kinetics and their metabolite regulation. However, it is severely impeded by the lack of available kinetic information, limiting the size of the system that can be modelled. Furthermore, the subsystem of the metabolic network whose dynamics can be modelled is faced with three problems: how to parameterize the model with mostly incomplete steady state data, how to close what is now an inherently open system, and how to account for the impact on growth. In this study we address these challenges of kinetic modelling by capitalizing on multi-'omics' steady state data and a genome-scale metabolic network model. We use these to generate parameters that integrate knowledge embedded in the genome-scale metabolic network model, into the most comprehensive kinetic model of the central carbon metabolism of E. coli realized to date. As an application, we performed a dynamical systems analysis of the resulting enriched model. This revealed bistability of the central carbon metabolism and thus its potential to express two distinct metabolic states. Furthermore, since our model-informing technique ensures both stable states are constrained by the same thermodynamically feasible steady state growth rate, the ensuing bistability represents a temporal coexistence of the two states, and by extension, reveals the emergence of a phenotypically heterogeneous population.",26469081,PMC4607504,10.1371/journal.pone.0139507,10,PloS one,101285081,3.752
Advances and Applications in the Quest for Orthologs,"Gene families evolve by the processes of speciation (creating orthologs), gene duplication (paralogs), and horizontal gene transfer (xenologs), in addition to sequence divergence and gene loss. Orthologs in particular play an essential role in comparative genomics and phylogenomic analyses. With the continued sequencing of organisms across the tree of life, the data are available to reconstruct the unique evolutionary histories of tens of thousands of gene families. Accurate reconstruction of these histories, however, is a challenging computational problem, and the focus of the Quest for Orthologs Consortium. We review the recent advances and outstanding challenges in this field, as revealed at a symposium and meeting held at the University of Southern California in 2017. Key advances have been made both at the level of orthology algorithm development and with respect to coordination across the community of algorithm developers and orthology end-users. Applications spanned a broad range, including gene function prediction, phylostratigraphy, genome evolution, and phylogenomics. The meetings highlighted the increasing use of meta-analyses integrating results from multiple different algorithms, and discussed ongoing challenges in orthology inference as well as the next steps toward improvement and integration of orthology resources.",31241141,PMC6759064,10.1093/molbev/msz150,41,Molecular biology and evolution,8501455,8.8
Multiomics technologies: role in disease biomarker discoveries and therapeutics,"Medical research has been revolutionized after the publication of the full human genome. This was the major landmark that paved the way for understanding the biological functions of different macro and micro molecules. With the advent of different high-throughput technologies, biomedical research was further revolutionized. These technologies constitute genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, etc. Collectively, these high-throughputs are referred to as multi-omics technologies. In the biomedical field, these omics technologies act as efficient and effective tools for disease diagnosis, management, monitoring, treatment and discovery of certain novel disease biomarkers. Genotyping arrays and other transcriptomic studies have helped us to elucidate the gene expression patterns in different biological states, i.e. healthy and diseased states. Further omics technologies such as proteomics and metabolomics have an important role in predicting the role of different biological molecules in an organism. It is because of these high throughput omics technologies that we have been able to fully understand the role of different genes, proteins, metabolites and biological pathways in a diseased condition. To understand a complex biological process, it is important to apply an integrative approach that analyses the multi-omics data in order to highlight the possible interrelationships of the involved biomolecules and their functions. Furthermore, these omics technologies offer an important opportunity to understand the information that underlies disease. In the current review, we will discuss the importance of omics technologies as promising tools to understand the role of different biomolecules in diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative diseases and diabetes.",35809340,,10.1093/bfgp/elac017,5,Briefings in functional genomics,101528229,4.84
Robust pathway-based multi-omics data integration using directed random walks for survival prediction in multiple cancer studies,"Background:Integrating the rich information from multi-omics data has been a popular approach to survival prediction and bio-marker identification for several cancer studies. To facilitate the integrative analysis of multiple genomic profiles, several studies have suggested utilizing pathway information rather than using individual genomic profiles.Methods:We have recently proposed an integrative directed random walk-based method utilizing pathway information (iDRW) for more robust and effective genomic feature extraction. In this study, we applied iDRW to multiple genomic profiles for two different cancers, and designed a directed gene-gene graph which reflects the interaction between gene expression and copy number data. In the experiments, the performances of the iDRW method and four state-of-the-art pathway-based methods were compared using a survival prediction model which classifies samples into two survival groups.Results:The results show that the integrative analysis guided by pathway information not only improves prediction performance, but also provides better biological insights into the top pathways and genes prioritized by the model in both the neuroblastoma and the breast cancer datasets. The pathways and genes selected by the iDRW method were shown to be related to the corresponding cancers.Conclusions:In this study, we demonstrated the effectiveness of a directed random walk-based multi-omics data integration method applied to gene expression and copy number data for both breast cancer and neuroblastoma datasets. We revamped a directed gene-gene graph considering the impact of copy number variation on gene expression and redefined the weight initialization and gene-scoring method. The benchmark result for iDRW with four pathway-based methods demonstrated that the iDRW method improved survival prediction performance and jointly identified cancer-related pathways and genes for two different cancer datasets.Reviewers:This article was reviewed by Helena Molina-Abril and Marta Hidalgo.",31036036,PMC6489180,10.1186/s13062-019-0239-8,29,Biology direct,101258412,7.173
"MinOmics, an Integrative and Immersive Tool for Multi-Omics Analysis","Proteomic and transcriptomic technologies resulted in massive biological datasets, their interpretation requiring sophisticated computational strategies. Efficient and intuitive real-time analysis remains challenging. We use proteomic data on 1417 proteins of the green microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii to investigate physicochemical parameters governing selectivity of three cysteine-based redox post translational modifications (PTM): glutathionylation (SSG), nitrosylation (SNO) and disulphide bonds (SS) reduced by thioredoxins. We aim to understand underlying molecular mechanisms and structural determinants through integration of redox proteome data from gene- to structural level. Our interactive visual analytics approach on an 8.3 m2 display wall of 25 MPixel resolution features stereoscopic three dimensions (3D) representation performed by UnityMol WebGL. Virtual reality headsets complement the range of usage configurations for fully immersive tasks. Our experiments confirm that fast access to a rich cross-linked database is necessary for immersive analysis of structural data. We emphasize the possibility to display complex data structures and relationships in 3D, intrinsic to molecular structure visualization, but less common for omics-network analysis.

Comparative genomics analysis and genome assembly integration with the recombination landscape contribute to Takifugu bimaculatus assembly refinement,"Takifugu genus has been brought to the fore in scientific and practical research due to its compact genome, explosive speciation progress and economic value. Here we updated the chromosome-level genome of Takifugu bimaculatus by an ultra-high-density linkage map, a classic and accurate way of chromosome assembly. The map constituted a robust assembly frame, with 92.2% (372.77 Mb) of the draft genome cumulatively placed. With intraspecies and interspecies comparative genomic analysis, we developed a criterion to quantify the differences between assemblies and established a novel way to integrate information from multiple assemblies. The integrated assembly rectified potential mis-assemblies, greatly improving the genome contiguity and correctness.

Genome to Phenome: A Systems Biology Approach to PTSD Using an Animal Model,"Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating illness that imposes significant emotional and financial burdens on military families. The understanding of PTSD etiology remains elusive; nonetheless, it is clear that PTSD is manifested by a cluster of symptoms including hyperarousal, reexperiencing of traumatic events, and avoidance of trauma reminders. With these characteristics in mind, several rodent models have been developed eliciting PTSD-like features. Animal models with social dimensions are of particular interest, since the social context plays a major role in the development and manifestation of PTSD.For civilians, a core trauma that elicits PTSD might be characterized by a singular life-threatening event such as a car accident. In contrast, among war veterans, PTSD might be triggered by repeated threats and a cumulative psychological burden that coalesced in the combat zone. In capturing this fundamental difference, the aggressor-exposed social stress (Agg-E SS) model imposes highly threatening conspecific trauma on naïve mice repeatedly and randomly.There is abundant evidence that suggests the potential role of genetic contributions to risk factors for PTSD. Specific observations include putatively heritable attributes of the disorder, the cited cases of atypical brain morphology, and the observed neuroendocrine shifts away from normative. Taken together, these features underscore the importance of multi-omics investigations to develop a comprehensive picture. More daunting will be the task of downstream analysis with integration of these heterogeneous genotypic and phenotypic data types to deliver putative clinical biomarkers. Researchers are advocating for a systems biology approach, which has demonstrated an increasingly robust potential for integrating multidisciplinary data. By applying a systems biology approach here, we have connected the tissue-specific molecular perturbations to the behaviors displayed by mice subjected to Agg-E SS. A molecular pattern that links the atypical fear plasticity to energy deficiency was thereby identified to be causally associated with many behavioral shifts and transformations.PTSD is a multifactorial illness sensitive to environmental influence. Accordingly, it is essential to employ the optimal animal model approximating the environmental condition that elicits PTSD-like symptoms. Integration of an optimal animal model with a systems biology approach can contribute to a more knowledge-driven and efficient next-generation care management system and, potentially, prevention of PTSD.",28508360,,10.1007/978-1-4939-6952-4_6,7,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,0.0
Novel secretome-to-transcriptome integrated or secreto-transcriptomic approach to reveal liquid biopsy biomarkers for predicting individualized prognosis of breast cancer patients,"Background:Presently, a 50-gene expression model (PAM50) serves as a breast cancer (BC) subtype classifier that is insufficient to distinguish, within each single PAM50-classified subtype, patient subpopulations having different prognosis. There is a pressing need for inexpensive and minimally invasive biomarker tests to easily and accurately predict individuals' clinical outcomes and response to treatments. Although quantitative proteomic approaches have been developed to identify/profile proteins secreted (secretome) from various cancer cell lines in vitro, missing are the clinicopathological relevance and the associated prognostic value of these secretomic identifications.Methods:To discover biomarkers to predict individualized prognosis we introduce a new multi-omics (secreto-transcriptomics) method that identifies, in their oncogenically secreted states, candidate markers of BC subtypes whose genes bear patient-specific mRNA expression alterations of prognostic significance. First, we used label-free quantitative (LFQ) proteomics to identify the proteins showing BC-subtypic secretion from a series of BC cell lines representing major BC-subtypes. To determine and externally validate the prognostic value of these secreted proteins, we developed a secreto-transcriptomic approach that discovered a PAM50-subtypic Secretion-Correlated mRNA Expression Pattern (SeCEP) wherein the PAM50-subtypic secretion of select proteins statistically correlated with cis-mRNA expression of their encoding genes in patients of the corresponding PAM50-subtypes. Kaplan-Meier analysis of SeCEP genes was used to identify new liquid biopsy biomarkers for predicting individualized prognosis.Results:The mRNA expression-to-secretion correlation (SeCEP) pinpointed multiple genes that are fully translated into the oncogenically active secretome in a PAM50-subtypic manner. Further, multiple SeCEP genes in distinct combinations or panels of multiple SeCEP genes were identified as 'systems prognostic markers' that showed mRNA co-overexpression patterns in the distinct subpopulations of PAM50-subtypic patients with poor prognosis or high-risk of relapse. Thus, our secreto-transcriptomic approach statistically linked BC subtypic secretome genes with patient-specific information about their mRNA expression alterations and significantly improved the sensitivity and specificity in patient stratification in the context of clinical outcomes or prognosis.Conclusions:By combining LFQ secretome screening with proteo-transcriptomic retrospective analysis of patient data our integrated multi-omics approach bypasses costly, tedious, genome-wide fishing and predictive modeling that are commonly required to distinguish a few prognostically altered genes from thousands of other non-BC related genes in a genome.",31146747,PMC6543675,10.1186/s12920-019-0530-7,8,BMC medical genomics,101319628,3.622
Multi-Omics Data Integration and Mapping of Altered Kinases to Pathways Reveal Gonadotropin Hormone Signaling in Glioblastoma,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is one of the most lethal brain tumors with an inadequately understood pathophysiology. Biomarkers that guide accurate diagnosis and treatment decisions would greatly support precision medicine for GBM. Previous studies of GBM have focused on signaling pathways such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFRs), notch, wnt, and others, identified with single omics technology platforms (genomics, transcriptomics, or proteomics), but not with their integrated use. In this context, we report here a multi-omics pathway view, expanded through integration of the expression data at transcriptomic and proteomic levels, followed by selection of a functionally related group of proteins such as kinases deregulated in GBM. By using this strategy, we observed a highly significant enrichment of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) signaling pathway that was not deciphered with single omics datasets. The curation of the GnRH pathway with extensive literature analysis brought about a comprehensive annotation of the pathway, which included several additional pathway members that were not previously annotated. A targeted search resulted in identification of additional nonkinase members of the pathway in the GBM multi-omics datasets. We found evidence of GnRH receptor expression in GBM and other cancers. We offer here an updated generic pathway map of GnRH signaling, show its enrichment in the context of GBM, and discuss its plausible cross-connectivity with EGFR, wnt, calcium, and focal adhesion kinase signaling pathways that were earlier shown to be the top deregulated pathways in GBM. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the promise of multi-omics research and analyses to better understand complex cancers and suggests continued efforts and research in this direction in the field of integrative biology.",27930095,,10.1089/omi.2016.0142,8,Omics : a journal of integrative biology,101131135,3.978
Speeding genomic island discovery through systematic design of reference database composition,"Background:Genomic islands (GIs) are mobile genetic elements that integrate site-specifically into bacterial chromosomes, bearing genes that affect phenotypes such as pathogenicity and metabolism. GIs typically occur sporadically among related bacterial strains, enabling comparative genomic approaches to GI identification. For a candidate GI in a query genome, the number of reference genomes with a precise deletion of the GI serves as a support value for the GI. Our comparative software for GI identification was slowed by our original use of large reference genome databases (DBs). Here we explore smaller species-focused DBs.Results:With increasing DB size, recovery of our reliable prophage GI calls reached a plateau, while recovery of less reliable GI calls (FPs) increased rapidly as DB sizes exceeded ~500 genomes; i.e., overlarge DBs can increase FP rates. Paradoxically, relative to prophages, FPs were both more frequently supported only by genomes outside the species and more frequently supported only by genomes inside the species; this may be due to their generally lower support values. Setting a DB size limit for our SMAll Ranked Tailored (SMART) DB design speeded runtime ~65-fold. Strictly intra-species DBs would tend to lower yields of prophages for small species (with few genomes available); simulations with large species showed that this could be partially overcome by reaching outside the species to closely related taxa, without an FP burden. Employing such taxonomic outreach in DB design generated redundancy in the DB set; as few as 2984 DBs were needed to cover all 47894 prokaryotic species.Conclusions:Runtime decreased dramatically with SMART DB design, with only minor losses of prophages. We also describe potential utility in other comparative genomics projects.",38478526,PMC10936790,10.1371/journal.pone.0298641,0,PloS one,101285081,3.752
Methods to Improve Molecular Diagnosis in Genomic Cold Cases in Pediatric Neurology,"During the last decade, genetic testing has emerged as an important etiological diagnostic tool for Mendelian diseases, including pediatric neurological conditions. A genetic diagnosis has a considerable impact on disease management and treatment; however, many cases remain undiagnosed after applying standard diagnostic sequencing techniques. This review discusses various methods to improve the molecular diagnostic rates in these genomic cold cases. We discuss extended analysis methods to consider, non-Mendelian inheritance models, mosaicism, dual/multiple diagnoses, periodic re-analysis, artificial intelligence tools, and deep phenotyping, in addition to integrating various omics methods to improve variant prioritization. Last, novel genomic technologies, including long-read sequencing, artificial long-read sequencing, and optical genome mapping are discussed. In conclusion, a more comprehensive molecular analysis and a timely re-analysis of unsolved cases are imperative to improve diagnostic rates. In addition, our current understanding of the human genome is still limited due to restrictions in technologies. Novel technologies are now available that improve upon some of these limitations and can capture all human genomic variation more accurately. Last, we recommend a more routine implementation of high molecular weight DNA extraction methods that is coherent with the ability to use and/or optimally benefit from these novel genomic methods.",35205378,PMC8871714,10.3390/genes13020333,4,Genes,101551097,4.141
Oncogenic viruses: Lessons learned using next-generation sequencing technologies,"Fifteen percent of cancers are driven by oncogenic human viruses. Four of those viruses, hepatitis B virus, human papillomavirus, Merkel cell polyomavirus, and human T-cell lymphotropic virus, integrate the host genome. Viral oncogenesis is the result of epigenetic and genetic alterations that happen during viral integration. So far, little data have been available regarding integration mechanisms and modifications in the host genome. However, the emergence of high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatic tools enables researchers to establish the landscape of genomic alterations and predict the events that follow viral integration. Cooperative working groups are currently investigating these factors in large data sets. Herein, we provide novel insights into the initiating events of cancer onset during infection with integrative viruses. Although much remains to be discovered, many improvements are expected from the clinical point of view, from better prognosis classifications to better therapeutic strategies.",27156225,,10.1016/j.ejca.2016.03.086,2,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,10.002
Genomic sketching with multiplicities and locality-sensitive hashing using Dashing 2,"A genomic sketch is a small, probabilistic representation of the set of k-mers in a sequencing data set. Sketches are building blocks for large-scale analyses that consider similarities between many pairs of sequences or sequence collections. Although existing tools can easily compare tens of thousands of genomes, data sets can reach millions of sequences and beyond. Popular tools also fail to consider k-mer multiplicities, making them less applicable in quantitative settings. Here, we describe a method called Dashing 2 that builds on the SetSketch data structure. SetSketch is related to HyperLogLog (HLL) but discards use of leading zero count in favor of a truncated logarithm of adjustable base. Unlike HLL, SetSketch can perform multiplicity-aware sketching when combined with the ProbMinHash method. Dashing 2 integrates locality-sensitive hashing to scale all-pairs comparisons to millions of sequences.

The application of multi-omics and systems biology to identify therapeutic targets in chronic kidney disease,"The quest for the ideal therapeutic target in chronic kidney disease (CKD) has been riddled with many obstacles stemming from the molecular complexity of the disease and its co-morbidities. Recent advances in omics technologies and the resulting amount of available data encompassing genomics, proteomics, peptidomics, transcriptomics and metabolomics has created an opportunity for integrating omics datasets to build a comprehensive and dynamic model of the molecular changes in CKD for the purpose of biomarker and drug discovery. This article reviews relevant concepts in omics data integration using systems biology, a mathematical modelling method that globally describes a biological system on the basis of its modules and the functional connections that govern their behaviour. The review describes key databases and bioinformatics tools, as well as the challenges and limitations of the current state of the art, along with practical application to CKD therapeutic target discovery. Moreover, it describes how systems biology and visualization tools can be used to generate clinically relevant molecular models with the capability to identify specific disease pathways, recognize key events in disease development and track disease progression.",26487673,,10.1093/ndt/gfv364,45,"Nephrology, dialysis, transplantation : official publication of the European",8706402,7.186
Delta: a new web-based 3D genome visualization and analysis platform,"Summary:Delta is an integrative visualization and analysis platform to facilitate visually annotating and exploring the 3D physical architecture of genomes. Delta takes Hi-C or ChIA-PET contact matrix as input and predicts the topologically associating domains and chromatin loops in the genome. It then generates a physical 3D model which represents the plausible consensus 3D structure of the genome. Delta features a highly interactive visualization tool which enhances the integration of genome topology/physical structure with extensive genome annotation by juxtaposing the 3D model with diverse genomic assay outputs. Finally, by visually comparing the 3D model of the β-globin gene locus and its annotation, we speculated a plausible transitory interaction pattern in the locus. Experimental evidence was found to support this speculation by literature survey. This served as an example of intuitive hypothesis testing with the help of Delta.Availability and implementation:Delta is freely accessible from http://delta.big.ac.cn, and the source code is available at https://github.com/zhangzhwlab/delta.Contact:zhangzhihua@big.ac.cn.Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",29253110,,10.1093/bioinformatics/btx805,7,"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",9808944,6.931
Integration of Crop Growth Models and Genomic Prediction,"Crop growth models (CGMs) consist of multiple equations that represent physiological processes of plants and simulate crop growth dynamically given environmental inputs. Because parameters of CGMs are often genotype-specific, gene effects can be related to environmental inputs through CGMs. Thus, CGMs are attractive tools for predicting genotype by environment (G×E) interactions. This chapter reviews CGMs, genetic analyses using these models, and the status of studies that integrate genomic prediction with CGMs. Examples of CGM analyses are also provided.",35451783,,10.1007/978-1-0716-2205-6_13,0,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,0.0
"The Future of ""Omics"" in Hypertension","Despite decades of research and clinical practice, the pathogenesis of hypertension remains incompletely understood, and blood pressure is often suboptimally controlled. ""Omics"" technologies allow the description of a large number of molecular features and have the potential to identify new factors that contribute to blood pressure regulation and how they interact. In this review, we focus on the potential of genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics and explore their roles in unraveling the pathophysiology and diagnosis of hypertension, the prediction of organ damage and treatment response, and monitoring treatment effect. Substantial progress has been made in the area of genomics, in which genome-wide association studies have identified > 50 blood pressure-related, single-nucleotide polymorphisms, and sequencing studies (especially in secondary forms of hypertension) have discovered novel regulatory pathways. In contrast, other omics technologies, despite their ability to provide detailed insights into the physiological state of an organism, have only more recently demonstrated their impact on hypertension research and clinical practice. The majority of current proteomic studies focus on organ damage resulting from hypertension and may have the potential to help us understand the link between blood pressure and organ failure but also serve as biomarkers for early detection of cerebrovascular or coronary disease. Examples include signatures for early detection of left ventricular dysfunction or albuminuria. Metabolomic studies have the potential to integrate environmental and intrinsic factors and are particularly suited to monitor the response to treatment. We discuss examples of omics studies in hypertension and explore the challenges related to these novel technologies.",28161100,PMC5417769,10.1016/j.cjca.2016.11.023,11,The Canadian journal of cardiology,8510280,6.614
Modeling and integration of N-glycan biomarkers in a comprehensive biomarker data model,"Molecular biomarkers measure discrete components of biological processes that can contribute to disorders when impaired. Great interest exists in discovering early cancer biomarkers to improve outcomes. Biomarkers represented in a standardized data model, integrated with multi-omics data, may improve the understanding and use of novel biomarkers such as glycans and glycoconjugates. Among altered components in tumorigenesis, N-glycans exhibit substantial biomarker potential, when analyzed with their protein carriers. However, such data are distributed across publications and databases of diverse formats, which hamper their use in research and clinical application. Mass spectrometry measures of 50 N-glycans on 7 serum proteins in liver disease were integrated (as a panel) into a cancer biomarker data model, providing a unique identifier, standard nomenclature, links to glycan resources, and accession and ontology annotations to standard protein, gene, disease, and biomarker information. Data provenance was documented with a standardized United States Food and Drug Administration-supported BioCompute Object. Using the biomarker data model allows the capture of granular information, such as glycans with different levels of abundance in cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and transplant groups. Such representation in a standardized data model harmonizes glycomics data in a unified framework, making glycan-protein biomarker data exploration more available to investigators and to other data resources. The biomarker data model we describe can be used by researchers to describe their novel glycan and glycoconjugate biomarkers; it can integrate N-glycan biomarker data with multi-source biomedical data and can foster discovery and insight within a unified data framework for glycan biomarker representation, thereby making the data FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) (https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/).",35925813,PMC9487899,10.1093/glycob/cwac046,2,Glycobiology,9104124,5.954
Status of Immune Oncology: Challenges and Opportunities,"This volume is intended to review the methods used to identify biomarkers predictive of cancer responsiveness to immunotherapy. The successful development of clinically actionable biomarkers depends upon three features: (a) their biological role with respect to malignant transformation and tumor progression; (b) the ability to detect them with robust, reliable, and clinically applicable assays; and (c) their prognostic or predictive value, as validated in clinical trials.Identifying biomarkers that have predictive value for patient selection based on the likelihood of benefiting from anticancer immunotherapy is a lengthy and complex process. To date, few predictive biomarkers for anticancer immunotherapy have been robustly analytically and clinically validated (i.e., PD-L1 expression as measured by IHC assays and microsatellite instability (MSI)/dMMR as measured by PCR or IHC, respectively).This introductory chapter to this book focuses on scientific and technical aspects relevant to the identification and validation of predictive biomarkers for immunotherapy. We emphasize that methods should address both the biology of the tumor and the tumor microenvironment. Moreover, the identification of biomarkers requires highly sensitive, multiplexed, comprehensive techniques, especially for application in clinical care. Thus, in this chapter, we will define the outstanding questions related to the immune biology of cancer as a base for development of the biomarkers and assays using diverse methodologies. These biomarkers will likely be identified through research that integrates conventional immunological approaches along with high-throughput genomic and proteomic screening and the host immune response of individual patients that relates to individual tumor biology and immune drugs' mechanism of action.Checkpoint inhibitor therapy (CIT) is by now an accepted modality of cancer treatment. However, immune resistance is common, and most patients do not benefit from the treatment. The reasons for resistance are diverse, and approaches to circumvent it need to consider genetic, biologic, and environmental factors that affect anticancer immune response. Here, we propose to systematically address fundamental concepts based on the premise that malignant cells orchestrate their surroundings by interacting with innate and adaptive immune sensors. This principle applies to most cancers and governs their evolution in the immune-competent host. Understanding the basic requirement(s) for this evolutionary process will guide biomarker discovery and validation and ultimately guide to effective therapeutic choices. This volume will also discuss novel biomarker approaches aimed at informing an effective assay development from a mechanistic point of view, as well as the clinical implementation (i.e., patient enrichment) for immune therapies.",31502145,,10.1007/978-1-4939-9773-2_1,5,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,0.0
Multi-omics reveal mechanisms underlying chronic kidney disease of unknown etiology (CKDu) pathogenesis using zebrafish,"Chronic kidney disease of unknown etiology (CKDu) is an endemic disease in the dry zone of farming communities, Sri Lanka. The drinking water in a CKDu prevalent area contains a high concentration of F-, hardness and other environmental pollutants, including heavy metals and microcystin, which are considered possible etiology of CKDu in these areas. Here, multi-omics data with host transcriptome, metabolome and gut microbiomes were obtained using simulated local drinking water of Sri Lanka after their exposure to adult zebrafish. Based on an integrated multi-omics analysis in the context of host physiology in the kidney injury samples with different pathologic grades, two common pathways necroptosis and purine metabolism were identified as potentially important pathways that affect kidney injury. The key metabolite acetyl adenylate in the purine metabolism pathway was significantly positively correlated with Comamonas (rho = 0.72) and significantly negatively correlated with Plesiomonas (rho = -0.58). This crucial metabolite and two key gut bacteria genera may not only be potential markers but also potential therapeutic targets in the uric acid metabolic pathway, which is an important factor in the pathogenesis of acute kidney injury (AKI) in general, as well as of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Based on this, we revealed the urea metabolism pathway of kidney injury in zebrafish and provided a new avenue for the treatment of CKDu in Sri Lanka.",37683759,,10.1016/j.envpol.2023.122524,0,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",8804476,9.988
Aging Atlas: a multi-omics database for aging biology,"Organismal aging is driven by interconnected molecular changes encompassing internal and extracellular factors. Combinational analysis of high-throughput 'multi-omics' datasets (gathering information from genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and pharmacogenomics), at either populational or single-cell levels, can provide a multi-dimensional, integrated profile of the heterogeneous aging process with unprecedented throughput and detail. These new strategies allow for the exploration of the molecular profile and regulatory status of gene expression during aging, and in turn, facilitate the development of new aging interventions. With a continually growing volume of valuable aging-related data, it is necessary to establish an open and integrated database to support a wide spectrum of aging research. The Aging Atlas database aims to provide a wide range of life science researchers with valuable resources that allow access to a large-scale of gene expression and regulation datasets created by various high-throughput omics technologies. The current implementation includes five modules: transcriptomics (RNA-seq), single-cell transcriptomics (scRNA-seq), epigenomics (ChIP-seq), proteomics (protein-protein interaction), and pharmacogenomics (geroprotective compounds).

Multi-omics analysis revealed the regulation mode of intratumor microorganisms and microbial signatures in gastrointestinal cancer,"Objective:Gastrointestinal cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors in the world, and its incidence rate is always high. In recent years, research has shown that microorganisms may play a broad role in the diagnosis, pathogenesis, and treatment of cancer.Methods:In this study, samples were first classified according to the microbial expression data of Gastrointestinal cancer, followed by functional enrichment and Immunoassay. In order to better understand the role of intratumor microorganisms in the prognosis, we screened gene signatures and constructed risk model through univariate cox and lasso regression and multivariable cox, then screened microbial signatures using zero-inflated model regression model and constructed risk index (RI), and finally predicted the immunotherapeutic effect of the risk model.Results:The results indicate that the composition of tumor microorganisms in the C3 subtype is closely related to tumor angiogenesis, and there is a significant difference in the proportion of innate and acquired immune cells between the C2 and C1 subtypes, as well as differences in the physiological functions of immune cells. There are significant differences in the expression of microbial signatures between high and low risk subtypes, with 9 microbial signatures upregulated in high risk subtypes and 15 microbial signatures upregulated in low risk subtypes. These microbial signatures were significantly correlated with the prognosis of patients. The results of immunotherapy indicate that immunotherapy for high-risk subtypes is more effective.Conclusion:Overall, we analyze from the perspective of microorganisms within tumors, pointing out new directions for the diagnosis and treatment of cancer.",37944024,,10.1093/carcin/bgad078,0,Carcinogenesis,8008055,4.741
Congenital cataracts affect the retinal visual cycle and mitochondrial function: A multi-omics study of GJA8 knockout rabbits,"Congenital cataracts are a threat to visual development in children, and the visual impairment persists after surgical treatment; however, the mechanisms involved remain unclear. Previous clinical studies have identified the effect of congenital cataracts on retinal morphology and function. To further understand the molecular mechanisms by which congenital cataracts affect retinal development, we analyzed retina samples from 7-week-old GJA8-knockout rabbits with congenital cataracts and controls by four-dimensional label-free quantification proteomics and untargeted metabolomics. Bioinformatics analysis of proteomic data showed that retinol metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, and fatty acid degradation pathways were downregulated in the retinas of rabbits with congenital cataracts, indicating that their visual cycle and mitochondrial function were affected. Additional validation of differentially abundant proteins related to the visual cycle and mitochondrial function was performed using Parallel reaction monitoring and western blot experiments. Untargeted metabolome analysis showed significant upregulation of the antioxidant glutathione and ascorbic acid in the retinas of rabbits with congenital cataracts, indicating that their oxidative stress balance was not dysregulated. SIGNIFICANCE: Congenital cataracts in children can alter retinal structure and function, yet the mechanisms are uncertain. Here is the first study to use proteomics and metabolomics approaches to investigate the effects of congenital cataracts on retinal development in the early postnatal period. Our findings suggest that congenital cataracts have an impact on the retinal visual cycle and mitochondrial function. These findings give insight on the molecular pathways behind congenital cataract-induced visual function impairment in the early postnatal period.",37467890,,10.1016/j.jprot.2023.104972,0,Journal of proteomics,101475056,3.855
Implementing circulating tumor DNA analysis in a clinical laboratory: A user manual,"Liquid biopsy, the analysis of cell-free circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), is becoming one of the most promising tools in oncology. It has already shown its usefulness in selecting and modulating therapy via remote analysis of the tumor genome and holds important promises in cancer therapy and management, such as assessing the success of key therapeutic steps, monitoring residual disease, early detection of relapses, and establishing prognosis. Yet, ctDNA analysis is technically challenging and its implementation in the laboratory raises multiple strategic and practical issues. As for oncology clinics, integration of this novel test in well-established therapeutic protocols can also pose numerous questions. The current review is intended as a field guide for (1) diagnostic laboratories wishing to implement, validate and possibly accredit ctDNA testing and (2) clinical oncologists interested in integrating the various applications of liquid biopsies in their daily practice.

Multi-omics analysis elucidates the relationship between intratumor microbiome and host immune heterogeneity in breast cancer,"Research has indicated that intratumor microbiomes affect the occurrence, progression, and therapeutic response in many cancer types by influencing the immune system. We aim to evaluate the characteristics of immune-related intratumor microbiomes (IRIMs) in breast cancer (BC) and search for potential prognosis prediction factors and treatment targets. The clinical information, microbiome data, transcriptomics data of The Cancer Genome Atlas Breast Invasive Carcinoma (TCGA-BRCA) patients were obtained from Kraken-TCGA-Raw-Data and TCGA portal. The core tumor-infiltrating immune cell was identified using univariate Cox regression analysis. Based on consensus clustering analysis, BC patients were categorized into two immune subtypes, referred to as immune-enriched and immune-deficient subtypes. The immune-enriched subtype, characterized by higher levels of immune infiltration of CD8+ T and macrophage M1 cells, demonstrated a more favorable prognosis. Furthermore, significant differences in alpha-diversity and beta-diversity were observed between the two immune subtypes, and the least discriminant analysis effect size method identified 33 types of IRIMs. An intratumor microbiome-based prognostic signature consisting of four prognostic IRIMs (Acidibacillus,Succinimonas,Lachnoclostridium, andPseudogulbenkiania) was constructed using the Cox proportional-hazard model, and it had great prognostic value. The prognostic IRIMs were correlated with immune gene expression and the sensitivity of chemotherapy drugs, specifically tamoxifen and docetaxel. In conclusion, our research has successfully identified two distinct immune subtypes in BC, which exhibit contrasting prognoses and possess unique epigenetic and intratumor microbiomes. The critical IRIMs were correlated with prognosis, tumor-infiltrating immune cell abundance, and immunotherapeutic efficacy in BC. Consequently, this study has identified potential IRIMs as biomarkers, providing a novel therapeutic approach for treating BC.IMPORTANCERecent research has substantiated the presence of the intratumor microbiome in tumor immune microenvironment, which could influence tumor occurrence and progression, as well as provide new opportunities for cancer diagnosis and treatment. This study identified the critical immune-related intratumor microbiome (Acidibacillus,Succinimonas,Lachnoclostridium, andPseudogulbenkiania), which were correlated with prognosis, tumor-infiltrating immune cell abundance, and immunotherapeutic efficacy in breast cancer and might be the novel target to regulate immunotherapy in BC.",38442004,PMC10986513,10.1128/spectrum.04104-23,0,Microbiology spectrum,101634614,9.043
TCGAbiolinks: an R/Bioconductor package for integrative analysis of TCGA data,"The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) research network has made public a large collection of clinical and molecular phenotypes of more than 10 000 tumor patients across 33 different tumor types. Using this cohort, TCGA has published over 20 marker papers detailing the genomic and epigenomic alterations associated with these tumor types. Although many important discoveries have been made by TCGA's research network, opportunities still exist to implement novel methods, thereby elucidating new biological pathways and diagnostic markers. However, mining the TCGA data presents several bioinformatics challenges, such as data retrieval and integration with clinical data and other molecular data types (e.g. RNA and DNA methylation). We developed an R/Bioconductor package called TCGAbiolinks to address these challenges and offer bioinformatics solutions by using a guided workflow to allow users to query, download and perform integrative analyses of TCGA data. We combined methods from computer science and statistics into the pipeline and incorporated methodologies developed in previous TCGA marker studies and in our own group.

Multi-omics analyses based on genes associated with oxidative stress and phospholipid metabolism revealed the intrinsic molecular characteristics of pancreatic cancer,"Oxidative stress (OS), which impacts lipid metabolic reprogramming, can affect the biological activities of cancer cells. How oxidative stress and phospholipid metabolism (OSPM) influence the prognosis of pancreatic cancer (PC) needs to be elucidated. The metabolic data of 35 pancreatic tumor samples, 34 para-carcinoma samples, and 31 normal pancreatic tissues were obtained from the previously published literature. Pan-cancer samples were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). And the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC), ArrayExpress, and the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) databases were searched for more PC and normal pancreatic samples. The metabolites in PC were compared with normal and para-carcinoma tissues. The characteristics of the key OSPM genes were summarized in pan-cancer. The random survival forest analysis and multivariate Cox regression analysis were utilized to construct an OSPM-related signature. Based on this signature, PC samples were divided into high- and low-risk subgroups. The dysregulations of the tumor immune microenvironment were further investigated. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was conducted to investigate the expression of genes in the signature in PC and normal tissues. The protein levels of these genes were further demonstrated. In PC, metabolomic studies revealed the alteration of PM, while transcriptomic studies showed different expressions of OSPM-related genes. Then 930 PC samples were divided into three subtypes with different prognoses, and an OSPM-related signature including eight OSPM-related genes (i.e., SLC2A1, MMP14, TOP2A, MBOAT2, ANLN, ECT2, SLC22A3, and FGD6) was developed. High- and low-risk subgroups divided by the signature showed different prognoses, expression levels of immune checkpoint genes, immune cell infiltration, and tumor microenvironment. The risk score was negatively correlated with the proportion of TIL, pDC, Mast cell, and T cell co-stimulation. The expression levels of genes in the signature were verified in PC and normal samples. The protein levels of SLC2A1, MMP14, TOP2A, MBOAT2, ANLN, and SLC22A3 showed up-regulation in PC samples compared with normal tissues. After integrating metabolomics and transcriptomics data, the alterations in OSPM in PC were investigated, and an OSPM-related signature was developed, which was helpful for the prognostic assessment and individualized treatment for PC.",37604837,PMC10442332,10.1038/s41598-023-40560-4,0,Scientific reports,101563288,4.996
Multi-omics analyses reveal spatial heterogeneity in primary and metastatic oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma,"Background:Biopsies obtained from primary oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) guide diagnosis and treatment. However, spatial intra-tumoral heterogeneity (ITH) influences biopsy-derived information and patient responsiveness to therapy. Here, we aimed to elucidate the spatial ITH of ESCC and matched lymph node metastasis (LNmet).Methods:Primary tumour superficial (PTsup), deep (PTdeep) and LNmetsubregions of patients with locally advanced resectable ESCC were evaluated using whole-exome sequencing (WES), whole-transcriptome sequencing and spatially resolved digital spatial profiling (DSP). To validate the findings, immunohistochemistry was conducted and a single-cell transcriptomic dataset was analysed.Results:WES revealed 15.72%, 5.02% and 32.00% unique mutations in PTsup, PTdeepand LNmet, respectively. Copy number alterations and phylogenetic trees showed spatial ITH among subregions both within and among patients. Driver mutations had a mixed intra-tumoral clonal status among subregions. Transcriptome data showed distinct differentially expressed genes among subregions. LNmetexhibited elevated expression of immunomodulatory genes and enriched immune cells, particularly when compared with PTsup(all P < .05). DSP revealed orthogonal support of bulk transcriptome results, with differences in protein and immune cell abundance between subregions in a spatial context. The integrative analysis of multi-omics data revealed complex heterogeneity in mRNA/protein levels and immune cell abundance within each subregion.Conclusions:This study comprehensively characterised spatial ITH in ESCC, and the findings highlight the clinical significance of unbiased molecular classification based on multi-omics data and their potential to improve the understanding and management of ESCC. The current practices for tissue sampling are insufficient for guiding precision medicine for ESCC, and routine profiling of PTdeepand/or LNmetshould be systematically performed to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of ESCC and better inform treatment decisions.",38009315,PMC10679972,10.1002/ctm2.1493,0,Clinical and translational medicine,101597971,8.554
IRplus: An Augmented Tool to Detect Inverted Repeats in Plastid Genomes,"High-throughput sequencing methods have increased the accessibility of plastid genomes, which are crucial for clarifying phylogenetic relationships.

Zebrafish regulatory genomic resources for disease modelling and regeneration,"In the past decades, the zebrafish has become a disease model with increasing popularity owing to its advantages that include fast development, easy genetic manipulation, simplicity for imaging, and sharing conserved disease-associated genes and pathways with those of human. In parallel, studies of disease mechanisms are increasingly focusing on non-coding mutations, which require genome annotation maps of regulatory elements, such as enhancers and promoters. In line with this, genomic resources for zebrafish research are expanding, producing a variety of genomic data that help in defining regulatory elements and their conservation between zebrafish and humans. Here, we discuss recent developments in generating functional annotation maps for regulatory elements of the zebrafish genome and how this can be applied to human diseases. We highlight community-driven developments, such as DANIO-CODE, in generating a centralised and standardised catalogue of zebrafish genomics data and functional annotations; consider the advantages and limitations of current annotation maps; and offer considerations for interpreting and integrating existing maps with comparative genomics tools. We also discuss the need for developing standardised genomics protocols and bioinformatic pipelines and provide suggestions for the development of analysis and visualisation tools that will integrate various multiomic bulk sequencing data together with fast-expanding data on single-cell methods, such as single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing. Such integration tools are essential to exploit the multiomic chromatin characterisation offered by bulk genomics together with the cell-type resolution offered by emerging single-cell methods. Together, these advances will build an expansive toolkit for interrogating the mechanisms of human disease in zebrafish.",37529920,PMC10417509,10.1242/dmm.050280,1,Disease models & mechanisms,101483332,5.732
An integrated multiomics analysis of rectal cancer patients identified POU2F3 as a putative druggable target and entinostat as a cytotoxic enhancer of 5-fluorouracil,"Rectal cancer (RC) accounts for one-third of colorectal cancers (CRC), and 40% of these are locally advanced rectal cancers (LARC). The use of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) significantly reduces the rate of local recurrence compared to adjuvant therapy or surgery alone. However, after nCRT, up to 40%-60% of patients show a poor pathological response, while only about 20% achieve a pathological complete response. In this scenario, the identification of novel predictors of tumor response to nCRT is urgently needed to reduce LARC mortality and to spare poorly responding patients from unnecessary treatments. Therefore, by combining gene and microRNA expression datasets with proteomic data from LARC patients, we developed an integrated network centered on seven hub-genes putatively involved in the response to nCRT. In an independent validation cohort of LARC patients, we confirmed that differential expression of NFKB1, TRAF6 and STAT3 is correlated with the response to nCRT. In addition, the functional enrichment analysis also revealed that these genes are strongly related to hallmarks of cancer and inflammation, whose dysfunction may causatively affect LARC patient's response to nCRT. Furthermore, by constructing the transcription factor-module network, we hypothesized a protective role of POU2F3 gene, which could be used as a new drug target in LARC patients.

ViR: a tool to solve intrasample variability in the prediction of viral integration sites using whole genome sequencing data,"Background:Several bioinformatics pipelines have been developed to detect sequences from viruses that integrate into the human genome because of the health relevance of these integrations, such as in the persistence of viral infection and/or in generating genotoxic effects, often progressing into cancer. Recent genomics and metagenomics analyses have shown that viruses also integrate into the genome of non-model organisms (i.e., arthropods, fish, plants, vertebrates). However, rarely studies of endogenous viral elements (EVEs) in non-model organisms have gone beyond their characterization from reference genome assemblies. In non-model organisms, we lack a thorough understanding of the widespread occurrence of EVEs and their biological relevance, apart from sporadic cases which nevertheless point to significant roles of EVEs in immunity and regulation of expression. The concomitance of repetitive DNA, duplications and/or assembly fragmentations in a genome sequence and intrasample variability in whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data could determine misalignments when mapping data to a genome assembly. This phenomenon hinders our ability to properly identify integration sites.Results:To fill this gap, we developed ViR, a pipeline which solves the dispersion of reads due to intrasample variability in sequencing data from both single and pooled DNA samples thus ameliorating the detection of integration sites. We tested ViR to work with both in silico and real sequencing data from a non-model organism, the arboviral vector Aedes albopictus. Potential viral integrations predicted by ViR were molecularly validated supporting the accuracy of ViR results.Conclusion:ViR will open new venues to explore the biology of EVEs, especially in non-model organisms. Importantly, while we generated ViR with the identification of EVEs in mind, its application can be extended to detect any lateral transfer event providing an ad-hoc sequence to interrogate.",33541262,PMC7863434,10.1186/s12859-021-03980-5,5,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,3.307
Comprehensive dissection of dispensable genomic regions in Streptomyces based on comparative analysis approach,"Background:Large-scale genome reduction has been performed to significantly improve the performance of microbial chassis. Identification of the essential or dispensable genes is pivotal for genome reduction to avoid synthetic lethality. Here, taking Streptomyces as an example, we developed a combinatorial strategy for systematic identification of large and dispensable genomic regions in Streptomyces based on multi-omics approaches.Results:Phylogenetic tree analysis revealed that the model strains including S. coelicolor A3(2), S. albus J1074 and S. avermitilis MA-4680 were preferred reference for comparative analysis of candidate genomes. Multiple genome alignment suggested that the Streptomyces genomes embodied highly conserved core region and variable sub-telomeric regions, and may present symmetric or asymmetric structure. Pan-genome and functional genome analyses showed that most conserved genes responsible for the fundamental functions of cell viability were concentrated in the core region and the vast majority of abundant genes were dispersed in the sub-telomeric regions. These results suggested that large-scale deletion can be performed in sub-telomeric regions to greatly streamline the Streptomyces genomes for developing versatile chassis.Conclusions:The integrative approach of comparative genomics, functional genomics and pan-genomics can not only be applied to perform a multi-tiered dissection for Streptomyces genomes, but also work as a universal method for systematic analysis of removable regions in other microbial hosts in order to generate more miscellaneous and versatile chassis with minimized genome for drug discovery.",32375781,PMC7204314,10.1186/s12934-020-01359-4,9,Microbial cell factories,101139812,6.352
MetaPGN: a pipeline for construction and graphical visualization of annotated pangenome networks,"Pangenome analyses facilitate the interpretation of genetic diversity and evolutionary history of a taxon. However, there is an urgent and unmet need to develop new tools for advanced pangenome construction and visualization, especially for metagenomic data. Here, we present an integrated pipeline, named MetaPGN, for construction and graphical visualization of pangenome networks from either microbial genomes or metagenomes. Given either isolated genomes or metagenomic assemblies coupled with a reference genome of the targeted taxon, MetaPGN generates a pangenome in a topological network, consisting of genes (nodes) and gene-gene genomic adjacencies (edges) of which biological information can be easily updated and retrieved. MetaPGN also includes a self-developed Cytoscape plugin for layout of and interaction with the resulting pangenome network, providing an intuitive and interactive interface for full exploration of genetic diversity. We demonstrate the utility of MetaPGN by constructing Escherichia coli pangenome networks from five E. coli pathogenic strains and 760 human gut microbiomes,revealing extensive genetic diversity of E. coli within both isolates and gut microbial populations. With the ability to extract and visualize gene contents and gene-gene physical adjacencies of a specific taxon from large-scale metagenomic data, MetaPGN provides advantages in expanding pangenome analysis to uncultured microbial taxa.",30277499,PMC6251982,10.1093/gigascience/giy121,6,GigaScience,101596872,7.658

Integrated multi-omics analyses reveal the biochemical mechanisms and phylogenetic relevance of anaerobic androgen biodegradation in the environment,"Steroid hormones, such as androgens, are common surface-water contaminants. However, literature on the ecophysiological relevance of steroid-degrading organisms in the environment, particularly in anoxic ecosystems, is extremely limited. We previously reported that Steroidobacter denitrificans anaerobically degrades androgens through the 2,3-seco pathway. In this study, the genome of Sdo. denitrificans was completely sequenced. Transcriptomic data revealed gene clusters that were distinctly expressed during anaerobic growth on testosterone. We isolated and characterized the bifunctional 1-testosterone hydratase/dehydrogenase, which is essential for anaerobic degradation of steroid A-ring. Because of apparent substrate preference of this molybdoenzyme, corresponding genes, along with the signature metabolites of the 2,3-seco pathway, were used as biomarkers to investigate androgen biodegradation in the largest sewage treatment plant in Taipei, Taiwan. Androgen metabolite analysis indicated that denitrifying bacteria in anoxic sewage use the 2,3-seco pathway to degrade androgens. Metagenomic analysis and PCR-based functional assays showed androgen degradation in anoxic sewage by Thauera spp. through the action of 1-testosterone hydratase/dehydrogenase. Our integrative 'omics' approach can be used for culture-independent investigations of the microbial degradation of structurally complex compounds where isotope-labeled substrates are not easily available.",26872041,PMC5029156,10.1038/ismej.2015.255,19,The ISME journal,101301086,11.217

We summarize the commonly used software and pipelines for read mapping, isoform reconstruction, isoform quantification, and differential expression analysis. We also discuss methods for analyzing long reads and the strategies to combine long and short reads in identifying splicing isoforms. We review several tools for characterizing local splicing events, splicing graphs, coding potential, and visualizing splicing isoforms. We further discuss the procedures for identifying conserved splicing isoforms across plant species.

The Application of Bayesian Methods in Cancer Prognosis and Prediction,"With the development of high-throughput biological techniques, high-dimensional omics data have emerged. These molecular data provide a solid foundation for precision medicine and prognostic prediction of cancer. Bayesian methods contribute to constructing prognostic models with complex relationships in omics and improving performance by introducing different prior distribution, which is suitable for modelling the high-dimensional data involved. Using different omics, several Bayesian hierarchical approaches have been proposed for variable selection and model construction. In particular, the Bayesian methods of multi-omics integration have also been consistently proposed in recent years. Compared with single-omics, multi-omics integration modelling will contribute to improving predictive performance, gaining insights into the underlying mechanisms of tumour occurrence and development, and the discovery of more reliable biomarkers. In this work, we present a review of current proposed Bayesian approaches in prognostic prediction modelling in cancer.",34949654,PMC8717957,10.21873/cgp.20298,7,Cancer genomics & proteomics,101188791,3.395
Molecular genomic landscapes of hepatobiliary cancer,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and biliary tract cancer are more frequent in East Asia including Japan than in Europe or North America. A compilation of 1340 multi-ethnic HCC genomes, the largest cohort ever reported, identified a comprehensive landscape of HCC driver genes, comprised of three core drivers (TP53, TERT, and WNT signaling) and combinations of infrequent alterations in various cancer pathways. In contrast, five core driver genes (TP53, ARID1A, KRAS, SMAD4, and BAP1) with characteristic molecular alterations including fusion transcripts involving fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 and the protein kinase A pathway, and IDH1/2 mutation constituted the biliary tract cancer genomes. Consistent with their heterogeneous epidemiological backgrounds, mutational signatures and combinations of non-core driver genes within these cancer genomes were found to be complex. Integrative analyses of multi-omics data identified molecular classifications of these tumors that are associated with clinical outcome and enrichments of potential therapeutic targets, including immune checkpoint molecules. Translating comprehensive molecular-genomic analysis together with further basic research and international collaborations are highly anticipated for developing precise and better treatments, diagnosis, and prevention of these tumor types.",29573058,PMC5980207,10.1111/cas.13582,19,Cancer science,101168776,6.518
The Landscape of L1 Retrotransposons in the Human Genome Is Shaped by Pre-insertion Sequence Biases and Post-insertion Selection,"L1 retrotransposons are transposable elements and major contributors of genetic variation in humans. Where L1 integrates into the genome can directly impact human evolution and disease. Here, we experimentally induced L1 retrotransposition in cells and mapped integration sites at nucleotide resolution. At local scales, L1 integration is mostly restricted by genome sequence biases and the specificity of the L1 machinery. At regional scales, L1 shows a broad capacity for integration into all chromatin states, in contrast to other known mobile genetic elements. However, integration is influenced by the replication timing of target regions, suggesting a link to host DNA replication. The distribution of new L1 integrations differs from those of preexisting L1 copies, which are significantly reshaped by natural selection. Our findings reveal that the L1 machinery has evolved to efficiently target all genomic regions and underline a predominant role for post-integrative processes on the distribution of endogenous L1 elements.",30956044,,10.1016/j.molcel.2019.02.036,77,Molecular cell,9802571,19.328

ioSearch: An approach for identifying interacting multiomics biomarkers using a novel algorithm with application on breast cancer data sets,"Identification of biomarkers by integrating multiple omics together is important because complex diseases occur due to an intricate interplay of various genetic materials. Traditional single-omics association tests neither explore this crucial interomics dependence nor identify moderately weak signals due to the multiple-testing burden. Conversely, multiomics data integration imparts complementary information but suffers from an increased multiple-testing burden, data diversity inherent with different omics features, high-dimensionality, and so forth. Most of the available methods address subtype classification using dimension-reduction techniques to circumvent the sample size issue but interacting multiomics biomarker identification methods are unavailable. We propose a two-step model that first investigates phenotype-omics association using logistic regression. Then, selects disease-associated omics using sparse principal components which explores the interrelationship of multiple variables from two omics in a multivariate multiple regression framework. On the basis of this model, we developed a multiomics biomarker identification algorithm, interacting omics search (ioSearch), that jointly tests the effect of multiple omics with disease and between-omics associations by using pathway information that subsequently reduces the multiple-testing burden. Further, inference in terms of p values potentially makes it an easily interpretable biomarker identification tool. Extensive simulation demonstrates ioSearch as statistically powerful with a controlled Type-I error rate. Its application to publicly available breast cancer data sets identified relevant omics features in important pathways.",37795815,,10.1002/gepi.22536,0,Genetic epidemiology,8411723,2.344
Comprehensive multi-omics analysis reveals the core role of glycerophospholipid metabolism in rheumatoid arthritis development,"Objectives:Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease with complex causes and recurrent attacks that can easily develop into chronic arthritis and eventually lead to joint deformity. Our study aims to elucidate potential mechanism among control, new-onset RA (NORA) and chronic RA (CRA) with multi-omics analysis.Methods:A total of 113 RA patients and 75 controls were included in our study. Plasma and stool samples were obtained for 16S rRNA sequencing, internally transcribed spacer (ITS) sequencing and metabolomics analysis. And PBMCs were obtained for RNA sequencing. We used three models, logistic regression, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and random forest, respectively, to distinguish NORA from CRA, and finally we validated model performance using an external cohort of 26 subjects.Results:Our results demonstrated intestinal flora disturbance in RA development, with significantly increased abundance of Escherichia-Shigella and Proteobacteria in NORA. We also found that the diversity was significantly reduced in CRA compared to NORA through fungi analysis. Moreover, we identified 29 differential metabolites between NORA and CRA. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed significant dysregulation of glycerophospholipid metabolism and phenylalanine metabolism pathways in RA patients. Next, we identified 40 differentially expressed genes between NORA and CRA, which acetylcholinesterase (ACHE) was the core gene and significantly enriched in glycerophospholipid metabolism pathway. Correlation analysis showed a strong negatively correlation between glycerophosphocholine and inflammatory characteristics. Additionally, we applied three approaches to develop disease classifier models that were based on plasma metabolites and gut microbiota, which effectively distinguished between new-onset and chronic RA patients in both discovery cohort and external validation cohort.Conclusions:These findings revealed that glycerophospholipid metabolism plays a crucial role in the development and progression of RA, providing new ideas for early clinical diagnosis and optimizing treatment strategies.",38102690,PMC10722724,10.1186/s13075-023-03208-2,0,Arthritis research & therapy,101154438,5.606
Interpreting and integrating genomic tests results in clinical cancer care: Overview and practical guidance,"The last decade has seen rapid progress in the use of genomic tests, including gene panels, whole-exome sequencing, and whole-genome sequencing, in research and clinical cancer care. These advances have created expansive opportunities to characterize the molecular attributes of cancer, revealing a subset of cancer-associated aberrations called driver mutations. The identification of these driver mutations can unearth vulnerabilities of cancer cells to targeted therapeutics, which has led to the development and approval of novel diagnostics and personalized interventions in various malignancies. The applications of this modern approach, often referred to as precision oncology or precision cancer medicine, are already becoming a staple in cancer care and will expand exponentially over the coming years. Although genomic tests can lead to better outcomes by informing cancer risk, prognosis, and therapeutic selection, they remain underutilized in routine cancer care. A contributing factor is a lack of understanding of their clinical utility and the difficulty of results interpretation by the broad oncology community. Practical guidelines on how to interpret and integrate genomic information in the clinical setting, addressed to clinicians without expertise in cancer genomics, are currently limited. Building upon the genomic foundations of cancer and the concept of precision oncology, the authors have developed practical guidance to aid the interpretation of genomic test results that help inform clinical decision making for patients with cancer. They also discuss the challenges that prevent the wider implementation of precision oncology.",38174605,,10.3322/caac.21825,1,CA: a cancer journal for clinicians,370647,286.13

Integrative Analysis of Incongruous Cancer Genomics and Proteomics Datasets,"Cancer is a complex disease characterized by molecular heterogeneity and the involvement of several cellular mechanisms throughout its evolution and pathogenesis. Despite the great efforts made to untangle these mechanisms, cancer pathophysiology remains far from clear. So far, panels of biomarkers have been reported from high-throughput data generated through different platforms. These biomarkers are primarily focused on one type of coding molecules such as transcripts or proteins, mainly due to the apparent heterogeneity of output data resulting from the use of various techniques specific to the molecular type. Hence, there is a major need to understand how these molecules interact and complement each other to be able to explain the deregulated processes involved. The breadth of large-scale data availability as well as the lack of in-depth analysis of publicly available data has raised concerns and enabled opportunities for new strategies to analyze ""Big data"" more comprehensively. Here, a new protocol to perform integrative analysis based on a systems biology approach is described. The foundation of the approach relies on groups of datasets from published studies compared within the original described groups and organized in a designated format to allow the integration and cross-comparison among different studies and different platforms. This approach follows an unbiased hypothesis-free methodology that will facilitate the identification of commonalities among different data-set sources, and ultimately map and characterize specific molecular pathways using significantly deregulated molecules. This in turn will generate novel insights about the mechanisms deregulated in complex diseases such as cancer.",34236668,,10.1007/978-1-0716-1641-3_17,1,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,0.0
Multi-omics network analysis reveals distinct stages in the human aging progression in epidermal tissue,"In recent years, reports of non-linear regulations in age- and longevity-associated biological processes have been accumulating. Inspired by methodological advances in precision medicine involving the integrative analysis of multi-omics data, we sought to investigate the potential of multi-omics integration to identify distinct stages in the aging progression fromex vivohuman skin tissue. For this we generated transcriptome and methylome profiling data from suction blister lesions of female subjects between 21 and 76 years, which were integrated using a network fusion approach. Unsupervised cluster analysis on the combined network identified four distinct subgroupings exhibiting a significant age-association. As indicated by DNAm age analysis and Hallmark of Aging enrichment signals, the stages captured the biological aging state more clearly than a mere grouping by chronological age and could further be recovered in a longitudinal validation cohort with high stability. Characterization of the biological processes driving the phases using machine learning enabled a data-driven reconstruction of the order of Hallmark of Aging manifestation. Finally, we investigated non-linearities in the mid-life aging progression captured by the aging phases and identified a far-reaching non-linear increase in transcriptional noise in the pathway landscape in the transition from mid- to late-life.",32554863,PMC7343460,10.18632/aging.103499,14,Aging,101508617,5.955
A Network Pharmacology and Multi-Omics Combination Approach to Reveal the Effect of Strontium on Ca2+Metabolism in Bovine Rumen Epithelial Cells,"Strontium (Sr) belongs to the same group in the periodic table as calcium (Ca). Sr level can serve as an index of rumen Ca absorption capacity; however, the effects of Sr on Ca2+metabolism are unclear. This study aims to investigate the effect of Sr on Ca2+metabolism in bovine rumen epithelial cells. The bovine rumen epithelial cells were isolated from the rumen of newborn Holstein male calves (n= 3, 1 day old, 38.0 ± 2.8 kg, fasting). The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of Sr-treated bovine rumen epithelial cells and cell cycle were used to establish the Sr treatment model. Transcriptomics, proteomics, and network pharmacology were conducted to investigate the core targets of Sr-mediated regulation of Ca2+metabolism in bovine rumen epithelial cells. The data of transcriptomics and proteomics were analyzed using bioinformatic analysis (Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of genes/protein). Quantitative data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA in GraphPad Prism 8.4.3 and the Shapiro-Wilk test was used for the normality test. Results presented that the IC50 of Sr treatment bovine rumen epithelial cells for 24 h was 43.21 mmol/L, and Sr increased intracellular Ca2+levels. Multi-omics results demonstrated the differential expression of 770 mRNAs and 2436 proteins after Sr treatment; network pharmacology and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) revealed Adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase-like protein 2(AHCYL2), Semaphoring 3A(SEMA3A), Parathyroid hormone-related protein(PTHLH), Transforming growth factor β2(TGF-β2), and Cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme(CYP11A1)as potential targets for Sr-mediated Ca2+metabolism regulation. Together these results will improve the current comprehension of the regulatory effect of Sr on Ca2+metabolism and pave a theoretical basis for Sr application in bovine hypocalcemia.",37298335,PMC10253303,10.3390/ijms24119383,2,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,6.208
Multi-omics analyses identify molecular signatures with prognostic values in different heart failure aetiologies,"Background:Heart failure (HF) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and there is an urgent need for more global studies and data mining approaches to uncover its underlying mechanisms. Multiple omics techniques provide a more holistic molecular perspective to study pathophysiological events involved in the development of HF.Methods:In this study, we used a label-free whole myocardium multi-omics characterization from three commonly used mouse HF models: transverse aortic constriction (TAC), myocardial infarction (MI), and homozygous Phospholamban-R14del (PLN-R14Δ/Δ). Genes, proteins, and metabolites were analysed for differential expression between each group and a corresponding control group. The core transcriptome and proteome datasets were used for enrichment analysis. For genes that were upregulated at both the RNA and protein levels in all models, clinical validation was performed by means of plasma level determination in patients with HF from the BIOSTAT-CHF cohort.Results:Cell death and tissue repair-related pathways were upregulated in all preclinical models. Fatty acid oxidation, ATP metabolism, and Energy derivation processes were downregulated in all investigated HF aetiologies. Putrescine, a metabolite known for its role in cell survival and apoptosis, demonstrated a 4.9-fold (p < 0.02) increase in PLN-R14Δ/Δ, 2.7-fold (p < 0.005) increase in TAC mice, and 2.2-fold (p < 0.02) increase in MI mice.

Common pathways and biomarkers with potential clinical and prognostic associations merit further investigation to develop optimal management and therapeutic strategies for all HF aetiologies.",36493852,,10.1016/j.yjmcc.2022.12.001,6,Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology,262322,5.763
Joint learning sample similarity and correlation representation for cancer survival prediction,"Background:As a highly aggressive disease, cancer has been becoming the leading death cause around the world. Accurate prediction of the survival expectancy for cancer patients is significant, which can help clinicians make appropriate therapeutic schemes. With the high-throughput sequencing technology becoming more and more cost-effective, integrating multi-type genome-wide data has been a promising method in cancer survival prediction. Based on these genomic data, some data-integration methods for cancer survival prediction have been proposed. However, existing methods fail to simultaneously utilize feature information and structure information of multi-type genome-wide data.Results:We propose a Multi-type Data Joint Learning (MDJL) approach based on multi-type genome-wide data, which comprehensively exploits feature information and structure information. Specifically, MDJL exploits correlation representations between any two data types by cross-correlation calculation for learning discriminant features. Moreover, based on the learned multiple correlation representations, MDJL constructs sample similarity matrices for capturing global and local structures across different data types.

Cell death is an essential process in normal tissue that consists of 3 classical pathways: apoptosis, necrosis and autophagy.Objectives:To perform a comprehensive analysis of the impact of cell death on liver cancer.Material and methods:The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database and the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets were used to analyze the relationships between mutations in cell death-related genes and clinical variables of HCC. Then, we applied the DESeq2 package to identify aberrantly expressed genes in HCC and their related biological functions through a Pearson correlation analysis. Finally, a cell death-related signature of HCC was constructed using the single-factor Cox regression.Results:We identified the genes involved in apoptosis, necrosis and autophagy, of which TP53 and SPTA1 had the highest frequency of mutations. The results revealed that cell death-related tumor mutational burden (TMB) was significant for the pathologic stage and had a strong relationship with the prognosis. Moreover, 53 cell death-related genes that are differentially expressed in HCC were screened, and 3 of them were correlated with HCC prognosis. Harvey rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (HRAS) affected the infiltration of immune cells and was closely correlated with ferroptosis. Peptidylprolyl isomerase A (PPIA) played a significant role in mitochondrial pathways. At last, we constructed a cell death-related signature of HCC using 10 prognosis-related genes and a nomogram based on 3 variables (expression, group and stage).Conclusions:This study provided a comprehensive analysis of cell death-related genes in HCC based on multi-omics data, identified the contribution of each variable to clinical outcome and predicted the survival probability of HCC patients more directly.",36753369,,10.17219/acem/152737,0,Advances in clinical and experimental medicine : official organ Wroclaw Medical,101138582,1.736
Synthesizing Systems Biology Knowledge from Omics Using Genome-Scale Models,"Omic technologies have enabled the complete readout of the molecular state of a cell at different biological scales. In principle, the combination of multiple omic data types can provide an integrated view of the entire biological system. This integration requires appropriate models in a systems biology approach. Here, genome-scale models (GEMs) are focused upon as one computational systems biology approach for interpreting and integrating multi-omic data. GEMs convert the reactions (related to metabolism, transcription, and translation) that occur in an organism to a mathematical formulation that can be modeled using optimization principles. A variety of genome-scale modeling methods used to interpret multiple omic data types, including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and meta-omics are reviewed. The ability to interpret omics in the context of biological systems has yielded important findings for human health, environmental biotechnology, bioenergy, and metabolic engineering. The authors find that concurrent with advancements in omic technologies, genome-scale modeling methods are also expanding to enable better interpretation of omic data. Therefore, continued synthesis of valuable knowledge, through the integration of omic data with GEMs, are expected.",32579720,PMC7501203,10.1002/pmic.201900282,8,Proteomics,101092707,5.393
The next steps in next-gen sequencing of cancer genomes,"The necessary infrastructure to carry out genomics-driven oncology is now widely available and has resulted in the exponential increase in characterized cancer genomes. While a subset of genomic alterations is clinically actionable, the majority of somatic events remain classified as variants of unknown significance and will require functional characterization. A careful cataloging of the genomic alterations and their response to therapeutic intervention should allow the compilation of an ""actionability atlas"" and the creation of a genomic taxonomy stratified by tumor type and oncogenic pathway activation. The next phase of genomic medicine will therefore require talented bioinformaticians, genomic navigators, and multidisciplinary approaches to decode complex cancer genomes and guide potential therapy. Equally important will be the ethical and interpretable return of results to practicing oncologists. Finally, the integration of genomics into clinical trials is likely to speed the development of predictive biomarkers of response to targeted therapy as well as define pathways to acquired resistance.",25642706,PMC4319423,10.1172/JCI68339,20,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,19.456
SINE_scan: an efficient tool to discover short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs) in large-scale genomic datasets,"Motivation:Short Interspersed Nuclear Elements (SINEs) are transposable elements (TEs) that amplify through a copy-and-paste mode via RNA intermediates. The computational identification of new SINEs are challenging because of their weak structural signals and rapid diversification in sequences.Results:Here we report SINE_Scan, a highly efficient program to predict SINE elements in genomic DNA sequences. SINE_Scan integrates hallmark of SINE transposition, copy number and structural signals to identify a SINE element. SINE_Scan outperforms the previously published de novo SINE discovery program. It shows high sensitivity and specificity in 19 plant and animal genome assemblies, of which sizes vary from 120 Mb to 3.5 Gb. It identifies numerous new families and substantially increases the estimation of the abundance of SINEs in these genomes.Availability and implementation:The code of SINE_Scan is freely available at http://github.com/maohlzj/SINE_Scan , implemented in PERL and supported on Linux.Contact:wangh8@fudan.edu.cn.Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",28062442,PMC5408816,10.1093/bioinformatics/btw718,24,"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",9808944,6.931
InCliniGene enables high-throughput and comprehensive in vivo clonal tracking toward clinical genomics data integration,"High-throughput clonal tracking in patients under hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy with integrating vector is instrumental in assessing bio-safety and efficacy. Monitoring the fate of millions of transplanted clones and their progeny across differentiation and proliferation over time leverages the identification of the vector integration sites, used as surrogates of clonal identity. Although γ-tracking retroviral insertion sites (γ-TRIS) is the state-of-the-art algorithm for clonal identification, the computational drawbacks in the tracking algorithm, based on a combinatorial all-versus-all strategy, limit its use in clinical studies with several thousands of samples per patient. We developed the first clonal tracking graph database, InCliniGene (https://github.com/calabrialab/InCliniGene), that imports the output files of γ-TRIS and generates the graph of clones (nodes) connected by arches if two nodes share common genomic features as defined by the γ-TRIS rules. Embedding both clonal data and their connections in the graph, InCliniGene can track all clones longitudinally over samples through data queries that fully explore the graph. This approach resulted in being highly accurate and scalable. We validated InCliniGene using an in vitro dataset, specifically designed to mimic clinical cases, and tested the accuracy and precision. InCliniGene allows extensive use of γ-TRIS in large gene therapy clinical applications and naturally realizes the full data integration of molecular and genomics data, clinical and treatment measurements and genomic annotations. Further extensions of InCliniGene with data federation and with application programming interface will support data mining toward precision, personalized and predictive medicine in gene therapy.

iGDP: An integrated genome decontamination pipeline for wild ciliated microeukaryotes,"Ciliates are a large group of ubiquitous and highly diverse single-celled eukaryotes that play an essential role in the functioning of microbial food webs. However, their genomic diversity is far from clear due to the need to develop cultivation methods for most species, so most research is based on wild organisms that almost invariably contain contaminants. Here we establish an integrated Genome Decontamination Pipeline (iGDP) that combines homology search, telomere reads-assisted and clustering approaches to filter contaminated ciliate genome assemblies from wild specimens. We benchmarked the performance of iGDP using genomic data from a contaminated ciliate culture and the results showed that iGDP could recall 91.9% of the target sequences with 96.9% precision. We also used a synthetic dataset to offer guidelines for the application of iGDP in the removal of various groups of contaminants. Compared with several popular metagenome binning tools, iGDP could show better performance. To further validate the effectiveness of iGDP on real-world data, we applied it to decontaminate genome assemblies of three wild ciliate specimens and obtained their genomes with high quality comparable to that of previously well-studied model ciliate genomes. It is anticipated that the newly generated genomes and the established iGDP method will be valuable community resources for detailed studies on ciliate biodiversity, phylogeny, ecology and evolution. The pipeline (https://github.com/GWang2022/iGDP) can be implemented automatically to reduce manual filtering and classification and may be further developed to apply to other microeukaryotes.",36912756,,10.1111/1755-0998.13782,2,Molecular ecology resources,101465604,8.678
Human Microbiome and Learning Healthcare Systems: Integrating Research and Precision Medicine for Inflammatory Bowel Disease,"Healthcare institutions face widespread challenges of delivering high-quality and cost-effective care, while keeping up with rapid advances in biomedical knowledge and technologies. Moreover, there is increased emphasis on developing personalized or precision medicine targeted to individuals or groups of patients who share a certain biomarker signature. Learning healthcare systems (LHS) have been proposed for integration of research and clinical practice to fill major knowledge gaps, improve care, reduce healthcare costs, and provide precision care. To date, much discussion in this context has focused on the potential of human genomic data, and not yet on human microbiome data. Rapid advances in human microbiome research suggest that profiling of, and interventions on, the human microbiome can provide substantial opportunity for improved diagnosis, therapeutics, risk management, and risk stratification. In this study, we discuss a potential role for microbiome science in LHSs. We first review the key elements of LHSs, and discuss possibilities of Big Data and patient engagement. We then consider potentials and challenges of integrating human microbiome research into clinical practice as part of an LHS. With rapid growth in human microbiome research, patient-specific microbial data will begin to contribute in important ways to precision medicine. Hence, we discuss how patient-specific microbial data can help guide therapeutic decisions and identify novel effective approaches for precision care of inflammatory bowel disease. To the best of our knowledge, this expert analysis makes an original contribution with new insights poised at the emerging intersection of LHSs, microbiome science, and postgenomics medicine.",28282257,PMC5810428,10.1089/omi.2016.0185,14,Omics : a journal of integrative biology,101131135,3.978
Multi-omics analysis identifies osteosarcoma subtypes with distinct prognosis indicating stratified treatment,"Osteosarcoma (OS) is a primary malignant bone tumor that most commonly affects children, adolescents, and young adults. Here, we comprehensively analyze genomic, epigenomic and transcriptomic data from 121 OS patients. Somatic mutations are diverse within the cohort, and only TP53 is significantly mutated. Through unsupervised integrative clustering of the multi-omics data, we classify OS into four subtypes with distinct molecular features and clinical prognosis: (1) Immune activated (S-IA), (2) Immune suppressed (S-IS), (3) Homologous recombination deficiency dominant (S-HRD), and (4) MYC driven (S-MD). MYC amplification with HR proficiency tumors is identified with a high oxidative phosphorylation signature resulting in resistance to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Potential therapeutic targets are identified for each subtype, including platinum-based chemotherapy, immune checkpoint inhibitors, anti-VEGFR, anti-MYC and PARPi-based synthetic lethal strategies. Our comprehensive integrated characterization provides a valuable resource that deepens our understanding of the disease, and may guide future clinical strategies for the precision treatment of OS.",36418292,PMC9684515,10.1038/s41467-022-34689-5,19,Nature communications,101528555,17.694
Single-cell multiomics: technologies and data analysis methods,"Advances in single-cell isolation and barcoding technologies offer unprecedented opportunities to profile DNA, mRNA, and proteins at a single-cell resolution. Recently, bulk multiomics analyses, such as multidimensional genomic and proteogenomic analyses, have proven beneficial for obtaining a comprehensive understanding of cellular events. This benefit has facilitated the development of single-cell multiomics analysis, which enables cell type-specific gene regulation to be examined. The cardinal features of single-cell multiomics analysis include (1) technologies for single-cell isolation, barcoding, and sequencing to measure multiple types of molecules from individual cells and (2) the integrative analysis of molecules to characterize cell types and their functions regarding pathophysiological processes based on molecular signatures. Here, we summarize the technologies for single-cell multiomics analyses (mRNA-genome, mRNA-DNA methylation, mRNA-chromatin accessibility, and mRNA-protein) as well as the methods for the integrative analysis of single-cell multiomics data.",32929225,PMC8080692,10.1038/s12276-020-0420-2,173,Experimental & molecular medicine,9607880,12.153
Combining quantitative trait locus mapping with multiomics profiling reveals genetic control of corn leaf aphid (Rhopalosiphum maidis) resistance in maize,"The corn leaf aphid (Rhopalosiphum maidis) is a major maize pest that frequently causes substantial yield losses. Exploring the genetic basis of resistance to aphids is important for improving maize yield and quality. Here, we used a maize recombinant inbred line population derived from two parents with different susceptibility to aphids, B73 (susceptible) and Abe2 (resistant), and performed quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping using aphid resistance scores as an indicator. We mapped a stable QTL, qRTA6, to chromosome 6 using data from 2 years of field trials, which explained 40.12-55.17% of the phenotypic variation. To further investigate the mechanism of aphid resistance in Abe2, we constructed transcriptome and metabolome libraries from Abe2 and B73 leaves with or without aphid infestation at different time points. Integrating QTL mapping and transcriptome data revealed three aphid resistance candidate genes (Zm00001d035736, Zm00001d035751, and Zm00001d035767) associated with the hypersensitive response, the jasmonic acid pathway, and protein ubiquitination. Integrated transcriptomic and metabolomic analysis revealed that the differentially expressed genes and metabolites were enriched in flavonoid biosynthesis. These findings extend our understanding of the molecular mechanisms controlling aphid resistance in maize, and the QTL and candidate genes are valuable resources for increasing this resistance.",36964900,,10.1093/jxb/erad113,1,Journal of experimental botany,9882906,7.298
What genomic data can reveal about eco-evolutionary dynamics,"Recognition that evolution operates on the same timescale as ecological processes has motivated growing interest in eco-evolutionary dynamics. Nonetheless, generating sufficient data to test predictions about eco-evolutionary dynamics has proved challenging, particularly in natural contexts. Here we argue that genomic data can be integrated into the study of eco-evolutionary dynamics in ways that deepen our understanding of the interplay between ecology and evolution. Specifically, we outline five major questions in the study of eco-evolutionary dynamics for which genomic data may provide answers. Although genomic data alone will not be sufficient to resolve these challenges, integrating genomic data can provide a more mechanistic understanding of the causes of phenotypic change, help elucidate the mechanisms driving eco-evolutionary dynamics, and lead to more accurate evolutionary predictions of eco-evolutionary dynamics in nature.",29158555,,10.1038/s41559-017-0385-2,24,Nature ecology & evolution,101698577,19.1
LINE Retrotransposition Assays in Saccharomyces cerevisiae,"Long interspersed nuclear element (LINE) retrotransposons make up significant parts of mammalian genomes. They alter host genomes by direct mutagenesis through integration of new transposon copies, by mobilizing non-autonomous transposons, by changes in host gene activity due to newly integrated transposons and by recombination events between different transposon copies. As a consequence, LINEs can contribute to genetic disease. Simple model systems can be useful for the study of basic molecular and cellular biology of LINE retrotransposons. Here, we describe methods for the analysis of LINE retrotransposition in the well-established model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The ability to follow retrotransposition in budding yeast opens up the possibility of performing systematic screens for evolutionarily conserved interactions between LINE retrotransposons and their host cells.",26895051,,10.1007/978-1-4939-3372-3_9,1,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,0.0
Genomics and epigenetics guided identification of tissue-specific genomic safe harbors,"Background:Genomic safe harbors are regions of the genome that can maintain transgene expression without disrupting the function of host cells. Genomic safe harbors play an increasingly important role in improving the efficiency and safety of genome engineering. However, limited safe harbors have been identified.Results:Here, we develop a framework to facilitate searches for genomic safe harbors by integrating information from polymorphic mobile element insertions that naturally occur in human populations, epigenomic signatures, and 3D chromatin organization. By applying our framework to polymorphic mobile element insertions identified in the 1000 Genomes project and the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project, we identify 19 candidate safe harbors in blood cells and 5 in brain cells. For three candidate sites in blood, we demonstrate the stable expression of transgene without disrupting nearby genes in host erythroid cells. We also develop a computer program, Genomics and Epigenetic Guided Safe Harbor mapper (GEG-SH mapper), for knowledge-based tissue-specific genomic safe harbor selection.Conclusions:Our study provides a new knowledge-based framework to identify tissue-specific genomic safe harbors. In combination with the fast-growing genome engineering technologies, our approach has the potential to improve the overall safety and efficiency of gene and cell-based therapy in the near future.",36131352,PMC9490961,10.1186/s13059-022-02770-3,3,Genome biology,100960660,17.906
A multi-modal data harmonisation approach for discovery of COVID-19 drug targets,"Despite the volume of experiments performed and data available, the complex biology of coronavirus SARS-COV-2 is not yet fully understood. Existing molecular profiling studies have focused on analysing functional omics data of a single type, which captures changes in a small subset of the molecular perturbations caused by the virus. As the logical next step, results from multiple such omics analysis may be aggregated to comprehensively interpret the molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2. An alternative approach is to integrate data simultaneously in a parallel fashion to highlight the inter-relationships of disease-driving biomolecules, in contrast to comparing processed information from each omics level separately. We demonstrate that valuable information may be masked by using the former fragmented views in analysis, and biomarkers resulting from such an approach cannot provide a systematic understanding of the disease aetiology. Hence, we present a generic, reproducible and flexible open-access data harmonisation framework that can be scaled out to future multi-omics analysis to study a phenotype in a holistic manner. The pipeline source code, detailed documentation and automated version as a R package are accessible. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our pipeline, we applied it to a drug screening task. We integrated multi-omics data to find the lowest level of statistical associations between data features in two case studies. Strongly correlated features within each of these two datasets were used for drug-target analysis, resulting in a list of 84 drug-target candidates. Further computational docking and toxicity analyses revealed seven high-confidence targets, amsacrine, bosutinib, ceritinib, crizotinib, nintedanib and sunitinib as potential starting points for drug therapy and development.",34036326,PMC8194516,10.1093/bib/bbab185,4,Briefings in bioinformatics,100912837,13.994
A Translational Pipeline for Overall Survival Prediction of Breast Cancer Patients by Decision-Level Integration of Multi-Omics Data,"Breast cancer is the most prevalent and among the most deadly cancers in females. Patients with breast cancer have highly variable survival rates, indicating a need to identify prognostic biomarkers. By integrating multi-omics data (e.g., gene expression, DNA methylation, miRNA expression, and copy number variations (CNVs)), it is likely to improve the accuracy of patient survival predictions compared to prediction using single modality data. Therefore, we propose to develop a machine learning pipeline using decision-level integration of multi-omics tumor data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to predict the overall survival of breast cancer patients. With multi-omics data consisting of gene expression, methylation, miRNA expression, and CNVs, the top performing model predicted survival with an accuracy of 85% and area under the curve (AUC) of 87%. Furthermore, the model was able to identify which modalities best contributed to prediction performance, identifying methylation, miRNA, and gene expression as the best integrated classification combination. Our method not only recapitulated several breast cancer-specific prognostic biomarkers that were previously reported in the literature but also yielded several novel biomarkers. Further analysis of these biomarkers could lend insight into the molecular mechanisms that lead to poor survival.",32601549,PMC7324293,10.1109/bibm47256.2019.8983243,5,Proceedings.

"De Novo, Divergence, and Mixed Origin Contribute to the Emergence of Orphan Genes inPristionchusNematodes","Homology is a fundamental concept in comparative biology. It is extensively used at the sequence level to make phylogenetic hypotheses and functional inferences. Nonetheless, the majority of eukaryotic genomes contain large numbers of orphan genes lacking homologs in other taxa. Generally, the fraction of orphan genes is higher in genomically undersampled clades, and in the absence of closely related genomes any hypothesis about their origin and evolution remains untestable. Previously, we sequenced ten genomes with an underlying ladder-like phylogeny to establish a phylogenomic framework for studying genome evolution in diplogastrid nematodes. Here, we use this deeply sampled data set to understand the processes that generate orphan genes in our focal speciesPristionchus pacificusBased on phylostratigraphic analysis and additional bioinformatic filters, we obtained 29 high-confidence candidate genes for which mechanisms of orphan origin were proposed based on manual inspection. This revealed diverse mechanisms including annotation artifacts, chimeric origin, alternative reading frame usage, and gene splitting with subsequent gain ofde novoexons. In addition, we present two cases of completede novoorigination from non-coding regions, which represents one of the first reports ofde novogenes in nematodes. Thus, we conclude thatde novoemergence, divergence, and mixed mechanisms contribute to novel gene formation inPristionchusnematodes.",31088903,PMC6643871,10.1534/g3.119.400326,17,"G3 (Bethesda, Md.)",101566598,3.542
Accurately annotate compound effects of genetic variants using a context-sensitive framework,"In genomics, effectively identifying the biological effects of genetic variants is crucial. Current methods handle each variant independently, assuming that each variant acts in a context-free manner. However, variants within the same gene may interfere with each other, producing combinational (compound) rather than individual effects. In this work, we introduce COPE, a gene-centric variant annotation tool that integrates the entire sequential context in evaluating the functional effects of intra-genic variants. Applying COPE to the 1000 Genomes dataset, we identified numerous cases of multiple-variant compound effects that frequently led to false-positive and false-negative loss-of-function calls by conventional variant-centric tools. Specifically, 64 disease-causing mutations were identified to be rescued in a specific genomic context, thus potentially contributing to the buffering effects for highly penetrant deleterious mutations.

GI-Cluster: Detecting genomic islands via consensus clustering on multiple features,"The accurate detection of genomic islands (GIs) in microbial genomes is important for both evolutionary study and medical research, because GIs may promote genome evolution and contain genes involved in pathogenesis. Various computational methods have been developed to predict GIs over the years. However, most of them cannot make full use of GI-associated features to achieve desirable performance. Additionally, many methods cannot be directly applied to newly sequenced genomes. We develop a new method called GI-Cluster, which provides an effective way to integrate multiple GI-related features via consensus clustering. GI-Cluster does not require training datasets or existing genome annotations, but it can still achieve comparable or better performance than supervised learning methods in comprehensive evaluations. Moreover, GI-Cluster is widely applicable, either to complete and incomplete genomes or to initial GI predictions from other programs. GI-Cluster also provides plots to visualize the distribution of predicted GIs and related features.

"Accurate cancer phenotype prediction with AKLIMATE, a stacked kernel learner integrating multimodal genomic data and pathway knowledge","Advancements in sequencing have led to the proliferation of multi-omic profiles of human cells under different conditions and perturbations. In addition, many databases have amassed information about pathways and gene ""signatures""-patterns of gene expression associated with specific cellular and phenotypic contexts. An important current challenge in systems biology is to leverage such knowledge about gene coordination to maximize the predictive power and generalization of models applied to high-throughput datasets. However, few such integrative approaches exist that also provide interpretable results quantifying the importance of individual genes and pathways to model accuracy. We introduce AKLIMATE, a first kernel-based stacked learner that seamlessly incorporates multi-omics feature data with prior information in the form of pathways for either regression or classification tasks. AKLIMATE uses a novel multiple-kernel learning framework where individual kernels capture the prediction propensities recorded in random forests, each built from a specific pathway gene set that integrates all omics data for its member genes. AKLIMATE has comparable or improved performance relative to state-of-the-art methods on diverse phenotype learning tasks, including predicting microsatellite instability in endometrial and colorectal cancer, survival in breast cancer, and cell line response to gene knockdowns. We show how AKLIMATE is able to connect feature data across data platforms through their common pathways to identify examples of several known and novel contributors of cancer and synthetic lethality.",33861732,PMC8081343,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008878,5,PLoS computational biology,101238922,4.779
Endometriosis research in the -omics era,"Endometriosis is a pathological condition extensively studied, but its pathogenesis is not completely understood, since its pathophysiology stems from a broad spectrum of environmental influences and genetic factors. Moreover, the nature of this condition is heterogeneous and includes different anatomical entities. Scientists actively pursue discovery of novel biomarkers in the hope of better identifying susceptible individuals in early stages of the disease. High-throughput technologies have substantially revolutionized medical research and, as a first step, the advent of genotyping arrays led to large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and enabled the assessment of global transcript levels, thus giving rise to integrative genetics. In this framework, comprehensive studies have been conducted at multiple biological levels by using the ""omics"" platforms, thus allowing to re-examine endometriosis at a greater degree of molecular resolution. -Omics technologies can detect and analyze hundreds of markers in the same experiment and their increasing use in the field of gynecology comes from an urgent need to find new diagnostic and therapeutic tools that improve the diagnosis of endometriosis and the efficacy of assisted reproductive techniques. Proteomics and metabolomics have been introduced recently into the every day methodology of researchers collaborating with gynecologists and, importantly, multi-omics approach is advantageous to gain insight of the total information that underlies endometriosis, compared to studies of any single -omics type. In this review, we expect to present multiple studies based on the high-throughput-omics technologies and to shed light in all considerable advantages that they may confer to a proper management of endometriosis.",32165309,,10.1016/j.gene.2020.144545,15,Gene,7706761,3.913
Integrating genomic resources to present full gene and putative promoter capture probe sets for bread wheat,"Background:Whole-genome shotgun resequencing of wheat is expensive because of its large, repetitive genome. Moreover, sequence data can fail to map uniquely to the reference genome, making it difficult to unambiguously assign variation. Resequencing using target capture enables sequencing of large numbers of individuals at high coverage to reliably identify variants associated with important agronomic traits. Previous studies have implemented complementary DNA/exon or gene-based probe sets in which the promoter and intron sequence is largely missing alongside newly characterized genes from the recent improved reference sequences.Results:We present and validate 2 gold standard capture probe sets for hexaploid bread wheat, a gene and a putative promoter capture, which are designed using recently developed genome sequence and annotation resources. The captures can be combined or used independently. We demonstrate that the capture probe sets effectively enrich the high-confidence genes and putative promoter regions that were identified in the genome alongside a large proportion of the low-confidence genes and associated promoters. Finally, we demonstrate successful sample multiplexing that allows generation of adequate sequence coverage for single-nucleotide polymorphism calling while significantly reducing cost per sample for gene and putative promoter capture.Conclusions:We show that a capture design employing an ""island strategy"" can enable analysis of the large gene/putative promoter space of wheat with only 2 × 160 Mbp probe sets. Furthermore, these assays extend the regions of the wheat genome that are amenable to analyses beyond its exome, providing tools for detailed characterization of these regulatory regions in large populations.",30715311,PMC6461119,10.1093/gigascience/giz018,10,GigaScience,101596872,7.658
DivBrowse-interactive visualization and exploratory data analysis of variant call matrices,"Background:The sequencing of whole genomes is becoming increasingly affordable. In this context, large-scale sequencing projects are generating ever larger datasets of species-specific genomic diversity. As a consequence, more and more genomic data need to be made easily accessible and analyzable to the scientific community.Findings:We present DivBrowse, a web application for interactive visualization and exploratory analysis of genomic diversity data stored in Variant Call Format (VCF) files of any size. By seamlessly combining BLAST as an entry point together with interactive data analysis features such as principal component analysis in one graphical user interface, DivBrowse provides a novel and unique set of exploratory data analysis capabilities for genomic biodiversity datasets. The capability to integrate DivBrowse into existing web applications supports interoperability between different web applications. Built-in interactive computation of principal component analysis allows users to perform ad hoc analysis of the population structure based on specific genetic elements such as genes and exons. Data interoperability is supported by the ability to export genomic diversity data in VCF and General Feature Format 3 files.Conclusion:DivBrowse offers a novel approach for interactive visualization and analysis of genomic diversity data and optionally also gene annotation data by including features like interactive calculation of variant frequencies and principal component analysis.

SNeCT: Scalable Network Constrained Tucker Decomposition for Multi-Platform Data Profiling,"How do we integratively profile large-scale multi-platform genomic data that are high dimensional and sparse? Furthermore, how can we incorporate prior knowledge, such as the association between genes, in the analysis systematically to find better latent relationships? To solve this problem, we propose a Scalable Network Constrained Tucker decomposition method (SNeCT). SNeCT adopts parallel stochastic gradient descent approach on the proposed parallelizable network constrained optimization function. SNeCT decomposition is applied to a tensor constructed from a large scale multi-platform multi-cohort cancer data, PanCan12, constrained on a network built from PathwayCommons database. The decomposed factor matrices are applied to stratify cancers, to search for top- k similar patients given a new patient, and to illustrate how the matrices can be used to identify significant genomic patterns in each patient. In the stratification test, combined twelve-cohort data is clustered to form thirteen subclasses. The similarity of the top- k patient to the query was high for 23 clinical features, including estrogen/progesterone receptor statuses of BRCA patients with average precision value ranges from 0.72 to 0.86 and from 0.68 to 0.86, respectively. We also illustrate how the factor matrices can be used for identifying significant patterns for each patient.

OmicsARules: a R package for integration of multi-omics datasets via association rules mining,"Background:The improvements of high throughput technologies have produced large amounts of multi-omics experiments datasets. Initial analysis of these data has revealed many concurrent gene alterations within single dataset or/and among multiple omics datasets. Although powerful bioinformatics pipelines have been developed to store, manipulate and analyze these data, few explicitly find and assess the recurrent co-occurring aberrations across multiple regulation levels.Results:Here, we introduced a novel R-package (called OmicsARules) to identify the concerted changes among genes under association rules mining framework. OmicsARules embedded a new rule-interestingness measure, Lamda3, to evaluate the associated pattern and prioritize the most biologically meaningful gene associations. As demonstrated with DNA methlylation and RNA-seq datasets from breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA), esophageal carcinoma (ESCA) and lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), Lamda3 achieved better biological significance over other rule-ranking measures. Furthermore, OmicsARules can illustrate the mechanistic connections between methlylation and transcription, based on combined omics dataset. OmicsARules is available as a free and open-source R package.Conclusions:OmicsARules searches for concurrent patterns among frequently altered genes, thus provides a new dimension for exploring single or multiple omics data across sequencing platforms.",31703610,PMC6839229,10.1186/s12859-019-3171-0,0,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,3.307
A study on multi-omic oscillations in Escherichia coli metabolic networks,"Background:Two important challenges in the analysis of molecular biology information are data (multi-omic information) integration and the detection of patterns across large scale molecular networks and sequences. They are are actually coupled beause the integration of omic information may provide better means to detect multi-omic patterns that could reveal multi-scale or emerging properties at the phenotype levels.Results:Here we address the problem of integrating various types of molecular information (a large collection of gene expression and sequence data, codon usage and protein abundances) to analyse the E.coli metabolic response to treatments at the whole network level. Our algorithm, MORA (Multi-omic relations adjacency) is able to detect patterns which may represent metabolic network motifs at pathway and supra pathway levels which could hint at some functional role. We provide a description and insights on the algorithm by testing it on a large database of responses to antibiotics. Along with the algorithm MORA, a novel model for the analysis of oscillating multi-omics has been proposed. Interestingly, the resulting analysis suggests that some motifs reveal recurring oscillating or position variation patterns on multi-omics metabolic networks. Our framework, implemented in R, provides effective and friendly means to design intervention scenarios on real data. By analysing how multi-omics data build up multi-scale phenotypes, the software allows to compare and test metabolic models, design new pathways or redesign existing metabolic pathways and validate in silico metabolic models using nearby species.Conclusions:The integration of multi-omic data reveals that E.coli multi-omic metabolic networks contain position dependent and recurring patterns which could provide clues of long range correlations in the bacterial genome.",30066640,PMC6069781,10.1186/s12859-018-2175-5,1,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,3.307
Unveiling the potential of proteomic and genetic signatures for precision therapeutics in lung cancer management,"Lung cancer's enduring global significance necessitates ongoing advancements in diagnostics and therapeutics. Recent spotlight on proteomic and genetic biomarker research offers a promising avenue for understanding lung cancer biology and guiding treatments. This review elucidates genetic and proteomic lung cancer biomarker progress and their treatment implications. Technological strides in mass spectrometry-based proteomics and next-generation sequencing enable pinpointing of genetic abnormalities and abnormal protein expressions, furnishing vital data for precise diagnosis, patient classification, and customized treatments. Biomarker-driven personalized medicine yields substantial treatment improvements, elevating survival rates and minimizing adverse effects. Integrating omics data (genomics, proteomics, etc.) enhances understanding of lung cancer's intricate biological milieu, identifying novel treatment targets and biomarkers, fostering precision medicine. Liquid biopsies, non-invasive tools for real-time treatment monitoring and early resistance detection, gain popularity, promising enhanced management and personalized therapy. Despite advancements, biomarker repeatability and validation challenges persist, necessitating interdisciplinary efforts and large-scale clinical trials. Integrating artificial intelligence and machine learning aids analyzing vast omics datasets and predicting treatment responses. Single-cell omics reveal cellular connections and intratumoral heterogeneity, valuable for combination treatments. Biomarkers enable accurate diagnosis, tailored medicines, and treatment response tracking, significantly impacting personalized lung cancer care. This approach spurs patient-centered trials, empowering active patient engagement. Lung cancer proteomic and genetic biomarkers illuminate disease biology and treatment prospects.

Identifying biomarkers for predicting successful embryo implantation: applying single to multi-OMICs to improve reproductive outcomes,"Background:Successful embryo implantation is a complex process that requires the coordination of a series of events, involving both the embryo and the maternal endometrium. Key to this process is the intricate cascade of molecular mechanisms regulated by endocrine, paracrine and autocrine modulators of embryonic and maternal origin. Despite significant progress in ART, implantation failure still affects numerous infertile couples worldwide and fewer than 10% of embryos successfully implant. Improved selection of both the viable embryos and the optimal endometrial phenotype for transfer remains crucial to enhancing implantation chances. However, both classical morphological embryo selection and new strategies incorporated into clinical practice, such as embryonic genetic analysis, morphokinetics or ultrasound endometrial dating, remain insufficient to predict successful implantation. Additionally, no techniques are widely applied to analyse molecular signals involved in the embryo-uterine interaction. More reliable biological markers to predict embryo and uterine reproductive competence are needed to improve pregnancy outcomes. Recent years have seen a trend towards 'omics' methods, which enable the assessment of complete endometrial and embryonic molecular profiles during implantation. Omics have advanced our knowledge of the implantation process, identifying potential but rarely implemented biomarkers of successful implantation.Objective and rationale:Differences between the findings of published omics studies, and perhaps because embryonic and endometrial molecular signatures were often not investigated jointly, have prevented firm conclusions being reached. A timely review summarizing omics studies on the molecular determinants of human implantation in both the embryo and the endometrium will help facilitate integrative and reliable omics approaches to enhance ART outcomes.Search methods:In order to provide a comprehensive review of the literature published up to September 2019, Medline databases were searched using keywords pertaining to omics, including 'transcriptome', 'proteome', 'secretome', 'metabolome' and 'expression profiles', combined with terms related to implantation, such as 'endometrial receptivity', 'embryo viability' and 'embryo implantation'. No language restrictions were imposed. References from articles were also used for additional literature.Outcomes:Here we provide a complete summary of the major achievements in human implantation research supplied by omics approaches, highlighting their potential to improve reproductive outcomes while fully elucidating the implantation mechanism. The review highlights the existence of discrepancies among the postulated biomarkers from studies on embryo viability or endometrial receptivity, even using the same omic analysis.Wider implications:Despite the huge amount of biomarker information provided by omics, we still do not have enough evidence to link data from all omics with an implantation outcome. However, in the foreseeable future, application of minimally or non-invasive omics tools, together with a more integrative interpretation of uniformly collected data, will help to overcome the difficulties for clinical implementation of omics tools. Omics assays of the embryo and endometrium are being proposed or already being used as diagnostic tools for personalised single-embryo transfer in the most favourable endometrial environment, avoiding the risk of multiple pregnancies and ensuring better pregnancy rates.",32096829,,10.1093/humupd/dmz042,35,Human reproduction update,9507614,17.179
Substantial genome synteny preservation among woody angiosperm species: comparative genomics of Chinese chestnut (Castanea mollissima) and plant reference genomes,"Background:Chinese chestnut (Castanea mollissima) has emerged as a model species for the Fagaceae family with extensive genomic resources including a physical map, a dense genetic map and quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for chestnut blight resistance. These resources enable comparative genomics analyses relative to model plants. We assessed the degree of conservation between the chestnut genome and other well annotated and assembled plant genomic sequences, focusing on the QTL regions of most interest to the chestnut breeding community.Results:The integrated physical and genetic map of Chinese chestnut has been improved to now include 858 shared sequence-based markers. The utility of the integrated map has also been improved through the addition of 42,970 BAC (bacterial artificial chromosome) end sequences spanning over 26 million bases of the estimated 800 Mb chestnut genome. Synteny between chestnut and ten model plant species was conducted on a macro-syntenic scale using sequences from both individual probes and BAC end sequences across the chestnut physical map. Blocks of synteny with chestnut were found in all ten reference species, with the percent of the chestnut physical map that could be aligned ranging from 10 to 39 %. The integrated genetic and physical map was utilized to identify BACs that spanned the three previously identified QTL regions conferring blight resistance. The clones were pooled and sequenced, yielding 396 sequence scaffolds covering 13.9 Mbp. Comparative genomic analysis on a microsytenic scale, using the QTL-associated genomic sequence, identified synteny from chestnut to other plant genomes ranging from 5.4 to 12.9 % of the genome sequences aligning.Conclusions:On both the macro- and micro-synteny levels, the peach, grape and poplar genomes were found to be the most structurally conserved with chestnut. Interestingly, these results did not strictly follow the expectation that decreased phylogenetic distance would correspond to increased levels of genome preservation, but rather suggest the additional influence of life-history traits on preservation of synteny. The regions of synteny that were detected provide an important tool for defining and cataloging genes in the QTL regions for advancing chestnut blight resistance research.",26438416,PMC4595192,10.1186/s12864-015-1942-1,16,BMC genomics,100965258,4.547
Identifying subpathway signatures for individualized anticancer drug response by integrating multi-omics data,"Background:Individualized drug response prediction is vital for achieving personalized treatment of cancer and moving precision medicine forward. Large-scale multi-omics profiles provide unprecedented opportunities for precision cancer therapy.Methods:In this study, we propose a pipeline to identify subpathway signatures for anticancer drug response of individuals by integrating the comprehensive contributions of multiple genetic and epigenetic (gene expression, copy number variation and DNA methylation) alterations.Results:Totally, 46 subpathway signatures associated with individual responses to different anticancer drugs were identified based on five cancer-drug response datasets. We have validated the reliability of subpathway signatures in two independent datasets. Furthermore, we also demonstrated these multi-omics subpathway signatures could significantly improve the performance of anticancer drug response prediction. In-depth analysis of these 46 subpathway signatures uncovered the essential roles of three omics types and the functional associations underlying different anticancer drug responses. Patient stratification based on subpathway signatures involved in anticancer drug response identified subtypes with different clinical outcomes, implying their potential roles as prognostic biomarkers. In addition, a landscape of subpathways associated with cellular responses to 191 anticancer drugs from CellMiner was provided and the mechanism similarity of drug action was accurately unclosed based on these subpathways. Finally, we constructed a user-friendly web interface-CancerDAP ( http://bio-bigdata.hrbmu.edu.cn/CancerDAP/ ) available to explore 2751 subpathways relevant with 191 anticancer drugs response.Conclusions:Taken together, our study identified and systematically characterized subpathway signatures for individualized anticancer drug response prediction, which may promote the precise treatment of cancer and the study for molecular mechanisms of drug actions.",31387579,PMC6685260,10.1186/s12967-019-2010-4,10,Journal of translational medicine,101190741,8.44
Data integration by fuzzy similarity-based hierarchical clustering,"Background:High throughput methods, in biological and biomedical fields, acquire a large number of molecular parameters or omics data by a single experiment. Combining these omics data can significantly increase the capability for recovering fine-tuned structures or reducing the effects of experimental and biological noise in data.Results:In this work we propose a multi-view integration methodology (named FH-Clust) for identifying patient subgroups from different omics information (e.g., Gene Expression, Mirna Expression, Methylation). In particular, hierarchical structures of patient data are obtained in each omic (or view) and finally their topologies are merged by consensus matrix. One of the main aspects of this methodology, is the use of a measure of dissimilarity between sets of observations, by using an appropriate metric. For each view, a dendrogram is obtained by using a hierarchical clustering based on a fuzzy equivalence relation with Łukasiewicz valued fuzzy similarity. Finally, a consensus matrix, that is a representative information of all dendrograms, is formed by combining multiple hierarchical agglomerations by an approach based on transitive consensus matrix construction. Several experiments and comparisons are made on real data (e.g., Glioblastoma, Prostate Cancer) to assess the proposed approach.Conclusions:Fuzzy logic allows us to introduce more flexible data agglomeration techniques. From the analysis of scientific literature, it appears to be the first time that a model based on fuzzy logic is used for the agglomeration of multi-omic data. The results suggest that FH-Clust provides better prognostic value and clinical significance compared to the analysis of single-omic data alone and it is very competitive with respect to other techniques from literature.",32838739,PMC7446192,10.1186/s12859-020-03567-6,3,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,3.307
DriverMP enables improved identification of cancer driver genes,"Background:Cancer is widely regarded as a complex disease primarily driven by genetic mutations. A critical concern and significant obstacle lies in discerning driver genes amid an extensive array of passenger genes.Findings:We present a new method termed DriverMP for effectively prioritizing altered genes on a cancer-type level by considering mutated gene pairs. It is designed to first apply nonsilent somatic mutation data, protein‒protein interaction network data, and differential gene expression data to prioritize mutated gene pairs, and then individual mutated genes are prioritized based on prioritized mutated gene pairs. Application of this method in 10 cancer datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas demonstrated its great improvements over all the compared state-of-the-art methods in identifying known driver genes. Then, a comprehensive analysis demonstrated the reliability of the novel driver genes that are strongly supported by clinical experiments, disease enrichment, or biological pathway analysis.Conclusions:The new method, DriverMP, which is able to identify driver genes by effectively integrating the advantages of multiple kinds of cancer data, is available at https://github.com/LiuYangyangSDU/DriverMP. In addition, we have developed a novel driver gene database for 10 cancer types and an online service that can be freely accessed without registration for users. The DriverMP method, the database of novel drivers, and the user-friendly online server are expected to contribute to new diagnostic and therapeutic opportunities for cancers.",38091511,PMC10716827,10.1093/gigascience/giad106,0,GigaScience,101596872,7.658
A New Era of Integration between Multiomics and Spatio-Temporal Analysis for the Translation of EMT towards Clinical Applications in Cancer,"Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is crucial to metastasis by increasing cancer cell migration and invasion. At the cellular level, EMT-related morphological and functional changes are well established. At the molecular level, critical signaling pathways able to drive EMT have been described. Yet, the translation of EMT into efficient diagnostic methods and anti-metastatic therapies is still missing. This highlights a gap in our understanding of the precise mechanisms governing EMT. Here, we discuss evidence suggesting that overcoming this limitation requires the integration of multiple omics, a hitherto neglected strategy in the EMT field. More specifically, this work summarizes results that were independently obtained through epigenomics/transcriptomics while comprehensively reviewing the achievements of proteomics in cancer research. Additionally, we prospect gains to be obtained by applying spatio-temporal multiomics in the investigation of EMT-driven metastasis. Along with the development of more sensitive technologies, the integration of currently available omics, and a look at dynamic alterations that regulate EMT at the subcellular level will lead to a deeper understanding of this process. Further, considering the significance of EMT to cancer progression, this integrative strategy may enable the development of new and improved biomarkers and therapeutics capable of increasing the survival and quality of life of cancer patients.",38067168,PMC10706093,10.3390/cells12232740,0,Cells,101600052,7.666
Multi-omics integration of scRNA-seq time series data predicts new intervention points for Parkinson's disease,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder without a cure. The onset of PD symptoms corresponds to 50% loss of midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neurons, limiting early-stage understanding of PD. To shed light on early PD development, we study time series scRNA-seq datasets of mDA neurons obtained from patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cell differentiation. We develop a new data integration method based on Non-negative Matrix Tri-Factorization that integrates these datasets with molecular interaction networks, producing condition-specific ""gene embeddings"". By mining these embeddings, we predict 193 PD-related genes that are largely supported (49.7%) in the literature and are specific to the investigated PINK1 mutation. Enrichment analysis in Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways highlights 10 PD-related molecular mechanisms perturbed during early PD development. Finally, investigating the top 20 prioritized genes reveals 12 previously unrecognized genes associated with PD that represent interesting drug targets.",38744869,PMC11094121,10.1038/s41598-024-61844-3,0,Scientific reports,101563288,4.996
Balrog: A universal protein model for prokaryotic gene prediction,"Low-cost, high-throughput sequencing has led to an enormous increase in the number of sequenced microbial genomes, with well over 100,000 genomes in public archives today. Automatic genome annotation tools are integral to understanding these organisms, yet older gene finding methods must be retrained on each new genome. We have developed a universal model of prokaryotic genes by fitting a temporal convolutional network to amino-acid sequences from a large, diverse set of microbial genomes. We incorporated the new model into a gene finding system, Balrog (Bacterial Annotation by Learned Representation Of Genes), which does not require genome-specific training and which matches or outperforms other state-of-the-art gene finding tools. Balrog is freely available under the MIT license at https://github.com/salzberg-lab/Balrog.",33635857,PMC7946324,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008727,12,PLoS computational biology,101238922,4.779
Integration of histopathological images and multi-dimensional omics analyses predicts molecular features and prognosis in high-grade serous ovarian cancer,"Objective:This study used histopathological image features to predict molecular features, and combined with multi-dimensional omics data to predict overall survival (OS) in high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC).Methods:Patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were distributed into training set (n = 115) and test set (n = 114). In addition, we collected tissue microarrays of 92 patients as an external validation set. Quantitative features were extracted from histopathological images using CellProfiler, and utilized to establish prediction models by machine learning methods in training set. The prediction performance was assessed in test set and validation set.Results:The prediction models were able to identify BRCA1 mutation (AUC = 0.952), BRCA2 mutation (AUC = 0.912), microsatellite instability-high (AUC = 0.919), microsatellite stable (AUC = 0.924), and molecular subtypes: proliferative (AUC = 0.961), differentiated (AUC = 0.952), immunoreactive (AUC = 0.941), mesenchymal (AUC = 0.918) in test set. The prognostic model based on histopathological image features could predict OS in test set (5-year AUC = 0.825) and validation set (5-year AUC = 0.703). We next explored the integrative prognostic models of image features, genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics. In test set, the models combining two omics had higher prediction accuracy, such as image features and genomics (5-year AUC = 0.834). The multi-omics model including all features showed the best prediction performance (5-year AUC = 0.911). According to risk score of multi-omics model, the high-risk and low-risk groups had significant survival differences (HR = 18.23, p < 0.001).Conclusions:These results indicated the potential ability of histopathological image features to predict above molecular features and survival risk of HGSOC patients. The integration of image features and multi-omics data may improve prognosis prediction in HGSOC patients.",34275655,,10.1016/j.ygyno.2021.07.015,13,Gynecologic oncology,365304,5.304

Performance analysis of data resampling on class imbalance and classification techniques on multi-omics data for cancer classification,"Cancer, in any of its forms, remains a significant public health concern worldwide. Advances in early detection and treatment could lead to a decline in the overall death rate from cancer in recent decades. Therefore, tumor prediction and classification play an important role in fighting cancer. This study built computational models for a joint analysis of RNA seq, copy number variation (CNV), and DNA methylation to classify normal and tumor samples across liver cancer, breast cancer, and colon adenocarcinoma from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset. Total of 18 machine learning methods were evaluated based on the AUC, precision, recall, and F-measure. Besides, five techniques were compared to ameliorate problems of class imbalance in the cancer datasets. Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) demonstrated the best performance. The results indicate that the model applying Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) for learning binary class SVM with hinge loss has the highest classification results on liver cancer and breast cancer datasets, with accuracy over 99% and AUC greater than or equal to 0.999. For colon adenocarcinoma dataset, both SGD and Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) that implements John Platt's sequential minimal optimization algorithm for training a support vector machine shows an outstanding classification performance with accuracy of 100%, AUC, precision, recall, and F-measure all at 1.000.",38422094,PMC10903850,10.1371/journal.pone.0293607,0,PloS one,101285081,3.752
Harnessing the predicted maize pan-interactome for putative gene function prediction and prioritization of candidate genes for important traits,"The recent assembly and annotation of the 26 maize nested association mapping population founder inbreds have enabled large-scale pan-genomic comparative studies. These studies have expanded our understanding of agronomically important traits by integrating pan-transcriptomic data with trait-specific gene candidates from previous association mapping results. In contrast to the availability of pan-transcriptomic data, obtaining reliable protein-protein interaction (PPI) data has remained a challenge due to its high cost and complexity. We generated predicted PPI networks for each of the 26 genomes using the established STRING database. The individual genome-interactomes were then integrated to generate core- and pan-interactomes. We deployed the PPI clustering algorithm ClusterONE to identify numerous PPI clusters that were functionally annotated using gene ontology (GO) functional enrichment, demonstrating a diverse range of enriched GO terms across different clusters. Additional cluster annotations were generated by integrating gene coexpression data and gene description annotations, providing additional useful information. We show that the functionally annotated PPI clusters establish a useful framework for protein function prediction and prioritization of candidate genes of interest. Our study not only provides a comprehensive resource of predicted PPI networks for 26 maize genomes but also offers annotated interactome clusters for predicting protein functions and prioritizing gene candidates. The source code for the Python implementation of the analysis workflow and a standalone web application for accessing the analysis results are available at https://github.com/eporetsky/PanPPI.",38492232,PMC11075552,10.1093/g3journal/jkae059,0,"G3 (Bethesda, Md.)",101566598,3.542
Molecular characterization of allergic constitution based on network pharmacology and multi-omics analysis methods,"The objective of this study was to identify critical pathways associated with allergic constitution. Shared genes among allergic rhinitis (AR), asthma (AA), and atopic dermatitis (AD) were extracted from the GWAS catalog. RNA-seq data of AR, AA, and AD from gene expression omnibus (GEO) database were preprocessed and subjected to differential gene expression analysis. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were merged using the Robust Rank Aggregation (RRA) algorithm. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was performed to identify modules associated with allergies. Components of Guominkang (GMK) were obtained from 6 databases and activate components were identified by SwissADME website. Utilizing the SwissTarget Prediction, PharmMapper, SymMap, and HERB, the targets of GMK were predicted and subsequently validated using gene chip data from our team previous study. Differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) related to the allergic constitution were also extracted based on a previous study. Pathway enrichment analysis was performed using KOBAS-i on the GWAS, RRA, WGCNA modules, DEPs, and GMK targets. P values from multi-omics datasets were combined by meta-analysis, and Bonferroni correction was applied. The significant pathways were further validated using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) with intervention data of GMK. The GWAS results yielded 172 genes. Four datasets AR1, AA1, AD1, and AD2 were acquired from GSE75011, GSE125916, and GSE184237. The RRA algorithm identified 19 upregulated and 20 downregulated genes. WGCNA identified 5 significant modules, with the blue and turquoise modules displaying a moderate correlation with allergies. By performing network pharmacology analysis, we identified 127 active ingredients of GMK and predicted 618 targets. Validation using gene chip data confirmed 107 GMK targets. Single-omics pathway analysis was conducted using KOBAS-i, and 39 significant pathways were identified across multiple omics datasets. GSEA analysis using GMK intervention data identified 11 of 39 significant pathways as the final key pathways associated with the allergic constitution. Through multi-omics integrated pathway analysis, we identified 11 critical pathways of allergic constitution, including TH1 and TH2 cell differentiation, TLR cascade, and TH17 cell differentiation. Identifying these pathways suggests that the observed alterations at the pathway level may play significant roles in the molecular characteristics of the allergic constitution.",38363941,PMC10869101,10.1097/MD.0000000000036892,1,Medicine,2985248R,0.0
Gigantic Genomes Provide Empirical Tests of Transposable Element Dynamics Models,"Transposable elements (TEs) are a major determinant of eukaryotic genome size. The collective properties of a genomic TE community reveal the history of TE/host evolutionary dynamics and impact present-day host structure and function, from genome to organism levels. In rare cases, TE community/genome size has greatly expanded in animals, associated with increased cell size and changes to anatomy and physiology. Here, we characterize the TE landscape of the genome and transcriptome in an amphibian with a giant genome - the caecilianIchthyophis bannanicus, which we show has a genome size of 12.2 Gb. Amphibians are an important model system because the clade includes independent cases of genomic gigantism. The I. bannanicus genome differs compositionally from other giant amphibian genomes, but shares a low rate of ectopic recombination-mediated deletion. We examine TE activity using expression and divergence plots; TEs account for 15% of somatic transcription, and most superfamilies appear active. We quantify TE diversity in the caecilian, as well as other vertebrates with a range of genome sizes, using diversity indices commonly applied in community ecology. We synthesize previous models that integrate TE abundance, diversity, and activity, and test whether the caecilian meets model predictions for genomes with high TE abundance. We propose thorough, consistent characterization of TEs to strengthen future comparative analyses. Such analyses will ultimately be required to reveal whether the divergent TE assemblages found across convergent gigantic genomes reflect fundamental shared features of TE/host genome evolutionary dynamics.",33677107,PMC8498967,10.1016/j.gpb.2020.11.005,8,"Genomics, proteomics & bioinformatics",101197608,6.409
SoFIA: a data integration framework for annotating high-throughput datasets,"Motivation:Integrating heterogeneous datasets from several sources is a common bioinformatics task that often requires implementing a complex workflow intermixing database access, data filtering, format conversions, identifier mapping, among further diverse operations. Data integration is especially important when annotating next generation sequencing data, where a multitude of diverse tools and heterogeneous databases can be used to provide a large variety of annotation for genomic locations, such a single nucleotide variants or genes. Each tool and data source is potentially useful for a given project and often more than one are used in parallel for the same purpose. However, software that always produces all available data is difficult to maintain and quickly leads to an excess of data, creating an information overload rather than the desired goal-oriented and integrated result.Results:We present SoFIA, a framework for workflow-driven data integration with a focus on genomic annotation. SoFIA conceptualizes workflow templates as comprehensive workflows that cover as many data integration operations as possible in a given domain. However, these templates are not intended to be executed as a whole; instead, when given an integration task consisting of a set of input data and a set of desired output data, SoFIA derives a minimal workflow that completes the task. These workflows are typically fast and create exactly the information a user wants without requiring them to do any implementation work. Using a comprehensive genome annotation template, we highlight the flexibility, extensibility and power of the framework using real-life case studies.Availability and implementation:https://github.com/childsish/sofia/releases/latest under the GNU General Public LicenseContact:liam.childs@hu-berlin.deSupplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",27187206,,10.1093/bioinformatics/btw302,4,"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",9808944,6.931
"Integrated multiomics analyses unveil the implication of a costimulatory molecule score on tumor aggressiveness and immune evasion in breast cancer: A large-scale study through over 8,000 patients","Background:Although immunotherapy has revolutionised cancer management, reliable genomic biomarkers for identifying eligible patient subpopulations are lacking. Costimulatory molecules play a crucial role in mounting anti-tumour responses, and clinical trials targeting these novel biomarkers are underway. However, whether these molecules can determine tumour aggressiveness and the risk of tumour evasion in breast cancer (BC) remains largely unknown.Methods:The whole-tissue transcriptomic data of 8236 patients with BC from 15 independent cohorts were extracted. An integrated scoring system named 'costimulatory molecule score' (CMS) was constructed and sufficient validated using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression (1000 iterations) and the random survival forest algorithm (1000 trees). The correlation among CMSs, cancer genotypes and clinicopathological characteristics was examined. Extensive multiomics and immunogenomic analyses were performed to investigate and verify the association among CMSs, enriched pathways, potential intrinsic and extrinsic immune escape mechanisms, immunotherapy response and therapeutic options.Results:The predictive role of CMS model that relies on expression pattern of merely 5 costimulatory genes for prognosis is almost universally applicable to BC patients in a platform-independent manner. Through internal and external in silico validation, high CMS was characterized by favorable genotypes but decreased tumor immunogenicity, activation of stroma, immune-suppressive states and potential immunotherapeutic resistance.

Four integrative subtypes (iP-1-4) are stratified on the basis of global proteome and phosphoproteome, each of which exhibits distinct molecular and pathway features. Scaffold and co-expression network analyses of three proteomic datasets, integrated with those from genome and transcriptome of the same cohort, reveal key pathways and master regulators that, characteristic of TNBC subtypes, play important regulatory roles within and between scaffold sub-structures and co-expression communities. We find that NAE1 is a potential drug target for subtype iP-1, and a series of key molecules in fatty acid metabolism, such as AKT1/FASN, are plausible targets for subtype iP-2. Libraries of proteins, pathways and networks of TNBC provide a valuable molecular infrastructure for further clinical exploration and in-depth studies of the molecular mechanisms of the disease.",35235781,,10.1016/j.celrep.2022.110460,11,Cell reports,101573691,9.995
GeneDig: a web application for accessing genomic and bioinformatics knowledge,"Background:With the exponential increase and widespread availability of genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data, accessing these '-omics' data is becoming increasingly difficult. The current resources for accessing and analyzing these data have been created to perform highly specific functions intended for specialists, and thus typically emphasize functionality over user experience.Results:We have developed a web-based application, GeneDig.org, that allows any general user access to genomic information with ease and efficiency. GeneDig allows for searching and browsing genes and genomes, while a dynamic navigator displays genomic, RNA, and protein information simultaneously for co-navigation. We demonstrate that our application allows more than five times faster and efficient access to genomic information than any currently available methods.Conclusion:We have developed GeneDig as a platform for bioinformatics integration focused on usability as its central design.

"A scalable, secure, and interoperable platform for deep data-driven health management","The large amount of biomedical data derived from wearable sensors, electronic health records, and molecular profiling (e.g., genomics data) is rapidly transforming our healthcare systems. The increasing scale and scope of biomedical data not only is generating enormous opportunities for improving health outcomes but also raises new challenges ranging from data acquisition and storage to data analysis and utilization. To meet these challenges, we developed the Personal Health Dashboard (PHD), which utilizes state-of-the-art security and scalability technologies to provide an end-to-end solution for big biomedical data analytics. The PHD platform is an open-source software framework that can be easily configured and deployed to any big data health project to store, organize, and process complex biomedical data sets, support real-time data analysis at both the individual level and the cohort level, and ensure participant privacy at every step. In addition to presenting the system, we illustrate the use of the PHD framework for large-scale applications in emerging multi-omics disease studies, such as collecting and visualization of diverse data types (wearable, clinical, omics) at a personal level, investigation of insulin resistance, and an infrastructure for the detection of presymptomatic COVID-19.",34599181,PMC8486823,10.1038/s41467-021-26040-1,11,Nature communications,101528555,17.694
Machine learning based combination of multi-omics data for subgroup identification in non-small cell lung cancer,"Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) is a heterogeneous disease with a poor prognosis. Identifying novel subtypes in cancer can help classify patients with similar molecular and clinical phenotypes. This work proposes an end-to-end pipeline for subgroup identification in NSCLC. Here, we used a machine learning (ML) based approach to compress the multi-omics NSCLC data to a lower dimensional space. This data is subjected to consensus K-means clustering to identify the five novel clusters (C1-C5). Survival analysis of the resulting clusters revealed a significant difference in the overall survival of clusters (p-value: 0.019). Each cluster was then molecularly characterized to identify specific molecular characteristics. We found that cluster C3 showed minimal genetic aberration with a high prognosis. Next, classification models were developed using data from each omic level to predict the subgroup of unseen patients. Decision‑level fused classification models were then built using these classifiers, which were used to classify unseen patients into five novel clusters. We also showed that the multi-omics-based classification model outperformed single-omic-based models, and the combination of classifiers proved to be a more accurate prediction model than the individual classifiers. In summary, we have used ML models to develop a classification method and identified five novel NSCLC clusters with different genetic and clinical characteristics.",36944673,PMC10030850,10.1038/s41598-023-31426-w,3,Scientific reports,101563288,4.996

Correlational selection in the age of genomics,"Ecologists and evolutionary biologists are well aware that natural and sexual selection do not operate on traits in isolation, but instead act on combinations of traits. This long-recognized and pervasive phenomenon is known as multivariate selection, or-in the particular case where it favours correlations between interacting traits-correlational selection. Despite broad acknowledgement of correlational selection, the relevant theory has often been overlooked in genomic research. Here, we discuss theory and empirical findings from ecological, quantitative genetic and genomic research, linking key insights from different fields. Correlational selection can operate on both discrete trait combinations and quantitative characters, with profound implications for genomic architecture, linkage, pleiotropy, evolvability, modularity, phenotypic integration and phenotypic plasticity. We synthesize current knowledge and discuss promising research approaches that will enable us to understand how correlational selection shapes genomic architecture, thereby linking quantitative genetic approaches with emerging genomic methods. We suggest that research on correlational selection has great potential to integrate multiple fields in evolutionary biology, including developmental and functional biology, ecology, quantitative genetics, phenotypic polymorphisms, hybrid zones and speciation processes.",33859374,,10.1038/s41559-021-01413-3,22,Nature ecology & evolution,101698577,19.1
Systems Biology Approaches to Understanding the Human Immune System,"Systems biology is an approach to interrogate complex biological systems through large-scale quantification of numerous biomolecules. The immune system involves >1,500 genes/proteins in many interconnected pathways and processes, and a systems-level approach is critical in broadening our understanding of the immune response to vaccination. Changes in molecular pathways can be detected using high-throughput omics datasets (e.g., transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics) by using methods such as pathway enrichment, network analysis, machine learning, etc. Importantly, integration of multipleomicdatasets is becoming key to revealing novel biological insights. In this perspective article, we highlight the use of protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks as a multi-omics integration approach to unravel information flow and mechanisms during complex biological events, with a focus on the immune system. This involves a combination of tools, including:InnateDB, a database of curated interactions between genes and protein products involved in the innate immunity;NetworkAnalyst, a visualization and analysis platform for InnateDB interactions; andMetaBridge, a tool to integrate metabolite data into PPI networks. The application of these systems techniques is demonstrated for a variety of biological questions, including: the developmental trajectory of neonates during the first week of life, mechanisms in host-pathogen interaction, disease prognosis, biomarker discovery, and drug discovery and repurposing. Overall, systems biology analyses of omics data have been applied to a variety of immunology-related questions, and here we demonstrate the numerous ways in which PPI network analysis can be a powerful tool in contributing to our understanding of the immune system and the study of vaccines.",32849587,PMC7406790,10.3389/fimmu.2020.01683,12,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,8.786
MDICC: novel method for multi-omics data integration and cancer subtype identification,"Each type of cancer usually has several subtypes with distinct clinical implications, and therefore the discovery of cancer subtypes is an important and urgent task in disease diagnosis and therapy. Using single-omics data to predict cancer subtypes is difficult because genomes are dysregulated and complicated by multiple molecular mechanisms, and therefore linking cancer genomes to cancer phenotypes is not an easy task. Using multi-omics data to effectively predict cancer subtypes is an area of much interest; however, integrating multi-omics data is challenging. Here, we propose a novel method of multi-omics data integration for clustering to identify cancer subtypes (MDICC) that integrates new affinity matrix and network fusion methods. Our experimental results show the effectiveness and generalization of the proposed MDICC model in identifying cancer subtypes, and its performance was better than those of currently available state-of-the-art clustering methods. Furthermore, the survival analysis demonstrates that MDICC delivered comparable or even better results than many typical integrative methods.",35437603,,10.1093/bib/bbac132,7,Briefings in bioinformatics,100912837,13.994
Multi-omics analysis reveals interferon-stimulated gene OAS1 as a prognostic and immunological biomarker in pan-cancer,"Introduction:OAS1(2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase 1) is a member of the Interferon-Stimulated Genes which plays an important role in the antiviral process. In recent years, the role of OAS1 in tumors has attracted attention, and it was found to be associated with prognosis in several tumors. However, the mechanism by which OAS1 affects tumors is unclear and pan-cancer study of OAS1 is necessary to better understand its implication in cancers.Methods:The expression, prognostic value, genetic alteration, alternative splicing events of OAS1 in pan-cancers were analyzed using TCGA, GTEx, HPA, GEPIA and OncoSplicing databases. OAS1 associated immune cell infiltration was evaluated using the ESTIMATE, xCell, CIBERSORT and QUANTISEQ algorithm. Single cell transcriptome data download using TISH database. Finally, the roles of the OAS1 on apoptosis, migration and invasion were investigated in two pancreatic cancer cells.Results:Our results revealed significant differences in OAS1 expression among various tumors, which had prognostic implications. In addition, we investigated the impact of OAS1 on genomic stability, methylation status, and other factors across different types of cancer, and the effects of these factors on prognosis. Notably, our study also demonstrated that OAS1 overexpression can contribute to CTL dysfunction and macrophage M2 polarization. In addition, cell experiments showed that the knockdown of OAS1 could reduce the invasive ability and increased the apoptosis rate of PAAD cells.Discussion:These results confirmed that OAS1 could be a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for its potential role in CTL dysfunction and macrophage M2 polarization.",37928544,PMC10623006,10.3389/fimmu.2023.1249731,0,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,8.786
Brassica database (BRAD) version 2.0: integrating and mining Brassicaceae species genomic resources,"The Brassica database (BRAD) was built initially to assist users apply Brassica rapa and Arabidopsis thaliana genomic data efficiently to their research. However, many Brassicaceae genomes have been sequenced and released after its construction. These genomes are rich resources for comparative genomics, gene annotation and functional evolutionary studies of Brassica crops. Therefore, we have updated BRAD to version 2.0 (V2.0). In BRAD V2.0, 11 more Brassicaceae genomes have been integrated into the database, namely those of Arabidopsis lyrata, Aethionema arabicum, Brassica oleracea, Brassica napus, Camelina sativa, Capsella rubella, Leavenworthia alabamica, Sisymbrium irio and three extremophiles Schrenkiella parvula, Thellungiella halophila and Thellungiella salsuginea. BRAD V2.0 provides plots of syntenic genomic fragments between pairs of Brassicaceae species, from the level of chromosomes to genomic blocks.

"FEATnotator: A tool for integrated annotation of sequence features and variation, facilitating interpretation in genomics experiments","As approaches are sought for more efficient and democratized uses of non-model and expanded model genomics references, ease of integration of genomic feature datasets is especially desirable in multidisciplinary research communities. Valuable conclusions are often missed or slowed when researchers refer experimental results to a single reference sequence that lacks integrated pan-genomic and multi-experiment data in accessible formats. Association of genomic positional information, such as results from an expansive variety of next-generation sequencing experiments, with annotated reference features such as genes or predicted protein binding sites, provides the context essential for conclusions and ongoing research. When the experimental system includes polymorphic genomic inputs, rapid calculation of gene structural and protein translational effects of sequence variation from the reference can be invaluable. Here we present FEATnotator, a lightweight, fast and easy to use open source software program that integrates and reports overlap and proximity in genomic information from any user-defined datasets including those from next generation sequencing applications. We illustrate use of the tool by summarizing whole genome sequence variation of a widely used natural isolate of Arabidopsis thaliana in the context of gene models of the reference accession. Previous discovery of a protein coding deletion influencing root development is replicated rapidly. Appropriate even in investigations of a single gene or genic regions such as QTL, comprehensive reports provided by FEATnotator better prepare researchers for interpretation of their experimental results.

htsint: a Python library for sequencing pipelines that combines data through gene set generation,"Background:Sequencing technologies provide a wealth of details in terms of genes, expression, splice variants, polymorphisms, and other features. A standard for sequencing analysis pipelines is to put genomic or transcriptomic features into a context of known functional information, but the relationships between ontology terms are often ignored. For RNA-Seq, considering genes and their genetic variants at the group level enables a convenient way to both integrate annotation data and detect small coordinated changes between experimental conditions, a known caveat of gene level analyses.Results:We introduce the high throughput data integration tool, htsint, as an extension to the commonly used gene set enrichment frameworks. The central aim of htsint is to compile annotation information from one or more taxa in order to calculate functional distances among all genes in a specified gene space. Spectral clustering is then used to partition the genes, thereby generating functional modules. The gene space can range from a targeted list of genes, like a specific pathway, all the way to an ensemble of genomes. Given a collection of gene sets and a count matrix of transcriptomic features (e.g. expression, polymorphisms), the gene sets produced by htsint can be tested for 'enrichment' or conditional differences using one of a number of commonly available packages.Conclusion:The database and bundled tools to generate functional modules were designed with sequencing pipelines in mind, but the toolkit nature of htsint allows it to also be used in other areas of genomics.

Molecular classification reveals the diverse genetic and prognostic features of gastric cancer: A multi-omics consensus ensemble clustering,"Background:Globally, gastric cancer (GC) is the fifth most common tumor. It is necessary to identify novel molecular subtypes to guide patient selection for specific target therapeutic benefits.Methods:Multi-omics data, including transcriptomics RNA-sequencing (mRNA, LncRNA, miRNA), DNA methylation, and gene mutations in the TCGA-STAD cohort were used for the clustering. Ten classical clustering algorithms were executed to recognize patients with different molecular features using the ""MOVICS"" package in R. The activated signaling pathways were evaluated using the single-sample gene set enrichment analysis. The differential distribution of gene mutations, copy number alterations, and tumor mutation burden was compared, and potential responses to immunotherapy and chemotherapy were also assessed.Results:Two molecular subtypes (CS1 and CS2) were recognized by ten clustering algorithms with consensus ensembles. Patients in the CS1 group had a shorter average overall survival time (28.5 vs. 68.9 months, P = 0.016), and progression-free survival (19.0 vs. 63.9 months, P = 0.008) as compared to those in the CS2 group. Extracellular associated biological process activation was higher in the CS1 group, while the CS2 group displayed the enhanced activation of cell cycle-associated pathways. Significantly higher total mutation numbers and neoantigens were observed in the CS2 group, along with specific mutations in TTN, MUC16, and ARID1A. Higher infiltration of immunocytes was also observed in the CS2 group, reflective of the potential immunotherapeutic benefits. Moreover, the CS2 group could also respond to 5-fluorouracil, cisplatin, and paclitaxel. The similar diversity in clinical outcomes between CS1 and CS2 groups was successfully validated in the external cohorts, GSE62254, GSE26253, GSE15459, and GSE84437.Conclusion:The findings provided novel insights into the GC subtypes through integrative analysis of five -omics data by ten clustering algorithms.

Multi-omics approach for identification of molecular alterations of QiShenYiQi dripping pills in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction,"Ethnopharmacological relevance:Traditional Chinese medicine theory believes that qi deficiency and blood stasis are the key pathogenesis of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). As a representative prescription for replenishing qi and activating blood, QiShenYiQi dripping pills (QSYQ) has been used for treating heart diseases. However, the pharmacological mechanism of QSYQ in improving HFpEF is not well understood.Aim of the study:The objective of the study is to investigate the cardioprotective effect and mechanism of QSYQ in HFpEF using the phenotypic dataset of HFpEF.Materials and methods:HFpEF mouse models established by feeding mice combined high-fat diet and Nω-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester drinking water were treated with QSYQ. To reveal causal genes, we performed a multi-omics study, including integrative analysis of transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics data. Moreover, adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based PKG inhibition confirmed that QSYQ mediated myocardial remodeling through PKG.Results:Computational systems pharmacological analysis based on human transcriptome data for HFpEF showed that QSYQ could potentially treat HFpEF through multiple signaling pathways. Subsequently, integrative analysis of transcriptome and proteome showed alterations in gene expression in HFpEF. QSYQ regulated genes involved in inflammation, energy metabolism, myocardial hypertrophy, myocardial fibrosis, and cGMP-PKG signaling pathway, confirming its function in the pathogenesis of HFpEF. Metabolomics analysis revealed fatty acid metabolism as the main mechanism by which QSYQ regulates HFpEF myocardial energy metabolism. Importantly, we found that the myocardial protective effect of QSYQ on HFpEF mice was attenuated after RNA interference-mediated knock-down of myocardial PKG.Conclusion:This study provides mechanistic insights into the pathogenesis of HFpEF and molecular mechanisms of QSYQ in HFpEF. We also identified the regulatory role of PKG in myocardial stiffness, making it an ideal therapeutic target for myocardial remodeling.",37268257,,10.1016/j.jep.2023.116673,1,Journal of ethnopharmacology,7903310,5.195
"Novel insights into head and neck cancer using next-generation ""omic"" technologies","Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a highly heterogeneous disease that develops via one of the two primary carcinogenic routes: chemical carcinogenesis through exposure to tobacco and alcohol or virally induced tumorigenesis. Human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive (HPV(+)) and HPV-negative (HPV(-)) HNSCCs represent distinct clinical entities, with the latter associated with significantly inferior outcome. The biologic basis of these different outcomes is an area of intense investigation; their therapeutic regimens are currently also being reevaluated, which would be significantly facilitated by reliable biomarkers for stratification. With the advent of the omics era and accelerated development of targeted therapies, there are unprecedented opportunities to address the challenges in the management of HNSCC. As summarized herein, side-by-side molecular characterization of HPV(+) versus HPV(-) HNSCC has revealed distinct molecular landscapes, novel prognostic signatures, and potentially targetable biologic pathways. In particular, we focus on the evidence acquired from genome-wide omics pertinent to our understanding of the clinical behavior of HNSCC and on insights into personalized treatment opportunities. Integrating, mining, and validating these data toward clinically meaningful outcomes for patients with HNSCC in conjunction with systematic verification of the functional relevance of these findings are critical steps toward the design of personalized therapies.",25589349,,10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-14-3124,25,Cancer research,2984705R,0.0

MBGD update 2018: microbial genome database based on hierarchical orthology relations covering closely related and distantly related comparisons,"The Microbial Genome Database for Comparative Analysis (MBGD) is a database for comparative genomics based on comprehensive orthology analysis of bacteria, archaea and unicellular eukaryotes. MBGD now contains 6318 genomes. To utilize the database for both closely related and distantly related genomes, MBGD previously provided two types of ortholog tables: the standard ortholog table containing one representative genome from each genus covering the entire taxonomic range and the taxon specific ortholog tables for each taxon. However, this approach has a drawback in that the standard ortholog table contains only genes that are conserved in the representative genomes. To address this problem, we developed a stepwise procedure to construct ortholog tables hierarchically in a bottom-up manner. By using this approach, the new standard ortholog table now covers the entire gene repertoire stored in MBGD. In addition, we have enhanced several functionalities, including rapid and flexible keyword searching, profile-based sequence searching for orthology assignment to a user query sequence, and displaying a phylogenetic tree of each taxon based on the concatenated core gene sequences.

Additional sequencing from diverse African populations and the construction of African-specific reference genomes is needed to better characterize the full spectrum of variation in humans. However, sequencing alone is insufficient to address the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying variable phenotypes and disease risks.

Identification of Protein Secretion Systems in Bacterial Genomes Using MacSyFinder Version 2,"Protein secretion systems are complex molecular machineries that translocate proteins through the outer membrane and sometimes through multiple other barriers. They have evolved by co-option of components from other envelope-associated cellular machineries, making them sometimes difficult to identify and discriminate. Here, we describe how to identify protein secretion systems in bacterial genomes using the MacSyFinder program. This flexible computational tool uses the knowledge gathered from experimental studies to identify homologous systems in genome data. It can be used with a set of predefined MacSyFinder models, ""TXSScan,"" to identify all major secretion systems of diderm bacteria (i.e., with inner and LPS-containing outer membranes) as well as evolutionarily related cell appendages (pili and flagella). For this, it identifies and clusters co-localized genes encoding proteins of secretion systems using sequence similarity search with Hidden Markov Model (HMM) protein profiles. Finally, it checks if the clusters' genetic content and genomic organization satisfy the constraints of the model. TXSScan models can be altered in the command line or customized to search for variants of known secretion systems. Models can also be built from scratch to identify novel systems. In this chapter, we describe a complete pipeline of analysis, starting from (i) the integration of information from a reference set of experimentally studied systems, (ii) the identification of conserved proteins and the construction of their HMM protein profiles, (iii) the definition and optimization of ""macsy-models,"" and (iv) their use and online distribution as tools to search genomic data for secretion systems of interest.

PROMO: an interactive tool for analyzing clinically-labeled multi-omic cancer datasets,"Background:Analysis of large genomic datasets along with their accompanying clinical information has shown great promise in cancer research over the last decade. Such datasets typically include thousands of samples, each measured by one or several high-throughput technologies ('omics') and annotated with extensive clinical information. While instrumental for fulfilling the promise of personalized medicine, the analysis and visualization of such large datasets is challenging and necessitates programming skills and familiarity with a large array of software tools to be used for the various steps of the analysis.Results:We developed PROMO (Profiler of Multi-Omic data), a friendly, fully interactive stand-alone software for analyzing large genomic cancer datasets together with their associated clinical information. The tool provides an array of built-in methods and algorithms for importing, preprocessing, visualizing, clustering, clinical label enrichment testing, and survival analysis that can be performed on a single or multi-omic dataset. The tool can be used for quick exploration and stratification of tumor samples taken from patients into clinically significant molecular subtypes. Identification of prognostic biomarkers and generation of simple subtype classifiers are additional important features. We review PROMO's main features and demonstrate its analysis capabilities on a breast cancer cohort from TCGA.Conclusions:PROMO provides a single integrated solution for swiftly performing a complete analysis of cancer genomic data for subtype discovery and biomarker identification without writing a single line of code, and can, therefore, make the analysis of these data much easier for cancer biologists and biomedical researchers.

SeqMule: automated pipeline for analysis of human exome/genome sequencing data,"Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology has greatly helped us identify disease-contributory variants for Mendelian diseases. However, users are often faced with issues such as software compatibility, complicated configuration, and no access to high-performance computing facility. Discrepancies exist among aligners and variant callers. We developed a computational pipeline, SeqMule, to perform automated variant calling from NGS data on human genomes and exomes. SeqMule integrates computational-cluster-free parallelization capability built on top of the variant callers, and facilitates normalization/intersection of variant calls to generate consensus set with high confidence. SeqMule integrates 5 alignment tools, 5 variant calling algorithms and accepts various combinations all by one-line command, therefore allowing highly flexible yet fully automated variant calling. In a modern machine (2 Intel Xeon X5650 CPUs, 48 GB memory), when fast turn-around is needed, SeqMule generates annotated VCF files in a day from a 30X whole-genome sequencing data set; when more accurate calling is needed, SeqMule generates consensus call set that improves over single callers, as measured by both Mendelian error rate and consistency.

Analysis of transcriptomics and metabolomics data revealed that LJO primarily altered the endocrine and digestive systems, signal transduction, and lipid metabolism. It led to a decrease in palmitic acid levels and an increase in glutathione levels. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay suggested that LJO upregulated Irs1 expression, consequently reducing insulin resistance. These findings strongly suggest that LJO holds promise in ameliorating T2DM and may serve as a potential dietary supplement for patients with T2DM.",38134985,,10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2023.128853,1,International journal of biological macromolecules,7909578,8.025
ArrayExpress update--simplifying data submissions,"The ArrayExpress Archive of Functional Genomics Data (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress) is an international functional genomics database at the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) recommended by most journals as a repository for data supporting peer-reviewed publications. It contains data from over 7000 public sequencing and 42,000 array-based studies comprising over 1.5 million assays in total. The proportion of sequencing-based submissions has grown significantly over the last few years and has doubled in the last 18 months, whilst the rate of microarray submissions is growing slightly. All data in ArrayExpress are available in the MAGE-TAB format, which allows robust linking to data analysis and visualization tools and standardized analysis. The main development over the last two years has been the release of a new data submission tool Annotare, which has reduced the average submission time almost 3-fold. In the near future, Annotare will become the only submission route into ArrayExpress, alongside MAGE-TAB format-based pipelines. ArrayExpress is a stable and highly accessed resource. Our future tasks include automation of data flows and further integration with other EMBL-EBI resources for the representation of multi-omics data.",25361974,PMC4383899,10.1093/nar/gku1057,386,Nucleic acids research,411011,19.16
"A high-risk, Double-Hit, group of newly diagnosed myeloma identified by genomic analysis","Patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) with high-risk disease are in need of new treatment strategies to improve the outcomes. Multiple clinical, cytogenetic, or gene expression features have been used to identify high-risk patients, each of which has significant weaknesses. Inclusion of molecular features into risk stratification could resolve the current challenges. In a genome-wide analysis of the largest set of molecular and clinical data established to date from NDMM, as part of the Myeloma Genome Project, we have defined DNA drivers of aggressive clinical behavior. Whole-genome and exome data from 1273 NDMM patients identified genetic factors that contribute significantly to progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) (cumulative R2= 18.4% and 25.2%, respectively). Integrating DNA drivers and clinical data into a Cox model using 784 patients with ISS, age, PFS, OS, and genomic data, the model has a cumlative R2of 34.3% for PFS and 46.5% for OS. A high-risk subgroup was defined by recursive partitioning using either a) bi-allelic TP53 inactivation or b) amplification (≥4 copies) of CKS1B (1q21) on the background of International Staging System III, comprising 6.1% of the population (median PFS = 15.4 months; OS = 20.7 months) that was validated in an independent dataset. Double-Hit patients have a dire prognosis despite modern therapies and should be considered for novel therapeutic approaches.",29967379,PMC6326953,10.1038/s41375-018-0196-8,194,Leukemia,8704895,12.883
Genomic context sensitivity of insulator function,"The specificity of interactions between genomic regulatory elements and potential target genes is influenced by the binding of insulator proteins such as CTCF, which can act as potent enhancer blockers when interposed between an enhancer and a promoter in a reporter assay. But not all CTCF sites genome-wide function as insulator elements, depending on cellular and genomic context. To dissect the influence of genomic context on enhancer blocker activity, we integrated reporter constructs with promoter-only, promoter and enhancer, and enhancer blocker configurations at hundreds of thousands of genomic sites using theSleeping Beautytransposase. Deconvolution of reporter activity by genomic position reveals distinct expression patterns subject to genomic context, including a compartment of enhancer blocker reporter integrations with robust expression. The high density of integration sites permits quantitative delineation of characteristic genomic context sensitivity profiles and their decomposition into sensitivity to both local and distant DNase I hypersensitive sites. Furthermore, using a single-cell expression approach to test the effect of integrated reporters for differential expression of nearby endogenous genes reveals that CTCF insulator elements do not completely abrogate reporter effects on endogenous gene expression. Collectively, our results lend new insight into genomic regulatory compartmentalization and its influence on the determinants of promoter-enhancer specificity.",35082140,PMC8896466,10.1101/gr.276449.121,9,Genome research,9518021,9.438
Metabolome and microbiome multi-omics integration from a murine lung inflammation model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia,"Background:Respiratory tract microbial dysbiosis can exacerbate inflammation and conversely inflammation may cause dysbiosis. Dysbiotic microbiome metabolites may lead to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Hyperoxia and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) interaction alters lung microbiome and metabolome, mediating BPD lung injury sequence.Methods:C57BL6/J mice were exposed to 21% (normoxia) or 70% (hyperoxia) oxygen during postnatal days (PND) 1-14. Pups were injected with LPS (6 mg/kg) or equal PBS volume, intraperitoneally on PND 3, 5, and 7. At PND14, the lungs were collected for microbiome and metabolomic analyses (n = 5/group).Results:Microbiome alpha and beta diversity were similar between groups. Metabolic changes included hyperoxia 31 up/18 down, LPS 7 up/4 down, exposure interaction 8. Hyperoxia increased Intestinimonas abundance, whereas LPS decreased Clostridiales, Dorea, and Intestinimonas; exposure interaction affected Blautia. Differential co-expression analysis on multi-omics data identified exposure-altered modules. Hyperoxia metabolomics response was integrated with a published matching transcriptome, identifying four induced genes (ALDOA, GAA, NEU1, RENBP), which positively correlated with BPD severity in a published human newborn cohort.Conclusions:We report hyperoxia and LPS lung microbiome and metabolome signatures in a clinically relevant BPD model. We identified four genes correlating with BPD status in preterm infants that are promising targets for therapy and prevention.Impact:Using multi-omics, we identified and correlated key biomarkers of hyperoxia and LPS on murine lung micro-landscape and examined their potential clinical implication, which shows strong clinical relevance for future research. Using a double-hit model of clinical relevance to bronchopulmonary dysplasia, we are the first to report integrated metabolomic/microbiome landscape changes and identify novel disease biomarker candidates.",35338351,PMC9509498,10.1038/s41390-022-02002-1,4,Pediatric research,100714,3.953
Multi-Omics Data Integration Reveals Key Variables Contributing to Subgingival Microbiome Dysbiosis-Induced Inflammatory Response in a Hyperglycemic Microenvironment,"Subgingival microbiome dysbiosis promotes the development of periodontitis, an irreversible chronic inflammatory disease associated with metabolic diseases. However, studies regarding the effects of a hyperglycemic microenvironment on host-microbiome interactions and host inflammatory response during periodontitis are still scarce. Here, we investigated the impacts of a hyperglycemic microenvironment on the inflammatory response and transcriptome of a gingival coculture model stimulated with dysbiotic subgingival microbiomes. HGF-1 cells overlaid with U937 macrophage-like cells were stimulated with subgingival microbiomes collected from four healthy donors and four patients with periodontitis. Pro-inflammatory cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases were measured while the coculture RNA was submitted to a microarray analysis. Subgingival microbiomes were submitted to 16s rRNA gene sequencing. Data were analyzed using an advanced multi-omics bioinformatic data integration model. Our results show that the geneskrt76,krt27,pnma5,mansc4,rab41,thoc6,tm6sf2, andznf506as well as the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, GM-CSF, FGF2, IL-10, the metalloproteinases MMP3 and MMP8, and bacteria from the ASV 105, ASV 211, ASV 299,Prevotella,CampylobacterandFretibacteriumgenera are key intercorrelated variables contributing to periodontitis-induced inflammatory response in a hyperglycemic microenvironment.

Development of Phylodynamic Methods for Bacterial Pathogens,"Phylodynamic methods have been essential to understand the interplay between the evolution and epidemiology of infectious diseases. To date, the field has centered on viruses. Bacterial pathogens are seldom analyzed under such phylodynamic frameworks, due to their complex genome evolution and, until recently, a paucity of whole-genome sequence data sets with rich associated metadata. We posit that the increasing availability of bacterial genomes and epidemiological data means that the field is now ripe to lay the foundations for applying phylodynamics to bacterial pathogens. The development of new methods that integrate more complex genomic and ecological data will help to inform public heath surveillance and control strategies for bacterial pathogens that represent serious threats to human health.",33736902,,10.1016/j.tim.2021.02.008,15,Trends in microbiology,9310916,18.23
Multi-omics atlas of combinatorial abiotic stress responses in wheat,"Field-grown crops rarely experience growth conditions in which yield can be maximized. Environmental stresses occur in combination, with advancements in crop tolerance further complicated by its polygenic nature. Strategic targeting of causal genes is required to meet future crop production needs. Here, we employed a systems biology approach in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) to investigate physio-metabolic adjustments and transcriptome reprogramming involved in acclimations to heat, drought, salinity and all combinations therein. A significant shift in magnitude and complexity of plant response was evident across stress scenarios based on the agronomic losses, increased proline concentrations and 8.7-fold increase in unique differentially expressed transcripts (DETs) observed under the triple stress condition. Transcriptome data from all stress treatments were assembled into an online, open access eFP browser for visualizing gene expression during abiotic stress. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis revealed 152 hub genes of which 32% contained the ethylene-responsive element binding factor-associated amphiphilic repression (EAR) transcriptional repression motif. Cross-referencing against the 31 DETs common to all stress treatments isolated TaWRKY33 as a leading candidate for greater plant tolerance to combinatorial stresses. Integration of our findings with available literature on gene functional characterization allowed us to further suggest flexible gene combinations for future adaptive gene stacking in wheat. Our approach demonstrates the strength of robust multi-omics-based data resources for gene discovery in complex environmental conditions. Accessibility of such datasets will promote cross-validation of candidate genes across studies and aid in accelerating causal gene validation for crop resiliency.",37248640,,10.1111/tpj.16332,2,The Plant journal : for cell and molecular biology,9207397,7.091
Integrated next-generation sequencing analysis of whole exome and 409 cancer-related genes,"The use of next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques to analyze the genomes of cancer cells has identified numerous genomic alterations, including single-base substitutions, small insertions and deletions, amplification, recombination, and epigenetic modifications. NGS contributes to the clinical management of patients as well as new discoveries that identify the mechanisms of tumorigenesis. Moreover, analysis of gene panels targeting actionable mutations enhances efforts to optimize the selection of chemotherapeutic regimens. However, whole genome sequencing takes several days and costs at least $10,000, depending on sequence coverage. Therefore, laboratories with relatively limited resources must employ a more economical approach. For this purpose, we conducted an integrated nucleotide sequence analysis of a panel of 409-cancer related genes (409-CRG) combined with whole exome sequencing (WES). Analysis of the 409-CRG panel detected low-frequency variants with high sensitivity, and WES identified moderate and high frequency somatic variants as well as germline variants.",28003584,,10.2220/biomedres.37.367,14,"Biomedical research (Tokyo, Japan)",8100317,2.964
What's in a genome? The C-value enigma and the evolution of eukaryotic genome content,"Some notable exceptions aside, eukaryotic genomes are distinguished from those of Bacteria and Archaea in a number of ways, including chromosome structure and number, repetitive DNA content, and the presence of introns in protein-coding regions. One of the most notable differences between eukaryotic and prokaryotic genomes is in size. Unlike their prokaryotic counterparts, eukaryotes exhibit enormous (more than 60,000-fold) variability in genome size which is not explained by differences in gene number. Genome size is known to correlate with cell size and division rate, and by extension with numerous organism-level traits such as metabolism, developmental rate or body size. Less well described are the relationships between genome size and other properties of the genome, such as gene content, transposable element content, base pair composition and related features. The rapid expansion of 'complete' genome sequencing projects has, for the first time, made it possible to examine these relationships across a wide range of eukaryotes in order to shed new light on the causes and correlates of genome size diversity. This study presents the results of phylogenetically informed comparisons of genome data for more than 500 species of eukaryotes. Several relationships are described between genome size and other genomic parameters, and some recommendations are presented for how these insights can be extended even more broadly in the future.",26323762,PMC4571570,10.1098/rstb.2014.0331,100,"Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London.

Multi-Platform Omics Analysis Reveals Molecular Signatures for Pathogenesis and Activity of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex autoimmune disease with heterogeneous clinical manifestations and the pathogenesis of SLE is still unclear. Various omics results have been reported for SLE, but the molecular hallmarks of SLE, especially in patients with different disease activity, using an integrated multi-omics approach have not been fully investigated. Here, we collected blood samples from 10 healthy controls (HCs) and 40 SLE patients with different clinical activity including inactive (IA), low activity (LA), and high activity (HA). Using an integrative analysis of proteomic, metabolomic and lipidomic profiles, we report the multi-omics landscape for SLE. The molecular changes suggest that both the complement system and the inflammatory response were activated in SLEs and were associated with disease activity. Additionally, activation of the immunoglobulin mediated immune response were observed in the LA stage of the disease, however this immune response was suppressed slightly in the HA stage. Finally, an imbalance in lipid metabolism, especially in sphingolipid metabolism, accompanied with dysregulated apolipoproteins were observed to contribute to the disease activity of SLE. The multi-omics data presented in this study and the characterization of peripheral blood from SLE patients may thus help provide important clues regarding the pathogenesis of SLE.",35514958,PMC9063006,10.3389/fimmu.2022.833699,10,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,8.786
"When ""Nof 2"" is not enough: integrating statistical and functional data in gene discovery","The expanding use of genomic sequencing promises to improve clinical diagnostics and to drive the discovery of new disease genes. Candidate genes are increasingly being identified through recurrent cases (e.g., two or more independent cases [""Nof 2""] in which variants are present in the same gene). These second case hits provide statistical evidence of an association, which may then be combined with functional validation or familial segregation studies to bolster the evidence that a gene is truly causal. Here, we discuss how to integrate different forms of functional evidence with human genetics case and segregation data to improve the significance of new disease-gene associations.",28487880,PMC5411689,10.1101/mcs.a001099,1,Cold Spring Harbor molecular case studies,101660017,0.0
Identifying Conjugative Plasmids and Integrative Conjugative Elements with CONJscan,"We present a computational method to identify conjugative systems in plasmids and chromosomes using the CONJscan module of MacSyFinder. The method relies on the identification of the protein components of the system using hidden Markov model profiles and then checking that the composition and genetic organization of the system is consistent with that expected from a conjugative system. The method can be assessed online using the Galaxy workflow or locally using a standalone software. The latter version allows to modify the models of the module (i.e., to change the expected components, their number, and their organization).CONJscan identifies conjugative systems, but when the mobile genetic element is integrative (ICE), one often also wants to delimit it from the chromosome. We present a method, with a script, to use the results of CONJscan and comparative genomics to delimit ICE in chromosomes. The method provides a visual representation of the ICE location. Together, these methods facilitate the identification of conjugative elements in bacterial genomes.",31584169,,10.1007/978-1-4939-9877-7_19,27,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,0.0
"DNA-, RNA-, and Protein-Based Stable-Isotope Probing for High-Throughput Biomarker Analysis of Active Microorganisms","Stable-isotope probing (SIP) enables researchers to target active populations within complex microbial communities, which is achieved by providing growth substrates enriched in heavy isotopes, usually in the form of13C,18O, or15N. After growth on the substrate and subsequent extraction of microbial biomarkers, typically nucleic acids or proteins, the SIP technique is used for the recovery and analysis of isotope-labeled biomarkers from active microbial populations. In the years following the initial development of DNA- and RNA-based SIP, it was common practice to characterize labeled populations by targeted gene analysis. Such approaches usually involved fingerprint-based analyses or sequencing of clone libraries containing 16S rRNA genes or functional marker gene amplicons. Although molecular fingerprinting remains a valuable approach for rapid confirmation of isotope labeling, recent advances in sequencing technology mean that it is possible to obtain affordable and comprehensive amplicon profiles, metagenomes, or metatranscriptomes from SIP experiments. Not only can the abundance of microbial groups be inferred from metagenomes, but researchers can bin, assemble, and explore individual genomes to build hypotheses about the metabolic capabilities of labeled microorganisms. Analysis of labeled mRNA is a more recent advance that can provide independent metatranscriptome-based analysis of active microorganisms. The power of metatranscriptomics is that mRNA abundance often correlates closely with the corresponding activity of encoded enzymes, thus providing insight into microbial metabolism at the time of sampling. Together, these advances have improved the sensitivity of SIP methods and allow the use of labeled substrates at ecologically relevant concentrations. Particularly as methods improve and costs continue to drop, we expect that the integration of SIP with multiple omics-based methods will become prevalent components of microbial ecology studies, leading to further breakthroughs in our understanding of novel microbial populations and elucidation of the metabolic function of complex microbial communities. In this chapter we provide protocols for obtaining labeled DNA, RNA, and proteins that can be used for downstream omics-based analyses.",27900684,,10.1007/978-1-4939-6691-2_5,4,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,0.0
Threatened Species Initiative: Empowering conservation action using genomic resources,"Globally, 15,521 animal species are listed as threatened by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, and of these less than 3% have genomic resources that can inform conservation management. To combat this, global genome initiatives are developing genomic resources, yet production of a reference genome alone does not conserve a species. The reference genome allows us to develop a suite of tools to understand both genome-wide and functional diversity within and between species. Conservation practitioners can use these tools to inform their decision-making. But, at present there is an implementation gap between the release of genome information and the use of genomic data in applied conservation by conservation practitioners. In May 2020, we launched the Threatened Species Initiative and brought a consortium of genome biologists, population biologists, bioinformaticians, population geneticists, and ecologists together with conservation agencies across Australia, including government, zoos, and nongovernment organizations. Our objective is to create a foundation of genomic data to advance our understanding of key Australian threatened species, and ultimately empower conservation practitioners to access and apply genomic data to their decision-making processes through a web-based portal. Currently, we are developing genomic resources for 61 threatened species from a range of taxa, across Australia, with more than 130 collaborators from government, academia, and conservation organizations. Developed in direct consultation with government threatened-species managers and other conservation practitioners, herein we present our framework for meeting their needs and our systematic approach to integrating genomics into threatened species recovery.",35042806,PMC8795520,10.1073/pnas.2115643118,16,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,12.779

Cuproptosis-related lncRNAs ovarian cancer: Multi-omics analysis of molecular mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets,"Ovarian cancer (OV) is an aggressive malignancy that poses a significant threat to the health and lives of women. Cuproptosis is a newly discovered form of programmed cell death that offers a promising therapeutic target, although its significance in cancer progression remains uncertain. In this study, we established a prognostic model of OV with six cuproptosis-related long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), including CTC.246B18.8, LINC00337, RP11.568N6.1, RP11.158I9.8, RP11.678G14.3 and CYP4F26P, based on the data of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Lower risk scores were associated with favorable prognosis. In addition, a negative outcome was associated with high expression of CTC.246B18.8. According to the ESTIMATE algorithm, CTC.246B18.8 was negatively correlated with the ImmuneScore, and positively with immune checkpoints, immune cell infiltration, and tumor mutation burden (TMB). Moreover, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed that pathways related to immunosuppression are likely activated in response to CTC-246B18.8 overexpression. Furthermore, CTC-246B18.8 expression was also associated with the sensitivity to various chemotherapy drugs. The expression patterns of the above lncRNAs were verified in ovarian tumor cell lines (SK-OV-3, COC1, and A2780) and normal ovarian epithelial cells (IOSE - 80). Six cuproptosis-related genes (CRGs), including ATP7B, MTF1, SLC31A1, DLD, ATP7A and DLAT, were differentially expressed between CTC-246B18.8highand CTC-246B18.8lowpatient groups, and exhibited organ-specific expression patterns pan-cancer. Small molecule drugs that target these CRGs were predicted, and potential candidates included DIAMIDE, bathocuproine disulfonate, D-penicillamine, etc. To summarize, our findings provide molecular insights into the role of cuproptosis in OV, and the signature lncRNAs and CRGs should be investigated further as immunotherapy biomarkers of OV.",38019212,,10.1002/tox.24067,0,Environmental toxicology,100885357,4.109
"Guidelines for bioinformatics of single-cell sequencing data analysis in Alzheimer's disease: review, recommendation, implementation and application","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, characterized by progressive cognitive impairment and neurodegeneration. Extensive clinical and genomic studies have revealed biomarkers, risk factors, pathways, and targets of AD in the past decade. However, the exact molecular basis of AD development and progression remains elusive. The emerging single-cell sequencing technology can potentially provide cell-level insights into the disease. Here we systematically review the state-of-the-art bioinformatics approaches to analyze single-cell sequencing data and their applications to AD in 14 major directions, including 1) quality control and normalization, 2) dimension reduction and feature extraction, 3) cell clustering analysis, 4) cell type inference and annotation, 5) differential expression, 6) trajectory inference, 7) copy number variation analysis, 8) integration of single-cell multi-omics, 9) epigenomic analysis, 10) gene network inference, 11) prioritization of cell subpopulations, 12) integrative analysis of human and mouse sc-RNA-seq data, 13) spatial transcriptomics, and 14) comparison of single cell AD mouse model studies and single cell human AD studies. We also address challenges in using human postmortem and mouse tissues and outline future developments in single cell sequencing data analysis. Importantly, we have implemented our recommended workflow for each major analytic direction and applied them to a large single nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) dataset in AD. Key analytic results are reported while the scripts and the data are shared with the research community through GitHub. In summary, this comprehensive review provides insights into various approaches to analyze single cell sequencing data and offers specific guidelines for study design and a variety of analytic directions.

High-density genetic linkage mapping in Sitka spruce advances the integration of genomic resources in conifers,"In species with large and complex genomes such as conifers, dense linkage maps are a useful resource for supporting genome assembly and laying the genomic groundwork at the structural, populational, and functional levels. However, most of the 600+ extant conifer species still lack extensive genotyping resources, which hampers the development of high-density linkage maps. In this study, we developed a linkage map relying on 21,570 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers in Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis [Bong.] Carr.), a long-lived conifer from western North America that is widely planted for productive forestry in the British Isles. We used a single-step mapping approach to efficiently combine RAD-seq and genotyping array SNP data for 528 individuals from 2 full-sib families. As expected for spruce taxa, the saturated map contained 12 linkages groups with a total length of 2,142 cM. The positioning of 5,414 unique gene coding sequences allowed us to compare our map with that of other Pinaceae species, which provided evidence for high levels of synteny and gene order conservation in this family. We then developed an integrated map for P. sitchensis and Picea glauca based on 27,052 markers and 11,609 gene sequences. Altogether, these 2 linkage maps, the accompanying catalog of 286,159 SNPs and the genotyping chip developed, herein, open new perspectives for a variety of fundamental and more applied research objectives, such as for the improvement of spruce genome assemblies, or for marker-assisted sustainable management of genetic resources in Sitka spruce and related species.",38366548,PMC10989875,10.1093/g3journal/jkae020,0,"G3 (Bethesda, Md.)",101566598,3.542
Integrating networks and comparative genomics reveals retroelement proliferation dynamics in hominid genomes,"Retroelements (REs) are mobile DNA sequences that multiply and spread throughout genomes by a copy-and-paste mechanism. These parasitic elements are active in diverse genomes, from yeast to humans, where they promote diversity, cause disease, and accelerate evolution. Because of their high copy number and sequence similarity, studying their activity and tracking their proliferation dynamics is a challenge. It is particularly difficult to pinpoint the few REs in a genome that are still active in the haystack of degenerate and suppressed elements. We develop a computational framework based on network theory that tracks the path of RE proliferation throughout evolution. We analyze SVA (SINE-VNTR-Alu), the youngest RE family in human genomes, to understand RE dynamics across hominids. Integrating comparative genomics and network tools enables us to track the course of SVA proliferation, identify yet unknown active communities, and detect tentative ""master REs"" that played key roles in SVA propagation, providing strong support for the fundamental ""master gene"" model of RE proliferation. The method is generic and thus can be applied to REs of any of the thousands of available genomes to identify active RE communities and master REs that were pivotal in the evolution of their host genomes.",29043294,PMC5640379,10.1126/sciadv.1701256,12,Science advances,101653440,14.957
Integration of DNA methylation and gene transcription across nineteen cell types reveals cell type-specific and genomic region-dependent regulatory patterns,"Despite numerous studies done on understanding the role of DNA methylation, limited work has focused on systems integration of cell type-specific interplay between DNA methylation and gene transcription. Through a genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation across 19 cell types with T-47D as reference, we identified 106,252 cell type-specific differentially-methylated CpGs categorized into 7,537 differentially (46.6% hyper- and 53.4% hypo-) methylated regions. We found 44% promoter regions and 75% CpG islands were T-47D cell type-specific methylated. Pyrosequencing experiments validated the cell type-specific methylation across three benchmark cell lines. Interestingly, these DMRs overlapped with 1,145 known tumor suppressor genes. We then developed a Bayesian Gaussian Regression model to measure the relationship among DNA methylation, genomic segment distribution, differential gene expression and tumor suppressor gene status. The model uncovered that 3'UTR methylation has much less impact on transcriptional activity than other regions. Integration of DNA methylation and 82 transcription factor binding information across the 19 cell types suggested diverse interplay patterns between the two regulators. Our integrative analysis reveals cell type-specific and genomic region-dependent regulatory patterns and provides a perspective for integrating hundreds of various omics-seq data together.",28620196,PMC5472622,10.1038/s41598-017-03837-z,13,Scientific reports,101563288,4.996
"An integrative, genomic, transcriptomic and network-assisted study to identify genes associated with human cleft lip with or without cleft palate","Background:Cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL/P) is one of the most common congenital human birth defects. A combination of genetic and epidemiology studies has contributed to a better knowledge of CL/P-associated candidate genes and environmental risk factors. However, the etiology of CL/P remains not fully understood. In this study, to identify new CL/P-associated genes, we conducted an integrative analysis using our in-house network tools, dmGWAS [dense module search for Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS)] and EW_dmGWAS (Edge-Weighted dmGWAS), in a combination with GWAS data, the human protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, and differential gene expression profiles.Results:A total of 87 genes were consistently detected in both European and Asian ancestries in dmGWAS. There were 31.0% (27/87) showed nominal significance with CL/P (gene-based p < 0.05), with three genes showing strong association signals, including KIAA1598, GPR183, and ZMYND11 (p < 1 × 10- 3). In EW_dmGWAS, we identified 253 and 245 module genes associated with CL/P for European ancestry and the Asian ancestry, respectively. Functional enrichment analysis demonstrated that these genes were involved in cell adhesion, protein localization to the plasma membrane, the regulation of the apoptotic signaling pathway, and other pathological conditions. A small proportion of genes (5.1% for European ancestry; 2.4% for Asian ancestry) had prior evidence in CL/P as annotated in CleftGeneDB database. Our analysis highlighted nine novel CL/P candidate genes (BRD1, CREBBP, CSK, DNM1L, LOR, PTPN18, SND1, TGS1, and VIM) and 17 previously reported genes in the top modules.Conclusions:The genes identified through superimposing GWAS signals and differential gene expression profiles onto human PPI network, as well as their functional features, helped our understanding of the etiology of CL/P. Our multi-omics integrative analyses revealed nine novel candidate genes involved in CL/P.",32241273,PMC7118807,10.1186/s12920-020-0675-4,13,BMC medical genomics,101319628,3.622
Adversarial and variational autoencoders improve metagenomic binning,"Assembly of reads from metagenomic samples is a hard problem, often resulting in highly fragmented genome assemblies. Metagenomic binning allows us to reconstruct genomes by re-grouping the sequences by their organism of origin, thus representing a crucial processing step when exploring the biological diversity of metagenomic samples. Here we present Adversarial Autoencoders for Metagenomics Binning (AAMB), an ensemble deep learning approach that integrates sequence co-abundances and tetranucleotide frequencies into a common denoised space that enables precise clustering of sequences into microbial genomes. When benchmarked, AAMB presented similar or better results compared with the state-of-the-art reference-free binner VAMB, reconstructing ~7% more near-complete (NC) genomes across simulated and real data. In addition, genomes reconstructed using AAMB had higher completeness and greater taxonomic diversity compared with VAMB. Finally, we implemented a pipeline Integrating VAMB and AAMB that enabled improved binning, recovering 20% and 29% more simulated and real NC genomes, respectively, compared to VAMB, with moderate additional runtime.",37865678,PMC10590447,10.1038/s42003-023-05452-3,3,Communications biology,101719179,6.548
Identification of target proteins for breast cancer genetic risk loci and blood risk biomarkers in a large study by integrating genomic and proteomic data,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified around 200 loci associated with breast cancer risk. However, protein targets for these loci remain largely unknown. Identifying protein targets and biomarkers can improve the understanding of cancer biology and etiology and identify high-risk individuals for cancer prevention. In this study, we investigated genetically predicted levels of 1142 circulating proteins with breast cancer risk in 133 384 cases and 113 789 controls of European ancestry included in the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC). We identified 22 blood protein biomarkers associated with the risk of overall breast cancer at a false discovery rate (FDR) <0.05, including nine proteins encoded by genes located at least 500 kb away from previously reported risk variants for breast cancer. Analyses focusing on 124 encoding genes located at GWAS-identified breast cancer risk loci found 20 proteins associated with overall breast cancer risk and one protein associated with triple-negative breast cancer risk at FDR <0.05. Adjustment for the GWAS-identified risk variants significantly attenuated the association for 13 of these proteins, suggesting that these proteins may be the targets of these GWAS-identified risk loci. The identified proteins are involved in various biological processes, including glutathione conjugation, STAT5 signaling and NF-κB signaling pathways. Our study identified novel protein targets and risk biomarkers for breast cancer risk.",36779764,,10.1002/ijc.34472,1,International journal of cancer,42124,7.316
Sequence-Based Synteny Analysis of Multiple Large Genomes,"Current methods for synteny analysis provide only limited support to study large genomes at the sequence level. In this chapter, we describe a pipeline based on existing tools that, applied in a suitable fashion, enables synteny analysis of large genomic datasets. We give a hands-on description of each step of the pipeline using four avian genomes for data. We also provide integration scripts that simplify the conversion and setup of data between the different tools in the pipeline.",29277871,,10.1007/978-1-4939-7463-4_11,0,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,0.0
"GMAP and GSNAP for Genomic Sequence Alignment: Enhancements to Speed, Accuracy, and Functionality","The programs GMAP and GSNAP, for aligning RNA-Seq and DNA-Seq datasets to genomes, have evolved along with advances in biological methodology to handle longer reads, larger volumes of data, and new types of biological assays. The genomic representation has been improved to include linear genomes that can compare sequences using single-instruction multiple-data (SIMD) instructions, compressed genomic hash tables with fast access using SIMD instructions, handling of large genomes with more than four billion bp, and enhanced suffix arrays (ESAs) with novel data structures for fast access. Improvements to the algorithms have included a greedy match-and-extend algorithm using suffix arrays, segment chaining using genomic hash tables, diagonalization using segmental hash tables, and nucleotide-level dynamic programming procedures that use SIMD instructions and eliminate the need for F-loop calculations. Enhancements to the functionality of the programs include standardization of indel positions, handling of ambiguous splicing, clipping and merging of overlapping paired-end reads, and alignments to circular chromosomes and alternate scaffolds. The programs have been adapted for use in pipelines by integrating their usage into R/Bioconductor packages such as gmapR and HTSeqGenie, and these pipelines have facilitated the discovery of numerous biological phenomena.",27008021,,10.1007/978-1-4939-3578-9_15,189,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,0.0
Integration of genomic copy number variations and chemotherapy-response biomarkers in pediatric sarcoma,"Background:While most pediatric sarcomas respond to front-line therapy, some bone sarcomas do not show radiographic response like soft-tissue sarcomas (rhabdomyosarccomas) but do show 90% necrosis. Though, new therapies are urgently needed to improve survival and quality of life in pediatric patients with sarcomas. Complex chromosomal aberrations such as amplifications and deletions of DNA sequences are frequently observed in pediatric sarcomas. Evaluation of copy number variations (CNVs) associated with pediatric sarcoma patients at the time of diagnosis or following therapy offers an opportunity to assess dysregulated molecular targets and signaling pathways that may drive sarcoma development, progression, or relapse. The objective of this study was to utilize publicly available data sets to identify potential predictive biomarkers of chemotherapeutic response in pediatric Osteosarcoma (OS), Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) and Ewing's Sarcoma Family of Tumors (ESFTs) based on CNVs following chemotherapy (OS n = 117, RMS n = 64, ESFTs n = 25 tumor biopsies).Methods:There were 206 CNV profiles derived from pediatric sarcoma biopsies collected from the public databases TARGET and NCBI-Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Through our comparative genomic analyses of OS, RMS, and ESFTs and 22,255 healthy individuals called from the Database of Genomic Variants (DGV), we identified CNVs (amplifications and deletions) pattern of genomic instability in these pediatric sarcomas. By integrating CNVs of Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) identified in the pool of genes with drug-response data from sarcoma cell lines (n = 27) from Cancer Therapeutics Response Portal (CTRP) Version 2, potential predictive biomarkers of therapeutic response were identified.Results:Genes associated with survival and/recurrence of these sarcomas with statistical significance were found on long arm of chromosome 8 and smaller aberrations were also identified at chromosomes 1q, 12q and x in OS, RMS, and ESFTs. A pool of 63 genes that harbored amplifications and/or deletions were frequently associated with recurrence across OS, RMS, and ESFTs. Correlation analysis of CNVs from CCLE with drug-response data of CTRP in 27 sarcoma cell lines, 33 CNVs out of 63 genes correlated with either sensitivity or resistance to 17 chemotherapies from which actionable CNV signatures such as IGF1R, MYC, MAPK1, ATF1, and MDM2 were identified. These CNV signatures could potentially be used to delineate patient populations that will respond versus those that will not respond to a particular chemotherapy.Conclusions:The large-scale analyses of CNV-drug screening provides a platform to evaluate genetic alterations across aggressive pediatric sarcomas. Additionally, this study provides novel insights into the potential utilization of CNVs as not only prognostic but also as predictive biomarkers of therapeutic response. Information obtained in this study may help guide and prioritize patient-specific therapeutic options in pediatric bone and soft-tissue sarcomas.",30704460,PMC6357363,10.1186/s12920-018-0456-5,23,BMC medical genomics,101319628,3.622
Machine learning for data integration in human gut microbiome,"Recent studies have demonstrated that gut microbiota plays critical roles in various human diseases. High-throughput technology has been widely applied to characterize the microbial ecosystems, which led to an explosion of different types of molecular profiling data, such as metagenomics, metatranscriptomics and metabolomics. For analysis of such data, machine learning algorithms have shown to be useful for identifying key molecular signatures, discovering potential patient stratifications, and particularly for generating models that can accurately predict phenotypes. In this review, we first discuss how dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota is linked to human disease development and how potential modulation strategies of the gut microbial ecosystem can be used for disease treatment. In addition, we introduce categories and workflows of different machine learning approaches, and how they can be used to perform integrative analysis of multi-omics data. Finally, we review advances of machine learning in gut microbiome applications and discuss related challenges. Based on this we conclude that machine learning is very well suited for analysis of gut microbiome and that these approaches can be useful for development of gut microbe-targeted therapies, which ultimately can help in achieving personalized and precision medicine.",36419034,PMC9685977,10.1186/s12934-022-01973-4,12,Microbial cell factories,101139812,6.352
Network analyses in microbiome based on high-throughput multi-omics data,"Together with various hosts and environments, ubiquitous microbes interact closely with each other forming an intertwined system or community. Of interest, shifts of the relationships between microbes and their hosts or environments are associated with critical diseases and ecological changes. While advances in high-throughput Omics technologies offer a great opportunity for understanding the structures and functions of microbiome, it is still challenging to analyse and interpret the omics data. Specifically, the heterogeneity and diversity of microbial communities, compounded with the large size of the datasets, impose a tremendous challenge to mechanistically elucidate the complex communities. Fortunately, network analyses provide an efficient way to tackle this problem, and several network approaches have been proposed to improve this understanding recently. Here, we systemically illustrate these network theories that have been used in biological and biomedical research. Then, we review existing network modelling methods of microbial studies at multiple layers from metagenomics to metabolomics and further to multi-omics. Lastly, we discuss the limitations of present studies and provide a perspective for further directions in support of the understanding of microbial communities.",32047891,PMC7986608,10.1093/bib/bbaa005,26,Briefings in bioinformatics,100912837,13.994

Decreasing costs of genome sequencing and increasing computational power provide opportunities to generate and analyse large viral genomic datasets that aim to uncover the spatial scales of transmission, the demographics contributing to transmission patterns, and to forecast epidemic trends. Emerging sources of genomic data and associated metadata provide new opportunities to further unravel transmission patterns. Key challenges include how to integrate genomic data with metadata from multiple sources, how to generate efficient computational algorithms to cope with large datasets, and how to establish sampling frameworks to enable robust conclusions.",34620561,,10.1016/j.pt.2021.08.007,26,Trends in parasitology,100966034,10.528

Epiviz: a view inside the design of an integrated visual analysis software for genomics,"Background:Computational and visual data analysis for genomics has traditionally involved a combination of tools and resources, of which the most ubiquitous consist of genome browsers, focused mainly on integrative visualization of large numbers of big datasets, and computational environments, focused on data modeling of a small number of moderately sized datasets. Workflows that involve the integration and exploration of multiple heterogeneous data sources, small and large, public and user specific have been poorly addressed by these tools. In our previous work, we introduced Epiviz, which bridges the gap between the two types of tools, simplifying these workflows.Results:In this paper we expand on the design decisions behind Epiviz, and introduce a series of new advanced features that further support the type of interactive exploratory workflow we have targeted. We discuss three ways in which Epiviz advances the field of genomic data analysis: 1) it brings code to interactive visualizations at various different levels; 2) takes the first steps in the direction of collaborative data analysis by incorporating user plugins from source control providers, as well as by allowing analysis states to be shared among the scientific community; 3) combines established analysis features that have never before been available simultaneously in a genome browser. In our discussion section, we present security implications of the current design, as well as a series of limitations and future research steps.Conclusions:Since many of the design choices of Epiviz are novel in genomics data analysis, this paper serves both as a document of our own approaches with lessons learned, as well as a start point for future efforts in the same direction for the genomics community.",26328750,PMC4559604,10.1186/1471-2105-16-S11-S4,2,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,3.307
Untangling determinants of gut microbiota and tumor immunologic status through a multi-omics approach in colorectal cancer,"The changes in gut microbiota have been implicated in colorectal cancer (CRC). The interplays between the host and gut microbiota remain largely unclear, and few studies have investigated these interplays using integrative multi-omics data. In this study, large-scale multi-comic datasets, including microbiome, metabolome, bulk transcriptomics and single cell RNA sequencing of CRC patients, were analyzed individually and integrated through advanced bioinformatics methods. We further examined the clinical relevance of these findings in the mice recolonized with microbiota from human. We found that CRC patients had distinct microbiota compositions compared to healthy controls. A machine-learning model was developed with 28 biomarkers for detection of CRC, which had high accuracy and clinical applicability. We identified multiple significant correlations between genera and well-characterized genes, suggesting the potential role of gut microbiota in tumor immunity. Further analysis showed that specific metabolites worked as profound communicators between these genera and tumor immunity. Integrating microbiota and metabolome perspectives, we cataloged gut taxonomic and metabolomic features that represented the key multi-omics signature of CRC. Furthermore, gut microbiota transplanted from CRC patients compromised the response of CRC to immunotherapy. These phenotypes were strongly associated with the alterations in gut microbiota, immune cell infiltration as well as multiple metabolic pathways. The comprehensive interplays across multi-comic data of CRC might explain how gut microbiota influenced tumor immunity. Hence, we proposed that modifying the CRC microbiota using healthy donors might serve as a promising strategy to improve response to immunotherapy.",36574857,,10.1016/j.phrs.2022.106633,0,Pharmacological research,8907422,10.334
"Economic importance, taxonomic representation and scientific priority as drivers of genome sequencing projects","Background:Of the approximately two hundred sequenced plant genomes, how many and which ones were sequenced motivated by strictly or largely scientific considerations, and how many by chiefly economic, in a wide sense, incentives? And how large a role does publication opportunity play?Results:In an integration of multiple disparate databases and other sources of information, we collect and analyze data on the size (number of species) in the plant orders and families containing sequenced genomes, on the trade value of these species, and of all the same-family or same-order species, and on the publication priority within the family and order. These data are subjected to multiple regression and other statistical analyses. We find that despite the initial importance of model organisms, it is clearly economic considerations that outweigh others in the choice of genome to be sequenced.Conclusions:This has important implications for generalizations about plant genomes, since human choices of plants to harvest (and cultivate) will have incurred many biases with respect to phenotypic characteristics and hence of genomic properties, and recent genomic evolution will also have been affected by human agricultural practices.",28185558,PMC5123250,10.1186/s12864-016-3100-9,6,BMC genomics,100965258,4.547
Adaptations and Diversity of Antarctic Fishes: A Genomic Perspective,"Antarctic notothenioid fishes are the classic example of vertebrate adaptive radiation in a marine environment. Notothenioids diversified from a single common ancestor ∼22 Mya to between 120 and 140 species today, and they represent ∼90% of fish biomass on the continental shelf of Antarctica. As they diversified in the cold Southern Ocean, notothenioids evolved numerous traits, including osteopenia, anemia, cardiomegaly, dyslipidemia, and aglomerular kidneys, that are beneficial or tolerated in their environment but are pathological in humans. Thus, notothenioids are models for understanding adaptive radiations, physiological and biochemical adaptations to extreme environments, and genetic mechanisms of human disease. Since 2014, 16 notothenioid genomes have been published, which enable a first-pass holistic analysis of the notothenioid radiation and the genetic underpinnings of novel notothenioid traits. Here, we review the notothenioid radiation from a genomic perspective and integrate our insights with recent observations from other fish radiations.",34748709,,10.1146/annurev-animal-081221-064325,6,Annual review of animal biosciences,101614024,13.341

Progress in the development of faster and more accurate pipelines for genome annotation and variant classification will lead to the discovery of more novel disease associations and candidate therapeutic targets. This ultimately will facilitate better patient recruitment in clinical trials. In this review, we describe the trends in research at the intersection of basic and clinical genomics that aims to increase understanding of overall genomic complexity, complex inheritance patterns of disease, and patient-phenotype-specific genomic associations. We describe the emerging field of translational functional genomics, which integrates other functional ""-omics"" approaches that support next-generation sequencing genomic data in order to facilitate personalized diagnostics, disease management, biomarker discovery, and medicine.

Small Genomes and Big Data: Adaptation of Plastid Genomics to the High-Throughput Era,"Plastid genome sequences are becoming more readily available with the increase in high-throughput sequencing, and whole-organelle genetic data is available for algae and plants from across the diversity of photosynthetic eukaryotes. This has provided incredible opportunities for studying species which may not be amenable to in vivo study or genetic manipulation or may not yet have been cultured. Research into plastid genomes has pushed the limits of what can be deduced from genomic information, and in particular genomic information obtained from public databases. In this Review, we discuss how research into plastid genomes has benefitted enormously from the explosion of publicly available genome sequence. We describe two case studies in how using publicly available gene data has supported previously held hypotheses about plastid traits from lineage-restricted experiments across algal and plant diversity. We propose how this approach could be used across disciplines for inferring functional and biological characteristics from genomic approaches, including integration of new computational and bioinformatic approaches such as machine learning. We argue that the techniques developed to gain the maximum possible insight from plastid genomes can be applied across the eukaryotic tree of life.",31344945,PMC6723049,10.3390/biom9080299,1,Biomolecules,101596414,6.064
Research on radiotherapy related genes and prognostic target identification of rectal cancer based on multi-omics,"Background:Radiosensitivity of rectal cancer is related to the radiotherapy efficacy and prognosis of patients with rectal cancer, and the genes and molecular mechanisms related to radiosensitivity of rectal cancer have not been clarified. We explored the radiosensitivity related genes of rectal cancer at a multi omics level.Methods:mRNA expression data and rectum adenocarcinoma (READ) data were obtained from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Gene Expression Omnibus Database (GEO) (GSE150082, GSE60331, GSE46862, GSE46862). Differentially expressed genes between radiotherapy sensitive group and radiotherapy insensitive group were screened. GO analysis and KEGG pathway analysis were performed for differentially expressed genes. Among the differentially expressed genes, five core genes associated with rectal cancer prognosis were selected using random survival forest analysis. For these five core genes, drug sensitivity analysis, immune cell infiltration analysis, TISIDB database immune gene correlation analysis, GSEA enrichment analysis, construction of Nomogram prediction model, transcriptional regulatory network analysis, and qRT-PCR validation was performed on human rectal adenocarcinoma tissue.Results:We found that 600 up-regulated genes and 553 down-regulated genes were significantly different between radiotherapy sensitive group and radiotherapy insensitive group in rectal cancer. Five key genes, TOP2A, MATR3, APOL6, JOSD1, and HOXC6, were finally screened by random survival forest analysis. These five key genes were associated with different immune cell infiltration, immune-related genes, and chemosensitivity. A comprehensive transcriptional regulatory network was constructed based on these five core genes. qRT-PCR revealed that MATR3 expression was different in rectal cancer tissues and adjacent non-cancerous tissues, while APOL6, HOXC6, JOSD1, and TOP2A expression was not different.Conclusion:Five radiosensitivity-related genes related to the prognosis of rectal cancer: TOP2A, MATR3, APOL6, JOSD1, HOXC6, are involved in multiple processes such as immune cell infiltration, immune-related genes, chemosensitivity, signaling pathways and transcriptional regulatory networks and may be potential biomarkers for radiotherapy of rectal cancer.",38012642,PMC10680259,10.1186/s12967-023-04753-9,0,Journal of translational medicine,101190741,8.44
AnnotSV: an integrated tool for structural variations annotation,"Summary:Structural Variations (SV) are a major source of variability in the human genome that shaped its actual structure during evolution. Moreover, many human diseases are caused by SV, highlighting the need to accurately detect those genomic events but also to annotate them and assist their biological interpretation. Therefore, we developed AnnotSV that compiles functionally, regulatory and clinically relevant information and aims at providing annotations useful to (i) interpret SV potential pathogenicity and (ii) filter out SV potential false positive. In particular, AnnotSV reports heterozygous and homozygous counts of single nucleotide variations (SNVs) and small insertions/deletions called within each SV for the analyzed patients, this genomic information being extremely useful to support or question the existence of an SV. We also report the computed allelic frequency relative to overlapping variants from DGV (MacDonald et al., 2014), that is especially powerful to filter out common SV. To delineate the strength of AnnotSV, we annotated the 4751 SV from one sample of the 1000 Genomes Project, integrating the sample information of four million of SNV/indel, in less than 60 s.Availability and implementation:AnnotSV is implemented in Tcl and runs in command line on all platforms.

A bulked segregant analysis tool for out-crossing species (BSATOS) and QTL-based genomics-assisted prediction of complex traits in apple,"Introduction:Genomic heterozygosity, self-incompatibility, and rich-in somatic mutations hinder the molecular breeding efficiency of outcrossing plants.Objectives:We attempted to develop an efficient integrated strategy to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and trait-associated genes, to develop gene markers, and to construct genomics-assisted prediction (GAP) modes.Methods:A novel protocol, bulked segregant analysis tool for out-crossing species (BSATOS), is presented here, which is characterized by taking full advantage of all segregation patterns (including AB × AB markers) and haplotype information. To verify the effectiveness of the protocol in dealing with the complex traits of outbreeding species, three apple cross populations with 9,654 individuals were adopted.Results:By using BSATOS, 90, 60, and 77 significant QTLs were identified successfully and candidate genes were predicted for apple fruit weight (FW), fruit ripening date (FRD), and fruit soluble solid content (SSC), respectively. The gene-based markers were developed and genotyped for 1,396 individuals in a training population, including 145 Malus accessions and 1,251 F1 plants of the three full-sib families. GAP models were trained using marker genotype effect estimates of the training population. The prediction accuracy was 0.7658, 0.6455, and 0.3758 for FW, FRD, and SSC, respectively.Conclusion:The BSATOS and GAP models provided a convenient and efficient methodology for candidate gene mining and molecular breeding in out-crossing plant species.

"The 2000HIV study: Design, multi-omics methods and participant characteristics","Background:Even during long-term combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), people living with HIV (PLHIV) have a dysregulated immune system, characterized by persistent immune activation, accelerated immune ageing and increased risk of non-AIDS comorbidities. A multi-omics approach is applied to a large cohort of PLHIV to understand pathways underlying these dysregulations in order to identify new biomarkers and novel genetically validated therapeutic drugs targets.Methods:The 2000HIV study is a prospective longitudinal cohort study of PLHIV on cART. In addition, untreated HIV spontaneous controllers were recruited. In-depth multi-omics characterization will be performed, including genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and metagenomics, functional immunological assays and extensive immunophenotyping. Furthermore, the latent viral reservoir will be assessed through cell associated HIV-1 RNA and DNA, and full-length individual proviral sequencing on a subset. Clinical measurements include an ECG, carotid intima-media thickness and plaque measurement, hepatic steatosis and fibrosis measurement as well as psychological symptoms and recreational drug questionnaires. Additionally, considering the developing pandemic, COVID-19 history and vaccination was recorded. Participants return for a two-year follow-up visit. The 2000HIV study consists of a discovery and validation cohort collected at separate sites to immediately validate any finding in an independent cohort.Results:Overall, 1895 PLHIV from four sites were included for analysis, 1559 in the discovery and 336 in the validation cohort. The study population was representative of a Western European HIV population, including 288 (15.2%)cis-women, 463 (24.4%) non-whites, and 1360 (71.8%) MSM (Men who have Sex with Men). Extreme phenotypes included 114 spontaneous controllers, 81 rapid progressors and 162 immunological non-responders. According to the Framingham score 321 (16.9%) had a cardiovascular risk of >20% in the next 10 years.

SuperPhy: predictive genomics for the bacterial pathogen Escherichia coli,"Background:Predictive genomics is the translation of raw genome sequence data into a phenotypic assessment of the organism. For bacterial pathogens, these phenotypes can range from environmental survivability, to the severity of human disease. Significant progress has been made in the development of generic tools for genomic analyses that are broadly applicable to all microorganisms; however, a fundamental missing component is the ability to analyze genomic data in the context of organism-specific phenotypic knowledge, which has been accumulated from decades of research and can provide a meaningful interpretation of genome sequence data.Results:In this study, we present SuperPhy, an online predictive genomics platform ( http://lfz.corefacility.ca/superphy/ ) for Escherichia coli.

Multi-Omics Elucidates Difference in Accumulation of Bioactive Constituents in Licorice (Glycyrrhiza uralensis) under Drought Stress,"Licorice is a frequently applied herb with potential edible and medicinal value based on various flavonoids and triterpenes. However, studies on detailed flavonoid and triterpene metabolism and the molecular basis of their biosynthesis in licorice are very limited, especially under drought conditions. In the present study, we carried out transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome experiments. To ultimately combine three omics for analysis, we performed a bioinformatics comparison, integrating transcriptome data and proteome data through a Cloud platform, along with a simplified biosynthesis of primary flavonoids and triterpenoids in the KEGG pathway based on metabolomic results. The biosynthesis pathways of triterpenes and flavonoids are enriched at both gene and protein levels. Key flavonoid-related genes (PAL,4CL,CHS,CHI,CYP93C,HIDH,HI4OMT, andCYP81E1_7) and representative proteins (HIDH, CYP81E1_7, CYP93C, and VR) were obtained, which all showed high levels after drought treatment. Notably, one R2R3-MYB transcription factor (Glyur000237s00014382.1), a critical regulator of flavonoid biosynthesis, achieved a significant upregulated expression as well. In the biosynthesis of glycyrrhizin, both gene and protein levels of bAS and CYP88D6 have been found with upregulated expression under drought conditions. Most of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and proteins (DEPs) showed similar expression patterns and positively related to metabolic profiles of flavonoid and saponin. We believe that suitable drought stress may contribute to the accumulation of bioactive constituents in licorice, and our research provides an insight into the genetic study and quality breeding in this plant.",37894521,PMC10609028,10.3390/molecules28207042,0,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",100964009,4.927
Multivariate Analysis with the R Package mixOmics,"The high-dimensional nature of proteomics data presents challenges for statistical analysis and biological interpretation. Multivariate analysis, combined with insightful visualization can help to reveal the underlying patterns in complex biological data. This chapter introduces the R package mixOmics which focuses on data exploration and integration. We first introduce methods for single data sets: both Principal Component Analysis, which can identify the patterns of variance present in data, and sparse Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis, which aims to identify variables that can classify samples into known groups. We then present integrative methods with Projection to Latent Structures and further extensions for discriminant analysis. We illustrate each technique on a breast cancer multi-omics study and provide the R code and data as online supplementary material for readers interested in reproducing these analyses.",36308696,,10.1007/978-1-0716-1967-4_15,4,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,0.0
Multi-omics analysis of mucosal and systemic immunity to SARS-CoV-2 after birth,"The dynamics of immunity to infection in infants remain obscure. Here, we used a multi-omics approach to perform a longitudinal analysis of immunity to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in infants and young children by analyzing blood samples and weekly nasal swabs collected before, during, and after infection with Omicron and non-Omicron variants. Infection stimulated robust antibody titers that, unlike in adults, showed no sign of decay for up to 300 days. Infants mounted a robust mucosal immune response characterized by inflammatory cytokines, interferon (IFN) α, and T helper (Th) 17 and neutrophil markers (interleukin [IL]-17, IL-8, and CXCL1). The immune response in blood was characterized by upregulation of activation markers on innate cells, no inflammatory cytokines, but several chemokines and IFNα. The latter correlated with viral load and expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in myeloid cells measured by single-cell multi-omics. Together, these data provide a snapshot of immunity to infection during the initial weeks and months of life.",37776858,,10.1016/j.cell.2023.08.044,4,Cell,413066,66.85
Evolution as an ecosystem process: insights from genomics,"Evolution is a fundamental ecosystem process. The study of genomic variation of organisms can not only improve our understanding of evolutionary processes, but also of contemporary and future ecosystem dynamics. We argue that integrative research between the fields of genomics and ecosystem ecology could generate new insights. Specifically, studies of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, evolutionary rescue, and eco-evolutionary dynamics could all benefit from information about variation in genome structure and the genetic architecture of traits, whereas genomic studies could benefit from information about the ecological context of evolutionary dynamics. We propose new ways to help link research on functional genomic diversity with (reciprocal) interactions between phenotypic evolution and ecosystem change. Despite numerous challenges, we anticipate that the wealth of genomic data being collected on natural populations will improve our understanding of ecosystems.",29241022,,10.1139/gen-2017-0044,3,Genome,8704544,2.449
Multi-omics analysis of the oncogenic value of copper Metabolism-Related protein COMMD2 in human cancers,"Background:The copper metabolism MURR1 domain (COMMD) protein family is involved in tumorigenicity of malignant tumors. However, as the member of COMMD, the role of COMMD2 in human tumors remains unknown.Methods:We used The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Genotype Tissue Expression (GTEx), Human Protein Atlas (HPA) database, Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) platform, univariate Cox regression analysis, Kaplan-Meier curve, cBioPortal, UALCAN database, Sangerbox online platform, GSCA database gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), and GeneMANIA to analyze the expression of COMMD2, its prognostic values, genomic alteration patterns, and the correlation with tumor stemness, tumor mutational burden (TMB), microsatellite instability (MSI), and immune infiltrates, drug sensitivity, and gene function enrichment in pan-cancer. qRT-PCR, CCK-8, EdU, wound healing, and transwell migration assays were performed to confirm the function of COMMD2.Results:COMMD2 was strongly expressed in most cancer types. Elevated COMMD2 expression affects the prognosis, clinicopathological stage, and molecular or immune subtypes of various tumors. Moreover, promoter hypomethylation and mutations in the COMMD2 gene may be associated with its high expression and poor survival. Additionally, we discovered that COMMD2 expression was linked to tumor stemness, TMB, MSI, immune cell infiltration, immune-checkpoint inhibitors, and drug sensitivity in pan-cancer. Furthermore, the COMMD2 gene co-expression network is constructed with GSEA analysis, displaying significant interaction of COMMD2 with E2F targets, G2-M checkpoint, and mitotic spindle in bladder cancer (BLCA). Finally, RNA interference data showed suppression of COMMD2 prevented proliferation and migration of BLCA and uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC) cells.Conclusion:Our findings shed light on the COMMD2 functions in human cancers and demonstrate that it is a promising prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in pan-cancer.",36205192,PMC10242316,10.1002/cam4.5320,0,Cancer medicine,101595310,4.711
"(Actino)Bacterial ""intelligence"": using comparative genomics to unravel the information processing capacities of microbes","Bacterial genomes encode numerous and often sophisticated signaling devices to perceive changes in their environment and mount appropriate adaptive responses. With their help, microbes are able to orchestrate specific decision-making processes that alter the cellular behavior, but also integrate and communicate information. Moreover and beyond, some signal transducing systems also enable bacteria to remember and learn from previous stimuli to anticipate environmental changes. As recently suggested, all of these aspects indicate that bacteria do, in fact, exhibit cognition remarkably reminiscent of what we refer to as intelligent behavior, at least when referred to higher eukaryotes. In this essay, comprehensive data derived from comparative genomics analyses of microbial signal transduction systems are used to probe the concept of cognition in bacterial cells. Using a recent comprehensive analysis of over 100 actinobacterial genomes as a test case, we illustrate the different layers of the capacities of bacteria that result in cognitive and behavioral complexity as well as some form of 'bacterial intelligence'. We try to raise awareness to approach bacteria as cognitive organisms and believe that this view would enrich and open a new path in the experimental studies of bacterial signal transducing systems.",26852121,,10.1007/s00294-016-0569-3,11,Current genetics,8004904,2.695
Integron cassettes integrate into bacterial genomes via widespread non-classical attG sites,"Integrons are genetic elements involved in bacterial adaptation which capture, shuffle and express genes encoding adaptive functions embedded in cassettes. These events are governed by the integron integrase through site-specific recombination between attC and attI integron sites. Using computational and molecular genetic approaches, here we demonstrate that the integrase also catalyses cassette integration into bacterial genomes outside of its known att sites. Once integrated, these cassettes can be expressed if located near bacterial promoters and can be excised at the integration point or outside, inducing chromosomal modifications in the latter case. Analysis of more than 5 × 105independent integration events revealed a very large genomic integration landscape. We identified consensus recombination sequences, named attG sites, which differ greatly in sequence and structure from classical att sites. These results unveil an alternative route for dissemination of adaptive functions in bacteria and expand the role of integrons in bacterial evolution.",38172619,,10.1038/s41564-023-01548-y,1,Nature microbiology,101674869,30.964
Controlled Access under Review: Improving the Governance of Genomic Data Access,"In parallel with massive genomic data production, data sharing practices have rapidly expanded over the last decade. To ensure authorized access to data, access review by data access committees (DACs) has been utilized as one potential solution. Here we discuss core elements to be integrated into the fabric of access review by both established and emerging DACs in order to foster fair, efficient, and responsible access to datasets. We particularly highlight the fact that the access review process could be adversely influenced by the potential conflicts of interest of data producers, particularly when they are directly involved in DACs management. Therefore, in structuring DACs and access procedures, possible data withholding by data producers should receive thorough attention.",26720729,PMC4697814,10.1371/journal.pbio.1002339,21,PLoS biology,101183755,9.593
STATegra: Multi-Omics Data Integration - A Conceptual Scheme With a Bioinformatics Pipeline,"Technologies for profiling samples using different omics platforms have been at the forefront since the human genome project. Large-scale multi-omics data hold the promise of deciphering different regulatory layers. Yet, while there is a myriad of bioinformatics tools, each multi-omics analysis appears to start from scratch with an arbitrary decision over which tools to use and how to combine them. Therefore, it is an unmet need to conceptualize how to integrate such data and implement and validate pipelines in different cases. We have designed a conceptual framework (STATegra), aiming it to be as generic as possible for multi-omics analysis, combining available multi-omic anlaysis tools (machine learning component analysis, non-parametric data combination, and a multi-omics exploratory analysis) in a step-wise manner. While in several studies, we have previously combined those integrative tools, here, we provide a systematic description of the STATegra framework and its validation using two The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) case studies. For both, the Glioblastoma and the Skin Cutaneous Melanoma (SKCM) cases, we demonstrate an enhanced capacity of the framework (and beyond the individual tools) to identify features and pathways compared to single-omics analysis. Such an integrative multi-omics analysis framework for identifying features and components facilitates the discovery of new biology. Finally, we provide several options for applying the STATegra framework when parametric assumptions are fulfilled and for the case when not all the samples are profiled for all omics. The STATegra framework is built using several tools, which are being integrated step-by-step as OpenSource in the STATegRa Bioconductor package.",33747045,PMC7970106,10.3389/fgene.2021.620453,10,Frontiers in genetics,101560621,4.772
Science for the Next Century: Deep Phenotyping,"Our ability to unravel the mysteries of human health and disease have changed dramatically over the past 2 decades. Decoding health and disease has been facilitated by the recent availability of high-throughput genomics and multi-omics analyses and the companion tools of advanced informatics and computational science. Understanding of the human genome and its influence on phenotype continues to advance through genotyping large populations and using ""light phenotyping"" approaches in combination with smaller subsets of the population being evaluated using ""deep phenotyping"" approaches. Using our capability to integrate and jointly analyze genomic data with other multi-omic data, the knowledge of genotype-phenotype relationships and associated genetic pathways and functions is being advanced. Understanding genotype-phenotype relationships that discriminate human health from disease is speculated to facilitate predictive, precision health care and change modes of health care delivery. The American Association for Dental Research Fall Focused Symposium assembled experts to discuss how studies of genotype-phenotype relationships are illuminating the pathophysiology of craniofacial diseases and developmental biology. Although the breadth of the topic did not allow all areas of dental, oral, and craniofacial research to be addressed (e.g., cancer), the importance and power of integrating genomic, phenomic, and other -omic data are illustrated using a variety of examples. The 8 Fall Focused talks presented different methodological approaches for ascertaining study populations and evaluating population variance and phenotyping approaches. These advances are reviewed in this summary.",33749358,PMC8258723,10.1177/00220345211001850,2,Journal of dental research,354343,8.924
Recommendations for the FAIRification of genomic track metadata,"Background:Many types of data from genomic analyses can be represented as genomic tracks,i.e.features linked to the genomic coordinates of a reference genome. Examples of such data are epigenetic DNA methylation data, ChIP-seq peaks, germline or somatic DNA variants, as well as RNA-seq expression levels. Researchers often face difficulties in locating, accessing and combining relevant tracks from external sources, as well as locating the raw data, reducing the value of the generated information.Description of work:We propose to advance the application of FAIR data principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) to produce searchable metadata for genomic tracks. Findability and Accessibility of metadata can then be ensured by a track search service that integrates globally identifiable metadata from various track hubs in the Track Hub Registry and other relevant repositories. Interoperability and Reusability need to be ensured by the specification and implementation of a basic set of recommendations for metadata. We have tested this concept by developing such a specification in a JSON Schema, called FAIRtracks, and have integrated it into a novel track search service, called TrackFind. We demonstrate practical usage by importing datasets through TrackFind into existing examples of relevant analytical tools for genomic tracks: EPICO and the GSuite HyperBrowser.Conclusion:We here provide a first iteration of a draft standard for genomic track metadata, as well as the accompanying software ecosystem. It can easily be adapted or extended to future needs of the research community regarding data, methods and tools, balancing the requirements of both data submitters and analytical end-users.",34249331,PMC8226415,10.12688/f1000research.28449.1,6,F1000Research,101594320,0.0

Computational frameworks integrating deep learning and statistical models in mining multimodal omics data,"Background:In health research, multimodal omics data analysis is widely used to address important clinical and biological questions. Traditional statistical methods rely on the strong assumptions of distribution. Statistical methods such as testing and differential expression are commonly used in omics analysis. Deep learning, on the other hand, is an advanced computer science technique that is powerful in mining high-dimensional omics data for prediction tasks. Recently, integrative frameworks or methods have been developed for omics studies that combine statistical models and deep learning algorithms.Methods and results:The aim of these integrative frameworks is to combine the strengths of both statistical methods and deep learning algorithms to improve prediction accuracy while also providing interpretability and explainability.

Methods based on short-read sequencing can identify viral insertion sites, but the sequence of the viral genomes within remains unobserved.

PMDBase: a database for studying microsatellite DNA and marker development in plants,"Microsatellite DNAs (or SSRs) are important genomic components involved in many important biological functions. SSRs have been extensively exploited as molecular markers for diverse applications including genetic diversity, linkage/association mapping of gene/QTL, marker-assisted selection, variety identification and evolution analysis. However, a comprehensive database or web service for studying microsatellite DNAs and marker development in plants is lacking. Here, we developed a database, PMDBase, which integrates large amounts of microsatellite DNAs from genome sequenced plant species and includes a web service for microsatellite DNAs identification. In PMDBase, 26 230 099 microsatellite DNAs were identified spanning 110 plant species. Up to three pairs of primers were supplied for every microsatellite DNA. For 81 species, genomic features of the microsatellite DNAs (genic or non-genic) were supplied with the corresponding genes or transcripts from public databases. Microsatellite DNAs can be explored through browsing and searching modules with a user-friendly web interface and customized software. Furthermore, we developed MISAweb and embedded Primer3web to help users to identify microsatellite DNAs and design corresponding primers in their own genomic sequences online.

Ovarian cancer beyond imaging: integration of AI and multiomics biomarkers,"High-grade serous ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynaecological malignancy. Detailed molecular studies have revealed marked intra-patient heterogeneity at the tumour microenvironment level, likely contributing to poor prognosis. Despite large quantities of clinical, molecular and imaging data on ovarian cancer being accumulated worldwide and the rise of high-throughput computing, data frequently remain siloed and are thus inaccessible for integrated analyses. Only a minority of studies on ovarian cancer have set out to harness artificial intelligence (AI) for the integration of multiomics data and for developing powerful algorithms that capture the characteristics of ovarian cancer at multiple scales and levels. Clinical data, serum markers, and imaging data were most frequently used, followed by genomics and transcriptomics. The current literature proves that integrative multiomics approaches outperform models based on single data types and indicates that imaging can be used for the longitudinal tracking of tumour heterogeneity in space and potentially over time. This review presents an overview of studies that integrated two or more data types to develop AI-based classifiers or prediction models.Relevance statement Integrative multiomics models for ovarian cancer outperform models using single data types for classification, prognostication, and predictive tasks.Key points• This review presents studies using multiomics and artificial intelligence in ovarian cancer.• Current literature proves that integrative multiomics outperform models using single data types.• Around 60% of studies used a combination of imaging with clinical data.• The combination of genomics and transcriptomics with imaging data was infrequently used.",37700218,PMC10497482,10.1186/s41747-023-00364-7,3,European radiology experimental,101721752,0.0
Unveiling the mechanism of action of nature-inspired anti-cancer compounds using a multi-omics approach,"The 2020 global cancer registry has ranked breast cancer (BCa) as the most commonly diagnosed type of cancer and the most common cause of cancer-related deaths in women worldwide. Increasing resistance and significant side effects continue to limit the efficacy of anti-BCa drugs, hence the need to identify new drug targets and to develop novel compounds to overcome these limitations. Nature-inspired anti-cancer compounds are becoming increasingly popular since they often provide a relatively safe and effective alternative. In this study, we employed multi-omics techniques to gain insights into the relevant mechanism of action of two recently identified new nature-inspired anti-cancer compounds (SIMR3066 and SIMR3058). Discovery proteomics analysis combined with LC-MS/MS-based untargeted metabolomics analysis was performed on compound-treated vs DMSO-treated (control) MCF-7 cells. Downstream protein functional enrichment analysis showed that most of the responsive proteins were functionally associated with antigen processing and neutrophil degranulation, RNA catabolism and protein folding as well as cytoplasmic vesicle lumen and mitochondrial matrix formation. Consistent with the proteomics findings, metabolomic pathway analysis suggested that the differentially abundant compounds indicated altered metabolic pathways such as glycolysis, the Krebs cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. Furthermore, metabolomics-based enriched-for-action pathway analysis showed that the two compounds associate with mercaptopurine, thioguanine and azathioprine related pathways. Lastly, integrated proteomics and metabolomics analysis revealed that treatment of BCa with SIMR3066 disrupts several signaling pathways including p53-mediated apoptosis and the circadian entertainment pathway. Overall, the multi-omics approach we used in this study indicated that it is a powerful tool in probing the mechanism of action of lead drug candidates. SIGNIFICANCE: In this study we adopted a multi-omics (proteomics and metabolomics) strategy to learn more about the molecular mechanisms of action of nature-inspired potential anticancer drugs. Following treatment with SIMR3066 or SIMR3058, the integration of these multi-omics data sets revealed which biological pathways are altered in BCa cells. This study demonstrates that combining proteomics with metabolomics is a powerful method to investigate the mechanism of action of potential anticancer lead drug candidates.",35728772,,10.1016/j.jprot.2022.104660,0,Journal of proteomics,101475056,3.855
Single-Cell Multi-Omics Map of Cell Type-Specific Mechanistic Drivers of Multiple Sclerosis Lesions,"Background and objectives:In progressive multiple sclerosis (MS), compartmentalized inflammation plays a pivotal role in the complex pathology of tissue damage. The interplay between epigenetic regulation, transcriptional modifications, and location-specific alterations within white matter (WM) lesions at the single-cell level remains underexplored.Methods:We examined intracellular and intercellular pathways in the MS brain WM using a novel dataset obtained by integrated single-cell multi-omics techniques from 3 active lesions, 3 chronic active lesions, 3 remyelinating lesions, and 3 control WM of 6 patients with progressive MS and 3 non-neurologic controls. Single-nucleus RNA-seq and ATAC-seq were combined and additionally enriched with newly conducted spatial transcriptomics from 1 chronic active lesion. Functional gene modules were then validated in our previously published bulk tissue transcriptome data obtained from 73 WM lesions of patients with progressive MS and 25 WM of non-neurologic disease controls.Results:Our analysis uncovered an MS-specific oligodendrocyte genetic signature influenced by the KLF/SP gene family. This modulation has potential associations with the autocrine iron uptake signaling observed in transcripts of transferrin and its receptorLRP2. In addition, an inflammatory profile emerged within these oligodendrocytes. We observed unique cellular endophenotypes both at the periphery and within the chronic active lesion. These include a distinct metabolic astrocyte phenotype, the importance of FGF signaling among astrocytes and neurons, and a notable enrichment of mitochondrial genes at the lesion edge populated predominantly by astrocytes. Our study also identified B-cell coexpression networks indicating different functional B-cell subsets with differential location and specific tendencies toward certain lesion types.Discussion:The use of single-cell multi-omics has offered a detailed perspective into the cellular dynamics and interactions in MS.

Recovery of strain-resolved genomes from human microbiome through an integration framework of single-cell genomics and metagenomics,"Background:Obtaining high-quality (HQ) reference genomes from microbial communities is crucial for understanding the phylogeny and function of uncultured microbes in complex microbial ecosystems. Despite improvements in bioinformatic approaches to generate curated metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), existing metagenome binners obtain population consensus genomes but they are nowhere comparable to genomes sequenced from isolates in terms of strain level resolution. Here, we present a framework for the integration of single-cell genomics and metagenomics, referred to as single-cell (sc) metagenomics, to reconstruct strain-resolved genomes from microbial communities at once.Results:Our sc-metagenomics integration framework, termed SMAGLinker, uses single-cell amplified genomes (SAGs) generated using microfluidic technology as binning guides and integrates them with metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) to recover improved draft genomes. We compared sc-metagenomics with the metagenomics-alone approach using conventional metagenome binners. The sc-metagenomics approach showed precise contig binning and higher recovery rates (>97%) of rRNA and plasmids than conventional metagenomics in genome reconstruction from the cell mock community. In human microbiota samples, sc-metagenomics recovered the largest number of genomes with a total of 103 gut microbial genomes (21 HQ, with 65 showing >90% completeness) and 45 skin microbial genomes (10 HQ, with 40 showing >90% completeness), respectively. Conventional metagenomics recovered one Staphylococcus hominis genome, whereas sc-metagenomics recovered two S. hominis genomes from identical skin microbiota sample. Single-cell sequencing revealed that these S. hominis genomes were derived from two distinct strains harboring specifically different plasmids. We found that all conventional S. hominis MAGs had a substantial lack or excess of genome sequences and contamination from other Staphylococcus species (S. epidermidis).Conclusions:SMAGLinker enabled us to obtain strain-resolved genomes in the mock community and human microbiota samples by assigning metagenomic sequences correctly and covering both highly conserved genes such as rRNA genes and unique extrachromosomal elements, including plasmids. SMAGLinker will provide HQ genomes that are difficult to obtain using metagenomics alone and will facilitate the understanding of microbial ecosystems by elucidating detailed metabolic pathways and horizontal gene transfer networks.

PseudoChecker: an integrated online platform for gene inactivation inference,"The rapid expansion of high-quality genome assemblies, exemplified by ongoing initiatives such as the Genome-10K and i5k, demands novel automated methods to approach comparative genomics. Of these, the study of inactivating mutations in the coding region of genes, or pseudogenization, as a source of evolutionary novelty is mostly overlooked. Thus, to address such evolutionary/genomic events, a systematic, accurate and computationally automated approach is required. Here, we present PseudoChecker, the first integrated online platform for gene inactivation inference. Unlike the few existing methods, our comparative genomics-based approach displays full automation, a built-in graphical user interface and a novel index, PseudoIndex, for an empirical evaluation of the gene coding status. As a multi-platform online service, PseudoChecker simplifies access and usability, allowing a fast identification of disruptive mutations. An analysis of 30 genes previously reported to be eroded in mammals, and 30 viable genes from the same lineages, demonstrated that PseudoChecker was able to correctly infer 97% of loss events and 95% of functional genes, confirming its reliability.

"VARista: a free web platform for streamlined whole-genome variant analysis across T2T, hg38, and hg19","With the increasing importance of genomic data in understanding genetic diseases, there is an essential need for efficient and user-friendly tools that simplify variant analysis. Although multiple tools exist, many present barriers such as steep learning curves, limited reference genome compatibility, or costs. We developed VARista, a free web-based tool, to address these challenges and provide a streamlined solution for researchers, particularly those focusing on rare monogenic diseases. VARista offers a user-centric interface that eliminates much of the technical complexity typically associated with variant analysis.

Multi-omics data reveals the important role of glycerophospholipid metabolism in the crosstalk between gut and brain in depression,"Background:Gut microbiota plays a critical role in the onset and development of depression, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are unclear. This study was conducted to observe the characteristics of gut microbiota, lipid metabolism and neurotransmitters in Gut-Liver-Brain axis in depressed mice (DM), and identify some novel perceptions on relationships between gut microbiota and depression.Methods:A mouse model of depression was built used chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS). Fecal samples (measuring gut microbiota compositions, microbial genes and lipid metabolites), liver samples (measuring lipid metabolites), and hippocampus (measuring neurotransmitters) were collected. Both univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were used to identify the differential gut microbiota, metabolic signatures and neurotransmitters in DM.Results:There were significant differences on both microbial and metabolic signatures between DM and control mice (CM): 71 significantly changed operational taxonomic units (OTUs) (60.56% belonged to phylum Firmicutes) and 405 differential lipid metabolites (51.11% belonged to Glycerophospholipid (GP) metabolism) were identified. Functional analysis showed that depressive-like behaviors (DLB)-related differential microbial genes were mainly enriched in GP metabolism. Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) showed that DLB-related differential metabolites mainly belonged to GPs. Meanwhile, seven differential neurotransmitters were identified. Comprehensive analysis found that Lachnospiraceae and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) were significantly correlated with 94.20% and 53.14% differential GPs, respectively, and GABA was significantly correlated with three main DLB phenotypes.Conclusion:Our results provided novel perceptions on the role of Gut-Liver-Brain axis in the onset of depression, and showed that GP metabolism might be the bridge between gut microbiota and depression. ""Lachnospiraceae-GP metabolism-GABA"" held the promise as a potential way between gut microbiota and brain functions in DM.",36750892,PMC9903503,10.1186/s12967-023-03942-w,4,Journal of translational medicine,101190741,8.44
MetQy-an R package to query metabolic functions of genes and genomes,"Summary:With the rapid accumulation of sequencing data from genomic and metagenomic studies, there is an acute need for better tools that facilitate their analyses against biological functions. To this end, we developed MetQy, an open-source R package designed for query-based analysis of functional units in [meta]genomes and/or sets of genes using the The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). Furthermore, MetQy contains visualization and analysis tools and facilitates KEGG's flat file manipulation. Thus, MetQy enables better understanding of metabolic capabilities of known genomes or user-specified [meta]genomes by using the available information and can help guide studies in microbial ecology, metabolic engineering and synthetic biology.Availability and implementation:The MetQy R package is freely available and can be downloaded from our group's website (http://osslab.lifesci.warwick.ac.uk) or GitHub (https://github.com/OSS-Lab/MetQy).",29878056,PMC6247936,10.1093/bioinformatics/bty447,3,"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",9808944,6.931
Discovery of novel genes derived from transposable elements using integrative genomic analysis,"Complex eukaryotes contain millions of transposable elements (TEs), comprising large fractions of their nuclear genomes. TEs consist of structural, regulatory, and coding sequences that are ordinarily associated with transposition, but that occasionally confer on the organism a selective advantage and may thereby become exapted. Exapted transposable element genes (ETEs) are known to play critical roles in diverse systems, from vertebrate adaptive immunity to plant development. Yet despite their evident importance, most ETEs have been identified fortuitously and few systematic searches have been conducted, suggesting that additional ETEs may await discovery. To explore this possibility, we develop a comprehensive systematic approach to searching for ETEs. We use TE-specific conserved domains to identify with high precision genes derived from TEs and screen them for signatures of exaptation based on their similarities to reference sets of known ETEs, conventional (non-TE) genes, and TE genes across diverse genetic attributes including repetitiveness, conservation of genomic location and sequence, and levels of expression and repressive small RNAs. Applying this approach in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, we discover a surprisingly large number of novel high confidence ETEs. Intriguingly, unlike known plant ETEs, several of the novel ETE families form tandemly arrayed gene clusters, whereas others are relatively young. Our results not only identify novel TE-derived genes that may have practical applications but also challenge the notion that TE exaptation is merely a relic of ancient life, instead suggesting that it may continue to fundamentally drive evolution.",25713212,,10.1093/molbev/msv042,20,Molecular biology and evolution,8501455,8.8
Single-cell multi-omics analysis identifies context-specific gene regulatory gates and mechanisms,"There is a growing interest in inferring context specific gene regulatory networks from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. This involves identifying the regulatory relationships between transcription factors (TFs) and genes in individual cells, and then characterizing these relationships at the level of specific cell types or cell states. In this study, we introduce scGATE (single-cell gene regulatory gate) as a novel computational tool for inferring TF-gene interaction networks and reconstructing Boolean logic gates involving regulatory TFs using scRNA-seq data. In contrast to current Boolean models, scGATE eliminates the need for individual formulations and likelihood calculations for each Boolean rule (e.g. AND, OR, XOR). By employing a Bayesian framework, scGATE infers the Boolean rule after fitting the model to the data, resulting in significant reductions in time-complexities for logic-based studies. We have applied assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing (scATAC-seq) data and TF DNA binding motifs to filter out non-relevant TFs in gene regulations. By integrating single-cell clustering with these external cues, scGATE is able to infer context specific networks. The performance of scGATE is evaluated using synthetic and real single-cell multi-omics data from mouse tissues and human blood, demonstrating its superiority over existing tools for reconstructing TF-gene networks. Additionally, scGATE provides a flexible framework for understanding the complex combinatorial and cooperative relationships among TFs regulating target genes by inferring Boolean logic gates among them.",38653489,PMC11036345,10.1093/bib/bbae180,0,Briefings in bioinformatics,100912837,13.994
Network-based multi-omics integration reveals metabolic at-risk profile within treated HIV-infection,"Multiomics technologies improve the biological understanding of health status in people living with HIV on antiretroviral therapy (PWH). Still, a systematic and in-depth characterization of metabolic risk profile during successful long-term treatment is lacking. Here, we used multi-omics (plasma lipidomic, metabolomic, and fecal 16 S microbiome) data-driven stratification and characterization to identify the metabolic at-risk profile within PWH. Through network analysis and similarity network fusion (SNF), we identified three groups of PWH (SNF-1-3): healthy (HC)-like (SNF-1), mild at-risk (SNF-3), and severe at-risk (SNF-2). The PWH in the SNF-2 (45%) had a severe at-risk metabolic profile with increased visceral adipose tissue, BMI, higher incidence of metabolic syndrome (MetS), and increased di- and triglycerides despite having higher CD4+T-cell counts than the other two clusters. However, the HC-like and the severe at-risk group had a similar metabolic profile differing from HIV-negative controls (HNC), with dysregulation of amino acid metabolism. At the microbiome profile, the HC-like group had a lower α-diversity, a lower proportion of men having sex with men (MSM) and was enriched in Bacteroides. In contrast, in at-risk groups, there was an increase inPrevotella, with a high proportion of MSM, which could potentially lead to higher systemic inflammation and increased cardiometabolic risk profile. The multi-omics integrative analysis also revealed a complex microbial interplay of the microbiome-associated metabolites in PWH. Those severely at-risk clusters may benefit from personalized medicine and lifestyle intervention to improve their dysregulated metabolic traits, aiming to achieve healthier aging.",36794912,PMC10017104,10.7554/eLife.82785,2,eLife,101579614,8.713
Integrated Network Discovery Using Multi-Proteomic Data,"A fundamental goal of systems biology is to seek a better understanding of the cell's molecular mechanisms. Experimentalists most frequently rely upon reductionist methods to isolate and analyze discrete signaling compartments, including subcellular domains, organelles, and protein-protein interactions. Among the systems-biology community, there is a growing need to integrate multiple datasets to resolve complex cellular networks. In this chapter, we share our procedures for the discovery of integrated signaling networks, across multi-proteomic data. Demonstrating these procedures, we provide an integrated analysis of the cellular proteome and extracellular (secretome) of human glioma LN229.",35612742,,10.1007/978-1-0716-2124-0_12,0,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,0.0
"A tool for integrating genetic and mass spectrometry-based peptide data: Proteogenomics Viewer: PV: A genome browser-like tool, which includes MS data visualization and peptide identification parameters","In this manuscript we describe Proteogenomics Viewer, a web-based tool that collects MS peptide identification, indexes to genomic sequence and structure, assigns exon usage, reports the identified protein isoforms with genomic alignments and, most importantly, allows the inspection of MS2 information for proper peptide identification. It also provides all performed indexing to facilitate global analysis of the data. The relevance of such tool is that there has been an increase in the number of proteogenomic efforts to improve the annotation of both genomics and proteomics data, culminating with the release of the two human proteome drafts. It is now clear that mass spectrometry-based peptide identification of uncharacterized sequences, such as those resulting from unpredicted exon joints or non-coding regions, is still prone to a higher than expected false discovery rate. Therefore, proper visualization of the raw data and the corresponding genome alignments are fundamental for further data validation and interpretation.

Draft Assembly ofPhytophthora capsicifrom Long-Read Sequencing Uncovers Complexity,"Resolving complex plant pathogen genomes is important for identifying the genomic shifts associated with rapid adaptation to selective agents such as hosts and fungicides, yet assembling these genomes remains challenging and expensive.Phytophthora capsiciis an important, globally distributed plant pathogen that exhibits widespread fungicide resistance and a broad host range. As with other pathogenic oomycetes,P. capsicihas a complex life history and a complex genome. Here, we leverage Oxford Nanopore Technologies and existing short-read resources to rapidly generate a low-cost, improved assembly. We generated 10 Gbp from a single MinION flow cell resulting in >1.25 million reads with an N50of 13 kb. The resulting assembly is 95.2 Mbp in 424 scaffolds with an N50length of 313 kb. This assembly is approximately 30 Mbp bigger than the current reference genome of 64 Mbp. We confirmed this larger genome size using flow cytometry, with an estimated size of 110 Mbp. BUSCO analysis identified 97.4% complete orthologs (19.2% duplicated). Evolutionary analysis supports a recent whole-genome duplication in this group. Our work provides a blueprint for rapidly integrating benchtop long-read sequencing with existing short-read data, to dramatically improve assembly quality and integrity of complex genomes and offer novel insights into pathogen genome function and evolution.",31479390,,10.1094/MPMI-04-19-0103-TA,15,Molecular plant-microbe interactions : MPMI,9107902,3.422
Ten Years of Collaborative Progress in the Quest for Orthologs,"Accurate determination of the evolutionary relationships between genes is a foundational challenge in biology. Homology-evolutionary relatedness-is in many cases readily determined based on sequence similarity analysis. By contrast, whether or not two genes directly descended from a common ancestor by a speciation event (orthologs) or duplication event (paralogs) is more challenging, yet provides critical information on the history of a gene. Since 2009, this task has been the focus of the Quest for Orthologs (QFO) Consortium. The sixth QFO meeting took place in Okazaki, Japan in conjunction with the 67th National Institute for Basic Biology conference. Here, we report recent advances, applications, and oncoming challenges that were discussed during the conference. Steady progress has been made toward standardization and scalability of new and existing tools. A feature of the conference was the presentation of a panel of accessible tools for phylogenetic profiling and several developments to bring orthology beyond the gene unit-from domains to networks. This meeting brought into light several challenges to come: leveraging orthology computations to get the most of the incoming avalanche of genomic data, integrating orthology from domain to biological network levels, building better gene models, and adapting orthology approaches to the broad evolutionary and genomic diversity recognized in different forms of life and viruses.",33822172,PMC8321534,10.1093/molbev/msab098,13,Molecular biology and evolution,8501455,8.8
A comprehensive benchmark of graph-based genetic variant genotyping algorithms on plant genomes for creating an accurate ensemble pipeline,"Background:Although sequencing technologies have boosted the measurement of the genomic diversity of plant crops, it remains challenging to accurately genotype millions of genetic variants, especially structural variations, with only short reads. In recent years, many graph-based variation genotyping methods have been developed to address this issue and tested for human genomes. However, their performance in plant genomes remains largely elusive. Furthermore, pipelines integrating the advantages of current genotyping methods might be required, considering the different complexity of plant genomes.Results:Here we comprehensively evaluate eight such genotypers in different scenarios in terms of variant type and size, sequencing parameters, genomic context, and complexity, as well as graph size, using both simulated and real data sets from representative plant genomes. Our evaluation reveals that there are still great challenges to applying existing methods to plants, such as excessive repeats and variants or high resource consumption. Therefore, we propose a pipeline called Ensemble Variant Genotyper (EVG) that can achieve better genotyping performance in almost all experimental scenarios and comparably higher genotyping recall and precision even using 5× reads. Furthermore, we demonstrate that EVG is more robust with an increasing number of graphed genomes, especially for insertions and deletions.Conclusions:Our study will provide new insights into the development and application of graph-based genotyping algorithms. We conclude that EVG provides an accurate, unbiased, and cost-effective way for genotyping both small and large variations and will be potentially used in population-scale genotyping for large, repetitive, and heterozygous plant genomes.",38589937,PMC11003132,10.1186/s13059-024-03239-1,0,Genome biology,100960660,17.906
Molecular classification reveals the sensitivity of lung adenocarcinoma to radiotherapy and immunotherapy: multi-omics clustering based on similarity network fusion,"Background:Due to individual differences in tumors and immune systems, the response rate to immunotherapy is low in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients. Combinations with other therapeutic strategies improve the efficacy of immunotherapy in LUAD patients. Although radioimmunotherapy has been demonstrated to effectively suppress tumors, the underlying mechanisms still need to be investigated.Methods:Total RNA from LUAD cells was sequenced before and after radiotherapy to identify differentially expressed radiation-associated genes. The similarity network fusion (SNF) algorithm was applied for molecular classification based on radiation-related genes, immune-related genes, methylation data, and somatic mutation data. The changes in gene expression, prognosis, immune cell infiltration, radiosensitivity, chemosensitivity, and sensitivity to immunotherapy were assessed for each subtype.Results:We used the SNF algorithm and multi-omics data to divide TCGA-LUAD patients into three subtypes. Patients with the CS3 subtype had the best prognosis, while those with the CS1 and CS2 subtypes had poorer prognoses. Among the strains tested, CS2 exhibited the most elevated immune cell infiltration and expression of immune checkpoint genes, while CS1 exhibited the least. Patients in the CS2 subgroup were more likely to respond to PD-1 immunotherapy. The CS2 patients were most sensitive to docetaxel and cisplatin, while the CS1 patients were most sensitive to paclitaxel. Experimental validation of signature genes in the CS2 subtype showed that inhibiting the expression of RHCG and TRPA1 could enhance the sensitivity of lung cancer cells to radiation.Conclusions:In summary, this study identified a risk classifier based on multi-omics data that can guide treatment selection for LUAD patients.",38430394,PMC10908647,10.1007/s00262-024-03657-x,0,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,6.63
Comparative genome features and secondary metabolite biosynthetic potential of Kutzneria chonburiensis and other species of the genus Kutzneria,"Actinobacteria are well known as a rich source of diversity of bioactive secondary metabolites. Kutzneria, a rare actinobacteria belonging to the family Pseudonocardiaceae has abundance of secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) and is one of important source of natural products and worthy of priority investigation. Currently, Kutzneria chonburiensis SMC256Thas been the latest type-strain of the genus and its genome sequence has not been reported yet. Therefore, we present the first report of new complete genome sequence of SMC256T(genome size of 10.4 Mbp) with genome annotation and feature comparison between SMC256Tand other publicly available Kutzneria species. The results from comparative and functional genomic analyses regarding the phylogenomic and the clusters of orthologous groups of proteins (COGs) analyses indicated that SMC256Tis most closely related to Kutzneria sp. 744, Kutzneria kofuensis, Kutzneria sp. CA-103260 and Kutzneria buriramensis. Furthermore, a total of 322 BGCs were also detected and showed diversity among the Kutzneria genomes. Out of which, 38 clusters showing the best hit to the most known BGCs were predicted in the SMC256Tgenome. We observed that six clusters responsible for biosynthesis of antimicrobials/antitumor metabolites were strain-specific in Kutzneria chonburiensis. These putative metabolites include virginiamycin S1, lysolipin I, esmeraldin, rakicidin, aclacinomycin and streptoseomycin. Based on these findings, the genome of Kutzneria chonburiensis contains distinct and unidentified BGCs different from other members of the genus, and the use of integrative genomic-based approach would be a useful alternative effort to target, isolate and identify putative and undiscovered secondary metabolites suspected to have new and/or specific bioactivity in the Kutzneria.",37258607,PMC10232511,10.1038/s41598-023-36039-x,0,Scientific reports,101563288,4.996

We characterize GESP expression patterns, recurrent genomic alterations, essentiality, receptor-ligand interactions and therapeutic potential. We also find that mRNA expression of GESPs is cancer-type specific and positively correlates with protein expression, and that certain GESP subgroups function as common or specific essential genes for tumor cell growth. We also predict receptor-ligand interactions substantially deregulated in cancer and, using systems biology approaches, we identify cancer-specific GESPs with therapeutic potential.

Integrative analysis of omics summary data reveals putative mechanisms underlying complex traits,"The identification of genes and regulatory elements underlying the associations discovered by GWAS is essential to understanding the aetiology of complex traits (including diseases). Here, we demonstrate an analytical paradigm of prioritizing genes and regulatory elements at GWAS loci for follow-up functional studies. We perform an integrative analysis that uses summary-level SNP data from multi-omics studies to detect DNA methylation (DNAm) sites associated with gene expression and phenotype through shared genetic effects (i.e., pleiotropy). We identify pleiotropic associations between 7858 DNAm sites and 2733 genes. These DNAm sites are enriched in enhancers and promoters, and >40% of them are mapped to distal genes. Further pleiotropic association analyses, which link both the methylome and transcriptome to 12 complex traits, identify 149 DNAm sites and 66 genes, indicating a plausible mechanism whereby the effect of a genetic variant on phenotype is mediated by genetic regulation of transcription through DNAm.",29500431,PMC5834629,10.1038/s41467-018-03371-0,157,Nature communications,101528555,17.694
kESVR: An Ensemble Model for Drug Response Prediction in Precision Medicine Using Cancer Cell Lines Gene Expression,"Background:Cancer cell lines are frequently used in research as in-vitro tumor models. Genomic data and large-scale drug screening have accelerated the right drug selection for cancer patients. Accuracy in drug response prediction is crucial for success. Due to data-type diversity and big data volume, few methods can integrative and efficiently find the principal low-dimensional manifold of the high-dimensional cancer multi-omics data to predict drug response in precision medicine.Method:A novelty k-means Ensemble Support Vector Regression (kESVR) is developed to predict each drug response values for single patient based on cell-line gene expression data. The kESVR is a blend of supervised and unsupervised learning methods and is entirely data driven. It utilizes embedded clustering (Principal Component Analysis and k-means clustering) and local regression (Support Vector Regression) to predict drug response and obtain the global pattern while overcoming missing data and outliers' noise.Results:We compared the efficiency and accuracy of kESVR to 4 standard machine learning regression models: (1) simple linear regression, (2) support vector regression (3) random forest (quantile regression forest) and (4) back propagation neural network. Our results, which based on drug response across 610 cancer cells from Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) and Cancer Therapeutics Response Portal (CTRP v2), proved to have the highest accuracy (smallest mean squared error (MSE) measure). We next compared kESVR with existing 17 drug response prediction models based a varied range of methods such as regression, Bayesian inference, matrix factorization and deep learning. After ranking the 18 models based on their accuracy of prediction, kESVR ranks first (best performing) in majority (74%) of the time. As for the remaining (26%) cases, kESVR still ranked in the top five performing models.Conclusion:In this paper we introduce a novel model (kESVR) for drug response prediction using high dimensional cell-line gene expression data. This model outperforms current existing prediction models in terms of prediction accuracy and speed and overcomes overfitting. This can be used in future to develop a robust drug response prediction system for cancer patients using the cancer cell-lines guidance and multi-omics data.",34070793,PMC8229729,10.3390/genes12060844,1,Genes,101551097,4.141
Prospects of pan-genomics in barley,"The concept of a pan-genome refers to intraspecific diversity in genome content and structure, encompassing both genes and intergenic space. Pan-genomic studies employ a combination of de novo sequence assembly and reference-based alignment to discover and genotype structural variants. The large size and complex structure of Triticeae genomes were for a long time an obstacle for genomic research in barley and its relatives. Now that a reference genome is available, computational pipelines for high-quality sequence assembly are in place, and sequence costs continue to drop, investigations into the structural diversity of the barley genome seem within reach. Here, we review the recent progress on pan-genomics in the model grass Brachypodium distachyon, and the cereal crops rice and maize, and devise a multi-tiered strategy for a pan-genome project in barley. Our design involves: (1) the construction of high-quality de novo sequence assemblies for a small core set of representative genotypes, (2) short-read sequencing of a large diversity panel of genebank accessions to medium coverage and (3) the use of complementary methods such as chromosome-conformation capture sequencing and k-mer-based association genetics. The in silico representation of the barley pan-genome may inform about the mechanisms of structural genome evolution in the Triticeae and supplement quantitative genetics models of crop performance for better accuracy and predictive ability.",30446793,,10.1007/s00122-018-3234-z,20,TAG.

Evolution of bird genomes-a transposon's-eye view,"Birds, the most species-rich monophyletic group of land vertebrates, have been subject to some of the most intense sequencing efforts to date, making them an ideal case study for recent developments in genomics research. Here, we review how our understanding of bird genomes has changed with the recent sequencing of more than 75 species from all major avian taxa. We illuminate avian genome evolution from a previously neglected perspective: their repetitive genomic parasites, transposable elements (TEs) and endogenous viral elements (EVEs). We show that (1) birds are unique among vertebrates in terms of their genome organization; (2) information about the diversity of avian TEs and EVEs is changing rapidly; (3) flying birds have smaller genomes yet more TEs than flightless birds; (4) current second-generation genome assemblies fail to capture the variation in avian chromosome number and genome size determined with cytogenetics; (5) the genomic microcosm of bird-TE ""arms races"" has yet to be explored; and (6) upcoming third-generation genome assemblies suggest that birds exhibit stability in gene-rich regions and instability in TE-rich regions. We emphasize that integration of cytogenetics and single-molecule technologies with repeat-resolved genome assemblies is essential for understanding the evolution of (bird) genomes.",27997700,,10.1111/nyas.13295,65,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,7506858,6.499
TCGA-assembler 2: software pipeline for retrieval and processing of TCGA/CPTAC data,"Motivation:The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) program has produced huge amounts of cancer genomics data providing unprecedented opportunities for research. In 2014, we developed TCGA-Assembler, a software pipeline for retrieval and processing of public TCGA data. In 2016, TCGA data were transferred from the TCGA data portal to the Genomic Data Commons (GDCs), which is supported by a different set of data storage and retrieval mechanisms. In addition, new proteomics data of TCGA samples have been generated by the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) program, which were not available for downloading through TCGA-Assembler. It is desirable to acquire and integrate data from both GDC and CPTAC.Results:We develop TCGA-assembler 2 (TA2) to automatically download and integrate data from GDC and CPTAC.

Multi-omics profiling reveals potential alterations in rheumatoid arthritis with different disease activity levels,"Background:Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, systemic autoimmune inflammatory disease, the pathogenesis of which is not clear. Clinical remission, or decreased disease activity, is the aim of treatment for RA. However, our understanding of disease activity is inadequate, and clinical remission rates for RA are generally poor. In this study, we used multi-omics profiling to study potential alterations in rheumatoid arthritis with different disease activity levels.Methods:Fecal and plasma samples from 131 rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients and 50 healthy subjects were collected for 16S rRNA sequencing, internally transcribed spacer (ITS) sequencing, and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The PBMCS were also collected for RNA sequencing and whole exome sequencing (WES). The disease groups, based on 28 joints and ESR (DAS28), were divided into DAS28L, DAS28M, and DAS28H groups. Three random forest models were constructed and verified with an external validation cohort of 93 subjects.Results:Our findings revealed significant alterations in plasma metabolites and gut microbiota in RA patients with different disease activities. Moreover, plasma metabolites, especially lipid metabolites, demonstrated a significant correlation with the DAS28 score and also associations with gut bacteria and fungi. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of plasma metabolites and RNA sequencing data demonstrated alterations in the lipid metabolic pathway in RA progression. Whole exome sequencing (WES) results have shown that non-synonymous single nucleotide variants (nsSNV) of the HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DRB5 gene locus were associated with the disease activity of RA. Furthermore, we developed a disease classifier based on plasma metabolites and gut microbiota that effectively discriminated RA patients with different disease activity in both the discovery cohort and the external validation cohort.Conclusion:Overall, our multi-omics analysis confirmed that RA patients with different disease activity were altered in plasma metabolites, gut microbiota composition, transcript levels, and DNA. Our study identified the relationship between gut microbiota and plasma metabolites and RA disease activity, which may provide a novel therapeutic direction for improving the clinical remission rate of RA.",37138305,PMC10155393,10.1186/s13075-023-03049-z,5,Arthritis research & therapy,101154438,5.606
Genome Sequence of an Emerging Salmonella enterica Serovar Infantis and Genomic Comparison with Other S. Infantis Strains,"Salmonella enterica serovar Infantis (S. Infantis) is one of the dominant serovars of the bacterial pathogen S. enterica. In recent years, the number of human infections caused by S. Infantis has been increasing in many countries, and often the emerging population harbors a unique virulence-resistant megaplasmid called plasmid of emerging S. Infantis (pESI). Here, we report the complete gap-free genome sequence of the S. Infantis Israeli emerging clone and compare its chromosome and pESI sequences with other complete S. Infantis genomes. We show a conserved presence of the Salmonella pathogenicity islands 1-6, 9, 11, 12, and CS54 and a common integration of five bacteriophages in the S. Infantis chromosome. In contrast, we found variable presence of additionally three chromosomally integrated phages and eight modular regions in pESI, which contribute to the genetic and phenotypic diversity (including antimicrobial resistance) of this ubiquitous foodborne pathogen.",32145019,PMC7144548,10.1093/gbe/evaa048,15,Genome biology and evolution,101509707,4.065
Comprehensive multi-omics integration identifies differentially active enhancers during human brain development with clinical relevance,"Background:Non-coding regulatory elements (NCREs), such as enhancers, play a crucial role in gene regulation, and genetic aberrations in NCREs can lead to human disease, including brain disorders. The human brain is a complex organ that is susceptible to numerous disorders; many of these are caused by genetic changes, but a multitude remain currently unexplained. Understanding NCREs acting during brain development has the potential to shed light on previously unrecognized genetic causes of human brain disease. Despite immense community-wide efforts to understand the role of the non-coding genome and NCREs, annotating functional NCREs remains challenging.Methods:Here we performed an integrative computational analysis of virtually all currently available epigenome data sets related to human fetal brain.Results:Our in-depth analysis unravels 39,709 differentially active enhancers (DAEs) that show dynamic epigenomic rearrangement during early stages of human brain development, indicating likely biological function. Many of these DAEs are linked to clinically relevant genes, and functional validation of selected DAEs in cell models and zebrafish confirms their role in gene regulation. Compared to enhancers without dynamic epigenomic rearrangement, DAEs are subjected to higher sequence constraints in humans, have distinct sequence characteristics and are bound by a distinct transcription factor landscape. DAEs are enriched for GWAS loci for brain-related traits and for genetic variation found in individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism.Conclusion:This compendium of high-confidence enhancers will assist in deciphering the mechanism behind developmental genetics of human brain and will be relevant to uncover missing heritability in human genetic brain disorders.",34663447,PMC8524963,10.1186/s13073-021-00980-1,6,Genome medicine,101475844,15.266
The Hologenome Concept: Helpful or Hollow?,"With the increasing appreciation for the crucial roles that microbial symbionts play in the development and fitness of plant and animal hosts, there has been a recent push to interpret evolution through the lens of the ""hologenome""--the collective genomic content of a host and its microbiome. But how symbionts evolve and, particularly, whether they undergo natural selection to benefit hosts are complex issues that are associated with several misconceptions about evolutionary processes in host-associated microbial communities. Microorganisms can have intimate, ancient, and/or mutualistic associations with hosts without having undergone natural selection to benefit hosts. Likewise, observing host-specific microbial community composition or greater community similarity among more closely related hosts does not imply that symbionts have coevolved with hosts, let alone that they have evolved for the benefit of the host. Although selection at the level of the symbiotic community, or hologenome, occurs in some cases, it should not be accepted as the null hypothesis for explaining features of host-symbiont associations.",26636661,PMC4670207,10.1371/journal.pbio.1002311,153,PLoS biology,101183755,9.593
SASpector: analysis of missing genomic regions in draft genomes of prokaryotes,"Summary:Missing regions in short-read assemblies of prokaryote genomes are often attributed to biases in sequencing technologies and to repetitive elements, the former resulting in low sequencing coverage of certain loci and the latter to unresolved loops in the de novo assembly graph. We developed SASpector, a command-line tool that compares short-read assemblies (draft genomes) to their corresponding closed assemblies and extracts missing regions to analyze them at the sequence and functional level. SASpector allows to benchmark the need for resolved genomes, can be integrated into pipelines to control the quality of assemblies, and could be used for comparative investigations of missingness in assemblies for which both short-read and long-read data are available in the public databases.Availability and implementation:SASpector is available at https://github.com/LoGT-KULeuven/SASpector. The tool is implemented in Python3 and available through pip and Docker (0mician/saspector).Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",35561201,PMC9113259,10.1093/bioinformatics/btac208,0,"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",9808944,6.931
Apollo: Democratizing genome annotation,"Genome annotation is the process of identifying the location and function of a genome's encoded features. Improving the biological accuracy of annotation is a complex and iterative process requiring researchers to review and incorporate multiple sources of information such as transcriptome alignments, predictive models based on sequence profiles, and comparisons to features found in related organisms. Because rapidly decreasing costs are enabling an ever-growing number of scientists to incorporate sequencing as a routine laboratory technique, there is widespread demand for tools that can assist in the deliberative analytical review of genomic information. To this end, we present Apollo, an open source software package that enables researchers to efficiently inspect and refine the precise structure and role of genomic features in a graphical browser-based platform. Some of Apollo's newer user interface features include support for real-time collaboration, allowing distributed users to simultaneously edit the same encoded features while also instantly seeing the updates made by other researchers on the same region in a manner similar to Google Docs. Its technical architecture enables Apollo to be integrated into multiple existing genomic analysis pipelines and heterogeneous laboratory workflow platforms. Finally, we consider the implications that Apollo and related applications may have on how the results of genome research are published and made accessible.",30726205,PMC6380598,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006790,125,PLoS computational biology,101238922,4.779
Sequencing smart: De novo sequencing and assembly approaches for a non-model mammal,"Background:Whilst much sequencing effort has focused on key mammalian model organisms such as mouse and human, little is known about the relationship between genome sequencing techniques for non-model mammals and genome assembly quality. This is especially relevant to non-model mammals, where the samples to be sequenced are often degraded and of low quality. A key aspect when planning a genome project is the choice of sequencing data to generate. This decision is driven by several factors, including the biological questions being asked, the quality of DNA available, and the availability of funds. Cutting-edge sequencing technologies now make it possible to achieve highly contiguous, chromosome-level genome assemblies, but rely on high-quality high molecular weight DNA. However, funding is often insufficient for many independent research groups to use these techniques. Here we use a range of different genomic technologies generated from a roadkill European polecat (Mustela putorius) to assess various assembly techniques on this low-quality sample. We evaluated different approaches for de novo assemblies and discuss their value in relation to biological analyses.Results:Generally, assemblies containing more data types achieved better scores in our ranking system. However, when accounting for misassemblies, this was not always the case for Bionano and low-coverage 10x Genomics (for scaffolding only). We also find that the extra cost associated with combining multiple data types is not necessarily associated with better genome assemblies.Conclusions:The high degree of variability between each de novo assembly method (assessed from the 7 key metrics) highlights the importance of carefully devising the sequencing strategy to be able to carry out the desired analysis. Adding more data to genome assemblies does not always result in better assemblies, so it is important to understand the nuances of genomic data integration explained here, in order to obtain cost-effective value for money when sequencing genomes.",32396200,PMC7216774,10.1093/gigascience/giaa045,9,GigaScience,101596872,7.658
Target enrichment of long open reading frames and ultraconserved elements to link microevolution and macroevolution in non-model organisms,"Despite the increasing accessibility of high-throughput sequencing, obtaining high-quality genomic data on non-model organisms without proximate well-assembled and annotated genomes remains challenging. Here, we describe a workflow that takes advantage of distant genomic resources and ingroup transcriptomes to select and jointly enrich long open reading frames (ORFs) and ultraconserved elements (UCEs) from genomic samples for integrative studies of microevolutionary and macroevolutionary dynamics. This workflow is applied to samples of the African unionid bivalve tribe Coelaturini (Parreysiinae) at basin and continent-wide scales. Our results indicate that ORFs are efficiently captured without prior identification of intron-exon boundaries. The enrichment of UCEs was less successful, but nevertheless produced substantial data sets. Exploratory continent-wide phylogenetic analyses with ORF supercontigs (>515,000 parsimony informative sites) resulted in a fully resolved phylogeny, the backbone of which was also retrieved with UCEs (>11,000 informative sites). Variant calling on ORFs and UCEs of Coelaturini from the Malawi Basin produced ~2000 SNPs per population pair. Estimates of nucleotide diversity and population differentiation were similar for ORFs and UCEs. They were low compared to previous estimates in molluscs, but comparable to those in recently diversifying Malawi cichlids and other taxa at an early stage of speciation. Skimming off-target sequence data from the same enriched libraries of Coelaturini from the Malawi Basin, we reconstructed the maternally-inherited mitogenome, which displays the gene order inferred for the most recent common ancestor of Unionidae. Overall, our workflow and results provide exciting perspectives for integrative genomic studies of microevolutionary and macroevolutionary dynamics in non-model organisms.",36349833,,10.1111/1755-0998.13735,0,Molecular ecology resources,101465604,8.678
"NanoForms: an integrated server for processing, analysis and assembly of raw sequencing data of microbial genomes, from Oxford Nanopore technology","Background:Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) techniques dominate today's landscape of genetics and genomics research. Though Illumina still dominates worldwide sequencing, Oxford Nanopore is one of the leading technologies currently being used by biologists, medics and geneticists across various applications. Oxford Nanopore is automated and relatively simple for conducting experiments, but generates gigabytes of raw data, to be processed by often ambiguous set of alternative bioinformatics command-line tools, and genomics frameworks which require a knowledge of bioinformatics to run.Results:We established an inter-collegiate collaboration across experimentalists and bioinformaticians in order to provide a novel bioinformatics tool, free for academics. This tool allows people without extensive bioinformatics knowledge to simply process their raw genome sequencing data. Currently, due to ICT resources' maintenance reasons, our server is only capable of handling small genomes (up to 15 Mb). In this paper, we introduce our tool, NanoForms: an intuitive and integrated web server for the processing and analysis of raw prokaryotic genome data, coming from Oxford Nanopore.

PathwayPCA: an R/Bioconductor Package for Pathway Based Integrative Analysis of Multi-Omics Data,"The authors present pathwayPCA, an R/Bioconductor package for integrative pathway analysis that utilizes modern statistical methodology, including supervised and adaptive, elastic-net, sparse principal component analysis. pathwayPCA can be applied to continuous, binary, and survival outcomes in studies with multiple covariates and/or interaction effects. It outperforms several alternative methods at identifying disease-associated pathways in integrative analysis using both simulated and real datasets. In addition, several case studies are provided to illustrate pathwayPCA analysis with gene selection, estimating, and visualizing sample-specific pathway activities, identifying sex-specific pathway effects in kidney cancer, and building integrative models for predicting patient prognosis. pathwayPCA is an open-source R package, freely available through the Bioconductor repository. pathwayPCA is expected to be a useful tool for empowering the wider scientific community to analyze and interpret the wealth of available proteomics data, along with other types of molecular data recently made available by Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium and other large consortiums.",32430990,PMC7677175,10.1002/pmic.201900409,7,Proteomics,101092707,5.393
clipplotr-a comparative visualization and analysis tool for CLIP data,"CLIP technologies are now widely used to study RNA-protein interactions and many data sets are now publicly available. An important first step in CLIP data exploration is the visual inspection and assessment of processed genomic data on selected genes or regions and performing comparisons: either across conditions within a particular project, or incorporating publicly available data. However, the output files produced by data processing pipelines or preprocessed files available to download from data repositories are often not suitable for direct comparison and usually need further processing. Furthermore, to derive biological insight it is usually necessary to visualize a CLIP signal alongside other data such as annotations, or orthogonal functional genomic data (e.g., RNA-seq). We have developed a simple, but powerful, command-line tool:clipplotr, which facilitates these visual comparative and integrative analyses with normalization and smoothing options for CLIP data and the ability to show these alongside reference annotation tracks and functional genomic data. These data can be supplied as input toclipplotrin a range of file formats, which will output a publication quality figure.

Foodomics for human health: current status and perspectives,"In the post-genomic era, the opportunity to combine and integrate cutting-edge analytical platforms and data processing systems allowed the birth of foodomics, 'a discipline that studies the Food and Nutrition domains through the application of advanced omics technologies to improve consumer's well-being, health, and confidence'. Since then, this discipline has rapidly evolved and researchers are now facing the daunting tasks to meet consumers' needs in terms of food traceability, sustainability, quality, safety and integrity. Most importantly, today it is imperative to provide solid evidence of the mechanisms through which food can promote human health and well-being. Areas covered: In this review, the complex relationships connecting food, nutrition and human health will be discussed, with emphasis on the relapses for the development of functional foods and nutraceuticals, personalized nutrition approaches, and the study of the interplay among gut microbiota, diet and health/diseases. Expert commentary: Evidence has been provided supporting the role of various omic platforms in studying the health-promoting effects of food and customized dietary interventions. However, although associated to major analytical challenges, only the proper integration of multi-omics studies and the implementation of bioinformatics tools and databases will help translate findings from clinical practice into effective personalized treatment strategies.",29271263,,10.1080/14789450.2018.1421072,14,Expert review of proteomics,101223548,4.25
SVmine improves structural variation detection by integrative mining of predictions from multiple algorithms,"Motivation:Structural variation (SV) is an important class of genomic variations in human genomes. A number of SV detection algorithms based on high-throughput sequencing data have been developed, but they have various and often limited level of sensitivity, specificity and breakpoint resolution. Furthermore, since overlaps between predictions of algorithms are low, SV detection based on multiple algorithms, an often-used strategy in real applications, has little effect in improving the performance of SV detection.Results:We develop a computational tool called SVmine for further mining of SV predictions from multiple tools to improve the performance of SV detection. SVmine refines SV predictions by performing local realignment and assess quality of SV predictions based on likelihoods of the realignments. The local realignment is performed against a set of sequences constructed from the reference sequence near the candidate SV by incorporating nearby single nucleotide variations, insertions and deletions. A sandwich alignment algorithm is further used to improve the accuracy of breakpoint positions. We evaluate SVmine on a set of simulated data and real data and find that SVmine has superior sensitivity, specificity and breakpoint estimation accuracy. We also find that SVmine can significantly improve overlaps of SV predictions from other algorithms.Availability and implementation:SVmine is available at https://github.com/xyc0813/SVmine.Contact:ruibinxi@math.pku.edu.cn.Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",29036467,,10.1093/bioinformatics/btx455,3,"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",9808944,6.931
Genic insights from integrated human proteomics in GeneCards,"GeneCards is a one-stop shop for searchable human gene annotations (http://www.genecards.org/). Data are automatically mined from ∼120 sources and presented in an integrated web card for every human gene. We report the application of recent advances in proteomics to enhance gene annotation and classification in GeneCards. First, we constructed the Human Integrated Protein Expression Database (HIPED), a unified database of protein abundance in human tissues, based on the publically available mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics sources ProteomicsDB, Multi-Omics Profiling Expression Database, Protein Abundance Across Organisms and The MaxQuant DataBase. The integrated database, residing within GeneCards, compares favourably with its individual sources, covering nearly 90% of human protein-coding genes. For gene annotation and comparisons, we first defined a protein expression vector for each gene, based on normalized abundances in 69 normal human tissues. This vector is portrayed in the GeneCards expression section as a bar graph, allowing visual inspection and comparison. These data are juxtaposed with transcriptome bar graphs. Using the protein expression vectors, we further defined a pairwise metric that helps assess expression-based pairwise proximity. This new metric for finding functional partners complements eight others, including sharing of pathways, gene ontology (GO) terms and domains, implemented in the GeneCards Suite. In parallel, we calculated proteome-based differential expression, highlighting a subset of tissues that overexpress a gene and subserving gene classification. This textual annotation allows users of VarElect, the suite's next-generation phenotyper, to more effectively discover causative disease variants. Finally, we define the protein-RNA expression ratio and correlation as yet another attribute of every gene in each tissue, adding further annotative information. The results constitute a significant enhancement of several GeneCards sections and help promote and organize the genome-wide structural and functional knowledge of the human proteome.

Integrating genomics for chickpea improvement: achievements and opportunities,"Integration of genomic technologies with breeding efforts have been used in recent years for chickpea improvement. Modern breeding along with low cost genotyping platforms have potential to further accelerate chickpea improvement efforts. The implementation of novel breeding technologies is expected to contribute substantial improvements in crop productivity. While conventional breeding methods have led to development of more than 200 improved chickpea varieties in the past, still there is ample scope to increase productivity. It is predicted that integration of modern genomic resources with conventional breeding efforts will help in the delivery of climate-resilient chickpea varieties in comparatively less time. Recent advances in genomics tools and technologies have facilitated the generation of large-scale sequencing and genotyping data sets in chickpea. Combined analysis of high-resolution phenotypic and genetic data is paving the way for identifying genes and biological pathways associated with breeding-related traits. Genomics technologies have been used to develop diagnostic markers for use in marker-assisted backcrossing programmes, which have yielded several molecular breeding products in chickpea. We anticipate that a sequence-based holistic breeding approach, including the integration of functional omics, parental selection, forward breeding and genome-wide selection, will bring a paradigm shift in development of superior chickpea varieties. There is a need to integrate the knowledge generated by modern genomics technologies with molecular breeding efforts to bridge the genome-to-phenome gap. Here, we review recent advances that have led to new possibilities for developing and screening breeding populations, and provide strategies for enhancing the selection efficiency and accelerating the rate of genetic gain in chickpea.",32253478,PMC7214385,10.1007/s00122-020-03584-2,41,TAG.

A High-Quality Genome Assembly of Striped Catfish (Pangasianodon hypophthalmus) Based on Highly Accurate Long-Read HiFi Sequencing Data,"The HiFi sequencing technology yields highly accurate long-read data with accuracies greater than 99.9% that can be used to improve results for complex applications such as genome assembly. Our study presents a high-quality chromosome-scale genome assembly of striped catfish (Pangasianodon hypophthalmus), a commercially important species cultured mainly in Vietnam, integrating HiFi reads and Hi-C data. A 788.4 Mb genome containing 381 scaffolds with an N50 length of 21.8 Mb has been obtained from HiFi reads. These scaffolds have been further ordered and clustered into 30 chromosome groups, ranging from 1.4 to 57.6 Mb, based on Hi-C data. The present updated assembly has a contig N50 of 14.7 Mb, representing a 245-fold and 4.2-fold improvement over the previous Illumina and Illumina-Nanopore-Hi-C based version, respectively. In addition, the proportion of repeat elements and BUSCO genes identified in our genome is remarkably higher than in the two previously released striped catfish genomes. These results highlight the power of using HiFi reads to assemble the highly repetitive regions and to improve the quality of genome assembly. The updated, high-quality genome assembled in this work will provide a valuable genomic resource for future population genetics, conservation biology and selective breeding studies of striped catfish.",35627308,PMC9141817,10.3390/genes13050923,1,Genes,101551097,4.141
Exploring the molecular basis of age-related disease comorbidities using a multi-omics graphical model,"Although association studies have unveiled numerous correlations of biochemical markers with age and age-related diseases, we still lack an understanding of their mutual dependencies. To find molecular pathways that underlie age-related diseases as well as their comorbidities, we integrated aging markers from four different high-throughput omics datasets, namely epigenomics, transcriptomics, glycomics and metabolomics, with a comprehensive set of disease phenotypes from 510 participants of the TwinsUK cohort. We used graphical random forests to assess conditional dependencies between omics markers and phenotypes while eliminating mediated associations. Applying this novel approach for multi-omics data integration yields a model consisting of seven modules that represent distinct aspects of aging. These modules are connected by hubs that potentially trigger comorbidities of age-related diseases. As an example, we identified urate as one of these key players mediating the comorbidity of renal disease with body composition and obesity. Body composition variables are in turn associated with inflammatory IgG markers, mediated by the expression of the hormone oxytocin. Thus, oxytocin potentially contributes to the development of chronic low-grade inflammation, which often accompanies obesity. Our multi-omics graphical model demonstrates the interconnectivity of age-related diseases and highlights molecular markers of the aging process that might drive disease comorbidities.",27886242,PMC5122881,10.1038/srep37646,26,Scientific reports,101563288,4.996
OpenXGR: a web-server update for genomic summary data interpretation,"How to effectively convert genomic summary data into downstream knowledge discovery represents a major challenge in human genomics research.

Genomic Tackling of Human Satellite DNA: Breaking Barriers through Time,"(Peri)centromeric repetitive sequences and, more specifically, satellite DNA (satDNA) sequences, constitute a major human genomic component. SatDNA sequences can vary on a large number of features, including nucleotide composition, complexity, and abundance. Several satDNA families have been identified and characterized in the human genome through time, albeit at different speeds. Human satDNA families present a high degree of sub-variability, leading to the definition of various subfamilies with different organization and clustered localization. Evolution of satDNA analysis has enabled the progressive characterization of satDNA features. Despite recent advances in the sequencing of centromeric arrays, comprehensive genomic studies to assess their variability are still required to provide accurate and proportional representation of satDNA (peri)centromeric/acrocentric short arm sequences. Approaches combining multiple techniques have been successfully applied and seem to be the path to follow for generating integrated knowledge in the promising field of human satDNA biology.",33946766,PMC8125562,10.3390/ijms22094707,6,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,6.208

Single-cell multi-omics sequencing reveals chromosome copy number inconsistency between trophectoderm and inner cell mass in human reconstituted embryos after spindle transfer,"Study question:Is the chromosome copy number of the trophectoderm (TE) of a human reconstituted embryos after spindle transfer (ST) representative of the inner cell mass (ICM)?Summary answer:Single-cell multi-omics sequencing revealed that ST blastocysts have a higher proportion of cell lineages exhibiting intermediate mosaicism than conventional ICSI blastocysts, and that the TE of ST blastocysts does not represent the chromosome copy number of ICM.What is known already:Preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidy (PGT-A) assumes that TE biopsies are representative of the ICM, but the TE and ICM originate from different cell lineages, and concordance between TE and ICM is not well-studied, especially in ST embryos.Study design, size, duration:We recruited 30 infertile women who received treatment at our clinic and obtained 45 usable blastocysts (22 from conventional ICSI and 23 reconstituted embryos after ST). We performed single-cell multi-omics sequencing on all blastocysts to predict and verify copy number variations (CNVs) in each cell. We determined the chromosome copy number of each embryo by analysing the proportion of abnormal cells in each blastocyst. We used the Bland-Altman concordance and the Kappa test to evaluate the concordance between TE and ICM in the both groups.Participants/materials, setting, methods:The study was conducted at a public tertiary hospital in China, where all the embryo operations, including oocytes retrieval, ST, and ICSI, were performed in the embryo laboratory. We utilized single-cell multi-omics sequencing technology at the Biomedical Pioneering Innovation Center, School of Life Sciences, Peking University, to analyse the blastocysts. Transcriptome sequencing was used to predict the CNV of each cell through bioinformatics analysis, and the results were validated using the DNA methylation library of each cell to confirm chromosomal normalcy. We conducted statistical analysis and graphical plotting using R 4.2.1, SPSS 27, and GraphPad Prism 9.3.Main results and the role of chance:Mean age of the volunteers, the blastocyst morphology, and the developmental ratewere similar in ST and ICSI groups. The blastocysts in the ST group had some additional chromosomal types that were prone to variations beyond those enriched in the blastocysts of the ICSI group. Finally, both Bland-Altman concordance test and kappa concordancetest showed good chromosomal concordance between TE and ICM in the ICSI blastocysts (kappa = 0.659, P < 0.05), but not in ST blastocysts (P = 1.000), suggesting that the TE in reconstituted embryos is not representative of ICM. Gene functional annotation (GO and KEGG analyses) suggests that there may be new or additional pathways for CNV generation in ST embryos compared to ICSI embryos.Limitations, reasons for caution:This study was mainly limited by the small sample size and the limitations of single-cell multi-omics sequencing technology. To select eligible single cells, some cells of the embryos were eliminated or not labelled, resulting in a loss of information about them. The findings of this study are innovative and exploratory. A larger sample size of human embryos (especially ST embryos) and more accurate molecular genetics techniques for detecting CNV in single cells are needed to validate our results.Wider implications of the findings:Our study justifies the routine clinical use of PGT-A in ICSI blastocysts, as we found that the TE is a good substitute for ICM in predicting chromosomal abnormalities. While PGT-A is not entirely accurate, our data demonstrate good clinical feasibility. This trial was able to provide correct genetic counselling to patients regarding the reliability of PGT-A. Regarding ST blastocysts, the increased mosaicism rate and the inability of the TE to represent the chromosomal copy number of the ICM are both biological characteristics that differentiate them from ICSI blastocysts. Currently, ST is not used clinically on a large scale to produce blastocysts. However, if ST becomes more widely used in the future, our study will be the first to demonstrate that the use of PGT-A in ST blastocysts may not be as accurate as PGT-A for ICSI blastocysts.Study funding/competing interest(s):This study was supported by grants from the National Key R&D Program of China (2018YFA0107601) and the National Key R&D Program of China (2018YFC1003003).

Integration site selection by retroviruses and transposable elements in eukaryotes,"Transposable elements and retroviruses are found in most genomes, can be pathogenic and are widely used as gene-delivery and functional genomics tools. Exploring whether these genetic elements target specific genomic sites for integration and how this preference is achieved is crucial to our understanding of genome evolution, somatic genome plasticity in cancer and ageing, host-parasite interactions and genome engineering applications. High-throughput profiling of integration sites by next-generation sequencing, combined with large-scale genomic data mining and cellular or biochemical approaches, has revealed that the insertions are usually non-random. The DNA sequence, chromatin and nuclear context, and cellular proteins cooperate in guiding integration in eukaryotic genomes, leading to a remarkable diversity of insertion site distribution and evolutionary strategies.",28286338,,10.1038/nrg.2017.7,117,Nature reviews.

Symposium review: Challenges and opportunities for evaluating and using the genetic potential of dairy cattle in the new era of sensor data from automation,"Sensor data from automation are becoming available on an increasingly large scale, and associated research is slowly starting to appear. This new era of sensor data from automation leads to many challenges but also new opportunities for assessing and maximizing the genetic potential of dairy cattle. The first challenge is data quality, because all uses of sensor data require careful data quality validation, potentially using external references. The second issue is data accessibility. Indeed, sensor data generated from automation are often designed to be available on-farm in a given system. However, to make these data useful-for genetic improvement for example-the data must also be made available off-farm. By nature, sensor data often are very complex and diverse; therefore, a data consolidation and integration layer is required. Moreover, the traits we want to select have to be defined precisely when generated from these raw data. This approach is obviously also beneficial to limit the challenge of extremely high data volumes generated by sensors. An additional challenge is that sensors will always be deployed in a context of herd management; therefore, any efforts to make them useful should focus on both breeding and management. However, this challenge also leads to opportunities to use genomic predictions based on these novel data for breeding and management. Access to relevant phenotypes is crucial for every genomic evaluation system. The automatic generation of training data, on both the phenotypic and genomic levels, is a major opportunity to access novel, precise, continuously updated, and relevant data. If the challenges of bidirectional data transfer between farms and external databases can be solved, new opportunities for continuous genomic evaluations integrating genotypes and the most current local phenotypes can be expected to appear. Novel concepts such as federated learning may help to limit exchange of raw data and, therefore, data ownership issues, which is another important element limiting access to sensor data. Accurate genome-guided decision-making and genome-guided management of dairy cattle should be the ultimate way to add value to sensor data from automation. This could also be the major driving force to improve the cost-benefit relationship for sensor-based technologies, which is currently one of the major obstacles for large-scale use of available technologies.",30904300,,10.3168/jds.2018-15711,7,Journal of dairy science,2985126R,0.0
The promise of multi-omics and clinical data integration to identify and target personalized healthcare approaches in autism spectrum disorders,"Complex diseases are caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, creating a difficult challenge for diagnosis and defining subtypes. This review article describes how distinct disease subtypes can be identified through integration and analysis of clinical and multi-omics data. A broad shift toward molecular subtyping of disease using genetic and omics data has yielded successful results in cancer and other complex diseases. To determine molecular subtypes, patients are first classified by applying clustering methods to different types of omics data, then these results are integrated with clinical data to characterize distinct disease subtypes. An example of this molecular-data-first approach is in research on Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), a spectrum of social communication disorders marked by tremendous etiological and phenotypic heterogeneity. In the case of ASD, omics data such as exome sequences and gene and protein expression data are combined with clinical data such as psychometric testing and imaging to enable subtype identification. Novel ASD subtypes have been proposed, such as CHD8, using this molecular subtyping approach. Broader use of molecular subtyping in complex disease research is impeded by data heterogeneity, diversity of standards, and ineffective analysis tools. The future of molecular subtyping for ASD and other complex diseases calls for an integrated resource to identify disease mechanisms, classify new patients, and inform effective treatment options. This in turn will empower and accelerate precision medicine and personalized healthcare.",25831060,PMC4389910,10.1089/omi.2015.0020,31,Omics : a journal of integrative biology,101131135,3.978
INTERPIN: A repository for intrinsic transcription termination hairpins in bacteria,"The large-scale detection of putative intrinsic transcription terminators is limited to only a few bacteria currently. We discovered a group of hairpins, called cluster hairpins, present within 15 nucleotides from each other. These are expected to work in tandem to cause intrinsic transcription termination (ITT), while the single hairpin can do the same alone. Therefore, exploring these ITT sites and the hairpins across bacterial genomes becomes highly desirable. INTERPIN is the largest archived collection of in silico inferred ITT hairpins in bacteria, covering 12745 bacterial genomes and encompassing ten bacterial phyla for ∼25 million hairpins. Users can obtain details on operons, individual cluster, and single ITT hairpins that were screened therein. Integrated Genome Viewer (IGV) software interactively visualizes hairpin secondary and tertiary structures in the genomic context. We also discuss statistics for the occurrence of cluster or single hairpins and other termination alternatives while showing the validation of predicted hairpins against in vivo detected hairpins. The database is freely available at http://pallab.cds.iisc.ac.in/INTERPIN/. INTERPIN (database and software) can make predictions for both AT and GC-rich genomes, which has not been achieved by any other program so far. It can also be used to improve genome annotation as well as to get predictions to improve the understanding of the ITT pathway by further analysis.",37499897,,10.1016/j.biochi.2023.07.018,0,Biochimie,1264604,4.372
HiFine: integrating Hi-C-based and shotgun-based methods to refine binning of metagenomic contigs,"Motivation:Metagenomic binning aims to retrieve microbial genomes directly from ecosystems by clustering metagenomic contigs assembled from short reads into draft genomic bins. Traditional shotgun-based binning methods depend on the contigs' composition and abundance profiles and are impaired by the paucity of enough samples to construct reliable co-abundance profiles. When applied to a single sample, shotgun-based binning methods struggle to distinguish closely related species only using composition information. As an alternative binning approach, Hi-C-based binning employs metagenomic Hi-C technique to measure the proximity contacts between metagenomic fragments. However, spurious inter-species Hi-C contacts inevitably generated by incorrect ligations of DNA fragments between species link the contigs from varying genomes, weakening the purity of final draft genomic bins. Therefore, it is imperative to develop a binning pipeline to overcome the shortcomings of both types of binning methods on a single sample.Results:We develop HiFine, a novel binning pipeline to refine the binning results of metagenomic contigs by integrating both Hi-C-based and shotgun-based binning tools. HiFine designs a strategy of fragmentation for the original bin sets derived from the Hi-C-based and shotgun-based binning methods, which considerably increases the purity of initial bins, followed by merging fragmented bins and recruiting unbinned contigs. We demonstrate that HiFine significantly improves the existing binning results of both types of binning methods and achieves better performance in constructing species genomes on publicly available datasets. To the best of our knowledge, HiFine is the first pipeline to integrate different types of tools for the binning of metagenomic contigs.Availability and implementation:HiFine is available at https://github.com/dyxstat/HiFine.Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",35482530,PMC9154269,10.1093/bioinformatics/btac295,1,"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",9808944,6.931
Multi-omics analysis revealing a senescence-relevant lncRNAs signature for the assessment of response to immunotherapy for breast cancer,"Breast cancer (BRCA) is the most fatal malignancy of women. Immunotherapy has greatly improved the prognosis of advanced BRCA. Cellular senescence contributes to tumorigenesis and suppresses anti-cancer immunity. Identification of senescence-relevant long noncoding RNAs (SRlncRNAs) signature may benefit the predictions of prognosis and response to immunotherapy of BRCA. RNA-seq, mutation, and clinical data of BRCA were acquired from public databases. SRlncRNAs were screened using univariate Cox regression analysis. Consensus clustering classified BRCA patients into 2 clusters, and the differences of overall survival (OS) and immune status between the 2 clusters were analyzed by survival analysis, CIBERSORT, and ESITIMATE. The SRlncRNAs signature was constructed by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analysis, and BRCA patients were divided into 2 risk groups. Enrichment analyses were performed to explore the cancer- and immunotherapy-relevant pathways. Transcriptome analysis was performed to investigate the differences of OS, immune infiltration, and ESITIMATE score of the 2 groups. Genome analysis was applied to investigate the differences of somatic mutation, tumor mutation burden (TMB) and microsatellite instability (MSI) between the 2 risk groups. A nomogram combined with calibration curves and decision curve analysis (DCA) was established for better clinical decision. Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE) score and IMvigor-210 were applied for the predicting of response to immunotherapy. Profiling Relative Inhibition Simultaneously in Mixtures (PRISM) and the Cancer Therapeutics Response Portal resource (CTRP) databases were used for drug susceptibility analysis. Ten prognostic SRlncRNAs were identified and BRCA patients were divided into 2 clusters. Cluster 1 had better OS with anti-tumor immune microenvironment. The high-risk BRCA had poorer OS in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) training cohort, which was also verified by TCGA validation cohort and GSE20685 validation cohort. Low-risk patients also had anti-tumor immune microenvironment. Genome analysis demonstrated that the high-risk group had significant higher TMB. High-risk BRCA were more susceptive to immunotherapy according to the TIDE score and IMvigor-210. Finally, drug susceptibility analysis showed that 6 compounds were sensitive to high-risk BRCA patients. We developed and verified an original SRlncRNAs signature by multi-omics analysis, which could serve as a prognosis and immunotherapy predictor for BRCA.",37443486,PMC10344520,10.1097/MD.0000000000034287,1,Medicine,2985248R,0.0

New approach for understanding genome variations in KEGG,"KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes; https://www.kegg.jp/ or https://www.genome.jp/kegg/) is a reference knowledge base for biological interpretation of genome sequences and other high-throughput data. It is an integrated database consisting of three generic categories of systems information, genomic information and chemical information, and an additional human-specific category of health information. KEGG pathway maps, BRITE hierarchies and KEGG modules have been developed as generic molecular networks with KEGG Orthology nodes of functional orthologs so that KEGG pathway mapping and other procedures can be applied to any cellular organism. Unfortunately, however, this generic approach was inadequate for knowledge representation in the health information category, where variations of human genomes, especially disease-related variations, had to be considered. Thus, we have introduced a new approach where human gene variants are explicitly incorporated into what we call 'network variants' in the recently released KEGG NETWORK database. This allows accumulation of knowledge about disease-related perturbed molecular networks caused not only by gene variants, but also by viruses and other pathogens, environmental factors and drugs. We expect that KEGG NETWORK will become another reference knowledge base for the basic understanding of disease mechanisms and practical use in clinical sequencing and drug development.",30321428,PMC6324070,10.1093/nar/gky962,902,Nucleic acids research,411011,19.16
Networking in microbes: conjugative elements and plasmids in the genus Alteromonas,"Background:To develop evolutionary models for the free living bacterium Alteromonas the genome sequences of isolates of the genus have been extensively analyzed. However, the main genetic exchange drivers in these microbes, conjugative elements (CEs), have not been considered in detail thus far. In this work, CEs have been searched in several complete Alteromonas genomes and their sequence studied to understand their role in the evolution of this genus. Six genomes are reported here for the first time.Results:We have found nine different plasmids of sizes ranging from 85 to 600 Kb, most of them were found in a single strain. Networks of gene similarity could be established among six of the plasmids that were also connected with another cluster of plasmids found in Shewanella strains. The cargo genes found in these plasmids included cassettes found before in chromosome flexible genomic islands of Alteromonas strains. We describe also the plasmids pAMCP48-600 and pAMCP49-600, the largest found in Alteromonas thus far (ca. 600 Kb) and containing all the hallmarks to be classified as chromids. We found in them some housekeeping genes and a cluster that code for an exocellular polysaccharide. They could represent the transport vectors for the previously described replacement flexible genomic islands. Integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs) were more common than plasmids and showed similar patterns of variation with cargo genes coding for components of additive flexible genomic islands. A nearly identical ICE was found in A. mediterranea MED64 and Vibrio cholera AHV1003 isolated from a human pathogen, indicating the potential exchange of these genes across phylogenetic distances exceeding the family threshold.Conclusion:We have seen evidence of how CEs can be vectors to transfer gene cassettes acquired in the chromosomal flexible genomic islands, both of the additive and replacement kind. These CEs showed evidence of how genetic material is exchanged among members of the same species but also (albeit less frequently) across genus and family barriers. These gradients of exchange frequency are probably one of the main drivers of species origin and maintenance in prokaryotes and also provide these taxa with large genetic diversity.",28056800,PMC5217437,10.1186/s12864-016-3461-0,12,BMC genomics,100965258,4.547
"Network-Based Integrative Analysis of Genomics, Epigenomics and Transcriptomics in Autism Spectrum Disorders","Current studies suggest that autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) may be caused by many genetic factors. In fact, collectively considering multiple studies aimed at characterizing the basic pathophysiology of ASDs, a large number of genes has been proposed. Addressing the problem of molecular data interpretation using gene networks helps to explain genetic heterogeneity in terms of shared pathways. Besides, the integrative analysis of multiple omics has emerged as an approach to provide a more comprehensive view of a disease. In this work, we carry out a network-based meta-analysis of the genes reported as associated with ASDs by studies that involved genomics, epigenomics, and transcriptomics. Collectively, our analysis provides a prioritization of the large number of genes proposed to be associated with ASDs, based on genes' relevance within the intracellular circuits, the strength of the supporting evidence of association with ASDs, and the number of different molecular alterations affecting genes. We discuss the presence of the prioritized genes in the SFARI (Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative) database and in gene networks associated with ASDs by other investigations. Lastly, we provide the full results of our analyses to encourage further studies on common targets amenable to therapy.",31323926,PMC6651137,10.3390/ijms20133363,3,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,6.208

It facilitates development of biological websites by providing tools to integrate and display biological data using the generic database schema, Chado, together with Drupal, a popular website creation and content management system. Tripal MapViewer is a new interactive tool for visualizing genetic map data. Developed as a Tripal replacement for Comparative Map Viewer (CMap), it enables visualization of entire maps or linkage groups and features such as molecular markers, quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and heritable phenotypic markers. It also provides graphical comparison of maps sharing the same markers as well as dot plot and correspondence matrices. MapViewer integrates directly with the Tripal application programming interface framework, improving data searching capability and providing a more seamless experience for site visitors. The Tripal MapViewer interface can be integrated in any Tripal map page and linked from any Tripal page for markers, QTLs, heritable morphological markers or genes. Configuration of the display is available through a control panel and the administration interface. The administration interface also allows configuration of the custom database query for building materialized views, providing better performance and flexibility in the way data is stored in the Chado database schema.

Constructing an Interactive and Integrated Analysis and Identification Platform for Pathogenic Microorganisms to Support Surveillance Capacity,"Introduction:Whole genome sequencing (WGS) holds significant promise for epidemiological inquiries, as it enables the identification and tracking of pathogenic origins and dissemination through comprehensive genome analysis. This method is widely preferred for investigating outbreaks and monitoring pathogen activity. However, the effective utilization of microbiome sequencing data remains a challenge for clinical and public health experts. Through the National Pathogen Resource Center, we have constructed a dynamic and interactive online analysis platform to facilitate the in-depth analysis and use of pathogen genomic data, by public health and associated professionals, to support infectious disease surveillance framework building and capacity warnings.Method:The platform was implemented using the Java programming language, and the front-end pages were developed using the VUE framework, following the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern to enable interactive service functionalities for front-end data collection and back-end data computation. Cloud computing services were employed to integrate biological information analysis tools for conducting fundamental analysis on sequencing data.Result:The platform achieved the goal of non-programming analysis, providing an interactive visual interface that allows users to visually obtain results by setting parameters in web pages. Moreover, the platform allows users to export results in various formats to further support their research.Discussion:We have established a dynamic and interactive online platform for bioinformatics analysis. By encapsulating the complex background experiments and analysis processes in a cloud-based service platform, the complex background experiments and analysis processes are presented to the end-user in a simple and interactive manner. It facilitates real-time data mining and analysis by allowing users to independently select parameters and generate analysis results at the click of a button, based on their needs, without the need for a programming foundation.",38136978,PMC10742832,10.3390/genes14122156,0,Genes,101551097,4.141
Detecting Structural Variants and Associated Gene Presence-Absence Variation Phenomena in the Genomes of Marine Organisms,"As complete genomes become easier to attain, even from previously difficult-to-sequence species, and as genomic resequencing becomes more routine, it is becoming obvious that genomic structural variation is more widespread than originally thought and plays an important role in maintaining genetic variation in populations. Structural variants (SVs) and associated gene presence-absence variation (PAV) can be important players in local adaptation, allowing the maintenance of genetic variation and taking part in other evolutionarily relevant phenomena. While recent studies have highlighted the importance of structural variation in Mollusca, the prevalence of this phenomenon in the broader context of marine organisms remains to be fully investigated.Here, we describe a straightforward and broadly applicable method for the identification of SVs in fully assembled diploid genomes, leveraging the same reads used for assembly. We also explain a gene PAV analysis protocol, which could be broadly applied to any species with a fully sequenced reference genome available. Although the strength of these approaches have been tested and proven in marine invertebrates, which tend to have high levels of heterozygosity, possibly due to their lifestyle traits, they are also applicable to other species across the tree of life, providing a ready means to begin investigations into this potentially widespread phenomena.",35727540,,10.1007/978-1-0716-2313-8_4,2,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,0.0
A novel prognostic model based on multi-omics features predicts the prognosis of colon cancer patients,"Background:As a common malignant tumor in the colon, colon cancer (CC) has high incidence and recurrence rates. This study is designed to build a prognostic model for CC.Methods:The gene expression dataset, microRNA-seq dataset, copy number variation (CNV) dataset, DNA methylation dataset, and transcription factor (TF) dataset of CC were downloaded from UCSC Xena database. Using limma package, the differentially methylated genes (DMGs), and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and miRNAs (DEMs) were identified. Based on random forest method, prognostic model for each omics dataset were constructed. After the omics features related to prognosis were selected using logrank test, the prognostic model based on multi-omics features was built. Finally, the clinical phenotypes correlated with prognosis were screened using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, and the nomogram model was established.Results:There were 1625 DEGs, 268 DEMs, and 386 DMGs between the tumor and normal samples. A total of 105, 29, 159, five, and six genes/sites significantly correlated with prognosis were identified in the gene expression dataset (GABRD), miRNA-seq dataset (miR-1271), CNV dataset (RN7SKP247), DNA methylation dataset (cg09170112 methylation site [located in SFSWAP]), and TF dataset (SIX5), respectively. The prognostic model based on multi-omics features was more effective than those based on single omics dataset. The number of lymph nodes, pathologic_M stage, and pathologic_T stage were the clinical phenotypes correlated with prognosis, based on which the nomogram model was constructed.Conclusion:The prognostic model based on multi-omics features and the nomogram model might be valuable for the prognostic prediction of CC.",32396280,PMC7336766,10.1002/mgg3.1255,4,Molecular genetics & genomic medicine,101603758,2.473
Multi-omics immune regulatory mechanisms in lung adenocarcinoma metastasis and survival time,"Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most common type of lung cancer. Despite previous research on immune mechanisms and related molecules in LUAD, the specific regulatory mechanisms of these molecules in the immune microenvironment remain unclear. Furthermore, the impact of regulatory genes or RNA on LUAD metastasis and survival time is yet to be understood. To address these gaps, we collected a substantial amount of data, including 17,226 gene expression profiles from 1,018 samples, 370,640 methylation sites from 461 samples, and 248 miRNAs from 513 samples. Our aim was to explore the genes, miRNAs, and methylation sites associated with LUAD progression. Leveraging the regulatory functions of miRNAs and methylation sites, we identified target and regulated genes. Through the utilization of LASSO and survival analysis, we pinpointed 22 key genes that play pivotal roles in the immune regulatory mechanism of LUAD. Notably, the expression levels of these 22 genes demonstrated significant discriminatory power in predicting LUAD patient survival time. Additionally, our deep learning model accurately predicted distant metastasis in LUAD patients using the expression levels of these genes. Further pathway enrichment analysis revealed that these 22 genes are significantly enriched in pathways closely linked to LUAD progression. Through Immune Infiltration Assay, we observed that T cell CD4 memory resting, monocytes, and macrophages.M2 were the three most abundant cell types in the immune microenvironment of LUAD. These cells are known to play crucial roles in tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis. Single-cell data analysis further validated the functional significance of these genes, indicating their involvement not only in immune cells but also in epithelial cells, showcasing significant differential expression. Overall, this study sheds light on the regulatory mechanisms underlying the immune microenvironment of LUAD by identifying key genes associated with LUAD progression. The findings provide insights into potential prognostic markers and therapeutic targets.",37586202,,10.1016/j.compbiomed.2023.107333,2,Computers in biology and medicine,1250250,6.698
TSEBRA: transcript selector for BRAKER,"Background:BRAKER is a suite of automatic pipelines, BRAKER1 and BRAKER2, for the accurate annotation of protein-coding genes in eukaryotic genomes. Each pipeline trains statistical models of protein-coding genes based on provided evidence and, then predicts protein-coding genes in genomic sequences using both the extrinsic evidence and statistical models. For training and prediction, BRAKER1 and BRAKER2 incorporate complementary extrinsic evidence: BRAKER1 uses only RNA-seq data while BRAKER2 uses only a database of cross-species proteins. The BRAKER suite has so far not been able to reliably exceed the accuracy of BRAKER1 and BRAKER2 when incorporating both types of evidence simultaneously. Currently, for a novel genome project where both RNA-seq and protein data are available, the best option is to run both pipelines independently, and to pick one, likely better output. Therefore, one or another type of the extrinsic evidence would remain unexploited.Results:We present TSEBRA, a software that selects gene predictions (transcripts) from the sets generated by BRAKER1 and BRAKER2. TSEBRA uses a set of rules to compare scores of overlapping transcripts based on their support by RNA-seq and homologous protein evidence. We show in computational experiments on genomes of 11 species that TSEBRA achieves higher accuracy than either BRAKER1 or BRAKER2 running alone and that TSEBRA compares favorably with the combiner tool EVidenceModeler.Conclusion:TSEBRA is an easy-to-use and fast software tool. It can be used in concert with the BRAKER pipeline to generate a gene prediction set supported by both RNA-seq and homologous protein evidence.",34823473,PMC8620231,10.1186/s12859-021-04482-0,54,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,3.307
DrivR-Base: a feature extraction toolkit for variant effect prediction model construction,"Motivation:Recent advancements in sequencing technologies have led to the discovery of numerous variants in the human genome. However, understanding their precise roles in diseases remains challenging due to their complex functional mechanisms. Various methodologies have emerged to predict the pathogenic significance of these genetic variants. Typically, these methods employ an integrative approach, leveraging diverse data sources that provide important insights into genomic function. Despite the abundance of publicly available data sources and databases, the process of navigating, extracting, and pre-processing features for machine learning models can be highly challenging and time-consuming. Furthermore, researchers often invest substantial effort in feature extraction, only to later discover that these features lack informativeness.Results:In this article, we introduce DrivR-Base, an innovative resource that efficiently extracts and integrates molecular information (features) related to single nucleotide variants. These features encompass information about the genomic positions and the associated protein positions of a variant. They are derived from a wide array of databases and tools, including structural properties obtained from AlphaFold, regulatory information sourced from ENCODE, and predicted variant consequences from Variant Effect Predictor. DrivR-Base is easily deployable via a Docker container to ensure reproducibility and ease of access across diverse computational environments. The resulting features can be used as input for machine learning models designed to predict the pathogenic impact of human genome variants in disease. Moreover, these feature sets have applications beyond this, including haploinsufficiency prediction and the development of drug repurposing tools. We describe the resource's development, practical applications, and potential for future expansion and enhancement.Availability and implementation:DrivR-Base source code is available at https://github.com/amyfrancis97/DrivR-Base.",38603611,PMC11057939,10.1093/bioinformatics/btae197,0,"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",9808944,6.931
MiDSystem: A comprehensive online system for de novo assembly and analysis of microbial genomes,"The substantial reduction in experimental cost of next-generation sequencing techniques makes it feasible to assemble a bacterial genome of unknown species de novo and acquire substantial genetic information from environmental samples. Many bioinformatics tools and algorithms have also been developed for prokaryotes, but complex parameter settings and command line-based user interfaces cause a significant entry barrier for novices. Efficient construction of pipelines that integrate all the available genomic data poses a major challenge to the understanding of unknown pathogens. MiDSystem is a comprehensive online system for analyzing genomic data from microbiomes. With a user-friendly interface, MiDSystem supports both de novo assembly and metagenomic analysis pipelines. It is designed to automatically analyze whole genome shotgun sequencing data of bacteria submitted by users. Multiple analytical steps can be performed directly on the system, and the results generated from the embedded tools are visualized in an online summary report to make it more interpretable. Constructing a genome de novo has gradually become the foundation of bacterial studies. Taking both single species and metagenomic samples into consideration, MiDSystem can greatly reduce the time and effort for analysis of bacterial genomic data.

Omics studies are enabling genotype-phenotype association studies which identify genetic determinants of pathogen virulence and drug resistance, as well as phylogenetic studies designed to track the origin and spread of disease outbreaks. These omics studies are complex and often employ multiple assay technologies including genomics, metagenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics. To maximize the impact of omics studies, it is essential that data be accompanied by detailed contextual metadata (e.g., specimen, spatial-temporal, phenotypic characteristics) in clear, organized, and consistent formats. Over the years, many metadata standards developed by various metadata standards initiatives have arisen; the Genomic Standards Consortium's minimal information standards (MIxS), the GSCID/BRC Project and Sample Application Standard. Some tools exist for tracking metadata, but they do not provide event based capabilities to configure, collect, validate, and distribute metadata. To address this gap in the scientific community, an event based data-driven application, OMeta, was created that allows users to quickly configure, collect, validate, distribute, and integrate metadata.Results:A data-driven web application, OMeta, has been developed for use by researchers consisting of a browser-based interface, a command-line interface (CLI), and server-side components that provide an intuitive platform for configuring, capturing, viewing, and sharing metadata. Project and sample metadata can be set based on existing standards or based on projects goals. Recorded information includes details on the biological samples, procedures, protocols, and experimental technologies, etc. This information can be organized based on events, including sample collection, sample quantification, sequencing assay, and analysis results. OMeta enables configuration in various presentation types: checkbox, file, drop-box, ontology, and fields can be configured to use the National Center for Biomedical Ontology (NCBO), a biomedical ontology server. Furthermore, OMeta maintains a complete audit trail of all changes made by users and allows metadata export in comma separated value (CSV) format for convenient deposition of data into public databases.Conclusions:We present, OMeta, a web-based software application that is built on data-driven principles for configuring and customizing data standards, capturing, curating, and sharing metadata.",30612540,PMC6322262,10.1186/s12859-018-2580-9,7,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,3.307
A syntelog-based pan-genome provides insights into rice domestication and de-domestication,"Background:Asian rice is one of the world's most widely cultivated crops. Large-scale resequencing analyses have been undertaken to explore the domestication and de-domestication genomic history of Asian rice, but the evolution of rice is still under debate.Results:Here, we construct a syntelog-based rice pan-genome by integrating and merging 74 high-accuracy genomes based on long-read sequencing, encompassing all ecotypes and taxa of Oryza sativa and Oryza rufipogon. Analyses of syntelog groups illustrate subspecies divergence in gene presence-and-absence and haplotype composition and identify massive genomic regions putatively introgressed from ancient Geng/japonica to ancient Xian/indica or its wild ancestor, including almost all well-known domestication genes and a 4.5-Mbp centromere-spanning block, supporting a single domestication event in main rice subspecies. Genomic comparisons between weedy and cultivated rice highlight the contribution from wild introgression to the emergence of de-domestication syndromes in weedy rice.Conclusions:This work highlights the significance of inter-taxa introgression in shaping diversification and divergence in rice evolution and provides an exploratory attempt by utilizing the advantages of pan-genomes in evolutionary studies.",37537691,PMC10401782,10.1186/s13059-023-03017-5,5,Genome biology,100960660,17.906
Dynamic Regulatory Event Mining by iDREM in Large-Scale Multi-omics Datasets During Biotic and Abiotic Stress in Plants,"The system-wide complexity of genome regulation encoding the organism phenotypic diversity is well understood. However, a major challenge persists about the appropriate method to describe the systematic dynamic genome regulation event utilizing enormous multi-omics datasets. Here, we describe Interactive Dynamic Regulatory Events Miner (iDREM) which reconstructs gene-regulatory networks from temporal transcriptome, proteome, and epigenome datasets during stress to envisage ""master"" regulators by simulating cascades of temporal transcription-regulatory and interactome events. The iDREM is a Java-based software that integrates static and time-series transcriptomics and proteomics datasets, transcription factor (TF)-target interactions, microRNA (miRNA)-target interaction, and protein-protein interactions to reconstruct temporal regulatory network and identify significant regulators in an unsupervised manner. The hidden Markov model detects specialized manipulated pathways as well as genes to recognize statistically significant regulators (TFs/miRNAs) that diverge in temporal activity. This method can be translated to any biotic or abiotic stress in plants and animals to predict the master regulators from condition-specific multi-omics datasets including host-pathogen interactions for comprehensive understanding of manipulated biological pathways.",34251627,,10.1007/978-1-0716-1534-8_12,2,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,0.0
Lineage-associated underrepresented permutations (LAUPs) of mammalian genomic sequences based on a Jellyfish-based LAUPs analysis application (JBLA),"Motivation:This study addresses several important questions related to naturally underrepresented sequences: (i) are there permutations of real genomic DNA sequences in a defined length (k-mer) and a given lineage that do not actually exist or underrepresented? (ii) If there are such sequences, what are their characteristics in terms of k-mer length and base composition? (iii) Are they related to CpG or TpA underrepresentation known for human sequences? We propose that the answers to these questions are of great significance for the study of sequence-associated regulatory mechanisms, such cytosine methylation and chromosomal structures in physiological or pathological conditions such as cancer.Results:We empirically defined sequences that were not included in any well-known public databases as lineage-associated underrepresented permutations (LAUPs). Then, we developed a Jellyfish-based LAUPs analysis application (JBLA) to investigate LAUPs for 24 representative species. The present discoveries include: (i) lengths for the shortest LAUPs, ranging from 10 to 14, which collectively constitute a low proportion of the genome. (ii) Common LAUPs showing higher CG content over the analysed mammalian genome and possessing distinct CG*CG motifs. (iii) Neither CpG-containing LAUPs nor CpG island sequences are randomly structured and distributed over the genomes; some LAUPs and most CpG-containing sequences exhibit an opposite trend within the same k and n variants. In addition, we demonstrate that the JBLA algorithm is more efficient than the original Jellyfish for computing LAUPs.Availability and implementation:We developed a Jellyfish-based LAUP analysis (JBLA) application by integrating Jellyfish (Marçais and Kingsford, 2011), MEME (Bailey, et al., 2009) and the NCBI genome database (Pruitt, et al., 2007) applications, which are listed as Supplementary Material.Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",29762634,,10.1093/bioinformatics/bty392,16,"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",9808944,6.931
Multi-omics computational analysis unveils the involvement of AP-1 and CTCF in hysteresis of chromatin states during macrophage polarization,"Macrophages display extreme plasticity, and the mechanisms and applications of polarization and de-/repolarization of macrophages have been extensively investigated. However, the regulation of macrophage hysteresis after de-/repolarization remains unclear. In this study, by using a large-scale computational analysis of macrophage multi-omics data, we report a list of hysteresis genes that maintain their expression patterns after polarization and de-/repolarization. While the polarization in M1 macrophages leads to a higher level of hysteresis in genes associated with cell cycle progression, cell migration, and enhancement of the immune response, we found weak levels of hysteresis after M2 polarization. During the polarization process from M0 to M1 and back to M0, the factors IRFs/STAT, AP-1, and CTCF regulate hysteresis by altering their binding sites to the chromatin. Overall, our results show that a history of polarization can lead to hysteresis in gene expression and chromatin accessibility over a given period. This study contributes to the understanding of de-/repolarization memory in macrophages.",38173717,PMC10761412,10.3389/fimmu.2023.1304778,0,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,8.786
Multi-omics Analyses Reveal Function of Apolipoprotein E in Alternative Splicing and Tumor Immune Microenvironment in Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma via Pan-cancer Analysis,"Apolipoprotein E (APOE) regulates lipid metabolism, associated with the development of various cancers. However, its precise prognostic significance and functions in alternative splicing and the tumor immune microenvironment remain unclear. In this study, we extracted APOE expression in pan-cancer from TCGA and analyzed mRNA transcriptome, cell lines, and protein levels. Furthermore, we analyzed the alternative splicing expression of the APOE gene transcript with prognostic profiles using the OncoSplicing database. We obtained 73 common APOE genes to perform functional enrichment analysis, assess the correlation between genes and immune cells using TIMER, EPIC, and ssGSEA methods, and examine the prognostic significance using the UALCAN database. Finally, single-cell data was employed to assess the correlation between APOE genes and cell functions. Our findings revealed that APOE expression varies across different tumor types and cancer cell lines. The alternative splicing analysis demonstrated that APOE transcript expression levels have prognostic value in cancers such as LGG, KIRC, and KIRP. Functional enrichment analysis indicated significant associations between APOE and various immune cells, such as macrophages, CD8 T cells, and NK cells, with significant implications for prognosis. Moreover, single-cell data indicated that APOE was primarily expressed in renal epithelial cells among stromal cells and in macrophages among immune cells, significantly negatively correlated with five functional states. Our study represents the first comprehensive exploration of APOE's function in pan-cancers and identifies APOE as a potential biomarker in cancer pathogenesis, prognosis, and immune therapeutic target.",38182861,,10.1007/s12013-023-01211-7,1,Cell biochemistry and biophysics,9701934,2.989
A Bayesian integrative approach for multi-platform genomic data: A kidney cancer case study,"Integration of genomic data from multiple platforms has the capability to increase precision, accuracy, and statistical power in the identification of prognostic biomarkers. A fundamental problem faced in many multi-platform studies is unbalanced sample sizes due to the inability to obtain measurements from all the platforms for all the patients in the study. We have developed a novel Bayesian approach that integrates multi-regression models to identify a small set of biomarkers that can accurately predict time-to-event outcomes. This method fully exploits the amount of available information across platforms and does not exclude any of the subjects from the analysis. Through simulations, we demonstrate the utility of our method and compare its performance to that of methods that do not borrow information across regression models. Motivated by The Cancer Genome Atlas kidney renal cell carcinoma dataset, our methodology provides novel insights missed by non-integrative models.",27669160,,10.1111/biom.12587,4,Biometrics,370625,1.701
Using Ancient Samples in Projection Analysis,"Projection analysis is a tool that extracts information from the joint allele frequency spectrum to better understand the relationship between two populations. In projection analysis, a test genome is compared to a set of genomes from a reference population. The projection's shape depends on the historical relationship of the test genome's population to the reference population. Here, we explore in greater depth the effects on the projection when ancient samples are included in the analysis. First, we conduct a series of simulations in which the ancient sample is directly ancestral to a present-day population (one-population model), or the ancient sample is ancestral to a sister population that diverged before the time of sampling (two-population model). We find that there are characteristic differences between the projections for the one-population and two-population models, which indicate that the projection can be used to determine whether a test genome is directly ancestral to a present-day population or not. Second, we compute projections for several published ancient genomes. We compare two Neanderthals and three ancient human genomes to European, Han Chinese and Yoruba reference panels. We use a previously constructed demographic model and insert these five ancient genomes to assess how well the observed projections are recovered.",26546309,PMC4704729,10.1534/g3.115.023788,4,"G3 (Bethesda, Md.)",101566598,3.542
"From genomics to metabolomics, moving toward an integrated strategy for the discovery of fungal secondary metabolites","Fungal secondary metabolites are defined by bioactive properties that ensure adaptation of the fungus to its environment. Although some of these natural products are promising sources of new lead compounds especially for the pharmaceutical industry, others pose risks to human and animal health. The identification of secondary metabolites is critical to assessing both the utility and risks of these compounds. Since fungi present biological specificities different from other microorganisms, this review covers the different strategies specifically used in fungal studies to perform this critical identification. Strategies focused on the direct detection of the secondary metabolites are firstly reported. Particularly, advances in high-throughput untargeted metabolomics have led to the generation of large datasets whose exploitation and interpretation generally require bioinformatics tools. Then, the genome-based methods used to study the entire fungal metabolic potential are reported. Transcriptomic and proteomic tools used in the discovery of fungal secondary metabolites are presented as links between genomic methods and metabolomic experiments. Finally, the influence of the culture environment on the synthesis of secondary metabolites by fungi is highlighted as a major factor to consider in research on fungal secondary metabolites. Through this review, we seek to emphasize that the discovery of natural products should integrate all of these valuable tools. Attention is also drawn to emerging technologies that will certainly revolutionize fungal research and to the use of computational tools that are necessary but whose results should be interpreted carefully.",29384544,,10.1039/c7np00032d,48,Natural product reports,8502408,15.111
Multi-omics inference of differential breast cancer-related transcriptional regulatory network gene hubs between young Black and White patients,"Objective:Breast cancers (BrCA) are a leading cause of illness and mortality worldwide. Black women have a higher incidence rate relative to white women prior to age 40 years, and a lower incidence rate after 50 years. The objective of this study is to identify -omics differences between the two breast cancer cohorts to better understand the disparities observed in patient outcomes.Materials and methods:Using Standard SQL, we queried ISB-CGC hosted Google BigQuery tables storing TCGA BrCA gene expression, methylation, and somatic mutation data and analyzed the combined multi-omics results using a variety of methods.Results:Among Stage II patients 50 years or younger, genes PIK3CA and CDH1 are more frequently mutated in White (W50) than in Black or African American patients (BAA50), while HUWE1, HYDIN, and FBXW7 mutations are more frequent in BAA50. Over-representation analysis (ORA) and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) results indicate that, among others, the Reactome Signaling by ROBO Receptors gene set is enriched in BAA50. Using the Virtual Inference of Protein-activity by Enriched Regulon analysis (VIPER) algorithm, putative top 20 master regulators identified include NUPR1, NFKBIL1, ZBTB17, TEAD1, EP300, TRAF6, CACTIN, and MID2. CACTIN and MID2 are of prognostic value. We identified driver genes, such as OTUB1, with suppressed expression whose DNA methylation status were inversely correlated with gene expression. Networks capturing microRNA and gene expression correlations identified notable microRNA hubs, such as miR-93 and miR-92a-2, expressed at higher levels in BAA50 than in W50.Discussion/conclusion:The results point to several driver genes as being involved in the observed differences between the cohorts. The findings here form the basis for further mechanistic exploration.",36410105,,10.1016/j.cancergen.2022.11.001,3,Cancer genetics,101539150,2.169
Proof-of-concept for incorporating mechanistic insights from multi-omics analyses of polymyxin B in combination with chloramphenicol against Klebsiella pneumoniae,"Carbapenemase-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP) resistant to multiple antibiotic classes necessitates optimized combination therapy. Our objective is to build a workflow leveraging omics and bacterial count data to identify antibiotic mechanisms that can be used to design and optimize combination regimens. For pharmacodynamic (PD) analysis, previously published static time-kill studies (J Antimicrob Chemother 70, 2015, 2589) were used with polymyxin B (PMB) and chloramphenicol (CHL) mono and combination therapy against three KP clinical isolates over 24 h. A mechanism-based model (MBM) was developed using time-kill data in S-ADAPT describing PMB-CHL PD activity against each isolate. Previously published results of PMB (1 mg/L continuous infusion) and CHL (Cmax: 8 mg/L; bolus q6h) mono and combination regimens were evaluated using an in vitro one-compartment dynamic infection model against a KP clinical isolate (108CFU/ml inoculum) over 24 h to obtain bacterial samples for multi-omics analyses. The differentially expressed genes and metabolites in these bacterial samples served as input to develop a partial least squares regression (PLSR) in R that links PD responses with the multi-omics responses via a multi-omics pathway analysis. PMB efficacy was increased when combined with CHL, and the MBM described the observed PD well for all strains. The PLSR consisted of 29 omics inputs and predicted MBM PD response (R2= 0.946). Our analysis found that CHL downregulated metabolites and genes pertinent to lipid A, hence limiting the emergence of PMB resistance. Our workflow linked insights from analysis of multi-omics data with MBM to identify biological mechanisms explaining observed PD activity in combination therapy.",36661181,PMC10014067,10.1002/psp4.12923,0,CPT: pharmacometrics & systems pharmacology,101580011,4.339
Parallel Multi-Omics in High-Risk Subjects for the Identification of Integrated Biomarker Signatures of Type 1 Diabetes,"Background:Biomarkers are crucial for detecting early type-1 diabetes (T1D) and preventing significant β-cell loss before the onset of clinical symptoms. Here, we present proof-of-concept studies to demonstrate the potential for identifying integrated biomarker signature(s) of T1D using parallel multi-omics.Methods:Blood from human subjects at high risk for T1D (and healthy controls;n= 4 + 4) was subjected to parallel unlabeled proteomics, metabolomics, lipidomics, and transcriptomics. The integrated dataset was analyzed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software for disturbances in the at-risk subjects compared to controls.Results:The final quadra-omics dataset contained 2292 proteins, 328 miRNAs, 75 metabolites, and 41 lipids that were detected in all samples without exception. Disease/function enrichment analyses consistently indicated increased activation, proliferation, and migration of CD4 T-lymphocytes and macrophages. Integrated molecular network predictions highlighted central involvement and activation of NF-κB, TGF-β, VEGF, arachidonic acid, and arginase, and inhibition of miRNA Let-7a-5p. IPA-predicted candidate biomarkers were used to construct a putative integrated signature containing several miRNAs and metabolite/lipid features in the at-risk subjects.Conclusions:Preliminary parallel quadra-omics provided a comprehensive picture of disturbances in high-risk T1D subjects and highlighted the potential for identifying associated integrated biomarker signatures. With further development and validation in larger cohorts, parallel multi-omics could ultimately facilitate the classification of T1D progressors from non-progressors.",33806609,PMC7999903,10.3390/biom11030383,12,Biomolecules,101596414,6.064
Proactive visual and statistical analysis of genomic data in Epiviz,"Motivation:Integrative analysis of genomic data that includes statistical methods in combination with visual exploration has gained widespread adoption. Many existing methods involve a combination of tools and resources: user interfaces that provide visualization of large genomic datasets, and computational environments that focus on data analyses over various subsets of a given dataset. Over the last few years, we have developed Epiviz as an integrative and interactive genomic data analysis tool that incorporates visualization tightly with state-of-the-art statistical analysis framework.Results:In this article, we present Epiviz Feed, a proactive and automatic visual analytics system integrated with Epiviz that alleviates the burden of manually executing data analysis required to test biologically meaningful hypotheses. Results of interest that are proactively identified by server-side computations are listed as notifications in a feed. The feed turns genomic data analysis into a collaborative work between the analyst and the computational environment, which shortens the analysis time and allows the analyst to explore results efficiently.We discuss three ways where the proposed system advances the field of genomic data analysis: (i) takes the first step of proactive data analysis by utilizing available CPU power from the server to automate the analysis process; (ii) summarizes hypothesis test results in a way that analysts can easily understand and investigate; (iii) enables filtering and grouping of analysis results for quick search. This effort provides initial work on systems that substantially expand how computational and visualization frameworks can be tightly integrated to facilitate interactive genomic data analysis.Availability and implementation:The source code for Epiviz Feed application is available at http://github.com/epiviz/epiviz_feed_polymer.

Integration of multiple networks and pathways identifies cancer driver genes in pan-cancer analysis,"Background:Modern high-throughput genomic technologies represent a comprehensive hallmark of molecular changes in pan-cancer studies. Although different cancer gene signatures have been revealed, the mechanism of tumourigenesis has yet to be completely understood. Pathways and networks are important tools to explain the role of genes in functional genomic studies. However, few methods consider the functional non-equal roles of genes in pathways and the complex gene-gene interactions in a network.Results:We present a novel method in pan-cancer analysis that identifies de-regulated genes with a functional role by integrating pathway and network data. A pan-cancer analysis of 7158 tumour/normal samples from 16 cancer types identified 895 genes with a central role in pathways and de-regulated in cancer. Comparing our approach with 15 current tools that identify cancer driver genes, we found that 35.6% of the 895 genes identified by our method have been found as cancer driver genes with at least 2/15 tools. Finally, we applied a machine learning algorithm on 16 independent GEO cancer datasets to validate the diagnostic role of cancer driver genes for each cancer. We obtained a list of the top-ten cancer driver genes for each cancer considered in this study.Conclusions:Our analysis 1) confirmed that there are several known cancer driver genes in common among different types of cancer, 2) highlighted that cancer driver genes are able to regulate crucial pathways.",29304754,PMC5756345,10.1186/s12864-017-4423-x,27,BMC genomics,100965258,4.547
Integration of DNA Microarray with Clinical and Genomic Data,"DNA microarrays have been widely employed to understand cancer development.

In addition, the detection of methylation patterns and gene copy number variations are also performed. Clinicians began to apply these findings in personalized medicine for the selection of cancer therapy according to the individual's cancer genomic profile. Because cancer is a complex disease it is of great value to integrate microarray data with genomic and clinical data.

Calibrating genomic and allelic coverage bias in single-cell sequencing,"Artifacts introduced in whole-genome amplification (WGA) make it difficult to derive accurate genomic information from single-cell genomes and require different analytical strategies from bulk genome analysis. Here, we describe statistical methods to quantitatively assess the amplification bias resulting from whole-genome amplification of single-cell genomic DNA. Analysis of single-cell DNA libraries generated by different technologies revealed universal features of the genome coverage bias predominantly generated at the amplicon level (1-10 kb). The magnitude of coverage bias can be accurately calibrated from low-pass sequencing (∼0.1 × ) to predict the depth-of-coverage yield of single-cell DNA libraries sequenced at arbitrary depths. We further provide a benchmark comparison of single-cell libraries generated by multi-strand displacement amplification (MDA) and multiple annealing and looping-based amplification cycles (MALBAC). Finally, we develop statistical models to calibrate allelic bias in single-cell whole-genome amplification and demonstrate a census-based strategy for efficient and accurate variant detection from low-input biopsy samples.",25879913,PMC4922254,10.1038/ncomms7822,37,Nature communications,101528555,17.694
Multi-omics joint analysis revealed the metabolic profile of retroperitoneal liposarcoma,"Retroperitoneal liposarcoma (RLPS) is the main subtype of retroperitoneal soft sarcoma (RSTS) and has a poor prognosis and few treatment options, except for surgery. The proteomic and metabolic profiles of RLPS have remained unclear. The aim of our study was to reveal the metabolic profile of RLPS. Here, we performed proteomic analysis (n = 10), metabolomic analysis (n = 51), and lipidomic analysis (n = 50) of retroperitoneal dedifferentiated liposarcoma (RDDLPS) and retroperitoneal well-differentiated liposarcoma (RWDLPS) tissue and paired adjacent adipose tissue obtained during surgery. Data analysis mainly revealed that glycolysis, purine metabolism, pyrimidine metabolism and phospholipid formation were upregulated in both RDDLPS and RWDLPS tissue compared with the adjacent adipose tissue, whereas the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, lipid absorption and synthesis, fatty acid degradation and biosynthesis, as well as glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism were downregulated. Of particular importance, the glycolytic inhibitor 2-deoxy-D-glucose and pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) inhibitor RRX-001 significantly promoted the antitumor effects of the MDM2 inhibitor RG7112 and CDK4 inhibitor abemaciclib. Our study not only describes the metabolic profiles of RDDLPS and RWDLPS, but also offers potential therapeutic targets and strategies for RLPS.",38157196,,10.1007/s11684-023-1020-z,1,Frontiers of medicine,101549428,9.927
Characterization of Proteome Variation During Modern Maize Breeding,"The success of modern maize breeding has been demonstrated by remarkable increases in productivity with tremendous modification of agricultural phenotypes over the last century. Although the underlying genetic changes of the maize adaptation from tropical to temperate regions have been extensively studied, our knowledge is limited regarding the accordance of protein and mRNA expression levels accompanying such adaptation. Here we conducted an integrative analysis of proteomic and transcriptomic changes in a maize association panel. The minimum extent of correlation between protein and RNA levels suggests that variation in mRNA expression is often not indicative of protein expression at a population scale. This is corroborated by the observation that mRNA- and protein-based coexpression networks are relatively independent of each other, and many pQTLs arise without the presence of corresponding eQTLs. Importantly, compared with transcriptome, the subtypes categorized by the proteome show a markedly high accuracy to resemble the genomic subpopulation. These findings suggest that proteome evolved under a greater evolutionary constraint than transcriptome during maize adaptation from tropical to temperate regions. Overall, the integrated multi-omics analysis provides a functional context to interpret gene expression variation during modern maize breeding.",30409858,PMC6356080,10.1074/mcp.RA118.001021,18,Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP,101125647,7.381
Learning a genome-wide score of human-mouse conservation at the functional genomics level,"Identifying genomic regions with functional genomic properties that are conserved between human and mouse is an important challenge in the context of mouse model studies. To address this, we develop a method to learn a score of evidence of conservation at the functional genomics level by integrating information from a compendium of epigenomic, transcription factor binding, and transcriptomic data from human and mouse. The method, Learning Evidence of Conservation from Integrated Functional genomic annotations (LECIF), trains neural networks to generate this score for the human and mouse genomes. The resulting LECIF score highlights human and mouse regions with shared functional genomic properties and captures correspondence of biologically similar human and mouse annotations. Analysis with independent datasets shows the score also highlights loci associated with similar phenotypes in both species. LECIF will be a resource for mouse model studies by identifying loci whose functional genomic properties are likely conserved.",33941776,PMC8093196,10.1038/s41467-021-22653-8,8,Nature communications,101528555,17.694
Multi-omics network model reveals key genes associated with p-coumaric acid stress response in an industrial yeast strain,"The production of ethanol from lignocellulosic sources presents increasingly difficult issues for the global biofuel scenario, leading to increased production costs of current second-generation (2G) ethanol when compared to first-generation (1G) plants. Among the setbacks encountered in industrial processes, the presence of chemical inhibitors from pre-treatment processes severely hinders the potential of yeasts in producing ethanol at peak efficiency. However, some industrial yeast strains have, either naturally or artificially, higher tolerance levels to these compounds. Such is the case of S. cerevisiae SA-1, a Brazilian fuel ethanol industrial strain that has shown high resistance to inhibitors produced by the pre-treatment of cellulosic complexes. Our study focuses on the characterization of the transcriptomic and physiological impact of an inhibitor of this type, p-coumaric acid (pCA), on this strain under chemostat cultivation via RNAseq and quantitative physiological data. It was found that strain SA-1 tend to increase ethanol yield and production rate while decreasing biomass yield when exposed to pCA, in contrast to pCA-susceptible strains, which tend to decrease their ethanol yield and fermentation efficiency when exposed to this substance. This suggests increased metabolic activity linked to mitochondrial and peroxisomal processes. The transcriptomic analysis also revealed a plethora of differentially expressed genes located in co-expressed clusters that are associated with changes in biological pathways linked to biosynthetic and energetical processes. Furthermore, it was also identified 20 genes that act as interaction hubs for these clusters, while also having association with altered pathways and changes in metabolic outputs, potentially leading to the discovery of novel targets for metabolic engineering toward a more robust industrial yeast strain.",36577778,PMC9797568,10.1038/s41598-022-26843-2,0,Scientific reports,101563288,4.996
Machine learning multi-omics analysis reveals cancer driver dysregulation in pan-cancer cell lines compared to primary tumors,"Cancer cell lines have been widely used for decades to study biological processes driving cancer development, and to identify biomarkers of response to therapeutic agents. Advances in genomic sequencing have made possible large-scale genomic characterizations of collections of cancer cell lines and primary tumors, such as the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). These studies allow for the first time a comprehensive evaluation of the comparability of cancer cell lines and primary tumors on the genomic and proteomic level. Here we employ bulk mRNA and micro-RNA sequencing data from thousands of samples in CCLE and TCGA, and proteomic data from partner studies in the MD Anderson Cell Line Project (MCLP) and The Cancer Proteome Atlas (TCPA), to characterize the extent to which cancer cell lines recapitulate tumors. We identify dysregulation of a long non-coding RNA and microRNA regulatory network in cancer cell lines, associated with differential expression between cell lines and primary tumors in four key cancer driver pathways: KRAS signaling, NFKB signaling, IL2/STAT5 signaling and TP53 signaling. Our results emphasize the necessity for careful interpretation of cancer cell line experiments, particularly with respect to therapeutic treatments targeting these important cancer pathways.",36513728,PMC9747808,10.1038/s42003-022-04075-4,2,Communications biology,101719179,6.548
"gFACs: Gene Filtering, Analysis, and Conversion to Unify Genome Annotations Across Alignment and Gene Prediction Frameworks","Published genomes frequently contain erroneous gene models that represent issues associated with identification of open reading frames, start sites, splice sites, and related structural features. The source of these inconsistencies is often traced back to integration across text file formats designed to describe long read alignments and predicted gene structures. In addition, the majority of gene prediction frameworks do not provide robust downstream filtering to remove problematic gene annotations, nor do they represent these annotations in a format consistent with current file standards. These frameworks also lack consideration for functional attributes, such as the presence or absence of protein domains that can be used for gene model validation. To provide oversight to the increasing number of published genome annotations, we present a software package, the Gene Filtering, Analysis, and Conversion (gFACs), to filter, analyze, and convert predicted gene models and alignments. The software operates across a wide range of alignment, analysis, and gene prediction files with a flexible framework for defining gene models with reliable structural and functional attributes. gFACs supports common downstream applications, including genome browsers, and generates extensive details on the filtering process, including distributions that can be visualized to further assess the proposed gene space. gFACs is freely available and implemented in Perl with support from BioPerl libraries at https://gitlab.com/PlantGenomicsLab/gFACs.",31437583,PMC6818179,10.1016/j.gpb.2019.04.002,23,"Genomics, proteomics & bioinformatics",101197608,6.409
Integrated analysis of multi-omics data reveals T cell exhaustion in sepsis,"Background:Sepsis is a heterogeneous disease, therefore the single-gene-based biomarker is not sufficient to fully understand the disease. Higher-level biomarkers need to be explored to identify important pathways related to sepsis and evaluate their clinical significance.Methods:Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was used to analyze the sepsis transcriptome to obtain the pathway-level expression. Limma was used to identify differentially expressed pathways. Tumor IMmune Estimation Resource (TIMER) was applied to estimate immune cell abundance. The Spearman correlation coefficient was used to find the relationships between pathways and immune cell abundance. Methylation and single-cell transcriptome data were also employed to identify important pathway genes. Log-rank test was performed to test the prognostic significance of pathways for patient survival probability. DSigDB was used to mine candidate drugs based on pathways. PyMol was used for 3-D structure visualization. LigPlot was used to plot the 2-D pose view for receptor-ligand interaction.Results:Eighty-four KEGG pathways were differentially expressed in sepsis patients compared to healthy controls. Of those, 10 pathways were associated with 28-day survival. Some pathways were significantly correlated with immune cell abundance and five pathways could be used to distinguish between systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), bacterial sepsis, and viral sepsis with Area Under the Curve (AUC) above 0.80. Seven related drugs were screened using survival-related pathways.Conclusion:Sepsis-related pathways can be utilized for disease subtyping, diagnosis, prognosis, and drug screening.",37077915,PMC10108839,10.3389/fimmu.2023.1110070,4,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,8.786
Mutant resources for functional genomics in Dictyostelium discoideum using REMI-seq technology,"Background:Genomes can be sequenced with relative ease, but ascribing gene function remains a major challenge. Genetically tractable model systems are crucial to meet this challenge. One powerful model is the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum, a eukaryotic microbe widely used to study diverse questions in the cell, developmental and evolutionary biology.Results:We describe REMI-seq, an adaptation of Tn-seq, which allows high throughput, en masse, and quantitative identification of the genomic site of insertion of a drug resistance marker after restriction enzyme-mediated integration. We use REMI-seq to develop tools which greatly enhance the efficiency with which the sequence, transcriptome or proteome variation can be linked to phenotype in D. discoideum. These comprise (1) a near genome-wide resource of individual mutants and (2) a defined pool of 'barcoded' mutants to allow large-scale parallel phenotypic analyses. These resources are freely available and easily accessible through the REMI-seq website that also provides comprehensive guidance and pipelines for data analysis. We demonstrate that integrating these resources allows novel regulators of cell migration, phagocytosis and macropinocytosis to be rapidly identified.Conclusions:We present methods and resources, generated using REMI-seq, for high throughput gene function analysis in a key model system.",34429112,PMC8386026,10.1186/s12915-021-01108-y,11,BMC biology,101190720,7.364
Gut microbiome-mediated epigenetic regulation of brain disorder and application of machine learning for multi-omics data analysis,"The gut-brain axis (GBA) is a biochemical link that connects the central nervous system (CNS) and enteric nervous system (ENS). Clinical and experimental evidence suggests gut microbiota as a key regulator of the GBA. Microbes living in the gut not only interact locally with intestinal cells and the ENS but have also been found to modulate the CNS through neuroendocrine and metabolic pathways. Studies have also explored the involvement of gut microbiota dysbiosis in depression, anxiety, autism, stroke, and pathophysiology of other neurodegenerative diseases. Recent reports suggest that microbe-derived metabolites can influence host metabolism by acting as epigenetic regulators. Butyrate, an intestinal bacterial metabolite, is a known histone deacetylase inhibitor that has shown to improve learning and memory in animal models. Due to high disease variability amongst the population, a multi-omics approach that utilizes artificial intelligence and machine learning to analyze and integrate omics data is necessary to better understand the role of the GBA in pathogenesis of neurological disorders, to generate predictive models, and to develop precise and personalized therapeutics. This review examines our current understanding of epigenetic regulation of the GBA and proposes a framework to integrate multi-omics data for prediction, prevention, and development of precision health approaches to treat brain disorders.",33031715,,10.1139/gen-2020-0136,13,Genome,8704544,2.449
Dealing with dimensionality: the application of machine learning to multi-omics data,"Motivation:Machine learning (ML) methods are motivated by the need to automate information extraction from large datasets in order to support human users in data-driven tasks. This is an attractive approach for integrative joint analysis of vast amounts of omics data produced in next generation sequencing and other -omics assays. A systematic assessment of the current literature can help to identify key trends and potential gaps in methodology and applications. We surveyed the literature on ML multi-omic data integration and quantitatively explored the goals, techniques and data involved in this field. We were particularly interested in examining how researchers use ML to deal with the volume and complexity of these datasets.Results:Our main finding is that the methods used are those that address the challenges of datasets with few samples and many features. Dimensionality reduction methods are used to reduce the feature count alongside models that can also appropriately handle relatively few samples. Popular techniques include autoencoders, random forests and support vector machines. We also found that the field is heavily influenced by the use of The Cancer Genome Atlas dataset, which is accessible and contains many diverse experiments.Availability and implementation:All data and processing scripts are available at this GitLab repository: https://gitlab.com/polavieja_lab/ml_multi-omics_review/ or in Zenodo: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7361807.Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",36637211,PMC9907220,10.1093/bioinformatics/btad021,13,"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",9808944,6.931
AFEI: adaptive optimized vertical federated learning for heterogeneous multi-omics data integration,"Vertical federated learning has gained popularity as a means of enabling collaboration and information sharing between different entities while maintaining data privacy and security. This approach has potential applications in disease healthcare, cancer prognosis prediction, and other industries where data privacy is a major concern. Although using multi-omics data for cancer prognosis prediction provides more information for treatment selection, collecting different types of omics data can be challenging due to their production in various medical institutions. Data owners must comply with strict data protection regulations such as European Union (EU) General Data Protection Regulation. To share patient data across multiple institutions, privacy and security issues must be addressed. Therefore, we propose an adaptive optimized vertical federated-learning-based framework adaptive optimized vertical federated learning for heterogeneous multi-omics data integration (AFEI) to integrate multi-omics data collected from multiple institutions for cancer prognosis prediction. AFEI enables participating parties to build an accurate joint evaluation model for learning more information related to cancer patients from different perspectives, based on the distributed and encrypted multi-omics features shared by multiple institutions. The experimental results demonstrate that AFEI achieves higher prediction accuracy (6.5% on average) than using single omics data by utilizing the encrypted multi-omics data from different institutions, and it performs almost as well as prognosis prediction by directly integrating multi-omics data. Overall, AFEI can be seen as an efficient solution for breaking down barriers to multi-institutional collaboration and promoting the development of cancer prognosis prediction.",37497720,,10.1093/bib/bbad269,0,Briefings in bioinformatics,100912837,13.994
Frontiers of soybean pan-genome studies,"Artificial domestication provided the original motivation to the blooming of agriculture, following with the dramatic change of the genetic background of crops and livestock. According to theory and technology upgradation that contributing to the omics, we appreciate using the pan-genome instead of single reference genome for crop study. By comparison and integration of multiple genomes under the guidance of pan-genome theory, we can estimate the genomic information range of a species, leading to a global understanding of its genetic diversity. Combining pan-genome with large size chromosomal structural variations, high throughput population resequencing, and multi-omics data, we can profoundly study the genetic basis behind species traits we focus on. Soybean is one of the most important commercial crops over the world. It is also essential to our food security. Dissecting the formation of genetic diversity and the causal loci of key agricultural traits of soybean will make the modern soybean breeding more efficiently. In this review, we summarize the core idea of pan-genome and clarified the characteristics of construction strategies of pan-genome such as de novo/mapping assembly, iterative assembly and graph-based genome. Then we used the soybean pan-genome work as a case study to introduce the general way to study pan-genome. We highlighted the contribution of structural variation (SV) to the evolution/domestication of soybean and its value in understanding the genetic bases of agronomy traits. By those, we approved the value of graph-based pan-genome for data integration and SV calculation. Future research directions are also discussed for crop genomics and data science.",38632097,,10.16288/j.yczz.23-321,0,Yi chuan = Hereditas,9436478,0.0
MAINE: a web tool for multi-omics feature selection and rule-based data exploration,"Summary:Patient multi-omics datasets are often characterized by a high dimensionality; however, usually only a small fraction of the features is informative, that is change in their value is directly related to the disease outcome or patient survival. In medical sciences, in addition to a robust feature selection procedure, the ability to discover human-readable patterns in the analyzed data is also desirable. To address this need, we created MAINE-Multi-omics Analysis and Exploration. The unique functionality of MAINE is the ability to discover multidimensional dependencies between the selected multi-omics features and event outcome prediction as well as patient survival probability. Learned patterns are visualized in the form of interpretable decision/survival trees and rules.Availability and implementation:MAINE is freely available at maine.ibemag.pl as an online web application.Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",34954788,PMC8896606,10.1093/bioinformatics/btab862,1,"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",9808944,6.931
Multi-omics and experimental analysis unveil theragnostic value and immunological roles of inner membrane mitochondrial protein (IMMT) in breast cancer,"Background:The inner membrane mitochondrial protein (IMMT) is a central unit of the mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing system (MICOS). While researchers continue to demonstrate the physiological function of IMMT in regulating mitochondrial dynamics and preserving mitochondrial structural integrity, the roles of IMMT in clinicopathology, the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME), and precision oncology in breast cancer (BC) remain unclear.Methods:Multi-omics analysis was used here to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic value of IMMT. Web applications aimed at analyzing the whole tumor tissue, single cells, and spatial transcriptomics were used to examine the relationship of IMMT with TIME. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was employed to determine the primary biological impact of IMMT. Experimental verification using siRNA knockdown and clinical specimens of BC patients confirmed the mechanisms behind IMMT on BC cells and the clinical significance, respectively. Potent drugs were identified by accessing the data repositories of CRISPR-based drug screenings.Results:High IMMT expression served as an independent diagnostic biomarker, correlated with advanced clinical status, and indicated a poor relapse-free survival (RFS) rate for patients with BC. Although, the contents of Th1, Th2, MSC, macrophages, basophil, CD4 + T cell and B cell, and TMB levels counteracted the prognostic significance. Single-cell level and whole-tissue level analyses revealed that high IMMT was associated with an immunosuppressive TIME. GSEA identified IMMT perturbation as involved in cell cycle progression and mitochondrial antioxidant defenses. Experimental knockdown of IMMT impeded the migration and viability of BC cells, arrested the cell cycle, disturbed mitochondrial function, and increased the ROS level and lipid peroxidation. The clinical values of IMMT were amenable to ethnic Chinese BC patients, and can be extrapolated to some other cancer types. Furthermore, we discovered that pyridostatin acted as a potent drug candidate in BC cells harboring an elevated IMMT expression.Conclusion:This study combined a multi-omics survey with experimental verification to reveal the novel clinical significance of IMMT in BC, demonstrating its role in TIME, cancer cell growth and mitochondrial fitness, and identified pyridostatin as a promising drug candidate for the development of precision medicine.",36899366,PMC9999521,10.1186/s12967-023-04035-4,3,Journal of translational medicine,101190741,8.44
SCOT: Single-Cell Multi-Omics Alignment with Optimal Transport,"Recent advances in sequencing technologies have allowed us to capture various aspects of the genome at single-cell resolution. However, with the exception of a few of co-assaying technologies, it is not possible to simultaneously apply different sequencing assays on the same single cell. In this scenario, computational integration of multi-omic measurements is crucial to enable joint analyses. This integration task is particularly challenging due to the lack of sample-wise or feature-wise correspondences. We present single-cell alignment with optimal transport (SCOT), an unsupervised algorithm that uses the Gromov-Wasserstein optimal transport to align single-cell multi-omics data sets. SCOT performs on par with the current state-of-the-art unsupervised alignment methods, is faster, and requires tuning of fewer hyperparameters. More importantly, SCOT uses a self-tuning heuristic to guide hyperparameter selection based on the Gromov-Wasserstein distance. Thus, in the fully unsupervised setting, SCOT aligns single-cell data sets better than the existing methods without requiring any orthogonal correspondence information.",35050714,PMC8812493,10.1089/cmb.2021.0446,24,Journal of computational biology : a journal of computational molecular cell,9433358,1.549
"Leveraging Multilayered ""Omics"" Data for Atopic Dermatitis: A Road Map to Precision Medicine","Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a complex multifactorial inflammatory skin disease that affects ~280 million people worldwide. About 85% of AD cases begin in childhood, a significant portion of which can persist into adulthood. Moreover, a typical progression of children with AD to food allergy, asthma or allergic rhinitis has been reported (""allergic march"" or ""atopic march""). AD comprises highly heterogeneous sub-phenotypes/endotypes resulting from complex interplay between intrinsic and extrinsic factors, such as environmental stimuli, and genetic factors regulating cutaneous functions (impaired barrier function, epidermal lipid, and protease abnormalities), immune functions and the microbiome. Though the roles of high-throughput ""omics"" integrations in defining endotypes are recognized, current analyses are primarily based on individual omics data and using binary clinical outcomes. Although individual omics analysis, such as genome-wide association studies (GWAS), can effectively map variants correlated with AD, the majority of the heritability and the functional relevance of discovered variants are not explained or known by the identified variants. The limited success of singular approaches underscores the need for holistic and integrated approaches to investigate complex phenotypes using trans-omics data integration strategies. Integrating omics layers (e.g., genome, epigenome, transcriptome, proteome, metabolome, lipidome, exposome, microbiome), which often have complementary and synergistic effects, might provide the opportunity to capture the flow of information underlying AD disease manifestation. Overlapping genes/candidates derived from multiple omics types includeFLG, SPINK5, S100A8, andSERPINB3in AD pathogenesis. Overlapping pathways include macrophage, endothelial cell and fibroblast activation pathways, in addition to well-known Th1/Th2 and NFkB activation pathways. Interestingly, there was more multi-omics overlap at the pathway level than gene level. Further analysis of multi-omics overlap at the tissue level showed that among 30 tissue types from the GTEx database, skin and esophagus were significantly enriched, indicating the biological interconnection between AD and food allergy. The present work explores multi-omics integration and provides new biological insights to better define the biological basis of AD etiology and confirm previously reported AD genes/pathways. In this context, we also discuss opportunities and challenges introduced by ""big omics data"" and their integration.",30631320,PMC6315155,10.3389/fimmu.2018.02727,43,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,8.786
ChromoMap: an R package for interactive visualization of multi-omics data and annotation of chromosomes,"Background:The recent advancements in high-throughput sequencing have resulted in the availability of annotated genomes, as well as of multi-omics data for many living organisms. This has increased the need for graphic tools that allow the concurrent visualization of genomes and feature-associated multi-omics data on single publication-ready plots.Results:We present chromoMap, an R package, developed for the construction of interactive visualizations of chromosomes/chromosomal regions, mapping of any chromosomal feature with known coordinates (i.e., protein coding genes, transposable elements, non-coding RNAs, microsatellites, etc.), and chromosomal regional characteristics (i.e. genomic feature density, gene expression, DNA methylation, chromatin modifications, etc.) of organisms with a genome assembly. ChromoMap can also integrate multi-omics data (genomics, transcriptomics and epigenomics) in relation to their occurrence across chromosomes. ChromoMap takes tab-delimited files (BED like) or alternatively R objects to specify the genomic co-ordinates of the chromosomes and elements to annotate. Rendered chromosomes are composed of continuous windows of a given range, which, on hover, display detailed information about the elements annotated within that range. By adjusting parameters of a single function, users can generate a variety of plots that can either be saved as static image or as HTML documents.Conclusions:ChromoMap's flexibility allows for concurrent visualization of genomic data in each strand of a given chromosome, or of more than one homologous chromosome; allowing the comparison of multi-omic data between genotypes (e.g. species, varieties, etc.) or between homologous chromosomes of phased diploid/polyploid genomes. chromoMap is an extensive tool that can be potentially used in various bioinformatics analysis pipelines for genomic visualization of multi-omics data.",35016614,PMC8753883,10.1186/s12859-021-04556-z,67,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,3.307
A multi-omics data simulator for complex disease studies and its application to evaluate multi-omics data analysis methods for disease classification,"Background:An integrative multi-omics analysis approach that combines multiple types of omics data including genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and microbiomics has become increasing popular for understanding the pathophysiology of complex diseases. Although many multi-omics analysis methods have been developed for complex disease studies, only a few simulation tools that simulate multiple types of omics data and model their relationships with disease status are available, and these tools have their limitations in simulating the multi-omics data.Results:We developed the multi-omics data simulator OmicsSIMLA, which simulates genomics (i.e., single-nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs] and copy number variations), epigenomics (i.e., bisulphite sequencing), transcriptomics (i.e., RNA sequencing), and proteomics (i.e., normalized reverse phase protein array) data at the whole-genome level. Furthermore, the relationships between different types of omics data, such as methylation quantitative trait loci (SNPs influencing methylation), expression quantitative trait loci (SNPs influencing gene expression), and expression quantitative trait methylations (methylations influencing gene expression), were modeled. More importantly, the relationships between these multi-omics data and the disease status were modeled as well. We used OmicsSIMLA to simulate a multi-omics dataset for breast cancer under a hypothetical disease model and used the data to compare the performance among existing multi-omics analysis methods in terms of disease classification accuracy and runtime. We also used OmicsSIMLA to simulate a multi-omics dataset with a scale similar to an ovarian cancer multi-omics dataset. The neural network-based multi-omics analysis method ATHENA was applied to both the real and simulated data and the results were compared. Our results demonstrated that complex disease mechanisms can be simulated by OmicsSIMLA, and ATHENA showed the highest prediction accuracy when the effects of multi-omics features (e.g., SNPs, copy number variations, and gene expression levels) on the disease were strong. Furthermore, similar results can be obtained from ATHENA when analyzing the simulated and real ovarian multi-omics data.Conclusions:OmicsSIMLA will be useful to evaluate the performace of different multi-omics analysis methods. Sample sizes and power can also be calculated by OmicsSIMLA when planning a new multi-omics disease study.",31029063,PMC6486474,10.1093/gigascience/giz045,14,GigaScience,101596872,7.658
Galbase: a comprehensive repository for integrating chicken multi-omics data,"Background:Multi-omics data can provide a stereoscopic view to explore potential causal variations and genes, as well as underlying genetic mechanisms of complex traits. However, for many non-mammalian species, including chickens, these resources are poorly integrated and reused, greatly limiting genetic research and breeding processes of the species.Results:Here, we constructed Galbase, an easily accessible repository that integrates public chicken multi-omics data from 928 re-sequenced genomes, 429 transcriptomes, 379 epigenomes, 15,275 QTL entries, and 7,526 associations. A total of 21.67 million SNPs, 2.71 million InDels, and 488,583 cis-regulatory elements were included. Galbase allows users to retrieve genomic variations in geographical maps, gene expression profiling in heatmaps, and epigenomic signals in peak patterns. It also provides modules for batch annotation of genes, regions, and loci based on multi-layered omics data. Additionally, a series of convenient tools, including the UCSC Genome Browser, WashU Epigenome Browser, BLAT, BLAST, and LiftOver, were also integrated to facilitate search, visualization, and analysis of sequence features.Conclusion:Galbase grants new opportunities to research communities to undertake in-depth functional genomic studies on chicken.

"Plant pan-genomics: recent advances, new challenges, and roads ahead","Pan-genomics can encompass most of the genetic diversity of a species or population and has proved to be a powerful tool for studying genomic evolution and the origin and domestication of species, and for providing information for plant improvement. Plant genomics has greatly progressed because of improvements in sequencing technologies and the rapid reduction of sequencing costs. Nevertheless, pan-genomics still presents many challenges, including computationally intensive assembly methods, high costs with large numbers of samples, ineffective integration of big data, and difficulty in applying it to downstream multi-omics analysis and breeding research. In this review, we summarize the definition and recent achievements of plant pan-genomics, computational technologies used for pan-genome construction, and the applications of pan-genomes in plant genomics and molecular breeding. We also discuss challenges and perspectives for future pan-genomics studies and provide a detailed pipeline for sample selection, genome assembly and annotation, structural variation identification, and construction and application of graph-based pan-genomes. The aim is to provide important guidance for plant pan-genome research and a better understanding of the genetic basis of genome evolution, crop domestication, and phenotypic diversity for future studies.",35750315,,10.1016/j.jgg.2022.06.004,23,Journal of genetics and genomics = Yi chuan xue bao,101304616,5.723
A multi-omics analysis identifies molecular features associated with fertility in heifers (Bos taurus),"Infertility or subfertility is a critical barrier to sustainable cattle production, including in heifers. The development of heifers that do not produce a calf within an optimum window of time is a critical factor for the profitability and sustainability of the cattle industry. In parallel, heifers are an excellent biomedical model for understanding the underlying etiology of infertility because well-nourished heifers can still be infertile, mostly because of inherent physiological and genetic causes. Using a high-density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chip, we collected genotypic data, which were analyzed using an association analysis in PLINK with Fisher's exact test. We also produced quantitative transcriptome data and proteome data. Transcriptome data were analyzed using the quasi-likelihood test followed by the Wald's test, and the likelihood test and proteome data were analyzed using a generalized mixed model and Student's t-test. We identified two SNPs significantly associated with heifer fertility (rs110918927, chr12: 85648422, P = 6.7 × 10-7; and rs109366560, chr11:37666527, P = 2.6 × 10-5). We identified two genes with differential transcript abundance (eFDR ≤ 0.002) between the two groups (Fertile and Sub-Fertile): Adipocyte Plasma Membrane Associated Protein (APMAP, 1.16 greater abundance in the Fertile group) and Dynein Axonemal Intermediate Chain 7 (DNAI7, 1.23 greater abundance in the Sub-Fertile group). Our analysis revealed that the protein Alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase FTO was more abundant in the plasma collected from Fertile heifers relative to their Sub-Fertile counterparts (FDR < 0.05). Lastly, an integrative analysis of the three datasets identified a series of molecular features (SNPs, gene transcripts, and proteins) that discriminated 21 out of 22 heifers correctly based on their fertility category. Our multi-omics analyses confirm the complex nature of female fertility. Very importantly, our results also highlight differences in the molecular profile of heifers associated with fertility that transcend the constraints of breed-specific genetic background.",37542054,PMC10403585,10.1038/s41598-023-39858-0,1,Scientific reports,101563288,4.996
Characterization of cancer subtypes associated with clinical outcomes by multi-omics integrative clustering,"Cancer patients show heterogeneous phenotypes and very different outcomes and responses even to common treatments, such as standard chemotherapy. This state-of-affairs has motivated the need for the comprehensive characterization of cancer phenotypes and fueled the generation of large omics datasets, comprising multiple omics data reported for the same patients, which might now allow us to start deciphering cancer heterogeneity and implement personalized therapeutic strategies. In this work, we performed the analysis of four cancer types obtained from the latest efforts by The Cancer Genome Atlas, for which seven distinct omics data were available for each patient, in addition to curated clinical outcomes. We performed a uniform pipeline for raw data preprocessing and adopted the Cancer Integration via MultIkernel LeaRning (CIMLR) integrative clustering method to extract cancer subtypes. We then systematically review the discovered clusters for the considered cancer types, highlighting novel associations between the different omics and prognosis.",37267828,,10.1016/j.compbiomed.2023.107064,1,Computers in biology and medicine,1250250,6.698
MCluster-VAEs: An end-to-end variational deep learning-based clustering method for subtype discovery using multi-omics data,"The discovery of cancer subtypes based on unsupervised clustering helps in providing a precise diagnosis, guide treatment, and improve patients' prognoses. Instead of single-omics data, multi-omics data can improve the clustering performance because it obtains a comprehensive landscape for understanding biological systems and mechanisms. However, heterogeneous data from multiple sources raises high complexity and different kinds of noise, which are detrimental to the extraction of clustering information. We propose an end-to-end deep learning based method, called Multi-omics Clustering Variational Autoencoders (MCluster-VAEs), that can extract cluster-friendly representations on multi-omics data. First, a unified network architecture with an attention mechanism was developed for accurately modeling multi-omics data. Then, using a novel objective function built from the Variational Bayes technique, the model was trained to effectively obtain the posterior estimation of the clustering assignments. Compared with 12 other state-of-the-art multi-omics clustering methods, MCluster-VAEs achieved an outstanding performance on benchmark datasets from the TCGA database. On the Pan Cancer dataset, MCluster-VAEs achieved an adjusted Rand index of approximately 0.78 for cancer category recognition, an increase of more than 18% compared with other methods. Furthermore, a survival analysis and clinical parameter enrichment tests conducted on 10 cancer datasets demonstrated that MCluster-VAEs provides comparable and even better results than many common integrative approaches. These results demonstrate that MCluster-VAEs are a powerful new tool for dissecting complex multi-omics relationships and providing new insights for cancer subtype discovery.",36162197,,10.1016/j.compbiomed.2022.106085,4,Computers in biology and medicine,1250250,6.698
Integrated Multi-Omics Analysis of Mechanisms Underlying Yeast Ethanol Tolerance,"For yeast cells, tolerance to high levels of ethanol is vital both in their natural environment and in industrially relevant conditions. We recently genotyped experimentally evolved yeast strains adapted to high levels of ethanol and identified mutations linked to ethanol tolerance. In this study, by integrating genomic sequencing data with quantitative proteomics profiles from six evolved strains (data set identifier PXD006631) and construction of protein interaction networks, we elucidate exactly how the genotype and phenotype are related at the molecular level. Our multi-omics approach points to the rewiring of numerous metabolic pathways affected by genomic and proteomic level changes, from energy-producing and lipid pathways to differential regulation of transposons and proteins involved in cell cycle progression. One of the key differences is found in the energy-producing metabolism, where the ancestral yeast strain responds to ethanol by switching to respiration and employing the mitochondrial electron transport chain. In contrast, the ethanol-adapted strains appear to have returned back to energy production mainly via glycolysis and ethanol fermentation, as supported by genomic and proteomic level changes. This work is relevant for synthetic biology where systems need to function under stressful conditions, as well as for industry and in cancer biology, where it is important to understand how the genotype relates to the phenotype.",34236875,PMC8353626,10.1021/acs.jproteome.1c00139,6,Journal of proteome research,101128775,5.37
Yak genome database: a multi-omics analysis platform,"Background:The yak (Bos grunniens) is a large ruminant species that lives in high-altitude regions and exhibits excellent adaptation to the plateau environments. To further understand the genetic characteristics and adaptive mechanisms of yak, we have developed a multi-omics database of yak including genome, transcriptome, proteome, and DNA methylation data.Description:The Yak Genome Database ( http://yakgenomics.com/ ) integrates the research results of genome, transcriptome, proteome, and DNA methylation, and provides an integrated platform for researchers to share and exchange omics data. The database contains 26,518 genes, 62 transcriptomes, 144,309 proteome spectra, and 22,478 methylation sites of yak. The genome module provides access to yak genome sequences, gene annotations and variant information. The transcriptome module offers transcriptome data from various tissues of yak and cattle strains at different developmental stages. The proteome module presents protein profiles from diverse yak organs. Additionally, the DNA methylation module shows the DNA methylation information at each base of the whole genome. Functions of data downloading and browsing, functional gene exploration, and experimental practice were available for the database.Conclusion:This comprehensive database provides a valuable resource for further investigations on development, molecular mechanisms underlying high-altitude adaptation, and molecular breeding of yak.",38580907,PMC10998334,10.1186/s12864-024-10274-6,0,BMC genomics,100965258,4.547
Ten quick tips for avoiding pitfalls in multi-omics data integration analyses,"Data are the most important elements of bioinformatics: Computational analysis of bioinformatics data, in fact, can help researchers infer new knowledge about biology, chemistry, biophysics, and sometimes even medicine, influencing treatments and therapies for patients. Bioinformatics and high-throughput biological data coming from different sources can even be more helpful, because each of these different data chunks can provide alternative, complementary information about a specific biological phenomenon, similar to multiple photos of the same subject taken from different angles. In this context, the integration of bioinformatics and high-throughput biological data gets a pivotal role in running a successful bioinformatics study. In the last decades, data originating from proteomics, metabolomics, metagenomics, phenomics, transcriptomics, and epigenomics have been labelled -omics data, as a unique name to refer to them, and the integration of these omics data has gained importance in all biological areas. Even if this omics data integration is useful and relevant, due to its heterogeneity, it is not uncommon to make mistakes during the integration phases. We therefore decided to present these ten quick tips to perform an omics data integration correctly, avoiding common mistakes we experienced or noticed in published studies in the past. Even if we designed our ten guidelines for beginners, by using a simple language that (we hope) can be understood by anyone, we believe our ten recommendations should be taken into account by all the bioinformaticians performing omics data integration, including experts.",37410704,PMC10325053,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011224,3,PLoS computational biology,101238922,4.779
Local augmented graph neural network for multi-omics cancer prognosis prediction and analysis,"Cancer prognosis prediction and analysis can help patients understand expected life and help clinicians provide correct therapeutic guidance. Thanks to the development of sequencing technology, multi-omics data, and biological networks have been used for cancer prognosis prediction. Besides, graph neural networks can simultaneously consider multi-omics features and molecular interactions in biological networks, becoming mainstream in cancer prognosis prediction and analysis. However, the limited number of neighboring genes in biological networks restricts the accuracy of graph neural networks. To solve this problem, a local augmented graph convolutional network named LAGProg is proposed in this paper for cancer prognosis prediction and analysis. The process follows: first, given a patient's multi-omics data features and biological network, the corresponding augmented conditional variational autoencoder generates features. Then, the generated augmented features and the original features are fed into a cancer prognosis prediction model to complete the cancer prognosis prediction task. The conditional variational autoencoder consists of two parts: encoder-decoder. In the encoding phase, an encoder learns the conditional distribution of the multi-omics data. As a generative model, a decoder takes the conditional distribution and the original feature as inputs to generate the enhanced features. The cancer prognosis prediction model consists of a two-layer graph convolutional neural network and a Cox proportional risk network. The Cox proportional risk network consists of fully connected layers. Extensive experiments on 15 real-world datasets from TCGA demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method in predicting cancer prognosis. LAGProg improved the C-index values by an average of 8.5% over the state-of-the-art graph neural network method. Moreover, we confirmed that the local augmentation technique could enhance the model's ability to represent multi-omics features, improve the model's robustness to missing multi-omics features, and prevent the model's over-smoothing during training. Finally, based on genes identified through differential expression analysis, we discovered 13 prognostic markers highly associated with breast cancer, among which ten genes have been proved by literature review.",36933628,,10.1016/j.ymeth.2023.02.011,3,"Methods (San Diego, Calif.)",9426302,4.647
Molecular Biology Networks and Key Gene Regulators for Inflammatory Biomarkers Shared by Breast Cancer Development: Multi-Omics Systems Analysis,"As key inflammatory biomarkers C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL6) play an important role in the pathogenesis of non-inflammatory diseases, including specific cancers, such as breast cancer (BC). Previous genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have neither explained the large proportion of genetic heritability nor provided comprehensive understanding of the underlying regulatory mechanisms. We adopted an integrative genomic network approach by incorporating our previous GWAS data for CRP and IL6 with multi-omics datasets, such as whole-blood expression quantitative loci, molecular biologic pathways, and gene regulatory networks to capture the full range of genetic functionalities associated with CRP/IL6 and tissue-specific key drivers (KDs) in gene subnetworks. We applied another systematic genomics approach for BC development to detect shared gene sets in enriched subnetworks across BC and CRP/IL6. We detected the topmost significant common pathways across CRP/IL6 (e.g., immune regulatory; chemokines and their receptors; interferon γ, JAK-STAT, and ERBB4 signaling), several of which overlapped with BC pathways. Further, in gene-gene interaction networks enriched by those topmost pathways, we identified KDs-both well-established (e.g., JAK1/2/3, STAT3) and novel (e.g., CXCR3, CD3D, CD3G, STAT6)-in a tissue-specific manner, for mechanisms shared in regulating CRP/IL6 and BC risk. Our study may provide robust, comprehensive insights into the mechanisms of CRP/IL6 regulation and highlight potential novel genetic targets as preventive and therapeutic strategies for associated disorders, such as BC.",34572592,PMC8469138,10.3390/biom11091379,2,Biomolecules,101596414,6.064

PathME: pathway based multi-modal sparse autoencoders for clustering of patient-level multi-omics data,"Background:Recent years have witnessed an increasing interest in multi-omics data, because these data allow for better understanding complex diseases such as cancer on a molecular system level. In addition, multi-omics data increase the chance to robustly identify molecular patient sub-groups and hence open the door towards a better personalized treatment of diseases. Several methods have been proposed for unsupervised clustering of multi-omics data. However, a number of challenges remain, such as the magnitude of features and the large difference in dimensionality across different omics data sources.Results:We propose a multi-modal sparse denoising autoencoder framework coupled with sparse non-negative matrix factorization to robustly cluster patients based on multi-omics data. The proposed model specifically leverages pathway information to effectively reduce the dimensionality of omics data into a pathway and patient specific score profile. In consequence, our method allows us to understand, which pathway is a feature of which particular patient cluster. Moreover, recently proposed machine learning techniques allow us to disentangle the specific impact of each individual omics feature on a pathway score. We applied our method to cluster patients in several cancer datasets using gene expression, miRNA expression, DNA methylation and CNVs, demonstrating the possibility to obtain biologically plausible disease subtypes characterized by specific molecular features. Comparison against several competing methods showed a competitive clustering performance. In addition, post-hoc analysis of somatic mutations and clinical data provided supporting evidence and interpretation of the identified clusters.Conclusions:Our suggested multi-modal sparse denoising autoencoder approach allows for an effective and interpretable integration of multi-omics data on pathway level while addressing the high dimensional character of omics data. Patient specific pathway score profiles derived from our model allow for a robust identification of disease subgroups.",32299344,PMC7161108,10.1186/s12859-020-3465-2,21,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,3.307
Bioinformatics Prediction for Network-Based Integrative Multi-Omics Expression Data Analysis in Hirschsprung Disease,"Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR) is a rare developmental disorder in which enteric ganglia are missing along a portion of the intestine. HSCR has a complex inheritance, withRETas the major disease-causing gene. However, the pathogenesis of HSCR is still not completely understood. Therefore, we applied a computational approach based on multi-omics network characterization and clustering analysis for HSCR-related gene/miRNA identification and biomarker discovery. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) and miRNA-target interaction (MTI) networks were analyzed by DPClusO and BiClusO, respectively, and finally, the biomarker potential of miRNAs was computationally screened by miRNA-BD. In this study, a total of 55 significant gene-disease modules were identified, allowing us to propose 178 new HSCR candidate genes and two biological pathways. Moreover, we identified 12 key miRNAs with biomarker potential among 137 predicted HSCR-associated miRNAs. Functional analysis of new candidates showed that enrichment terms related to gene ontology (GO) and pathways were associated with HSCR. In conclusion, this approach has allowed us to decipher new clues of the etiopathogenesis of HSCR, although molecular experiments are further needed for clinical validations.",38397401,PMC10886964,10.3390/biom14020164,0,Biomolecules,101596414,6.064
A deep learning approach based on multi-omics data integration to construct a risk stratification prediction model for skin cutaneous melanoma,"Purpose:Skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) is a highly aggressive melanocytic carcinoma whose high heterogeneity and complex etiology make its prognosis difficult to predict. This study aimed to construct a risk subtype typing model for SKCM.Methods:The study proposes a deep learning framework combining early fusion feature autoencoder (AE) and late fusion feature AE for risk subtype prediction of SKCM. The deep learning framework integrates mRNA, miRNA, and DNA methylation data of SKCM patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and clusters the screened multi-omics features associated with survival prognosis to identify risk subtypes. Differential expression analysis and functional enrichment analysis were performed between risk subtypes, while SVM classifiers were constructed between differentially expressed genes (DEGs) obtained by Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) logistic regression screening and risk subtype labels inferred from multi-omics data, and the predictive robustness of risk subtypes inferred from the risk subtype classification prediction model was validated using two independent datasets.Results:The deep learning framework that combined early fusion feature AE with late fusion feature AE distinguished the two best risk subtypes compared to the multi-omics integration approach with single strategy AE or PCA. A promising C-index (C-index = 0.748) and a significant difference in survival (log-rank P value = 4.61 × 10-9) were found between the identified risk subtypes. The DEGs with the top significance values together with differentially expressed miRNAs provided the biological interpretation of risk subtypes on SKCM. Finally, the framework was applied to predict risk subtypes in two independent test datasets of SKCM patients, all of which showed good predictive power (C-index > 0.680) and significant survival differences (log-rank P value < 0.01).Conclusion:The SKCM risk subtypes identified by integrating multi-omics data based on deep learning can not only improve the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of SKCM, but also provide clinicians with assistance in treatment decisions.",37673824,,10.1007/s00432-023-05358-x,0,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,4.322
[Study design and statistical methods used for integrative analysis on multi-omics in cancer epidemiology],"Rapid development of biotechnology provides us with large number of omics data from different angles in biological research, including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and epigenetics.

scMCs: a framework for single-cell multi-omics data integration and multiple clusterings,"Motivation:The integration of single-cell multi-omics data can uncover the underlying regulatory basis of diverse cell types and states. However, contemporary methods disregard the omics individuality, and the high noise, sparsity, and heterogeneity of single-cell data also impact the fusion effect. Furthermore, available single-cell clustering methods only focus on the cell type clustering, which cannot mine the alternative clustering to comprehensively analyze cells.Results:We propose a single-cell data fusion based multiple clustering (scMCs) approach that can jointly model single-cell transcriptomics and epigenetic data, and explore multiple different clusterings. scMCs first mines the omics-specific and cross-omics consistent representations, then fuses them into a co-embedding representation, which can dissect cellular heterogeneity and impute data. To discover the potential alternative clustering embedded in multi-omics, scMCs projects the co-embedding representation into different salient subspaces. Meanwhile, it reduces the redundancy between subspaces to enhance the diversity of alternative clusterings and optimizes the cluster centers in each subspace to boost the quality of corresponding clustering. Unlike single clustering, these alternative clusterings provide additional perspectives for understanding complex genetic information, such as cell types and states. Experimental results show that scMCs can effectively identify subcellular types, impute dropout events, and uncover diverse cell characteristics by giving different but meaningful clusterings.Availability and implementation:The code is available at www.sdu-idea.cn/codes.php?name=scMCs.",36929930,PMC10070040,10.1093/bioinformatics/btad133,4,"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",9808944,6.931
Integrative approaches based on genomic techniques in the functional studies on enhancers,"With the development of sequencing technology and the dramatic drop in sequencing cost, the functions of noncoding genes are being characterized in a wide variety of fields (e.g. biomedicine). Enhancers are noncoding DNA elements with vital transcription regulation functions. Tens of thousands of enhancers have been identified in the human genome; however, the location, function, target genes and regulatory mechanisms of most enhancers have not been elucidated thus far. As high-throughput sequencing techniques have leapt forwards, omics approaches have been extensively employed in enhancer research. Multidimensional genomic data integration enables the full exploration of the data and provides novel perspectives for screening, identification and characterization of the function and regulatory mechanisms of unknown enhancers. However, multidimensional genomic data are still difficult to integrate genome wide due to complex varieties, massive amounts, high rarity, etc. To facilitate the appropriate methods for studying enhancers with high efficacy, we delineate the principles, data processing modes and progress of various omics approaches to study enhancers and summarize the applications of traditional machine learning and deep learning in multi-omics integration in the enhancer field. In addition, the challenges encountered during the integration of multiple omics data are addressed. Overall, this review provides a comprehensive foundation for enhancer analysis.",38048082,PMC10694556,10.1093/bib/bbad442,0,Briefings in bioinformatics,100912837,13.994
"The road towards data integration in human genomics: players, steps and interactions","Thousands of new experimental datasets are becoming available every day; in many cases, they are produced within the scope of large cooperative efforts, involving a variety of laboratories spread all over the world, and typically open for public use. Although the potential collective amount of available information is huge, the effective combination of such public sources is hindered by data heterogeneity, as the datasets exhibit a wide variety of notations and formats, concerning both experimental values and metadata. Thus, data integration is becoming a fundamental activity, to be performed prior to data analysis and biological knowledge discovery, consisting of subsequent steps of data extraction, normalization, matching and enrichment; once applied to heterogeneous data sources, it builds multiple perspectives over the genome, leading to the identification of meaningful relationships that could not be perceived by using incompatible data formats. In this paper, we first describe a technological pipeline from data production to data integration; we then propose a taxonomy of genomic data players (based on the distinction between contributors, repository hosts, consortia, integrators and consumers) and apply the taxonomy to describe about 30 important players in genomic data management. We specifically focus on the integrator players and analyse the issues in solving the genomic data integration challenges, as well as evaluate the computational environments that they provide to follow up data integration by means of visualization and analysis tools.",32496509,,10.1093/bib/bbaa080,7,Briefings in bioinformatics,100912837,13.994
Using high-throughput multi-omics data to investigate structural balance in elementary gene regulatory network motifs,"Motivation:The simultaneous availability of ATAC-seq and RNA-seq experiments allows to obtain a more in-depth knowledge on the regulatory mechanisms occurring in gene regulatory networks. In this article, we highlight and analyze two novel aspects that leverage on the possibility of pairing RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data. Namely we investigate the causality of the relationships between transcription factors, chromatin and target genes and the internal consistency between the two omics, here measured in terms of structural balance in the sample correlations along elementary length-3 cycles.Results:We propose a framework that uses the a priori knowledge on the data to infer elementary causal regulatory motifs (namely chains and forks) in the network. It is based on the notions of conditional independence and partial correlation, and can be applied to both longitudinal and non-longitudinal data. Our analysis highlights a strong connection between the causal regulatory motifs that are selected by the data and the structural balance of the underlying sample correlation graphs: strikingly, >97% of the selected regulatory motifs belong to a balanced subgraph. This result shows that internal consistency, as measured by structural balance, is close to a necessary condition for 3-node regulatory motifs to satisfy causality rules.Availability and implementation:The analysis was carried out in MATLAB and the code can be found at https://github.com/albertozenere/Multi-omics-elementary-regulatory-motifs.Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",34383882,PMC8696094,10.1093/bioinformatics/btab577,2,"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",9808944,6.931

Integration of multi-omics data for prediction of phenotypic traits using random forest,"Background:In order to find genetic and metabolic pathways related to phenotypic traits of interest, we analyzed gene expression data, metabolite data obtained with GC-MS and LC-MS, proteomics data and a selected set of tuber quality phenotypic data from a diploid segregating mapping population of potato. In this study we present an approach to integrate these ~ omics data sets for the purpose of predicting phenotypic traits. This gives us networks of relatively small sets of interrelated ~ omics variables that can predict, with higher accuracy, a quality trait of interest.Results:We used Random Forest regression for integrating multiple ~ omics data for prediction of four quality traits of potato: tuber flesh colour, DSC onset, tuber shape and enzymatic discoloration. For tuber flesh colour beta-carotene hydroxylase and zeaxanthin epoxidase were ranked first and forty-fourth respectively both of which have previously been associated with flesh colour in potato tubers. Combining all the significant genes, LC-peaks, GC-peaks and proteins, the variation explained was 75 %, only slightly more than what gene expression or LC-MS data explain by themselves which indicates that there are correlations among the variables across data sets. For tuber shape regressed on the gene expression, LC-MS, GC-MS and proteomics data sets separately, only gene expression data was found to explain significant variation. For DSC onset, we found 12 significant gene expression, 5 metabolite levels (GC) and 2 proteins that are associated with the trait. Using those 19 significant variables, the variation explained was 45 %. Expression QTL (eQTL) analyses showed many associations with genomic regions in chromosome 2 with also the highest explained variation compared to other chromosomes. Transcriptomics and metabolomics analysis on enzymatic discoloration after 5 min resulted in 420 significant genes and 8 significant LC metabolites, among which two were putatively identified as caffeoylquinic acid methyl ester and tyrosine.Conclusions:In this study, we made a strategy for selecting and integrating multiple ~ omics data using random forest method and selected representative individual peaks for networks based on eQTL, mQTL or pQTL information.

Multi-omics reveals novel prognostic implication of SRC protein expression in bladder cancer and its correlation with immunotherapy response,"Purpose:This study aims to identify potential prognostic biomarkers of bladder cancer (BCa) based on large-scale multi-omics data and investigate the role of SRC in improving predictive outcomes for BCa patients and those receiving immune checkpoint therapies (ICTs).Methods:Large-scale multi-comic data were enrolled from the Cancer Proteome Atlas, the Cancer Genome Atlas and gene expression omnibus based on machining-learning methods. Immune infiltration, survival and other statistical analyses were implemented using R software in cancers (n= 12,452). The predictive value of SRC was performed in 81 BCa patients receiving ICT from aa validation cohort (n= 81).Results:Landscape of novel candidate prognostic protein signatures of BCa patients was identified. Differential BECLIN, EGFR, PKCALPHA, ANNEXIN1, AXL and SRC expression significantly correlated with the outcomes for BCa patients from multiply cohorts (n= 906). Notably, risk score of the integrated prognosis-related proteins (IPRPs) model exhibited high diagnostic accuracy and consistent predictive ability (AUC = 0.714). Besides, we tested the clinical relevance of baseline SRC protein and mRNA expression in two independent confirmatory cohorts (n= 566) and the prognostic value in pan-cancers. Then, we found that elevated SRC expression contributed to immunosuppressive microenvironment mediated by immune checkpoint molecules of BCa and other cancers. Next, we validated SRC expression as a potential biomarker in predicting response to ICT in 81 BCa patient from FUSCC cohort, and found that expression of SRC in the baseline tumour tissues correlated with improved survival benefits, but predicts worse ICT response.Conclusion:This study first performed the large-scale multi-omics analysis, distinguished the IPRPs (BECLIN, EGFR, PKCALPHA, SRC, ANNEXIN1andAXL) and revealed novel prediction model, outperforming the currently traditional prognostic indicators for anticipating BCa progression and better clinical strategies. Additionally, this study provided insight into the importance of biomarker SRC for better prognosis, which may inversely improve predictive outcomes for patients receiving ICT and enable patient selection for future clinical treatment.",33830879,PMC8043611,10.1080/07853890.2021.1908588,9,Annals of medicine,8906388,5.348
Multi-omics data integration and drug screening of AML cancer using Generative Adversarial Network,"In the era of precision medicine, accurate disease phenotype prediction for heterogeneous diseases, such as cancer, is emerging due to advanced technologies that link genotypes and phenotypes. However, it is difficult to integrate different types of biological data because they are so varied. In this study, we focused on predicting the traits of a blood cancer called Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) by combining different kinds of biological data. We used a recently developed method called Omics Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to better classify cancer outcomes. The primary advantages of a GAN include its ability to create synthetic data that is nearly indistinguishable from real data, its high flexibility, and its wide range of applications, including multi-omics data analysis. In addition, the GAN was effective at combining two types of biological data. We created synthetic datasets for gene activity and DNA methylation. Our method was more accurate in predicting disease traits than using the original data alone. The experimental results provided evidence that the creation of synthetic data through interacting multi-omics data analysis using GANs improves the overall prediction quality. Furthermore, we identified the top-ranked significant genes through statistical methods and pinpointed potential candidate drug agents through in-silico studies. The proposed drugs, also supported by other independent studies, might play a crucial role in the treatment of AML cancer.

Vertical and horizontal integration of multi-omics data with miodin,"Background:Studies on multiple modalities of omics data such as transcriptomics, genomics and proteomics are growing in popularity, since they allow us to investigate complex mechanisms across molecular layers. It is widely recognized that integrative omics analysis holds the promise to unlock novel and actionable biological insights into health and disease. Integration of multi-omics data remains challenging, however, and requires combination of several software tools and extensive technical expertise to account for the properties of heterogeneous data.Results:This paper presents the miodin R package, which provides a streamlined workflow-based syntax for multi-omics data analysis. The package allows users to perform analysis of omics data either across experiments on the same samples (vertical integration), or across studies on the same variables (horizontal integration). Workflows have been designed to promote transparent data analysis and reduce the technical expertise required to perform low-level data import and processing.Conclusions:The miodin package is implemented in R and is freely available for use and extension under the GPL-3 license.

Genetic architecture of inter-specific and -generic grass hybrids by network analysis on multi-omics data,"Background:Understanding the mechanisms underlining forage production and its biomass nutritive quality at the omics level is crucial for boosting the output of high-quality dry matter per unit of land. Despite the advent of multiple omics integration for the study of biological systems in major crops, investigations on forage species are still scarce.Results:Our results identified substantial changes in gene co-expression and metabolite-metabolite network topologies as a result of genetic perturbation by hybridizing L. perenne with another species within the genus (L. multiflorum) relative to across genera (F. pratensis). However, conserved hub genes and hub metabolomic features were detected between pedigree classes, some of which were highly heritable and displayed one or more significant edges with agronomic traits in a weighted omics-phenotype network. In spite of tagging relevant biological molecules as, for example, the light-induced rice 1 (LIR1), hub features were not necessarily better explanatory variables for omics-assisted prediction than features stochastically sampled and all available regressors.Conclusions:The utilization of computational techniques for the reconstruction of co-expression networks facilitates the identification of key omic features that serve as central nodes and demonstrate correlation with the manifestation of observed traits. Our results also indicate a robust association between early multi-omic traits measured in a greenhouse setting and phenotypic traits evaluated under field conditions.",37095447,PMC10127077,10.1186/s12864-023-09292-7,0,BMC genomics,100965258,4.547
Integrated analysis of multimodal single-cell data with structural similarity,"Multimodal single-cell sequencing technologies provide unprecedented information on cellular heterogeneity from multiple layers of genomic readouts. However, joint analysis of two modalities without properly handling the noise often leads to overfitting of one modality by the other and worse clustering results than vanilla single-modality analysis. How to efficiently utilize the extra information from single cell multi-omics to delineate cell states and identify meaningful signal remains as a significant computational challenge. In this work, we propose a deep learning framework, named SAILERX, for efficient, robust, and flexible analysis of multi-modal single-cell data. SAILERX consists of a variational autoencoder with invariant representation learning to correct technical noises from sequencing process, and a multimodal data alignment mechanism to integrate information from different modalities. Instead of performing hard alignment by projecting both modalities to a shared latent space, SAILERX encourages the local structures of two modalities measured by pairwise similarities to be similar. This strategy is more robust against overfitting of noises, which facilitates various downstream analysis such as clustering, imputation, and marker gene detection. Furthermore, the invariant representation learning part enables SAILERX to perform integrative analysis on both multi- and single-modal datasets, making it an applicable and scalable tool for more general scenarios.",36130281,PMC9757079,10.1093/nar/gkac781,23,Nucleic acids research,411011,19.16
"Multi-omics insights into the interplay between gut microbiota and colorectal cancer in the ""microworld"" age","Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a multifactorial heterogeneous disease largely due to both genetic predisposition and environmental factors including the gut microbiota, a dynamic microbial ecosystem inhabiting the gastrointestinal tract. Elucidation of the molecular mechanisms by which the gut microbiota interacts with the host may contribute to the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and promotion of CRC. However, deciphering the influence of genetic variants and interactions with the gut microbial ecosystem is rather challenging. Despite recent advancements in single omics analysis, the application of multi-omics approaches to integrate multiple layers of information in the microbiome and host to introduce effective prevention, diagnosis, and treatment strategies is still in its infancy. Here, we integrate host- and microbe-based multi-omics studies, respectively, to provide a strategy to explore potential causal relationships between gut microbiota and colorectal cancer. Specifically, we summarize the recent multi-omics studies such as metagenomics combined with metabolomics and metagenomics combined with genomics. Meanwhile, the sample size and sample types commonly used in multi-omics research, as well as the methods of data analysis, were also generalized. We highlight multiple layers of information from multi-omics that need to be verified by different types of models. Together, this review provides new insights into the clinical diagnosis and treatment of colorectal cancer patients.",36916422,,10.1039/d2mo00288d,1,Molecular omics,101713384,4.212
"Multi-omics study of key genes, metabolites, and pathways of periodontitis","Objective:This study aimed to explore the key genes, metabolites, and pathways that influence periodontitis pathogenesis by integrating transcriptomic and metabolomic studies.Design:Gingival crevicular fluid samples from periodontitis patients and healthy controls were collected for liquid chromatography/tandem mass-based metabolomics. RNA-seq data for periodontitis and control samples were obtained from the GSE16134 dataset. Differential metabolites and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the two groups were then compared. Based on the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network module analysis, key module genes were selected from immune-related DEGs. Correlation and pathway enrichment analyses were performed for differential metabolites and key module genes. A multi-omics integrative analysis was performed using bioinformatic methods to construct a gene-metabolite-pathway network.Results:From the metabolomics study, 146 differential metabolites were identified, which were mainly enriched in the pathways of purine metabolism and Adenosine triphosphate binding cassette transporters (ABC transporters). The GSE16134 dataset revealed 102 immune-related DEGs (458 upregulated and 264 downregulated genes), 33 of which may play core roles in the key modules of the PPI network and are involved in cytokine-related regulatory pathways. Through a multi-omics integrative analysis, a gene-metabolite-pathway network was constructed, including 28 genes (such as platelet derived growth factor D (PDGFD), neurturin (NRTN), and interleukin 2 receptor, gamma (IL2RG)); 47 metabolites (such as deoxyinosine); and 8 pathways (such as ABC transporters).Conclusion:PDGFD, NRTN, and IL2RG may be potential biomarkers of periodontitis and may affect disease progression by regulating deoxyinosine to participate in the ABC transporter pathway.",37285682,,10.1016/j.archoralbio.2023.105720,0,Archives of oral biology,116711,2.64
Insights into therapeutic targets and biomarkers using integrated multi-'omics' approaches for dilated and ischemic cardiomyopathies,"At present, heart failure (HF) treatment only targets the symptoms based on the left ventricle dysfunction severity; however, the lack of systemic 'omics' studies and available biological data to uncover the heterogeneous underlying mechanisms signifies the need to shift the analytical paradigm towards network-centric and data mining approaches. This study, for the first time, aimed to investigate how bulk and single cell RNA-sequencing as well as the proteomics analysis of the human heart tissue can be integrated to uncover HF-specific networks and potential therapeutic targets or biomarkers. We also aimed to address the issue of dealing with a limited number of samples and to show how appropriate statistical models, enrichment with other datasets as well as machine learning-guided analysis can aid in such cases. Furthermore, we elucidated specific gene expression profiles using transcriptomic and mined data from public databases. This was achieved using the two-step machine learning algorithm to predict the likelihood of the therapeutic target or biomarker tractability based on a novel scoring system, which has also been introduced in this study. The described methodology could be very useful for the target or biomarker selection and evaluation during the pre-clinical therapeutics development stage as well as disease progression monitoring. In addition, the present study sheds new light into the complex aetiology of HF, differentiating between subtle changes in dilated cardiomyopathies (DCs) and ischemic cardiomyopathies (ICs) on the single cell, proteome and whole transcriptome level, demonstrating that HF might be dependent on the involvement of not only the cardiomyocytes but also on other cell populations. Identified tissue remodelling and inflammatory processes can be beneficial when selecting targeted pharmacological management for DCs or ICs, respectively.",33969404,,10.1093/intbio/zyab007,2,Integrative biology : quantitative biosciences from nano to macro,101478378,3.177
Multi-omics clustering for cancer subtyping based on latent subspace learning,"The increased availability of high-throughput technologies has enabled biomedical researchers to learn about disease etiology across multiple omics layers, which shows promise for improving cancer subtype identification. Many computational methods have been developed to perform clustering on multi-omics data, however, only a few of them are applicable for partial multi-omics in which some samples lack data in some types of omics. In this study, we propose a novel multi-omics clustering method based on latent sub-space learning (MCLS), which can deal with the missing multi-omics for clustering. We utilize the data with complete omics to construct a latent subspace using PCA-based feature extraction and singular value decomposition (SVD). The data with incomplete multi-omics are then projected to the latent subspace, and spectral clustering is performed to find the clusters. The proposed MCLS method is evaluated on seven different cancer datasets on three levels of omics in both full and partial cases compared to several state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results show that the proposed MCLS method is more efficient and effective than the compared methods for cancer subtype identification in multi-omics data analysis, which provides important references to a comprehensive understanding of cancer and biological mechanisms. AVAILABILITY: The proposed method can be freely accessible at https://github.com/ShangCS/MCLS.",37490833,,10.1016/j.compbiomed.2023.107223,1,Computers in biology and medicine,1250250,6.698
Classifying Breast Cancer Subtypes Using Deep Neural Networks Based on Multi-Omics Data,"With the high prevalence of breast cancer, it is urgent to find out the intrinsic difference between various subtypes, so as to infer the underlying mechanisms. Given the available multi-omics data, their proper integration can improve the accuracy of breast cancer subtype recognition. In this study, DeepMO, a model using deep neural networks based on multi-omics data, was employed for classifying breast cancer subtypes. Three types of omics data including mRNA data, DNA methylation data, and copy number variation (CNV) data were collected from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). After data preprocessing and feature selection, each type of omics data was input into the deep neural network, which consists of an encoding subnetwork and a classification subnetwork. The results of DeepMO based on multi-omics on binary classification are better than other methods in terms of accuracy and area under the curve (AUC). Moreover, compared with other methods using single omics data and multi-omics data, DeepMO also had a higher prediction accuracy on multi-classification. We also validated the effect of feature selection on DeepMO. Finally, we analyzed the enrichment gene ontology (GO) terms and biological pathways of these significant genes, which were discovered during the feature selection process. We believe that the proposed model is useful for multi-omics data analysis.",32759821,PMC7464481,10.3390/genes11080888,24,Genes,101551097,4.141
"Integrative analysis of genomic, epigenomic and transcriptomic data identified molecular subtypes of esophageal carcinoma","Esophageal cancer (EC) involves many genomic, epigenetic and transcriptomic disorders, which play key roles in the heterogeneous progression of cancer. However, the study of EC with multi-omics has not been conducted. This study identified a high consistency between DNA copy number variations and abnormal methylations in EC by analyzing genomics, epigenetics and transcriptomics data and investigating mutual correlations of DNA copy number variation, methylation and gene expressions, and stratified copy number variation genes (CNV-Gs) and methylation genes (MET-Gs). The methylation, CNVs and expression profiles of CNV-Gs and MET-Gs were analyzed by consistent clustering using iCluster integration, here, we determined three subtypes (iC1, iC2, iC3) with different molecular traits, prognostic characteristics and tumor immune microenvironment features. We also identified 4 prognostic genes (CLDN3, FAM221A, GDF15 and YBX2) differentially expressed in the three subtypes, and could therefore be used as representative biomarkers for the three subtypes of EC. In conclusion, by performing comprehensive analysis on genomic, epigenetic and transcriptomic regulations, the current study provided new insights into the multilayer molecular and pathological traits of EC, and contributed to the precision medication for EC patients.",33638948,PMC7993659,10.18632/aging.202556,4,Aging,101508617,5.955
Network medicine for patients' stratification: From single-layer to multi-omics,"Precision medicine research increasingly relies on the integrated analysis of multiple types of omics. In the era of big data, the large availability of different health-related information represents a great, but at the same time untapped, chance with a potentially fundamental role in the prevention, diagnosis and prognosis of diseases. Computational methods are needed to combine this data to create a comprehensive view of a given disease. Network science can model biomedical data in terms of relationships among molecular players of different nature and has been successfully proposed as a new paradigm for studying human diseases. Patient stratification is an open challenge aimed at identifying subtypes with different disease manifestations, severity, and expected survival time. Several stratification approaches based on high-throughput gene expression measurements have been successfully applied. However, few attempts have been proposed to exploit the integration of various genotypic and phenotypic data to discover novel sub-types or improve the detection of known groupings.

Omics-Based Strategies in Precision Medicine: Toward a Paradigm Shift in Inborn Errors of Metabolism Investigations,"The rise of technologies that simultaneously measure thousands of data points represents the heart of systems biology. These technologies have had a huge impact on the discovery of next-generation diagnostics, biomarkers, and drugs in the precision medicine era. Systems biology aims to achieve systemic exploration of complex interactions in biological systems. Driven by high-throughput omics technologies and the computational surge, it enables multi-scale and insightful overviews of cells, organisms, and populations. Precision medicine capitalizes on these conceptual and technological advancements and stands on two main pillars: data generation and data modeling. High-throughput omics technologies allow the retrieval of comprehensive and holistic biological information, whereas computational capabilities enable high-dimensional data modeling and, therefore, accessible and user-friendly visualization. Furthermore, bioinformatics has enabled comprehensive multi-omics and clinical data integration for insightful interpretation. Despite their promise, the translation of these technologies into clinically actionable tools has been slow. In this review, we present state-of-the-art multi-omics data analysis strategies in a clinical context. The challenges of omics-based biomarker translation are discussed. Perspectives regarding the use of multi-omics approaches for inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) are presented by introducing a new paradigm shift in addressing IEM investigations in the post-genomic era.",27649151,PMC5037827,10.3390/ijms17091555,69,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,6.208
Multi-view spectral clustering with latent representation learning for applications on multi-omics cancer subtyping,"Driven by multi-omics data, some multi-view clustering algorithms have been successfully applied to cancer subtypes prediction, aiming to identify subtypes with biometric differences in the same cancer, thereby improving the clinical prognosis of patients and designing personalized treatment plan. Due to the fact that the number of patients in omics data is much smaller than the number of genes, multi-view spectral clustering based on similarity learning has been widely developed. However, these algorithms still suffer some problems, such as over-reliance on the quality of pre-defined similarity matrices for clustering results, inability to reasonably handle noise and redundant information in high-dimensional omics data, ignoring complementary information between omics data, etc. This paper proposes multi-view spectral clustering with latent representation learning (MSCLRL) method to alleviate the above problems. First, MSCLRL generates a corresponding low-dimensional latent representation for each omics data, which can effectively retain the unique information of each omics and improve the robustness and accuracy of the similarity matrix. Second, the obtained latent representations are assigned appropriate weights by MSCLRL, and global similarity learning is performed to generate an integrated similarity matrix. Third, the integrated similarity matrix is used to feed back and update the low-dimensional representation of each omics. Finally, the final integrated similarity matrix is used for clustering. In 10 benchmark multi-omics datasets and 2 separate cancer case studies, the experiments confirmed that the proposed method obtained statistically and biologically meaningful cancer subtypes.",36445207,,10.1093/bib/bbac500,1,Briefings in bioinformatics,100912837,13.994
GOAT: Gene-level biomarker discovery from multi-Omics data using graph ATtention neural network for eosinophilic asthma subtype,"Motivation:Asthma is a heterogeneous disease where various subtypes are established and molecular biomarkers of the subtypes are yet to be discovered. Recent availability of multi-omics data paved a way to discover molecular biomarkers for the subtypes. However, multi-omics biomarker discovery is challenging because of the complex interplay between different omics layers.Results:We propose a deep attention model named Gene-level biomarker discovery from multi-Omics data using graph ATtention neural network (GOAT) for identifying molecular biomarkers for eosinophilic asthma subtypes with multi-omics data. GOAT identifies genes that discriminate subtypes using a graph neural network by modeling complex interactions among genes as the attention mechanism in the deep learning model. In experiments with multi-omics profiles of the COREA (Cohort for Reality and Evolution of Adult Asthma in Korea) asthma cohort of 300 patients, GOAT outperforms existing models and suggests interpretable biological mechanisms underlying asthma subtypes. Importantly, GOAT identified genes that are distinct only in terms of relationship with other genes through attention. To better understand the role of biomarkers, we further investigated two transcription factors, CTNNB1 and JUN, captured by GOAT. We were successful in showing the role of the transcription factors in eosinophilic asthma pathophysiology in a network propagation and transcriptional network analysis, which were not distinct in terms of gene expression level differences.Availability and implementation:Source code is available https://github.com/DabinJeong/Multi-omics_biomarker.

Bayesian tensor factorization-drive breast cancer subtyping by integrating multi-omics data,"Breast cancer is a highly heterogeneous disease. Subtyping the disease and identifying the genomic features driving these subtypes are critical for precision oncology for breast cancer. This study focuses on developing a new computational approach for breast cancer subtyping. We proposed to use Bayesian tensor factorization (BTF) to integrate multi-omics data of breast cancer, which include expression profiles of RNA-sequencing, copy number variation, and DNA methylation measured on 762 breast cancer patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas. We applied a consensus clustering approach to identify breast cancer subtypes using the factorized latent features by BTF. Subtype-specific survival patterns of the breast cancer patients were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier (KM) estimators. The proposed approach was compared with other state-of-the-art approaches for cancer subtyping. The BTF-subtyping analysis identified 17 optimized latent components, which were used to reveal six major breast cancer subtypes. Out of all different approaches, only the proposed approach showed distinct survival patterns (p < 0.05). Statistical tests also showed that the identified clusters have statistically significant distributions. Our results showed that the proposed approach is a promising strategy to efficiently use publicly available multi-omics data to identify breast cancer subtypes.",34839017,,10.1016/j.jbi.2021.103958,4,Journal of biomedical informatics,100970413,8.0
"Implementing Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) in Clinical Practice: Advantages, Challenges, and Future Perspectives","The integration of whole genome sequencing (WGS) into all aspects of modern medicine represents the next step in the evolution of healthcare. Using this technology, scientists and physicians can observe the entire human genome comprehensively, generating a plethora of new sequencing data. Modern computational analysis entails advanced algorithms for variant detection, as well as complex models for classification. Data science and machine learning play a crucial role in the processing and interpretation of results, using enormous databases and statistics to discover new and support current genotype-phenotype correlations. In clinical practice, this technology has greatly enabled the development of personalized medicine, approaching each patient individually and in accordance with their genetic and biochemical profile. The most propulsive areas include rare disease genomics, oncogenomics, pharmacogenomics, neonatal screening, and infectious disease genomics. Another crucial application of WGS lies in the field of multi-omics, working towards the complete integration of human biomolecular data. Further technological development of sequencing technologies has led to the birth of third and fourth-generation sequencing, which include long-read sequencing, single-cell genomics, and nanopore sequencing.

Knowledge Generation with Rule Induction in Cancer Omics,"The explosion of omics data availability in cancer research has boosted the knowledge of the molecular basis of cancer, although the strategies for its definitive resolution are still not well established. The complexity of cancer biology, given by the high heterogeneity of cancer cells, leads to the development of pharmacoresistance for many patients, hampering the efficacy of therapeutic approaches. Machine learning techniques have been implemented to extract knowledge from cancer omics data in order to address fundamental issues in cancer research, as well as the classification of clinically relevant sub-groups of patients and for the identification of biomarkers for disease risk and prognosis. Rule induction algorithms are a group of pattern discovery approaches that represents discovered relationships in the form of human readable associative rules. The application of such techniques to the modern plethora of collected cancer omics data can effectively boost our understanding of cancer-related mechanisms. In fact, the capability of these methods to extract a huge amount of human readable knowledge will eventually help to uncover unknown relationships between molecular attributes and the malignant phenotype. In this review, we describe applications and strategies for the usage of rule induction approaches in cancer omics data analysis. In particular, we explore the canonical applications and the future challenges and opportunities posed by multi-omics integration problems.",31861438,PMC6981587,10.3390/ijms21010018,3,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,6.208
Lung cancer multi-omics digital human avatars for integrating precision medicine into clinical practice: the LANTERN study,"Background:The current management of lung cancer patients has reached a high level of complexity. Indeed, besides the traditional clinical variables (e.g., age, sex, TNM stage), new omics data have recently been introduced in clinical practice, thereby making more complex the decision-making process. With the advent of Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, various omics datasets may be used to create more accurate predictive models paving the way for a better care in lung cancer patients.Methods:The LANTERN study is a multi-center observational clinical trial involving a multidisciplinary consortium of five institutions from different European countries. The aim of this trial is to develop accurate several predictive models for lung cancer patients, through the creation of Digital Human Avatars (DHA), defined as digital representations of patients using various omics-based variables and integrating well-established clinical factors with genomic data, quantitative imaging data etc. A total of 600 lung cancer patients will be prospectively enrolled by the recruiting centers and multi-omics data will be collected. Data will then be modelled and parameterized in an experimental context of cutting-edge big data analysis. All data variables will be recorded according to a shared common ontology based on variable-specific domains in order to enhance their direct actionability. An exploratory analysis will then initiate the biomarker identification process. The second phase of the project will focus on creating multiple multivariate models trained though advanced machine learning (ML) and AI techniques for the specific areas of interest. Finally, the developed models will be validated in order to test their robustness, transferability and generalizability, leading to the development of the DHA. All the potential clinical and scientific stakeholders will be involved in the DHA development process. The main goals aim of LANTERN project are: i) To develop predictive models for lung cancer diagnosis and histological characterization; (ii) to set up personalized predictive models for individual-specific treatments; iii) to enable feedback data loops for preventive healthcare strategies and quality of life management.Discussion:The LANTERN project will develop a predictive platform based on integration of multi-omics data. This will enhance the generation of important and valuable information assets, in order to identify new biomarkers that can be used for early detection, improved tumor diagnosis and personalization of treatment protocols.Ethics committee approval number:5420 - 0002485/23 from Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Agostino Gemelli IRCCS - Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore Ethics Committee.Trial registration:clinicaltrial.gov -NCT05802771.",37312079,PMC10262371,10.1186/s12885-023-10997-x,5,BMC cancer,100967800,4.638
Integrative cross-omics and cross-context analysis elucidates molecular links underlying genetic effects on complex traits,"Genetic effects on functionally related 'omic' traits often co-occur in relevant cellular contexts, such as tissues. Motivated by the multi-tissue methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTLs) and expression QTLs (eQTLs) analysis, we propose X-ING (Cross-INtegrative Genomics) for cross-omics and cross-context integrative analysis. X-ING takes as input multiple matrices of association statistics, each obtained from different omics data types across multiple cellular contexts. It models the latent binary association status of each statistic, captures the major association patterns among omics data types and contexts, and outputs the posterior mean and probability for each input statistic. X-ING enables the integration of effects from different omics data with varying effect distributions. In the multi-tissue cis-association analysis, X-ING shows improved detection and replication of mQTLs by integrating eQTL maps. In the trans-association analysis, X-ING reveals an enrichment of trans-associations in many disease/trait-relevant tissues.",38493154,PMC10944527,10.1038/s41467-024-46675-0,0,Nature communications,101528555,17.694
Integration of single-cell regulon atlas and multi-omics data for prognostic stratification and personalized treatment prediction in human lung adenocarcinoma,"Transcriptional programs are often dysregulated in cancers. A comprehensive investigation of potential regulons is critical to the understanding of tumorigeneses. We first constructed the regulatory networks from single-cell RNA sequencing data in human lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). We next introduce LPRI (Lung Cancer Prognostic Regulon Index), a precision oncology framework to identify new biomarkers associated with prognosis by leveraging the single cell regulon atlas and bulk RNA sequencing or microarray datasets. We confirmed that LPRI could be a robust biomarker to guide prognosis stratification across lung adenocarcinoma cohorts. Finally, a multi-omics data analysis to characterize molecular alterations associated with LPRI was performed from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset.

Multi-omic analysis of the tumor microenvironment shows clinical correlations in Ph1 study of atezolizumab +/- SoC in MM,"Multiple myeloma (MM) remains incurable, and treatment of relapsed/refractory (R/R) disease is challenging. There is an unmet need for more targeted therapies in this setting; deep cellular and molecular phenotyping of the tumor and microenvironment in MM could help guide such therapies. This phase 1b study (NCT02431208) evaluated the safety and efficacy of the anti-programmed death-ligand 1 monoclonal antibody atezolizumab (Atezo) alone or in combination with the standard of care (SoC) treatments lenalidomide (Len) or pomalidomide (Pom) and/or daratumumab (Dara) in patients with R/R MM. Study endpoints included incidence of adverse events (AEs) and overall response rate (ORR). A novel unsupervised integrative multi-omic analysis was performed using RNA sequencing, mass cytometry immunophenotyping, and proteomic profiling of baseline and on-treatment bone marrow samples from patients receiving Atezo monotherapy or Atezo+Dara. A similarity network fusion (SNF) algorithm was applied to preprocessed data. Eighty-five patients were enrolled. Treatment-emergent deaths occurred in 2 patients; both deaths were considered unrelated to study treatment. ORRs ranged from 11.1% (Atezo+Len cohorts, n=18) to 83.3% (Atezo+Dara+Pom cohort, n=6). High-dimensional multi-omic profiling of the tumor microenvironment and integrative SNF analysis revealed novel correlations between cellular and molecular features of the tumor and immune microenvironment, patient selection criteria, and clinical outcome. Atezo monotherapy and SoC combinations were safe in this patient population and demonstrated some evidence of clinical efficacy. Integrative analysis of high dimensional genomics and immune data identified novel clinical correlations that may inform patient selection criteria and outcome assessment in future immunotherapy studies for myeloma.",37559718,PMC10408441,10.3389/fimmu.2023.1085893,1,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,8.786
Molecular Characterization and Landscape of Breast cancer Models from a multi-omics Perspective,"Breast cancer is well-known to be a highly heterogenous disease. This facet of cancer makes finding a research model that mirrors the disparate intrinsic features challenging. With advances in multi-omics technologies, establishing parallels between the various models and human tumors is increasingly intricate. Here we review the various model systems and their relation to primary breast tumors using available omics data platforms. Among the research models reviewed here, breast cancer cell lines have the least resemblance to human tumors since they have accumulated many mutations and copy number alterations during their long use. Moreover, individual proteomic and metabolomic profiles do not overlap with the molecular landscape of breast cancer. Interestingly, omics analysis revealed that the initial subtype classification of some breast cancer cell lines was inappropriate. In cell lines the major subtypes are all well represented and share some features with primary tumors. In contrast, patient-derived xenografts (PDX) and patient-derived organoids (PDO) are superior in mirroring human breast cancers at many levels, making them suitable models for drug screening and molecular analysis. While patient derived organoids are spread across luminal, basal- and normal-like subtypes, the PDX samples were initially largely basal but other subtypes have been increasingly described. Murine models offer heterogenous tumor landscapes, inter and intra-model heterogeneity, and give rise to tumors of different phenotypes and histology. Murine models have a reduced mutational burden compared to human breast cancer but share some transcriptomic resemblance, and representation of many breast cancer subtypes can be found among the variety subtypes. To date, while mammospheres and three- dimensional cultures lack comprehensive omics data, these are excellent models for the study of stem cells, cell fate decision and differentiation, and have also been used for drug screening. Therefore, this review explores the molecular landscapes and characterization of breast cancer research models by comparing recent published multi-omics data and analysis.",37269418,PMC10239388,10.1007/s10911-023-09540-2,2,Journal of mammary gland biology and neoplasia,9601804,2.698
Single-cell multi-omics topic embedding reveals cell-type-specific and COVID-19 severity-related immune signatures,"The advent of single-cell multi-omics sequencing technology makes it possible for researchers to leverage multiple modalities for individual cells and explore cell heterogeneity. However, the high-dimensional, discrete, and sparse nature of the data make the downstream analysis particularly challenging. Here, we propose an interpretable deep learning method called moETM to perform integrative analysis of high-dimensional single-cell multimodal data. moETM integrates multiple omics data via a product-of-experts in the encoder and employs multiple linear decoders to learn the multi-omics signatures. moETM demonstrates superior performance compared with six state-of-the-art methods on seven publicly available datasets. By applying moETM to the scRNA + scATAC data, we identified sequence motifs corresponding to the transcription factors regulating immune gene signatures. Applying moETM to CITE-seq data from the COVID-19 patients revealed not only known immune cell-type-specific signatures but also composite multi-omics biomarkers of critical conditions due to COVID-19, thus providing insights from both biological and clinical perspectives.",37671028,PMC10475851,10.1016/j.crmeth.2023.100563,4,Cell reports methods,9918227360606676,0.0
Identifying BMI-associated genes via a genome-wide multi-omics integrative approach using summary data,"Objective:This study aims to identify BMI-associated genes by integrating aggregated summary information from different omics data.Methods:We conducted a meta-analysis to leverage information from a genome-wide association study (n = 339 224), a transcriptome-wide association study (n = 5619), and an epigenome-wide association study (n = 3743). We prioritized the significant genes with a machine learning-based method, netWAS, which borrows information from adipose tissue-specific interaction networks. We also used the brain-specific network in netWAS to investigate genes potentially involved in brain-adipose interaction.Results:We identified 195 genes that were significantly associated with BMI through meta-analysis. The netWAS analysis narrowed down the list to 21 genes in adipose tissue. Among these 21 genes, six genes, including FUS, STX4, CCNT2, FUBP1, NDUFS3, and RAPSN, were not reported to be BMI-associated in PubMed or GWAS Catalog. We also identified 11 genes that were significantly associated with BMI in both adipose and whole brain tissues.Conclusion:This study integrated three types of omics data and identified a group of genes that have not previously been reported to be associated with BMI. This strategy could provide new insights for future studies to identify molecular mechanisms contributing to BMI regulation.",38215789,,10.1093/hmg/ddad212,0,Human molecular genetics,9208958,5.121
scBridge embraces cell heterogeneity in single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data integration,"Single-cell multi-omics data integration aims to reduce the omics difference while keeping the cell type difference. However, it is daunting to model and distinguish the two differences due to cell heterogeneity. Namely, even cells of the same omics and type would have various features, making the two differences less significant. In this work, we reveal that instead of being an interference, cell heterogeneity could be exploited to improve data integration. Specifically, we observe that the omics difference varies in cells, and cells with smaller omics differences are easier to be integrated. Hence, unlike most existing works that homogeneously treat and integrate all cells, we propose a multi-omics data integration method (dubbed scBridge) that integrates cells in a heterogeneous manner. In brief, scBridge iterates between i) identifying reliable scATAC-seq cells that have smaller omics differences, and ii) integrating reliable scATAC-seq cells with scRNA-seq data to narrow the omics gap, thus benefiting the integration for the rest cells. Extensive experiments on seven multi-omics datasets demonstrate the superiority of scBridge compared with six representative baselines.",37770437,PMC10539354,10.1038/s41467-023-41795-5,1,Nature communications,101528555,17.694
Multi-omics reveal the metabolic patterns in mouse cumulus cells during oocyte maturation,"Bi-directional communication between cumulus cells and the surrounded oocytes is important for the development and functions of both compartments. However, the metabolic framework in cumulus cells has not been systematically described. In the present study, cumulus cells from cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) at three key time points were isolated (arrested GV stage, post-hCG 0h; meiotic resumption GVBD stage, post-hCG 3h; and metaphase II stage, post-hCG 12h), and the temporal metabolomic and proteomic profiling were performed. Integrated multi-omics analysis reveals the global metabolic patterns in cumulus cells during mouse oocyte maturation. In particular, we found the active hyaluronic acid metabolism, steroid hormone synthesis, and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production in cumulus cells. Meanwhile, accompanying the oocyte maturation, a progressive increase in nucleotide and amino acid metabolism was detected in the surrounding cumulus cells. In sum, the data serve as a valuable resource for probing metabolism during terminal differentiation of ovarian granulosa cells, and provide the potential biomarkers for improving and predicting oocyte quality.",37550748,PMC10408154,10.1186/s13048-023-01237-8,0,Journal of ovarian research,101474849,5.506
An overview of technologies for MS-based proteomics-centric multi-omics,"Introduction:Mass spectrometry-based proteomics reveals dynamic molecular signatures underlying phenotypes reflecting normal and perturbed conditions in living systems. Although valuable on its own, the proteome has only one level of moleclar information, with the genome, epigenome, transcriptome, and metabolome, all providing complementary information. Multi-omic analysis integrating information from one or more of these other domains with proteomic information provides a more complete picture of molecular contributors to dynamic biological systems.Areas covered:Here, we discuss the improvements to mass spectrometry-based technologies, focused on peptide-based, bottom-up approaches that have enabled deep, quantitative characterization of complex proteomes. These advances are facilitating the integration of proteomics data with other 'omic information, providing a more complete picture of living systems. We also describe the current state of bioinformatics software and approaches for integrating proteomics and other 'omics data, critical for enabling new discoveries driven by multi-omics.Expert commentary:Multi-omics, centered on the integration of proteomics information with other 'omic information, has tremendous promise for biological and biomedical studies. Continued advances in approaches for generating deep, reliable proteomic data and bioinformatics tools aimed at integrating data across 'omic domains will ensure the discoveries offered by these multi-omic studies continue to increase.",35466851,PMC9613604,10.1080/14789450.2022.2070476,10,Expert review of proteomics,101223548,4.25
"BioVLAB-mCpG-SNP-EXPRESS: A system for multi-level and multi-perspective analysis and exploration of DNA methylation, sequence variation (SNPs), and gene expression from multi-omics data","Measuring gene expression, DNA sequence variation, and DNA methylation status is routinely done using high throughput sequencing technologies. To analyze such multi-omics data and explore relationships, reliable bioinformatics systems are much needed. Existing systems are either for exploring curated data or for processing omics data in the form of a library such as R. Thus scientists have much difficulty in investigating relationships among gene expression, DNA sequence variation, and DNA methylation using multi-omics data. In this study, we report a system called BioVLAB-mCpG-SNP-EXPRESS for the integrated analysis of DNA methylation, sequence variation (SNPs), and gene expression for distinguishing cellular phenotypes at the pairwise and multiple phenotype levels. The system can be deployed on either the Amazon cloud or a publicly available high-performance computing node, and the data analysis and exploration of the analysis result can be conveniently done using a web-based interface. In order to alleviate analysis complexity, all the process are fully automated, and graphical workflow system is integrated to represent real-time analysis progression. The BioVLAB-mCpG-SNP-EXPRESS system works in three stages. First, it processes and analyzes multi-omics data as input in the form of the raw data, i.e., FastQ files. Second, various integrated analyses such as methylation vs. gene expression and mutation vs. methylation are performed. Finally, the analysis result can be explored in a number of ways through a web interface for the multi-level, multi-perspective exploration. Multi-level interpretation can be done by either gene, gene set, pathway or network level and multi-perspective exploration can be explored from either gene expression, DNA methylation, sequence variation, or their relationship perspective. The utility of the system is demonstrated by performing analysis of phenotypically distinct 30breast cancer cell line data set. BioVLAB-mCpG-SNP-EXPRESS is available at http://biohealth.snu.ac.kr/software/biovlab_mcpg_snp_express/.",27477210,,10.1016/j.ymeth.2016.07.019,1,"Methods (San Diego, Calif.)",9426302,4.647
GpemDB: A Scalable Database Architecture with the Multi-omics Entity-relationship Model to Integrate Heterogeneous Big-data for Precise Crop Breeding,"Background:With the development of high-throughput genome sequencing and phenotype screening techniques, there is a possibility of leveraging multi-omics to speed up the breeding process. However, the heterogeneity of big data handicaps the progress and the lack of a comprehensive database supporting end-to-end association analysis impedes the efficient use of these data.Methods:In response to this problem, a scalable entity-relationship model and a database architecture are firstly proposed in this paper to manage the cross-platform data sets and explore the relationship among multi-omics, and finally accelerate our breeding efficiency. First, the targeted omics data of crops should be normalized before being stored in the database. A typical breeding data content and structure is demonstrated with the case study of rice (Oryza sativa L). Second, the structure, patterns and hierarchy of multi-omics data are described with the entity-relationship modeling technique. Third, some statistical tools used frequently in the agricultural analysis have been embedded into the database to help breeding.Results:As a result, a general-purpose scalable database, called GpemDB integrating genomics, phenomics, enviromics and management, is developed. It is the first database designed to manage all these four omics data together. The GpemDB involving Gpem metadata-level layer and informative-level layer provides a visualized scheme to display the content of the database and facilitates users to manage, analyze and share breeding data.Conclusions:GpemDB has been successfully applied to a rice population, which demonstrates this database architecture and model are promising to serve as a powerful tool to utilize the big data for high precise and efficient research and breeding of crops.",35638426,,10.31083/j.fbl2705159,2,Frontiers in bioscience (Landmark edition),101612996,3.115
Exploiting Interdata Relationships in Next-generation Proteomics Analysis,"Mass spectrometry based proteomics and other technologies have matured to enable routine quantitative, system-wide analysis of concentrations, modifications, and interactions of proteins, mRNAs, and other molecules. These studies have allowed us to move toward a new field concerned with mining information from the combination of these orthogonal data sets, perhaps called ""integromics."" We highlight examples of recent studies and tools that aim at relating proteomic information to mRNAs, genetic associations, and changes in small molecules and lipids. We argue that productive data integration differs from parallel acquisition and interpretation and should move toward quantitative modeling of the relationships between the data. These relationships might be expressed by temporal information retrieved from time series experiments, rate equations to model synthesis and degradation, or networks of causal, evolutionary, physical, and other interactions. We outline steps and considerations toward such integromic studies to exploit the synergy between data sets.",31126983,PMC6692783,10.1074/mcp.MR118.001246,19,Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP,101125647,7.381
A Practical Guide to Inferring Multi-Omics Networks in Plant Systems,"The inference of gene regulatory networks can reveal molecular connections underlying biological processes and improve our understanding of complex biological phenomena in plants. Many previous network studies have inferred networks using only one type of omics data, such as transcriptomics. However, given more recent work applying multi-omics integration in plant biology, such as combining (phospho)proteomics with transcriptomics, it may be advantageous to integrate multiple omics data types into a comprehensive network prediction. Here, we describe a state-of-the-art approach for integrating multi-omics data with gene regulatory network inference to describe signaling pathways and uncover novel regulators. We detail how to download and process transcriptomics and (phospho)proteomics data for network inference, using an example dataset from the plant hormone signaling field. We provide a step-by-step protocol for inference, visualization, and analysis of an integrative multi-omics network using currently available methods. This chapter serves as an accessible guide for novice and intermediate bioinformaticians to analyze their own datasets and reanalyze published work.",37682479,,10.1007/978-1-0716-3354-0_15,1,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,0.0
Precision medicine: In need of guidance and surveillance,"Precision medicine, currently a hotspot in mainstream medicine, has been strongly promoted in recent years. With rapid technological development, such as next-generation sequencing, and fierce competition in molecular targeted drug exploitation, precision medicine represents an advance in science and technology; it also fulfills needs in public health care. The clinical translation and application of precision medicine - especially in the prevention and treatment of tumors - is far from satisfactory; however, the aims of precision medicine deserve approval. Thus, this medical approach is currently in its infancy; it has promising prospects, but it needs to overcome numbers of problems and deficiencies. It is expected that in addition to conventional symptoms and signs, precision medicine will define disease in terms of the underlying molecular characteristics and other environmental susceptibility factors. Those expectations should be realized by constructing a novel data network, integrating clinical data from individual patients and personal genomic background with existing research on the molecular makeup of diseases. In addition, multi-omics analysis and multi-discipline collaboration will become crucial elements in precision medicine. Precision medicine deserves strong support, and its development demands directed momentum. We propose three kinds of impetus (research, application and collaboration impetus) for such directed momentum toward promoting precision medicine and accelerating its clinical translation and application.",28811702,PMC5537174,10.3748/wjg.v23.i28.5045,4,World journal of gastroenterology,100883448,5.374
Advancing neuro-oncology of glial tumors from big data and multidisciplinary studies,"Introduction:Multidisciplinary studies for glial tumors has produced an enormous amount of information including imaging, histology, and a large cohort of molecular data (i.e. genomics, epigenomics, metabolomics, proteomics, etc.). The big data resources are made possible through open access that offers great potential for new biomarker or therapeutic intervention via deep-learning and/or machine learning for integrated multi-omics analysis. An equally important effort to define the hallmarks of glial tumors will also advance precision neuro-oncology and inform patient-specific therapeutics. This review summarizes past studies regarding tumor classification, hallmarks of cancer, and hypothetical mechanisms. Leveraging on advanced big data approaches and ongoing cross-disciplinary endeavors, this review also discusses how to integrate multiple layers of big data toward the goal of precision medicine.Results:In addition to basic research of cancer biology, the results from integrated multi-omics analysis will highlight biological processes and potential candidates as biomarkers or therapeutic targets. Ultimately, these collective resources built upon an armamentarium of accessible data can re-form clinical and molecular data to stratify patient-tailored therapy.Conclusion:We envision that a comprehensive understanding of the link between molecular signatures, tumor locations, and patients' history will identify a molecular taxonomy of glial tumors to advance the improvements in early diagnosis, prevention, and treatment.",31853838,,10.1007/s11060-019-03369-8,2,Journal of neuro-oncology,8309335,4.506
Deep Subspace Mutual Learning for cancer subtypes prediction,"Motivation:Precise prediction of cancer subtypes is of significant importance in cancer diagnosis and treatment. Disease etiology is complicated existing at different omics levels; hence integrative analysis provides a very effective way to improve our understanding of cancer.Results:We propose a novel computational framework, named Deep Subspace Mutual Learning (DSML). DSML has the capability to simultaneously learn the subspace structures in each available omics data and in overall multi-omics data by adopting deep neural networks, which thereby facilitates the subtype's prediction via clustering on multi-level, single-level and partial-level omics data. Extensive experiments are performed in five different cancers on three levels of omics data from The Cancer Genome Atlas. The experimental analysis demonstrates that DSML delivers comparable or even better results than many state-of-the-art integrative methods.Availability and implementation:An implementation and documentation of the DSML is publicly available at https://github.com/polytechnicXTT/Deep-Subspace-Mutual-Learning.git.",34478501,,10.1093/bioinformatics/btab625,1,"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",9808944,6.931
Clustering and variable selection evaluation of 13 unsupervised methods for multi-omics data integration,"Recent advances in NGS sequencing, microarrays and mass spectrometry for omics data production have enabled the generation and collection of different modalities of high-dimensional molecular data. The integration of multiple omics datasets is a statistical challenge, due to the limited number of individuals, the high number of variables and the heterogeneity of the datasets to integrate. Recently, a lot of tools have been developed to solve the problem of integrating omics data including canonical correlation analysis, matrix factorization and SM. These commonly used techniques aim to analyze simultaneously two or more types of omics. In this article, we compare a panel of 13 unsupervised methods based on these different approaches to integrate various types of multi-omics datasets: iClusterPlus, regularized generalized canonical correlation analysis, sparse generalized canonical correlation analysis, multiple co-inertia analysis (MCIA), integrative-NMF (intNMF), SNF, MoCluster, mixKernel, CIMLR, LRAcluster, ConsensusClustering, PINSPlus and multi-omics factor analysis (MOFA). We evaluate the ability of the methods to recover the subgroups and the variables that drive the clustering on eight benchmarks of simulation. MOFA does not provide any results on these benchmarks. For clustering, SNF, MoCluster, CIMLR, LRAcluster, ConsensusClustering and intNMF provide the best results. For variable selection, MoCluster outperforms the others. However, the performance of the methods seems to depend on the heterogeneity of the datasets (especially for MCIA, intNMF and iClusterPlus). Finally, we apply the methods on three real studies with heterogeneous data and various phenotypes. We conclude that MoCluster is the best method to analyze these omics data.

PathIntegrate: Multivariate modelling approaches for pathway-based multi-omics data integration,"As terabytes of multi-omics data are being generated, there is an ever-increasing need for methods facilitating the integration and interpretation of such data. Current multi-omics integration methods typically output lists, clusters, or subnetworks of molecules related to an outcome. Even with expert domain knowledge, discerning the biological processes involved is a time-consuming activity. Here we propose PathIntegrate, a method for integrating multi-omics datasets based on pathways, designed to exploit knowledge of biological systems and thus provide interpretable models for such studies. PathIntegrate employs single-sample pathway analysis to transform multi-omics datasets from the molecular to the pathway-level, and applies a predictive single-view or multi-view model to integrate the data. Model outputs include multi-omics pathways ranked by their contribution to the outcome prediction, the contribution of each omics layer, and the importance of each molecule in a pathway. Using semi-synthetic data we demonstrate the benefit of grouping molecules into pathways to detect signals in low signal-to-noise scenarios, as well as the ability of PathIntegrate to precisely identify important pathways at low effect sizes. Finally, using COPD and COVID-19 data we showcase how PathIntegrate enables convenient integration and interpretation of complex high-dimensional multi-omics datasets. PathIntegrate is available as an open-source Python package.",38527092,PMC10994553,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011814,0,PLoS computational biology,101238922,4.779
BnIR: A multi-omics database with various tools for Brassica napus research and breeding,"In the post-genome-wide association study era, multi-omics techniques have shown great power and potential for candidate gene mining and functional genomics research. However, due to the lack of effective data integration and multi-omics analysis platforms, such techniques have not still been applied widely in rapeseed, an important oil crop worldwide. Here, we report a rapeseed multi-omics database (BnIR; http://yanglab.hzau.edu.cn/BnIR), which provides datasets of six omics including genomics, transcriptomics, variomics, epigenetics, phenomics, and metabolomics, as well as numerous ""variation-gene expression-phenotype"" associations by using multiple statistical methods. In addition, a series of multi-omics search and analysis tools are integrated to facilitate the browsing and application of these datasets. BnIR is the most comprehensive multi-omics database for rapeseed so far, and two case studies demonstrated its power to mine candidate genes associated with specific traits and analyze their potential regulatory mechanisms.",36919242,,10.1016/j.molp.2023.03.007,18,Molecular plant,101465514,21.949
Tightly integrated multiomics-based deep tensor survival model for time-to-event prediction,"Motivation:Multiomics cancer profiles provide essential signals for predicting cancer survival. It is challenging to reveal the complex patterns from multiple types of data and link them to survival outcomes. We aim to develop a new deep learning-based algorithm to integrate three types of high-dimensional omics data measured on the same individuals to improve cancer survival outcome prediction.Results:We built a three-dimension tensor to integrate multi-omics cancer data and factorized it into two-dimension matrices of latent factors, which were fed into neural networks-based survival networks. The new algorithm and other multi-omics-based algorithms, as well as individual genomic-based survival analysis algorithms, were applied to the breast cancer data colon and rectal cancer data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) program. We evaluated the goodness-of-fit using the concordance index (C-index) and Integrated Brier Score (IBS).

REALGAR: a web app of integrated respiratory omics data,"Motivation:In the post genome-wide association study (GWAS) era, omics techniques have characterized information beyond genomic variants to include cell and tissue type-specific gene transcription, transcription factor binding sites, expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and many other biological layers. Analysis of omics data and its integration has in turn improved the functional interpretation of disease-associated genetic variants. Over 170 000 transcriptomic and epigenomic datasets corresponding to studies of various cell and tissue types under specific disease, treatment and exposure conditions are available in the Gene Expression Omnibus resource. Although these datasets are valuable to guide the design of experimental validation studies to understand the function of disease-associated genetic loci, in their raw form, they are not helpful to experimental researchers who lack adequate computational resources or experience analyzing omics data. We sought to create an integrated re-source of tissue-specific results from omics studies that is guided by disease-specific knowledge to facilitate the design of experiments that can provide biologically meaningful insights into genetic associations.Results:We designed the Reducing Associations by Linking Genes and omics Results web app to provide multi-layered omics information based on results from GWAS, transcriptomic, epigenomic and eQTL studies for gene-centric analysis and visualization. With a focus on asthma datasets, the integrated omics results it contains facilitate the formulation of hypotheses related to airways disease-associated genes and can be addressed with experimental validation studies.Availability and implementation:The REALGAR web app is available at: http://realgar.org/.

Significant advances in the integration methods of these multiomics data sets by machine learning promise us a holistic view of disease pathogenesis and yield biomarkers for disease diagnosis and prognosis. Using machine learning tools and algorithms, it is possible to integrate multiomics data with clinical information to develop predictive models that identify risk before the condition is clinically apparent, thus facilitating early interventions to improve the health trajectories of the patients. In this review, we intend to update the readers on the recent developments related to the use of artificial intelligence in integrating multiomic and clinical data sets in the field of perinatology, focusing on neonatal intensive care and the opportunities for precision medicine.

Simulation studies indicate that we can obtain consistent estimates reflective of the true simulated values, accurately estimate subgroups and recapitulate subgroup-specific effects. We also demonstrate the use of the integrated model for future prediction of risk subgroups and phenotypes.

PanDrugs2: prioritizing cancer therapies using integrated individual multi-omics data,"Genomics studies routinely confront researchers with long lists of tumor alterations detected in patients. Such lists are difficult to interpret since only a minority of the alterations are relevant biomarkers for diagnosis and for designing therapeutic strategies. PanDrugs is a methodology that facilitates the interpretation of tumor molecular alterations and guides the selection of personalized treatments. To do so, PanDrugs scores gene actionability and drug feasibility to provide a prioritized evidence-based list of drugs. Here, we introduce PanDrugs2, a major upgrade of PanDrugs that, in addition to somatic variant analysis, supports a new integrated multi-omics analysis which simultaneously combines somatic and germline variants, copy number variation and gene expression data. Moreover, PanDrugs2 now considers cancer genetic dependencies to extend tumor vulnerabilities providing therapeutic options for untargetable genes. Importantly, a novel intuitive report to support clinical decision-making is generated.

Multi-Omics Data Integration Reveals Sex-Dependent Hippocampal Programming by Maternal High-Fat Diet during Lactation in Adult Mouse Offspring,"Early-life exposure to high-fat diets (HF) can program metabolic and cognitive alterations in adult offspring. Although the hippocampus plays a crucial role in memory and metabolic homeostasis, few studies have reported the impact of maternal HF on this structure. We assessed the effects of maternal HF during lactation on physiological, metabolic, and cognitive parameters in young adult offspring mice. To identify early-programming mechanisms in the hippocampus, we developed a multi-omics strategy in male and female offspring. Maternal HF induced a transient increased body weight at weaning, and a mild glucose intolerance only in 3-month-old male mice with no change in plasma metabolic parameters in adult male and female offspring. Behavioral alterations revealed by a Barnes maze test were observed both in 6-month-old male and female mice. The multi-omics strategy unveiled sex-specific transcriptomic and proteomic modifications in the hippocampus of adult offspring. These studies that were confirmed by regulon analysis show that, although genes whose expression was modified by maternal HF were different between sexes, the main pathways affected were similar with mitochondria and synapses as main hippocampal targets of maternal HF. The effects of maternal HF reported here may help to better characterize sex-dependent molecular pathways involved in cognitive disorders and neurodegenerative diseases.",37960344,PMC10649590,10.3390/nu15214691,0,Nutrients,101521595,6.706
Unveiling the novel immune and molecular signatures of ovarian cancer: insights and innovations from single-cell sequencing,"Ovarian cancer is a highly heterogeneous and lethal malignancy with limited treatment options. Over the past decade, single-cell sequencing has emerged as an advanced biological technology capable of decoding the landscape of ovarian cancer at the single-cell resolution. It operates at the level of genes, transcriptomes, proteins, epigenomes, and metabolisms, providing detailed information that is distinct from bulk sequencing methods, which only offer average data for specific lesions. Single-cell sequencing technology provides detailed insights into the immune and molecular mechanisms underlying tumor occurrence, development, drug resistance, and immune escape. These insights can guide the development of innovative diagnostic markers, therapeutic strategies, and prognostic indicators. Overall, this review provides a comprehensive summary of the diverse applications of single-cell sequencing in ovarian cancer.

To maximize the potential for discovery, computational biologists have created and adapted integrative multi-omic analytical methods. When applied to diseases with traceable pathophysiology such as cancer, these new algorithms and statistical approaches have enabled the discovery of clinically relevant molecular mechanisms and biomarkers. In contrast, these methods have been much less applied to the field of molecular psychiatry, although diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers are similarly needed. In the present review, we first briefly summarize main findings from two decades of studies that investigated single molecular processes in relation to mood disorders. Then, we conduct a systematic review of multi-omic strategies that have been proposed and used more recently. We also list databases and types of data available to researchers for future work.

In soybean, numerous multi-omics databases have been published. Although they cover multiple omics, there are still limitations when it comes to the types and scales of omics datasets and analysis methods utilized. This study aims to address these limitations by collecting and integrating a comprehensive set of multi-omics datasets. This includes 38 genomes, transcriptomes from 435 tissue samples, 125 phenotypes from 6686 accessions, epigenome data involving histone modification, transcription factor binding, chromosomal accessibility and chromosomal interaction, as well as genetic variation data from 24 501 soybean accessions.

"From Microcosm to Macrocosm: The -Omics, Multiomics, and Sportomics Approaches in Exercise and Sports","This article explores the progressive integration of -omics methods, including genomics, metabolomics, and proteomics, into sports research, highlighting the development of the concept of ""sportomics."" We discuss how sportomics can be used to comprehend the multilevel metabolism during exercise in real-life conditions faced by athletes, enabling potential personalized interventions to improve performance and recovery and reduce injuries, all with a minimally invasive approach and reduced time. Sportomics may also support highly personalized investigations, including the implementation ofn-of-1 clinical trials and the curation of extensive datasets through long-term follow-up of athletes, enabling tailored interventions for athletes based on their unique physiological responses to different conditions. Beyond its immediate sport-related applications, we delve into the potential of utilizing the sportomics approach to translate Big Data regarding top-level athletes into studying different human diseases, especially with nontargeted analysis.

"The Personal Genome Project-UK, an open access resource of human multi-omics data","Integrative analysis of multi-omics data is a powerful approach for gaining functional insights into biological and medical processes. Conducting these multifaceted analyses on human samples is often complicated by the fact that the raw sequencing output is rarely available under open access. The Personal Genome Project UK (PGP-UK) is one of few resources that recruits its participants under open consent and makes the resulting multi-omics data freely and openly available. As part of this resource, we describe the PGP-UK multi-omics reference panel consisting of ten genomic, methylomic and transcriptomic data. Specifically, we outline the data processing, quality control and validation procedures which were implemented to ensure data integrity and exclude sample mix-ups. In addition, we provide a REST API to facilitate the download of the entire PGP-UK dataset. The data are also available from two cloud-based environments, providing platforms for free integrated analysis. In conclusion, the genotype-validated PGP-UK multi-omics human reference panel described here provides a valuable new open access resource for integrated analyses in support of personal and medical genomics.",31672996,PMC6823446,10.1038/s41597-019-0205-4,12,Scientific data,101640192,8.501
Topological integration of RPPA proteomic data with multi-omics data for survival prediction in breast cancer via pathway activity inference,"Background:The analysis of integrated multi-omics data enables the identification of disease-related biomarkers that cannot be identified from a single omics profile. Although protein-level data reflects the cellular status of cancer tissue more directly than gene-level data, past studies have mainly focused on multi-omics integration using gene-level data as opposed to protein-level data. However, the use of protein-level data (such as mass spectrometry) in multi-omics integration has some limitations. For example, the correlation between the characteristics of gene-level data (such as mRNA) and protein-level data is weak, and it is difficult to detect low-abundance signaling proteins that are used to target cancer. The reverse phase protein array (RPPA) is a highly sensitive antibody-based quantification method for signaling proteins. However, the number of protein features in RPPA data is extremely low compared to the number of gene features in gene-level data. In this study, we present a new method for integrating RPPA profiles with RNA-Seq and DNA methylation profiles for survival prediction based on the integrative directed random walk (iDRW) framework proposed in our previous study. In the iDRW framework, each omics profile is merged into a single pathway profile that reflects the topological information of the pathway. In order to address the sparsity of RPPA profiles, we employ the random walk with restart (RWR) approach on the pathway network.Results:Our model was validated using survival prediction analysis for a breast cancer dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Our proposed model exhibited improved performance compared with other methods that utilize pathway information and also out-performed models that did not include the RPPA data utilized in our study. The risk pathways identified for breast cancer in this study were closely related to well-known breast cancer risk pathways.Conclusions:Our results indicated that RPPA data is useful for survival prediction for breast cancer patients under our framework. We also observed that iDRW effectively integrates RNA-Seq, DNA methylation, and RPPA profiles, while variation in the composition of the omics data can affect both prediction performance and risk pathway identification. These results suggest that omics data composition is a critical parameter for iDRW.",31296204,PMC6624183,10.1186/s12920-019-0511-x,2,BMC medical genomics,101319628,3.622
Multiomics Analysis Provides Novel Pathways Related to Progression of Heart Failure,"Background:Despite major advances in pharmacological treatment for patients with heart failure, residual mortality remains high. This suggests that important pathways are not yet targeted by current heart failure therapies.Objectives:We sought integration of genetic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data in a large cohort of patients with heart failure to detect major pathways related to progression of heart failure leading to death.Methods:We used machine learning methodology based on stacked generalization framework and gradient boosting algorithms, using 54 clinical phenotypes, 403 circulating plasma proteins, 36,046 transcript expression levels in whole blood, and 6 million genomic markers to model all-cause mortality in 2,516 patients with heart failure from the BIOSTAT-CHF (Systems BIOlogy Study to TAilored Treatment in Chronic Heart Failure) study. Results were validated in an independent cohort of 1,738 patients.Results:The mean age of the patients was 70 years (Q1-Q3: 61-78 years), 27% were female, median N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide was 4,275 ng/L (Q1-Q3: 2,360-8,486 ng/L), and 7% had heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. During a median follow-up of 21 months, 657 (26%) of patients died. The 4 major pathways with a significant association to all-cause mortality were: 1) the PI3K/Akt pathway; 2) the MAPK pathway; 3) the Ras signaling pathway; and 4) epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance. Results were validated in an independent cohort of 1,738 patients.Conclusions:A systems biology approach integrating genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data identified 4 major pathways related to mortality. These pathways are related to decreased activation of the cardioprotective ERBB2 receptor, which can be modified by neuregulin.",37940229,,10.1016/j.jacc.2023.08.053,0,Journal of the American College of Cardiology,8301365,27.203
Improving existing analysis pipeline to identify and analyze cancer driver genes using multi-omics data,"The cumulative of genes carrying mutations is vital for the establishment and development of cancer. However, this driver gene exploring research line has selected and used types of tools and models of analysis unsystematically and discretely. Also, the previous studies may have neglected low-frequency drivers and seldom predicted subgroup specificities of identified driver genes. In this study, we presented an improved driver gene identification and analysis pipeline that comprises the four most widely focused analyses for driver genes: enrichment analysis, clinical feature association with expression profiles of identified driver genes as well as with their functional modules, and patient stratification by existing advanced computational tools integrating multi-omics data. The improved pipeline's general usability was demonstrated straightforwardly for breast cancer, validated by some independent databases. Accordingly, 31 validated driver genes, including four novel ones, were discovered. Subsequently, we detected cancer-related significantly enriched gene ontology terms and pathways, probable drug targets, two co-expressed modules associated significantly with several clinical features, such as number of positive lymph nodes, Nottingham prognostic index, and tumor stage, and two biologically distinct groups of BRCA patients.

Characterizing the Survival-Associated Interactions Between Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes and Tumors From Pathological Images and Multi-Omics Data,"The tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and its correlation with tumors have shown significant values in the development of cancers. Many observations indicated that the combination of the whole-slide pathological images (WSIs) and genomic data can better characterize the immunological mechanisms of TILs. However, the existing image-genomic studies evaluated the TILs by the combination of pathological image and single-type of omics data (e.g., mRNA), which is difficulty in assessing the underlying molecular processes of TILs holistically. Additionally, it is still very challenging to characterize the intersections between TILs and tumor regions in WSIs and the high dimensional genomic data also brings difficulty for the integrative analysis with WSIs. Based on the above considerations, we proposed an end-to-end deep learning framework i.e., IMO-TILs that can integrate pathological image with multi-omics data (i.e., mRNA and miRNA) to analyze TILs and explore the survival-associated interactions between TILs and tumors. Specifically, we firstly apply the graph attention network to describe the spatial interactions between TILs and tumor regions in WSIs. As to genomic data, the Concrete AutoEncoder (i.e., CAE) is adopted to select survival-associated Eigengenes from the high-dimensional multi-omics data. Finally, the deep generalized canonical correlation analysis (DGCCA) accompanied with the attention layer is implemented to fuse the image and multi-omics data for prognosis prediction of human cancers. The experimental results on three cancer cohorts derived from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) indicated that our method can both achieve higher prognosis results and identify consistent imaging and multi-omics bio-markers correlated strongly with the prognosis of human cancers.",37159321,,10.1109/TMI.2023.3274652,1,IEEE transactions on medical imaging,8310780,11.037
The fusion of multi-omics profile and multimodal EEG data contributes to the personalized diagnostic strategy for neurocognitive disorders,"Background:The increasing prevalence of neurocognitive disorders (NCDs) in the aging population worldwide has become a significant concern due to subjectivity of evaluations and the lack of precise diagnostic methods and specific indicators. Developing personalized diagnostic strategies for NCDs has therefore become a priority.Results:Multimodal electroencephalography (EEG) data of a matched cohort of normal aging (NA) and NCDs seniors were recorded, and their faecal samples and urine exosomes were collected to identify multi-omics signatures and metabolic pathways in NCDs by integrating metagenomics, proteomics, and metabolomics analysis. Additionally, experimental verification of multi-omics signatures was carried out in aged mice using faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). We found that NCDs seniors had low EEG power spectral density and identified specific microbiota, including Ruminococcus gnavus, Enterocloster bolteae, Lachnoclostridium sp. YL 32, and metabolites, including L-tryptophan, L-glutamic acid, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and fatty acid esters of hydroxy fatty acids (FAHFAs), as well as disturbed biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids and TCA cycle dysfunction, validated in aged mice. Finally, we employed a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm to construct a machine learning model to classify NA and NCDs groups based on the fusion of EEG data and multi-omics profiles and the model demonstrated 92.69% accuracy in classifying NA and NCDs groups.Conclusions:Our study highlights the potential of multi-omics profiling and EEG data fusion in personalized diagnosis of NCDs, with the potential to improve diagnostic precision and provide insights into the underlying mechanisms of NCDs.

Methods for the integration of multi-omics data: mathematical aspects,"Background:Methods for the integrative analysis of multi-omics data are required to draw a more complete and accurate picture of the dynamics of molecular systems. The complexity of biological systems, the technological limits, the large number of biological variables and the relatively low number of biological samples make the analysis of multi-omics datasets a non-trivial problem.Results and conclusions:We review the most advanced strategies for integrating multi-omics datasets, focusing on mathematical and methodological aspects.",26821531,PMC4959355,10.1186/s12859-015-0857-9,152,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,3.307
Multi-OMICS approaches in cancer biology: New era in cancer therapy,"Innovative multi-omics frameworks integrate diverse datasets from the same patients to enhance our understanding of the molecular and clinical aspects of cancers. Advanced omics and multi-view clustering algorithms present unprecedented opportunities for classifying cancers into subtypes, refining survival predictions and treatment outcomes, and unravelling key pathophysiological processes across various molecular layers. However, with the increasing availability of cost-effective high-throughput technologies (HTT) that generate vast amounts of data, analyzing single layers often falls short of establishing causal relations. Integrating multi-omics data spanning genomes, epigenomes, transcriptomes, proteomes, metabolomes, and microbiomes offers unique prospects to comprehend the underlying biology of complex diseases like cancer. This discussion explores algorithmic frameworks designed to uncover cancer subtypes, disease mechanisms, and methods for identifying pivotal genomic alterations. It also underscores the significance of multi-omics in tumor classifications, diagnostics, and prognostications. Despite its unparalleled advantages, the integration of multi-omics data has been slow to find its way into everyday clinics. A major hurdle is the uneven maturity of different omics approaches and the widening gap between the generation of large datasets and the capacity to process this data. Initiatives promoting the standardization of sample processing and analytical pipelines, as well as multidisciplinary training for experts in data analysis and interpretation, are crucial for translating theoretical findings into practical applications.",38484941,,10.1016/j.bbadis.2024.167120,0,Biochimica et biophysica acta.

Executable Network Models of Integrated Multiomics Data,"Multiomics profiling provides a holistic picture of a condition being examined and captures the complexity of signaling events, beginning from the original cause (environmental or genetic), to downstream functional changes at multiple molecular layers. Pathway enrichment analysis has been used with multiomics data sets to characterize signaling mechanisms. However, technical and biological variability between these layered data limit an integrative computational analyses. We present a Boolean network-based method, multiomics Boolean Omics Network Invariant-Time Analysis (mBONITA), to integrate omics data sets that quantify multiple molecular layers. mBONITA utilizes prior knowledge networks to perform topology-based pathway analysis. In addition, mBONITA identifies genes that are consistently modulated across molecular measurements by combining observed fold-changes and variance, with a measure of node (i.e., gene or protein) influence over signaling, and a measure of the strength of evidence for that gene across data sets. We used mBONITA to integrate multiomics data sets from RAMOS B cells treated with the immunosuppressant drug cyclosporine A under varying O2tensions to identify pathways involved in hypoxia-mediated chemotaxis. We compare mBONITA's performance with 6 other pathway analysis methods designed for multiomics data and show that mBONITA identifies a set of pathways with evidence of modulation across all omics layers. mBONITA is freely available at https://github.com/Thakar-Lab/mBONITA.",37000949,PMC10167691,10.1021/acs.jproteome.2c00730,1,Journal of proteome research,101128775,5.37
Multi-omics approaches in psychoneuroimmunology and health research: Conceptual considerations and methodological recommendations,"The field of psychoneuroimmunology (PNI) has grown substantially in both relevance and prominence over the past 40 years. Notwithstanding its impressive trajectory, a majority of PNI studies are still based on a relatively small number of analytes. To advance this work, we suggest that PNI, and health research in general, can benefit greatly from adopting a multi-omics approach, which involves integrating data across multiple biological levels (e.g., the genome, proteome, transcriptome, metabolome, lipidome, and microbiome/metagenome) to more comprehensively profile biological functions and relate these profiles to clinical and behavioral outcomes. To assist investigators in this endeavor, we provide an overview of multi-omics research, highlight recent landmark multi-omics studies investigating human health and disease risk, and discuss how multi-omics can be applied to better elucidate links between psychological, nervous system, and immune system activity. In doing so, we describe how to design high-quality multi-omics studies, decide which biological samples (e.g., blood, stool, urine, saliva, solid tissue) are most relevant, incorporate behavioral and wearable sensing data into multi-omics research, and understand key data quality, integration, analysis, and interpretation issues. PNI researchers are addressing some of the most interesting and important questions at the intersection of psychology, neuroscience, and immunology. Applying a multi-omics approach to this work will greatly expand the horizon of what is possible in PNI and has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of mind-body medicine.",37543247,,10.1016/j.bbi.2023.07.022,5,"Brain, behavior, and immunity",8800478,19.227
Single cell multiomic analysis reveals diabetes-associated β-cell heterogeneity driven by HNF1A,"Broad heterogeneity in pancreatic β-cell function and morphology has been widely reported. However, determining which components of this cellular heterogeneity serve a diabetes-relevant function remains challenging. Here, we integrate single-cell transcriptome, single-nuclei chromatin accessibility, and cell-type specific 3D genome profiles from human islets and identify Type II Diabetes (T2D)-associated β-cell heterogeneity at both transcriptomic and epigenomic levels. We develop a computational method to explicitly dissect the intra-donor and inter-donor heterogeneity between single β-cells, which reflect distinct mechanisms of T2D pathogenesis. Integrative transcriptomic and epigenomic analysis identifies HNF1A as a principal driver of intra-donor heterogeneity between β-cells from the same donors; HNF1A expression is also reduced in β-cells from T2D donors. Interestingly, HNF1A activity in single β-cells is significantly associated with lower Na+ currents and we nominate a HNF1A target, FXYD2, as the primary mitigator. Our study demonstrates the value of investigating disease-associated single-cell heterogeneity and provides new insights into the pathogenesis of T2D.",37669939,PMC10480445,10.1038/s41467-023-41228-3,2,Nature communications,101528555,17.694
MyeloDB: a multi-omics resource for multiple myeloma,"Multiple myeloma (MM) is a common type of blood cancer affecting plasma cells originating from the lymphoid B-cell lineage. It accounts for about 10% of all hematological malignancies and can cause significant end-organ damage. The emergence of genomic technologies such as next-generation sequencing and gene expression analysis has opened new possibilities for early detection of multiple myeloma and identification of personalized treatment options. However, there remain significant challenges to overcome in MM research, including integrating multi-omics data, achieving a comprehensive understanding of the disease, and developing targeted therapies and biomarkers. The extensive data generated by these technologies presents another challenge for data analysis and interpretation. To bridge this gap, we have developed a multi-omics open-access database called MyeloDB. It includes gene expression profiling, high-throughput CRISPR-Cas9 screens, drug sensitivity resources profile, and biomarkers. MyeloDB contains 47 expression profiles, 3 methylation profiles comprising a total of 5630 patient samples and 25 biomarkers which were reported in previous studies. In addition to this, MyeloDB can provide significant insight of gene mutations in MM on drug sensitivity. Furthermore, users can download the datasets and conduct their own analyses. Utilizing this database, we have identified five novel genes, i.e., CBFB, MANF, MBNL1, SEPHS2, and UFM1 as potential drug targets for MM. We hope MyeloDB will serve as a comprehensive platform for researchers and foster novel discoveries in MM.

FGCNSurv: dually fused graph convolutional network for multi-omics survival prediction,"Motivation:Survival analysis is an important tool for modeling time-to-event data, e.g. to predict the survival time of patient after a cancer diagnosis or a certain treatment. While deep neural networks work well in standard prediction tasks, it is still unclear how to best utilize these deep models in survival analysis due to the difficulty of modeling right censored data, especially for multi-omics data. Although existing methods have shown the advantage of multi-omics integration in survival prediction, it remains challenging to extract complementary information from different omics and improve the prediction accuracy.Results:In this work, we propose a novel multi-omics deep survival prediction approach by dually fused graph convolutional network (GCN) named FGCNSurv. Our FGCNSurv is a complete generative model from multi-omics data to survival outcome of patients, including feature fusion by a factorized bilinear model, graph fusion of multiple graphs, higher-level feature extraction by GCN and survival prediction by a Cox proportional hazard model. The factorized bilinear model enables to capture cross-omics features and quantify complex relations from multi-omics data. By fusing single-omics features and the cross-omics features, and simultaneously fusing multiple graphs from different omics, GCN with the generated dually fused graph could capture higher-level features for computing the survival loss in the Cox-PH model. Comprehensive experimental results on real-world datasets with gene expression and microRNA expression data show that the proposed FGCNSurv method outperforms existing survival prediction methods, and imply its ability to extract complementary information for survival prediction from multi-omics data.Availability and implementation:The codes are freely available at https://github.com/LiminLi-xjtu/FGCNSurv.",37522887,PMC10412406,10.1093/bioinformatics/btad472,0,"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",9808944,6.931
From cancer big data to treatment: Artificial intelligence in cancer research,"In recent years, developing the idea of ""cancer big data"" has emerged as a result of the significant expansion of various fields such as clinical research, genomics, proteomics and public health records. Advances in omics technologies are making a significant contribution to cancer big data in biomedicine and disease diagnosis. The increasingly availability of extensive cancer big data has set the stage for the development of multimodal artificial intelligence (AI) frameworks. These frameworks aim to analyze high-dimensional multi-omics data, extracting meaningful information that is challenging to obtain manually. Although interpretability and data quality remain critical challenges, these methods hold great promise for advancing our understanding of cancer biology and improving patient care and clinical outcomes. Here, we provide an overview of cancer big data and explore the applications of both traditional machine learning and deep learning approaches in cancer genomic and proteomic studies.

Uncertainty-aware dynamic integration for multi-omics classification of tumors,"Purpose:Omics data are crucial for medical diagnosis as it contains intrinsic biomedical information. Multi-omics integrated analysis has become a new direction for scientists to explore life mechanisms. Nevertheless, the quality of complex omics data often varies greatly due to different samples or even different omics types, it is challenging to dynamically capture the uncertainty for different kinds of omics data.Methods:This paper proposes a uncertainty-aware dynamic integration framework for multi-omics classification. The framework consists of three modules: deep embedding, confidence prediction, and downstream tasks. The deep embedding module extract key information from multi-omics data to obtain a low-dimensional feature representation which is used to train downstream tasks. Combined with the deep embedding module, the confidence prediction module is used to dynamically capture the uncertainty of the data. We introduce ""confidNet"" to assign a confidence value for each type of omics data, which is used for dynamic integration between multi-omics.Results:Compared with other integration methods, the proposed method can contain more crucial biomedical information in the obtained low-dimensional representation. Our framework realizes reliable integration among multiple omics, and it can still achieve high accuracy on small sample data sets. We have verified the effectiveness of the model in a large number of experiments.Conclusion:Our framework can be widely applied to high-dimensional omics data and has great potential to facilitate medical decision-making and biological analysis.",35925427,,10.1007/s00432-022-04219-3,1,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,4.322
Capturing the latent space of an Autoencoder for multi-omics integration and cancer subtyping,"Background and objective:The motivation behind cancer subtyping is to identify subgroups of cancer patients with distinguishable phenotypes of clinical importance. It can assist in advancement of subtype-targeted based treatments. Subtype identification is a complicated task, therefore requires multi-omics data integration to identify the precise patients' subgroup. Over the years, several computational attempts have been made to identify the cancer subtypes accurately using integrative multi-omics analysis. Some studies have used Autoencoders (AE) to capture multi-omics feature integration in lower dimensions for identifying subtypes in specific types of cancer. However, capturing the highly informative latent space by learning the deep architectures of AE to attain a satisfactory generalized performance is required. Therefore, in this study, a novel AE-assisted cancer subtyping framework is presented that utilizes the compressed latent space of a Sparse AE neural network for multi-omics clustering.Methods:The proposed framework first performs a supervised feature selection based on the survival status of the patients. The selected features from each of the omic data are passed to the AE. The information embedded in the latent space of the trained AE neural networks are then used for cancer subtyping using Spectral clustering. The AE architecture designed in this study exhaustively searches the best compression for multi-omics data by varying the number of neurons in the hidden layers and penalizing activations within the layers.Results and conclusion:The proposed framework is applied to five different multi-omics cancer datasets taken from The Cancer Genome Atlas. It is observed that for getting a robust information bottleneck, a compression of 10-20% of the input features along with an L1 regularization penalty of 0.01 or 0.001 performs well for most of the cancer datasets. Clustering performed on this latent representation generates clusters with better silhouette scores and significantly varying survival patterns. For further biological assessment, differential expression analysis is performed between the identified subtypes of Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), followed by enrichment analysis of the differentially expressed biomarkers. Several pathways and disease ontology terms coherent to GBM are found to be significantly associated. Varying responses of the identified GBM subtypes towards the drug Temozolomide is also tested to demonstrate its clinical importance. Hence, the study shows that AE-assisted multi-omics integration can be used for the prediction of clinically significant cancer subtypes.",35834966,,10.1016/j.compbiomed.2022.105832,3,Computers in biology and medicine,1250250,6.698
Multi-omics analysis of zebrafish response to tick saliva reveals biological processes associated with alpha-Gal syndrome,"The alpha-Gal syndrome (AGS) is a tick-borne allergy. A multi-omics approach was used to determine the effect of tick saliva and mammalian meat consumption on zebrafish gut transcriptome and proteome. Bioinformatics analysis using R software was focused on significant biological and metabolic pathway changes associated with AGS. Ortholog mapping identified highly concordant human ortholog genes for the detection of disease-enriched pathways. Tick saliva treatment increased zebrafish mortality, incidence of hemorrhagic type allergic reactions and changes in behavior and feeding patterns. Transcriptomics analysis showed downregulation of biological and metabolic pathways correlated with anti-alpha-Gal IgE and allergic reactions to tick saliva affecting blood circulation, cardiac and vascular smooth muscle contraction, behavior and sensory perception. Disease enrichment analysis revealed downregulated orthologous genes associated with human disorders affecting nervous, musculoskeletal, and cardiovascular systems. Proteomics analysis revealed suppression of pathways associated with immune system production of reactive oxygen species and cardiac muscle contraction. Underrepresented proteins were mainly linked to nervous and metabolic human disorders. Multi-omics data revealed inhibition of pathways associated with adrenergic signaling in cardiomyocytes, and heart and muscle contraction.

Identification of immunotherapy and chemotherapy-related molecular subtypes in colon cancer by integrated multi-omics data analysis,"Background:Colon cancer is a highly heterogeneous disease, and identifying molecular subtypes can provide insights into deregulated pathways within tumor subsets, which may lead to personalized treatment options. However, most prognostic models are based on single-pathway genes.Methods:In this study, we aimed to identify three clinically relevant subtypes of colon cancer based on multiple signaling pathways-related genes. Integrative multi-omics analysis was used to explain the biological processes contributing to colon cancer aggressiveness, recurrence, and progression. Machine learning methods were employed to identify the subtypes and provide medication guidance for distinct subtypes using the L1000 platform. We developed a robust prognostic model (MKPC score) based on gene pairs and validated it in one internal test set and three external test sets. Risk-related genes were extracted and verified by qPCR.Results:Three clinically relevant subtypes of colon cancer were identified based on multiple signaling pathways-related genes, which had significantly different survival state (Log-Rank test, p<0.05). Integrative multi-omics analysis revealed biological processes contributing to colon cancer aggressiveness, recurrence, and progression. The developed MKPC score, based on gene pairs, was robust in predicting prognosis state (Log-Rank test, p<0.05), and risk-related genes were successfully verified by qPCR (t test, p<0.05). An easy-to-use web tool was created for risk scoring and therapy stratification in colon cancer patients, and the practical nomogram can be extended to other cancer types.Conclusion:In conclusion, our study identified three clinically relevant subtypes of colon cancer and developed a robust prognostic model based on gene pairs. The developed web tool is a valuable resource for researchers and clinicians in risk scoring and therapy stratification in colon cancer patients, and the practical nomogram can be extended to other cancer types.",37020539,PMC10067602,10.3389/fimmu.2023.1142609,4,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,8.786
Autoencoder-assisted latent representation learning for survival prediction and multi-view clustering on multi-omics cancer subtyping,"Cancer subtyping (or cancer subtypes identification) based on multi-omics data has played an important role in advancing diagnosis, prognosis and treatment, which triggers the development of advanced multi-view clustering algorithms. However, the high-dimension and heterogeneity of multi-omics data make great effects on the performance of these methods. In this paper, we propose to learn the informative latent representation based on autoencoder (AE) to naturally capture nonlinear omic features in lower dimensions, which is helpful for identifying the similarity of patients. Moreover, to take advantage of survival information or clinical information, a multi-omic survival analysis approach is embedded when integrating the similarity graph of heterogeneous data at the multi-omics level. Then, the clustering method is performed on the integrated similarity to generate subtype groups. In the experimental part, the effectiveness of the proposed framework is confirmed by evaluating five different multi-omics datasets, taken from The Cancer Genome Atlas. The results show that AE-assisted multi-omics clustering method can identify clinically significant cancer subtypes.",38124589,,10.3934/mbe.2023933,0,Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE,101197794,2.194
Improving prediction performance of colon cancer prognosis based on the integration of clinical and multi-omics data,"Background:Colon cancer is common worldwide and is the leading cause of cancer-related death. Multiple levels of omics data are available due to the development of sequencing technologies. In this study, we proposed an integrative prognostic model for colon cancer based on the integration of clinical and multi-omics data.Methods:In total, 344 patients were included in this study. Clinical, gene expression, DNA methylation and miRNA expression data were retrieved from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). To accommodate the high dimensionality of omics data, unsupervised clustering was used as dimension reduction method. The bias-corrected Harrell's concordance index was used to verify which clustering result provided the best prognostic performance. Finally, we proposed a prognostic prediction model based on the integration of clinical data and multi-omics data. Uno's concordance index with cross-validation was used to compare the discriminative performance of the prognostic model constructed with different covariates.Results:Combinations of clinical and multi-omics data can improve prognostic performance, as shown by the increase of the bias-corrected Harrell's concordance of the prognostic model from 0.7424 (clinical features only) to 0.7604 (clinical features and three types of omics features).

Integration of ""-omics"" and multi-omics research is of high priority in sepsis, a heterogeneous syndrome that is widely recognized as a global health burden and a priority biomedical funding field. We report here an original study on bibliometric trends in the use of ""-omics"" technologies, and multi-omics approaches in particular, in sepsis research in three (supra)national settings, the United States, the European Union 28 Member States (EU-28), and China. Using a 5-year longitudinal bibliometric study design from 2011 to 2015, we analyzed the sepsis-related research articles in English language that included at least one or multi-omics technologies in publicly available form in Medline (free full texts). We found that the United States has had the lead (almost one-third of publications) in the inclusion of an ""-omics"" or multi-omics technology in sepsis within the study period. However, both China and the EU-28 displayed a significant increase in the number of publications that employed one or more types of ""-omics"" research (p < 0.005), while the EU-28 displayed a significant increase especially in multi-omics research articles in sepsis (p < 0.05). Notably, more than half of the multi-omics research studies in the sepsis knowledge domain had a university or government/state funding source. Among the multi-omics research publications in sepsis, the combination of genomics and transcriptomics was the most frequent (40.5%), followed by genomics and proteomics (20.4%). We suggest that the lead of the United States in the field of ""-omics"" and multi-omics research in sepsis is likely at stake, with both the EU-28 and China rapidly increasing their research capacity. Moreover, ""triple omics"" that combine genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics analyses appear to be uncommon in sepsis, and yet much needed for triangulation of systems science data. These observations have implications for ""-omics"" technology policy and global research funding strategic foresight.",29649387,,10.1089/omi.2017.0192,6,Omics : a journal of integrative biology,101131135,3.978
inMTSCCA: An Integrated Multi-task Sparse Canonical Correlation Analysis for Multi-omic Brain Imaging Genetics,"Identifying genetic risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an important research topic. To date, different endophenotypes, such as imaging-derived endophenotypes and proteomic expression-derived endophenotypes, have shown the great value in uncovering risk genes compared to case-control studies. Biologically, a co-varying pattern of different omics-derived endophenotypes could result from the shared genetic basis. However, existing methods mainly focus on the effect of endophenotypes alone; the effect of cross-endophenotype (CEP) associations remains largely unexploited. In this study, we used both endophenotypes and their CEP associations of multi-omic data to identify genetic risk factors, and proposed two integrated multi-task sparse canonical correlation analysis (inMTSCCA) methods, i.e., pairwise endophenotype correlation-guided MTSCCA (pcMTSCCA) and high-order endophenotype correlation-guided MTSCCA (hocMTSCCA). pcMTSCCA employed pairwise correlations between magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-derived, plasma-derived, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-derived endophenotypes as an additional penalty. hocMTSCCA used high-order correlations among these multi-omic data for regularization. To figure out genetic risk factors at individual and group levels, as well as altered endophenotypic markers, we introduced sparsity-inducing penalties for both models. We compared pcMTSCCA and hocMTSCCA with three related methods on both simulation and real (consisting of neuroimaging data, proteomic analytes, and genetic data) datasets. The results showed that our methods obtained better or comparable canonical correlation coefficients (CCCs) and better feature subsets than benchmarks. Most importantly, the identified genetic loci and heterogeneous endophenotypic markers showed high relevance. Therefore, jointly using multi-omic endophenotypes and their CEP associations is promising to reveal genetic risk factors.

Multi-omics analysis predicts fibronectin 1 as a prognostic biomarker in glioblastoma multiforme,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is one of the most malignant and intractable central nervous system tumors with high recurrence, low survival rate, and poor prognosis. Despite the advances of aggressive, multimodal treatment, a successful treatment strategy is still elusive, often leading to therapeutic resistance and fatality. Thus, it is imperative to search for and identify novel markers critically associated with GBM pathogenesis to improve the existing trend of diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. Seven publicly available GEO microarray datasets containing 409 GBM samples were integrated and further data mining was conducted using several bioinformatics tools. A total of 209 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in the GBM tissue samples compared to the normal brains. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of the DEGs revealed association of the upregulates genes with extracellular matrix (ECM), conceivably contributing to the invasive nature of GBM while downregulated DEGs were found to be predominantly related to neuronal processes and structures. Alongside, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Reactome pathway analyses described the involvement of the DEGs with various crucial contributing pathways (PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, p53 signaling pathway, insulin secretion, etc.) in GBM progression and pathogenesis. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network containing 879 nodes and 1237 edges revealed 3 significant modules and consecutive KEGG pathway analysis of these modules showed a significant connection to gliomagenesis. Later, 10 hub genes were screened out based on degree and their expressions were externally validated. Surprisingly, only fibronectin 1 (FN1) high expression appeared to be related to poor prognosis. Subsequently, 109 transcription factors and 211 miRNAs were detected to be involved with the hub genes where FN1 demonstrated the highest number of interactions. Considering its high connectivity and potential prognostic value FN1 could be a novel biomarker providing new insights into the prognosis and treatment for GBM, although experimental validation is required.",35513291,,10.1016/j.ygeno.2022.110378,5,Genomics,8800135,4.31
"Identification of Small Novel Coding Sequences, a Proteogenomics Endeavor","The identification of small proteins and peptides has consistently proven to be challenging. However, technological advances as well as multi-omics endeavors facilitate the identification of novel small coding sequences, leading to new insights. Specifically, the application of next generation sequencing technologies (NGS), providing accurate and sample specific transcriptome / translatome information, into the proteomics field led to more comprehensive results and new discoveries. This book chapter focuses on the inclusion of RNA-Seq and RIBO-Seq also known as ribosome profiling, an RNA-Seq based technique sequencing the +/- 30 bp long fragments captured by translating ribosomes. We emphasize the identification of micropeptides and neo-antigens, two distinct classes of small translation products, triggering our current understanding of biology. RNA-Seq is capable of capturing sample specific genomic variations, enabling focused neo-antigen identification. RIBO-Seq can identify translation events in small open reading frames which are considered to be non-coding, leading to the discovery of micropeptides. The identification of small translation products requires the integration of multi-omics data, stressing the importance of proteogenomics in this novel research area.",27686805,,10.1007/978-3-319-42316-6_4,8,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,121103,3.65
MRGCN: cancer subtyping with multi-reconstruction graph convolutional network using full and partial multi-omics dataset,"Motivation:Cancer is a molecular complex and heterogeneous disease. Each type of cancer is usually composed of several subtypes with different treatment responses and clinical outcomes. Therefore, subtyping is a crucial step in cancer diagnosis and therapy. The rapid advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies provide an increasing amount of multi-omics data, which benefits our understanding of cancer genetic architecture, and yet poses new challenges in multi-omics data integration.Results:We propose a graph convolutional network model, called MRGCN for multi-omics data integrative representation. MRGCN simultaneously encodes and reconstructs multiple omics expression and similarity relationships into a shared latent embedding space. In addition, MRGCN adopts an indicator matrix to denote the situation of missing values in partial omics, so that the full and partial multi-omics processing procedures are combined in a unified framework. Experimental results on 11 multi-omics datasets show that cancer subtypes obtained by MRGCN with superior enriched clinical parameters and log-rank test P-values in survival analysis over many typical integrative methods.Availability and implementation:https://github.com/Polytech-bioinf/MRGCN.git https://figshare.com/articles/software/MRGCN/23058503.",37255323,PMC10279523,10.1093/bioinformatics/btad353,3,"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",9808944,6.931
Multi-Omics Profiling of Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Reveals Altered Mechanisms in Mitochondrial Dynamics and Excitation-Contraction Coupling,"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is one of the most common inherited cardiomyopathies and a leading cause of sudden cardiac death in young adults. Despite profound insights into the genetics, there is imperfect correlation between mutation and clinical prognosis, suggesting complex molecular cascades driving pathogenesis. To investigate this, we performed an integrated quantitative multi-omics (proteomic, phosphoproteomic, and metabolomic) analysis to illuminate the early and direct consequences of mutations in myosin heavy chain in engineered human induced pluripotent stem-cell-derived cardiomyocytes relative to late-stage disease using patient myectomies. We captured hundreds of differential features, which map to distinct molecular mechanisms modulating mitochondrial homeostasis at the earliest stages of pathobiology, as well as stage-specific metabolic and excitation-coupling maladaptation. Collectively, this study fills in gaps from previous studies by expanding knowledge of the initial responses to mutations that protect cells against the early stress prior to contractile dysfunction and overt disease.",36902152,PMC10002553,10.3390/ijms24054724,1,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,6.208
Multi-omics analysis of immune-related microbiome and prognostic model in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,"Objectives:The aim of our study is to explore the transcriptional and microbial characteristics of head and neck cancer's immune phenotypes using a multi-omics approach.Materials and methods:Employing TCGA data, we analyzed head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) immune cells with CIBERSORT and identified differentially expressed genes using DESeq2. Microbial profiles, obtained from the TCMA database, were analyzed using LEfSe algorithm to identify differential microbes in immune cell infiltration (ICI) subgroups. Random Forest algorithm and deep neural network (DNN) were employed to select microbial features and developed a prognosis model.Results:We categorized HNSCC into three immune subtypes, finding ICI-2 with the worst prognosis and distinct microbial diversity. Our immune-related microbiome (IRM) model outperformed the TNM staging model in predicting survival, linking higher IRM model scores with poorer prognosis, and demonstrating clinical utility over TNM staging. Patients categorized as low-risk by the IRM model showed higher sensitivity to cisplatin and sorafenib treatments.Conclusions:This study offers a comprehensive exploration of the ICI landscape in HNSCC. We provide a detailed scenario of immune regulation in HNSCC and report a correlation between differing ICI patterns, intratumor microbiome, and prognosis. This research aids in identifying prime candidates for optimizing treatment strategies in HNSCC.Clinical relevance:This study revealed the microbial signatures associated with immunophenotyping of HNSCC and further found the microbial signatures associated with prognosis.

Convex Multi-View Clustering Via Robust Low Rank Approximation With Application to Multi-Omic Data,"Recent advances in high throughput technologies have made large amounts of biomedical omics data accessible to the scientific community. Single omic data clustering has proved its impact in the biomedical and biological research fields. Multi-omic data clustering and multi-omic data integration techniques have shown improved clustering performance and biological insight. Cancer subtype clustering is an important task in the medical field to be able to identify a suitable treatment procedure and prognosis for cancer patients. State of the art multi-view clustering methods are based on non-convex objectives which only guarantee non-global solutions that are high in computational complexity. Only a few convex multi-view methods are present. However, their models do not take into account the intrinsic manifold structure of the data. In this paper, we introduce a convex graph regularized multi-view clustering method that is robust to outliers. We compare our algorithm to state of the art convex and non-convex multi-view and single view clustering methods, and show its superiority in clustering cancer subtypes on publicly available cancer genomic datasets from the TCGA repository. We also show our method's better ability to potentially discover cancer subtypes compared to other state of the art multi-view methods.",34705655,,10.1109/TCBB.2021.3122961,0,IEEE/ACM transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics,101196755,3.702
Network diffusion-based approach for survival prediction and identification of biomarkers using multi-omics data of papillary renal cell carcinoma,"Identification of cancer subtypes based on molecular knowledge is crucial for improving the patient diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. In this work, we integrated copy number variations (CNVs) and transcriptomic data of Kidney Papillary Renal Cell Carcinoma (KIRP) using a network diffusion strategy to stratify cancers into clinically and biologically relevant subtypes. We constructed GeneNet, a KIRP specific gene expression network from RNA-seq data. The copy number variation data was projected onto GeneNet and propagated on the network for clustering. We identified robust subtypes that are biologically informative and significantly associated with patient survival, tumor stage and clinical subtypes of KIRP. We performed a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) analysis of KIRP subtypes, which revealed the genes/silent players related to poor survival. A differential gene expression analysis between subtypes showed that genes related to immune, extracellular matrix organization, and genomic instability are upregulated in the poor survival group. Overall, the network-based approach revealed the molecular subtypes of KIRP and captured the relationship between gene expression and CNVs. This framework can be further expanded to integrate other omics data.",37093328,,10.1007/s00438-023-02022-4,0,Molecular genetics and genomics : MGG,101093320,2.98
Metabolome subtyping reveals multi-omics characteristics and biological heterogeneity in major psychiatric disorders,"Growing evidence suggests that major psychiatric disorders (MPDs) share common etiologies and pathological processes. However, the diagnosis is currently based on descriptive symptoms, which ignores the underlying pathogenesis and hinders the development of clinical treatments. This highlights the urgency of characterizing molecular biomarkers and establishing objective diagnoses of MPDs. Here, we collected untargeted metabolomics, proteomics and DNA methylation data of 327 patients with MPDs, 131 individuals with genetic high risk and 146 healthy controls to explore the multi-omics characteristics of MPDs. First, differential metabolites (DMs) were identified and we classified MPD patients into 3 subtypes based on DMs. The subtypes showed distinct metabolomics, proteomics and DNA methylation signatures. Specifically, one subtype showed dysregulation of complement and coagulation proteins, while the DNA methylation showed abnormalities in chemical synapses and autophagy. Integrative analysis in metabolic pathways identified the important roles of the citrate cycle, sphingolipid metabolism and amino acid metabolism. Finally, we constructed prediction models based on the metabolites and proteomics that successfully captured the risks of MPD patients. Our study established molecular subtypes of MPDs and elucidated their biological heterogeneity through a multi-omics investigation. These results facilitate the understanding of pathological mechanisms and promote the diagnosis and prevention of MPDs.",38006718,,10.1016/j.psychres.2023.115605,0,Psychiatry research,7911385,11.225
An Emerging Approach of Age-Related Hearing Loss Research: Application of Integrated Multi-Omics Analysis,"As one of the most common otologic diseases in the elderly, age-related hearing loss (ARHL) usually characterized by hearing loss and cognitive disorders, which have a significant impact on the elderly's physical and mental health and quality of life. However, as a typical disease of aging, it is unclear why aging causes widespread hearing impairment in the elderly. As molecular biological experiments have been conducted for research recently, ARHL is gradually established at various levels with the application and development of integrated multi-omics analysis in the studies of ARHL. Here, the recent progress in the application of multi-omics analysis in the molecular mechanisms of ARHL development and therapeutic regimens, including the combined analysis of different omics, such as transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome, to screen for risk sites, risk genes, and differences in lipid metabolism, etc., is outlined and the integrated histological data further promote the profound understanding of the disease process as well as physiological mechanisms of ARHL. The advantages and disadvantages of multi-omics analysis in disease research are also discussed and the authors speculate on the future prospects and applications of this part-to-whole approach, which may provide more comprehensive guidance for ARHL and aging disease prevention and treatment.",38279573,,10.1002/adbi.202300613,0,Advanced biology,101775319,0.0
Attention-based GCN integrates multi-omics data for breast cancer subtype classification and patient-specific gene marker identification,"Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease and can be divided into several subtypes with unique prognostic and molecular characteristics. The classification of breast cancer subtypes plays an important role in the precision treatment and prognosis of breast cancer. Benefitting from the relation-aware ability of a graph convolution network (GCN), we present a multi-omics integrative method, the attention-based GCN (AGCN), for breast cancer molecular subtype classification using messenger RNA expression, copy number variation and deoxyribonucleic acid methylation multi-omics data. In the extensive comparative studies, our AGCN models outperform state-of-the-art methods under different experimental conditions and both attention mechanisms and the graph convolution subnetwork play an important role in accurate cancer subtype classification. The layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) algorithm is used for the interpretation of model decision, which can identify patient-specific important biomarkers that are reported to be related to the occurrence and development of breast cancer. Our results highlighted the effectiveness of the GCN and attention mechanisms in multi-omics integrative analysis and the implement of the LRP algorithm can provide biologically reasonable insights into model decision.",37114942,,10.1093/bfgp/elad013,1,Briefings in functional genomics,101528229,4.84
Identification of early and intermediate biomarkers for ARDS mortality by multi-omic approaches,"The lack of successful clinical trials in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has highlighted the unmet need for biomarkers predicting ARDS mortality and for novel therapeutics to reduce ARDS mortality. We utilized a systems biology multi-""omics"" approach to identify predictive biomarkers for ARDS mortality. Integrating analyses were designed to differentiate ARDS non-survivors and survivors (568 subjects, 27% overall 28-day mortality) using datasets derived from multiple 'omics' studies in a multi-institution ARDS cohort (54% European descent, 40% African descent). 'Omics' data was available for each subject and included genome-wide association studies (GWAS, n = 297), RNA sequencing (n = 93), DNA methylation data (n = 61), and selective proteomic network analysis (n = 240). Integration of available ""omic"" data identified a 9-gene set (TNPO1, NUP214, HDAC1, HNRNPA1, GATAD2A, FOSB, DDX17, PHF20, CREBBP) that differentiated ARDS survivors/non-survivors, results that were validated utilizing a longitudinal transcription dataset. Pathway analysis identified TP53-, HDAC1-, TGF-β-, and IL-6-signaling pathways to be associated with ARDS mortality. Predictive biomarker discovery identified transcription levels of the 9-gene set (AUC-0.83) and Day 7 angiopoietin 2 protein levels as potential candidate predictors of ARDS mortality (AUC-0.70). These results underscore the value of utilizing integrated ""multi-omics"" approaches in underpowered datasets from racially diverse ARDS subjects.",34556700,PMC8460799,10.1038/s41598-021-98053-1,4,Scientific reports,101563288,4.996
Multi-omics integration highlights the role of ubiquitination in endometriosis fibrosis,"Background:Endometriosis, characterized by the presence of active endometrial-like tissues outside the uterus, causes symptoms like dysmenorrhea and infertility due to the fibrosis of endometrial cells, which involves excessive deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. Ubiquitination, an important post-transcriptional modification, regulates various biological processes in human diseases. However, its role in the fibrosis process in endometriosis remains unclear.Methods:We employed multi-omics approaches on two cohorts of endometriosis patients with 39 samples. GO terms and KEGG pathways enrichment analyses were used to investigate the functional changes involved in endometriosis. Pearson's correlation coefficient analysis was conducted to explore the relationship between global proteome and ubiquitylome in endometriosis. The protein expression levels of ubiquitin-, fibrosis-related proteins, and E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase TRIM33 were validated via Western blot. Transfecting human endometrial stroma cells (hESCs) with TRIM33 small interfering RNA (siRNA) in vitro to explore how TRIM33 affects fibrosis-related proteins.Results:Integration of proteomics and transcriptomics showed genes with concurrent change of both mRNA and protein level which involved in ECM production in ectopic endometria. Ubiquitylomics distinguished 1647 and 1698 ubiquitinated lysine sites in the ectopic (EC) group compared to the normal (NC) and eutopic (EU) groups, respectively. Further multi-omics integration highlighted the essential role of ubiquitination in key fibrosis regulators in endometriosis. Correlation analysis between proteome and ubiquitylome showed correlation coefficients of 0.32 and 0.36 for ubiquitinated fibrosis proteins in EC/NC and EC/EU groups, respectively, indicating positive regulation of fibrosis-related protein expression by ubiquitination in ectopic lesions. We identified ubiquitination in 41 pivotal proteins within the fibrosis-related pathway of endometriosis. Finally, the elevated expression of TGFBR1/α-SMA/FAP/FN1/Collagen1 proteins in EC tissues were validated across independent samples. More importantly, we demonstrated that both the mRNA and protein levels of TRIM33 were reduced in endometriotic tissues. Knockdown of TRIM33 promoted TGFBR1/p-SMAD2/α-SMA/FN1 protein expressions in hESCs but did not significantly affect Collagen1/FAP levels, suggesting its inhibitory effect on fibrosis in vitro.Conclusions:This study, employing multi-omics approaches, provides novel insights into endometriosis ubiquitination profiles and reveals aberrant expression of the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM33 in endometriotic tissues, emphasizing their critical involvement in fibrosis pathogenesis and potential therapeutic targets.",38735939,PMC11089738,10.1186/s12967-024-05245-0,0,Journal of translational medicine,101190741,8.44
Identification of cancer risk groups through multi-omics integration using autoencoder and tensor analysis,"Identifying cancer risk groups by multi-omics has attracted researchers in their quest to find biomarkers from diverse risk-related omics. Stratifying the patients into cancer risk groups using genomics is essential for clinicians for pre-prevention treatment to improve the survival time for patients and identify the appropriate therapy strategies. This study proposes a multi-omics framework that can extract the features from various omics simultaneously. The framework employs autoencoders to learn the non-linear representation of the data and applies tensor analysis for feature learning. Further, the clustering method is used to stratify the patients into multiple cancer risk groups. Several omics were included in the experiments, namely methylation, somatic copy-number variation (SCNV), micro RNA (miRNA) and RNA sequencing (RNAseq) from two cancer types, including Glioma and Breast Invasive Carcinoma from the TCGA dataset. The results of this study are promising, as evidenced by the survival analysis and classification models, which outperformed the state-of-the-art.

Identification of a 6-gene signature for the survival prediction of breast cancer patients based on integrated multi-omics data analysis,"Purpose:To identify a gene signature for the prognosis of breast cancer using high-throughput analysis.Methods:RNASeq, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), copy number variation (CNV) data and clinical follow-up information were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and randomly divided into training set or verification set. Genes related to breast cancer prognosis and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with CNV or SNP were screened from training set, then integrated together for feature selection of identify robust biomarkers using RandomForest. Finally, a gene-related prognostic model was established and its performance was verified in TCGA test set, Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) validation set and breast cancer subtypes.Results:A total of 2287 prognosis-related genes, 131 genes with amplified copy numbers, 724 gens with copy number deletions, and 280 genes with significant mutations screened from Genomic Variants were closely correlated with the development of breast cancer. A total of 120 candidate genes were obtained by integrating genes from Genomic Variants and those related to prognosis, then 6 characteristic genes (CD24, PRRG1, IQSEC3, MRGPRX, RCC2, and CASP8) were top-ranked by RandomForest for feature selection, noticeably, several of these have been previously reported to be associated with the progression of breast cancer. Cox regression analysis was performed to establish a 6-gene signature, which can stratify the risk of samples from training set, test set and external validation set, moreover, the five-year survival AUC of the model in the training set and validation set was both higher than 0.65. Thus, the 6-gene signature developed in the current study could serve as an independent prognostic factor for breast cancer patients.Conclusion:This study constructed a 6-gene signature as a novel prognostic marker for predicting the survival of breast cancer patients, providing new diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for breast cancer patients.",33170908,PMC7654770,10.1371/journal.pone.0241924,4,PloS one,101285081,3.752

Multi-omics integration analysis unveils heterogeneity in breast cancer at the individual level,"Identifying robust breast cancer subtypes will help to reveal the cancer heterogeneity. However, previous breast cancer subtypes were based on population-level quantitative gene expression, which is affected by batch effects and cannot be applied to individuals. We detected differential gene expression, genomic, and epigenomic alterations to identify driver differential expression at the individual level. The individual driver differential expression reflected the breast cancer patients' heterogeneity and revealed four subtypes. Mesenchymal subtype as the most aggressive subtype harbored deletion and downregulated expression of genes in chromosome 11q23 region. Specifically, silencing of theSDHDgene in 11q23 promoted the invasion and migration of breast cancer cells in vitro by the epithelial-mesenchymal transition. The immunologically hot subtype displayed an immune-hot microenvironment, including high T-cell infiltration and upregulated PD-1 and CTLA4. Luminal and genomic-unstable subtypes showed opposite macrophage polarization, which may be regulated by the ligand-receptor pairs of CD99. The integration of multi-omics data at the individual level provides a powerful framework for elucidating the heterogeneity of breast cancer.",37974462,PMC10730166,10.1080/15384101.2023.2281816,0,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,5.173
COVID-19 and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: Biological insights from multi-omics data,"We explored the shared pathophysiological mechanisms between COVID-19 and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) by integrating multi-omics data. We studied common genetic risk factors and underlying biological processes using functional enrichment analysis. To understand the sex-specific pathways involved in the clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we processed sex-stratified data from COVID-19 genome-wide association datasets. We further explored the transcriptional signature of the liver cells in healthy and COVID-19 tissue specimens. We also integrated genetic and metabolomic information. We found that COVID-19 and NAFLD share biological disease mechanisms, including pathways that regulate the inflammatory and lipopolysaccharide response. Single-cell transcriptomics revealed enrichment of complement-related pathways in Kupffer cells, syndecan-mediated signalling in plasma cells, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in hepatic stellate cells.

Multi-omics approaches for biomarker discovery in predicting the response of esophageal cancer to neoadjuvant therapy: A multidimensional perspective,"Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NCRT) followed by surgery has been established as the standard treatment strategy for operable locally advanced esophageal cancer (EC). However, achieving pathologic complete response (pCR) or near pCR to NCRT is significantly associated with a considerable improvement in survival outcomes, while pCR patients may help organ preservation for patients by active surveillance to avoid planned surgery. Thus, there is an urgent need for improved biomarkers to predict EC chemoradiation response in research and clinical settings. Advances in multiple high-throughput technologies such as next-generation sequencing have facilitated the discovery of novel predictive biomarkers, specifically based on multi-omics data, including genomic/transcriptomic sequencings and proteomic/metabolomic mass spectra. The application of multi-omics data has shown the benefits in improving the understanding of underlying mechanisms of NCRT sensitivity/resistance in EC. Particularly, the prominent development of artificial intelligence (AI) has introduced a new direction in cancer research. The integration of multi-omics data has significantly advanced our knowledge of the disease and enabled the identification of valuable biomarkers for predicting treatment response from diverse dimension levels, especially with rapid advances in biotechnological and AI methodologies.

Subtype-DCC: decoupled contrastive clustering method for cancer subtype identification based on multi-omics data,"Due to the high heterogeneity and complexity of cancers, patients with different cancer subtypes often have distinct groups of genomic and clinical characteristics. Therefore, the discovery and identification of cancer subtypes are crucial to cancer diagnosis, prognosis and treatment. Recent technological advances have accelerated the increasing availability of multi-omics data for cancer subtyping. To take advantage of the complementary information from multi-omics data, it is necessary to develop computational models that can represent and integrate different layers of data into a single framework. Here, we propose a decoupled contrastive clustering method (Subtype-DCC) based on multi-omics data integration for clustering to identify cancer subtypes. The idea of contrastive learning is introduced into deep clustering based on deep neural networks to learn clustering-friendly representations. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed Subtype-DCC model in identifying cancer subtypes over the currently available state-of-the-art clustering methods. The strength of Subtype-DCC is also supported by the survival and clinical analysis.",36702755,,10.1093/bib/bbad025,6,Briefings in bioinformatics,100912837,13.994
Integrative multi-omic sequencing reveals the MMTV-Myc mouse model mimics human breast cancer heterogeneity,"Background:Breast cancer is a complex and heterogeneous disease with distinct subtypes and molecular profiles corresponding to different clinical outcomes. Mouse models of breast cancer are widely used, but their relevance in capturing the heterogeneity of human disease is unclear. Previous studies have shown the heterogeneity at the gene expression level for the MMTV-Myc model, but have only speculated on the underlying genetics.Methods:Tumors from the microacinar, squamous, and EMT histological subtypes of the MMTV-Myc mouse model of breast cancer underwent whole genome sequencing. The genomic data obtained were then integrated with previously obtained matched sample gene expression data and extended to additional samples of each histological subtype, totaling 42 gene expression samples. High correlation was observed between genetic copy number events and resulting gene expression by both Spearman's rank correlation coefficient and the Kendall rank correlation coefficient. These same genetic events are conserved in humans and are indicative of poor overall survival by Kaplan-Meier analysis. A supervised machine learning algorithm trained on METABRIC gene expression data was used to predict the analogous human breast cancer intrinsic subtype from mouse gene expression data.Results:Herein, we examine three common histological subtypes of the MMTV-Myc model through whole genome sequencing and have integrated these results with gene expression data. Significantly, key genomic alterations driving cell signaling pathways were well conserved within histological subtypes. Genomic changes included frequent, co-occurring mutations in KIT and RARA in the microacinar histological subtype as well as SCRIB mutations in the EMT subtype. EMT tumors additionally displayed strong KRAS activation signatures downstream of genetic activating events primarily ascribed to KRAS activating mutations, but also FGFR2 amplification. Analogous genetic events in human breast cancer showed stark decreases in overall survival. In further analyzing transcriptional heterogeneity of the MMTV-Myc model, we report a supervised machine learning model that classifies MMTV-Myc histological subtypes and other mouse models as being representative of different human intrinsic breast cancer subtypes.Conclusions:We conclude the well-established MMTV-Myc mouse model presents further opportunities for investigation of human breast cancer heterogeneity.",37805590,PMC10559619,10.1186/s13058-023-01723-3,0,Breast cancer research : BCR,100927353,8.408
Multi-omics analysis of N6-methyladenosine reader IGF2BP3 as a promising biomarker in pan-cancer,"Background:Insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 3 (IGF2BP3) has been reported to exhibit an oncogenic effect as an RNA-binding protein (RBP) by promoting tumor cell proliferation, migration and invasion in several tumor types. However, a pan-cancer analysis of IGF2BP3 is not currently available, and the exact roles of IGF2BP3 in prognosis and immunology in cancer patients remain enigmatic. The main aim of this study was to provide visualization of the systemic prognostic landscape of IGF2BP3 in pan-cancer and to uncover the potential relationship between IGF2BP3 expression in the tumor microenvironment and immune infiltration profile.Methods:Raw data on IGF2BP3 expression were obtained from GTEx, CCLE, TCGA, and HPA data portals. We have investigated the expression patterns, diagnostic and prognostic significance, mutation landscapes, functional analysis, and functional states of IGF2BP3 utilizing multiple databases, including HPA, TISIDB, cBioPortal, GeneMANIA, GESA, and CancerSEA. Moreover, the relationship of IGF2BP3 expression with immune infiltrates, TMB, MSI and immune-related genes was evaluated in pan-cancer. IGF2BP3 with drug sensitivity analysis was performed from the CellMiner database. Furthermore, the expression of IGF2BP3 in different grades of glioma was detected by immunohistochemical staining and western blot.Results:We found that IGF2BP3 was ubiquitously highly expressed in pan-cancer and significantly correlated with diagnosis, prognosis, TMB, MSI, and drug sensitivity in various types of cancer. Besides, IGF2BP3 was involved in many cancer pathways and varied in different immune and molecular subtypes of cancers. Additionally, IGF2BP3 is critically associated with genetic markers of immunomodulators in various cancers. Finally, we validated that IGF2BP3 protein expression was significantly higher in glioma than in normal tissue, especially in GBM.Conclusions:IGF2BP3 may be a potential molecular biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis in pan-cancer, especially for glioma. It could become a novel therapeutic target for various cancers.",36761737,PMC9905439,10.3389/fimmu.2023.1071675,2,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,8.786
"Identification of the role of MCM6 in bladder cancer prognosis, immunotherapy response, and in vitro experimental investigation using multi-omics analysis","Background:The tumor-promoting effects of MCM6 in numerous tumors have been widely revealed, yet its specific role in bladder cancer (BLCA) is still elusive. The objective of this research was to explore the underlying impact of MCM6 on BLCA.Methods:Integrating transcriptomic and proteomic data, MCM6 was identified to be strongly correlated with BLCA through weighted gene co-expression network analysis(WGCNA) and venn analyses. Then, the clinical value of MCM6 was validated with public database data. The different molecular/immune characteristics and the benefit of immunotherapy were also found in MCM6-defined subgroups. Additionally, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data was choose for quantify MCM6 expression in the distinct BLCA cell types. The biological role of MCM6 were evaluated via in vitro functional experiments.Results:It was testified that the MCM6 could distinguish patients outcome in TCGA and GEO cohorts. Moreover, compared with the MCM6 low-expression group, the MCM6 high-expression group was related to more tumor-promoting related pathways, aggressive phenotypes, and benefit from immunotherapy. Analysis of scRNA-seq data resulted in MCM6 was mainly expressed in BLCA epithelial cells and the proportion of MCM6-expressing tumor epithelial cells is higher than the normal epithelial cells. Moreover, vitro experiments demonstrated that MCM6 knockdown repressed proliferation, cell cycle, migration, and invasion of BLCA cells.Conclusion:This research indicated MCM6 is a promising marker for both prognosis and immunotherapy benefit and could promote the cells proliferation, invasion and migration in BLCA.",37951536,,10.1016/j.lfs.2023.122253,1,Life sciences,375521,6.78
An automated workflow for multi-omics screening of microbial model organisms,"Multi-omics datasets are becoming of key importance to drive discovery in fundamental research as much as generating knowledge for applied biotechnology. However, the construction of such large datasets is usually time-consuming and expensive. Automation might enable to overcome these issues by streamlining workflows from sample generation to data analysis. Here, we describe the construction of a complex workflow for the generation of high-throughput microbial multi-omics datasets. The workflow comprises a custom-built platform for automated cultivation and sampling of microbes, sample preparation protocols, analytical methods for sample analysis and automated scripts for raw data processing.

Multi-Omics Analysis Reveals the IFI6 Gene as a Prognostic Indicator and Therapeutic Target in Esophageal Cancer,"The role of the IFI6 gene has been described in several cancers, but its involvement in esophageal cancer (ESCA) remains unclear. This study aimed to identify novel prognostic indicators for ESCA-targeted therapy by investigating IFI6's expression, epigenetic mechanisms, and signaling activities. We utilized public data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to analyze IFI6's expression, clinical characteristics, gene function, pathways, and correlation with different immune cells in ESCA. The TIMER2.0 database was employed to assess the pan-cancer expression of IFI6, while UALCAN was used to examine its expression across tumor stages and histology subtypes. Additionally, the KEGG database helped identify related pathways. Our findings revealed 95 genes positively correlated and 15 genes negatively correlated with IFI6 in ESCA. IFI6 was over-expressed in ESCA and other cancers, impacting patient survival and showing higher expression in tumor tissues than normal tissues. IFI6 was also correlated with CD4+ T cells and B cell receptors (BCRs), both essential in immune response. GO Biological Process (GO BP) enrichment analysis indicated that IFI6 was primarily associated with the Type I interferon signaling pathway and the defense response to viruses. Intriguingly, KEGG pathway analysis demonstrated that IFI6 and its positively correlated genes in ESCA were mostly linked to the Cytosolic DNA-sensing pathway, which plays a crucial role in innate immunity and viral defense, and the RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) signaling pathway, which detects viral infections and activates immune responses. Pathways related to various viral infections were also identified. It is important to note that our study relied on online databases. Given that ESCA consists of two distinct subgroups (ESCC and EAC), most databases combine them into a single category. Future research should focus on evaluating IFI6 expression and its impact on each subgroup to gain more specific insights. In conclusion, inhibiting IFI6 using targeted therapy could be an effective strategy for treating ESCA considering its potential as a biomarker and correlation with immune cell factors.",38473938,PMC10931552,10.3390/ijms25052691,0,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,6.208
Integrative multi-omics approach for identifying molecular signatures and pathways and deriving and validating molecular scores for COVID-19 severity and status,"Background:There is still more to learn about the pathobiology of COVID-19. A multi-omic approach offers a holistic view to better understand the mechanisms of COVID-19. We used state-of-the-art statistical learning methods to integrate genomics, metabolomics, proteomics, and lipidomics data obtained from 123 patients experiencing COVID-19 or COVID-19-like symptoms for the purpose of identifying molecular signatures and corresponding pathways associated with the disease.Results:We constructed and validated molecular scores and evaluated their utility beyond clinical factors known to impact disease status and severity. We identified inflammation- and immune response-related pathways, and other pathways, providing insights into possible consequences of the disease.Conclusions:The molecular scores we derived were strongly associated with disease status and severity and can be used to identify individuals at a higher risk for developing severe disease. These findings have the potential to provide further, and needed, insights into why certain individuals develop worse outcomes.",37308820,PMC10259816,10.1186/s12864-023-09410-5,2,BMC genomics,100965258,4.547
Recursive integration of synergised graph representations of multi-omics data for cancer subtypes identification,"Cancer subtypes identification is one of the critical steps toward advancing personalized anti-cancerous therapies. Accumulation of a massive amount of multi-platform omics data measured across the same set of samples provides an opportunity to look into this deadly disease from several views simultaneously. Few integrative clustering approaches are developed to capture shared information from all the views to identify cancer subtypes. However, they have certain limitations. The challenge here is identifying the most relevant feature space from each omic view and systematically integrating them. Both the steps should lead toward a global clustering solution with biological significance. In this respect, a novel multi-omics clustering algorithm named RISynG (Recursive Integration of Synergised Graph-representations) is presented in this study. RISynG represents each omic view as two representation matrices that are Gramian and Laplacian. A parameterised combination function is defined to obtain a synergy matrix from these representation matrices. Then a recursive multi-kernel approach is applied to integrate the most relevant, shared, and complementary information captured via the respective synergy matrices. At last, clustering is applied to the integrated subspace. RISynG is benchmarked on five multi-omics cancer datasets taken from The Cancer Genome Atlas. The experimental results demonstrate RISynG's efficiency over the other approaches in this domain.",36115864,PMC9482647,10.1038/s41598-022-17585-2,1,Scientific reports,101563288,4.996
Mergeomics 2.0: a web server for multi-omics data integration to elucidate disease networks and predict therapeutics,"The Mergeomics web server is a flexible online tool for multi-omics data integration to derive biological pathways, networks, and key drivers important to disease pathogenesis and is based on the open source Mergeomics R package. The web server takes summary statistics of multi-omics disease association studies (GWAS, EWAS, TWAS, PWAS, etc.) as input and features four functions: Marker Dependency Filtering (MDF) to correct for known dependency between omics markers, Marker Set Enrichment Analysis (MSEA) to detect disease relevant biological processes, Meta-MSEA to examine the consistency of biological processes informed by various omics datasets, and Key Driver Analysis (KDA) to identify essential regulators of disease-associated pathways and networks.

BioSTD: A New Tensor Multi-View Framework via Combining Tensor Decomposition and Strong Complementarity Constraint for Analyzing Cancer Omics Data,"Advances in omics technology have enriched the understanding of the biological mechanisms of diseases, which has provided a new approach for cancer research. Multi-omics data contain different levels of cancer information, and comprehensive analysis of them has attracted wide attention. However, limited by the dimensionality of matrix models, traditional methods cannot fully use the key high-dimensional global structure of multi-omics data. Moreover, besides global information, local features within each omics are also critical. It is necessary to consider the potential local information together with the high-dimensional global information, ensuring that the shared and complementary features of the omics data are comprehensively observed. In view of the above, this article proposes a new tensor integrative framework called the strong complementarity tensor decomposition model (BioSTD) for cancer multi-omics data. It is used to identify cancer subtype specific genes and cluster subtype samples. Different from the matrix framework, BioSTD utilizes multi-view tensors to coordinate each omics to maximize high-dimensional spatial relationships, which jointly considers the different characteristics of different omics data. Meanwhile, we propose the concept of strong complementarity constraint applicable to omics data and introduce it into BioSTD. Strong complementarity is used to explore the potential local information, which can enhance the separability of different subtypes, allowing consistency and complementarity in the omics data to be fully represented. Experimental results on real cancer datasets show that our model outperforms other advanced models, which confirms its validity.",37498764,,10.1109/JBHI.2023.3299274,0,IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics,101604520,7.021
Information-incorporated sparse convex clustering for disease subtyping,"Motivation:Heterogeneity in human diseases presents clinical challenges in accurate disease characterization and treatment. Recently available high throughput multi-omics data may offer a great opportunity to explore the underlying mechanisms of diseases and improve disease heterogeneity assessment throughout the treatment course. In addition, increasingly accumulated data from existing literature may be informative about disease subtyping. However, the existing clustering procedures, such as Sparse Convex Clustering (SCC), cannot directly utilize the prior information even though SCC produces stable clusters.Results:We develop a clustering procedure, information-incorporated Sparse Convex Clustering, to respond to the need for disease subtyping in precision medicine. Utilizing the text mining approach, the proposed method leverages the existing information from previously published studies through a group lasso penalty to improve disease subtyping and biomarker identification. The proposed method allows taking heterogeneous information, such as multi-omics data. We conduct simulation studies under several scenarios with various accuracy of the prior information to evaluate the performance of our method. The proposed method outperforms other clustering methods, such as SCC, K-means, Sparse K-means, iCluster+, and Bayesian Consensus Clustering. In addition, the proposed method generates more accurate disease subtypes and identifies important biomarkers for future studies in real data analysis of breast and lung cancer-related omics data.

Deep learning assisted multi-omics integration for survival and drug-response prediction in breast cancer,"Background:Survival and drug response are two highly emphasized clinical outcomes in cancer research that directs the prognosis of a cancer patient. Here, we have proposed a late multi omics integrative framework that robustly quantifies survival and drug response for breast cancer patients with a focus on the relative predictive ability of available omics datatypes. Neighborhood component analysis (NCA), a supervised feature selection algorithm selected relevant features from multi-omics datasets retrieved from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) databases. A Neural network framework, fed with NCA selected features, was used to develop survival and drug response prediction models for breast cancer patients. The drug response framework used regression and unsupervised clustering (K-means) to segregate samples into responders and non-responders based on their predicted IC50 values (Z-score).Results:The survival prediction framework was highly effective in categorizing patients into risk subtypes with an accuracy of 94%. Compared to single-omics and early integration approaches, our drug response prediction models performed significantly better and were able to predict IC50 values (Z-score) with a mean square error (MSE) of 1.154 and an overall regression value of 0.92, showing a linear relationship between predicted and actual IC50 values.Conclusion:The proposed omics integration strategy provides an effective way of extracting critical information from diverse omics data types enabling estimation of prognostic indicators. Such integrative models with high predictive power would have a significant impact and utility in precision oncology.",33761889,PMC7992339,10.1186/s12864-021-07524-2,30,BMC genomics,100965258,4.547

'Omics' data appropriately integrated with genome-scale reconstructions and modelling facilitates our understanding of how individual components interact and influence overall cell, tissue or organisms function.

"The Practical Haplotype Graph, a platform for storing and using pangenomes for imputation","Motivation:Pangenomes provide novel insights for population and quantitative genetics, genomics and breeding not available from studying a single reference genome. Instead, a species is better represented by a pangenome or collection of genomes. Unfortunately, managing and using pangenomes for genomically diverse species is computationally and practically challenging. We developed a trellis graph representation anchored to the reference genome that represents most pangenomes well and can be used to impute complete genomes from low density sequence or variant data.Results:The Practical Haplotype Graph (PHG) is a pangenome pipeline, database (PostGRES & SQLite), data model (Java, Kotlin or R) and Breeding API (BrAPI) web service. The PHG has already been able to accurately represent diversity in four major crops including maize, one of the most genomically diverse species, with up to 1000-fold data compression. Using simulated data, we show that, at even 0.1× coverage, with appropriate reads and sequence alignment, imputation results in extremely accurate haplotype reconstruction. The PHG is a platform and environment for the understanding and application of genomic diversity.Availability and implementation:All resources listed here are freely available.

A Multiview Clustering Method With Low-Rank and Sparsity Constraints for Cancer Subtyping,"Multiomics data clustering is one of the major challenges in the field of precision medicine. Integration of multiomics data for cancer subtyping can improve the understanding on cancer and reveal systems-level insights. How to integrate multiomics data for accurate cancer subtyping is an interesting and challenging research problem. To capture the global and the local structure of omics data, a novel framework for integrating multiomics data is proposed for cancer subtyping. Multiview clustering with low-rank and sparsity constraints (MVCLRS) can measure the local similarities of samples in each omics data and obtain global consensus structures by integrating the multiomics data. The main insight provided by MVCLRS is that low-rank sparse subspace clustering for the construction of an affinity matrix can best capture the local similarities in omics data. Extensive testing is conducted on 10 real world cancer datasets with multiomics from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Compared with 10 state-of-the-art multiomics clustering algorithms, the MVCLRS performs better in the 10 cancer datasets by providing its clustering results with at least one enriched clinical label in nine of ten cancer subtypes, the most of any method.",34705654,,10.1109/TCBB.2021.3122917,1,IEEE/ACM transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics,101196755,3.702
Two-step multi-omics modelling of drug sensitivity in cancer cell lines to identify driving mechanisms,"Drug sensitivity prediction models for human cancer cell lines constitute important tools in identifying potential computational biomarkers for responsiveness in a pre-clinical setting. Integrating information derived from a range of heterogeneous data is crucial, but remains non-trivial, as differences in data structures may hinder fitting algorithms from assigning adequate weights to complementary information that is contained in distinct omics data. In order to counteract this effect that tends to lead to just one data type dominating supposedly multi-omics models, we developed a novel tool that enables users to train single-omics models separately in a first step and to integrate them into a multi-omics model in a second step. Extensive ablation studies are performed in order to facilitate an in-depth evaluation of the respective contributions of singular data types and of combinations thereof, effectively identifying redundancies and interdependencies between them. Moreover, the integration of the single-omics models is realized by a range of distinct classification algorithms, thus allowing for a performance comparison. Sets of molecular events and tissue types found to be related to significant shifts in drug sensitivity are returned to facilitate a comprehensive and straightforward analysis of potential computational biomarkers for drug responsiveness. Our two-step approach yields sets of actual multi-omics pan-cancer classification models that are highly predictive for a majority of drugs in the GDSC data base. In the context of targeted drugs with particular modes of action, its predictive performances compare favourably to those of classification models that incorporate multi-omics data in a simple one-step approach. Additionally, case studies demonstrate that it succeeds both in correctly identifying known key biomarkers for sensitivity towards specific drug compounds as well as in providing sets of potential candidates for additional computational biomarkers.",33226984,PMC7682852,10.1371/journal.pone.0238961,3,PloS one,101285081,3.752

"Multi-omics panoramic analysis of HBV integration, transcriptional regulation, and epigenetic modifications in PLC/PRF/5 cell line","The clearance or transcriptional silencing of integrated HBV DNA is crucial for achieving a functional cure in patients with chronic hepatitis B and reducing the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma development. The PLC/PRF/5 cell line is commonly used as an in vitro model for studying HBV integration. In this study, we employed a range of multi-omics techniques to gain a panoramic understanding of the characteristics of HBV integration in PLC/PRF/5 cells and to reveal the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms of integrated HBV DNA. Transcriptome long-read sequencing (ONT) was conducted to analyze and characterize the transcriptional activity of different HBV DNA integration sites in PLC/PRF/5 cells. Additionally, we collected data related to epigenetic regulation, including whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS), histone chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq), and assays for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq), to explore the potential mechanisms involved in the transcriptional regulation of integrated HBV DNA. Long-read RNA sequencing analysis revealed significant transcriptional differences at various integration sites in the PLC/PRF/5 cell line, with higher HBV DNA transcription levels at integration sites on chr11, chr13, and the chr13/chr5 fusion chromosome t (13:5). Combining long-read DNA and RNA sequencing results, we found that transcription of integrated HBV DNA generally starts downstream of the SP1, SP2, or XP promoters. ATAC-seq data confirmed that chromatin accessibility has limited influence on the transcription of integrated HBV DNA in the PLC/PRF/5 cell line. Analysis of WGBS data showed that the methylation intensity of integrated HBV DNA was highly negatively correlated with its transcription level (r = -0.8929, p = 0.0123). After AzaD treatment, the transcription level of integrated HBV DNA significantly increased, especially for the integration chr17, which had the highest level of methylation. Through ChIP-seq data, we observed the association between histone modification of H3K4me3 and H3K9me3 with the transcription of integrated HBV DNA. Our findings suggest that the SP1, SP2 and XP in integrated HBV DNA, methylation level of surrounding host chromosome, and histone modifications affect the transcription of integrated HBV DNA in PLC/PRF/5 cells. This provides important clues for future studies on the expression and regulatory mechanisms of integrated HBV.",38647071,,10.1002/jmv.29614,0,Journal of medical virology,7705876,20.693

Proteogenomic Tools and Approaches to Explore Protein Coding Landscapes of Eukaryotic Genomes,"Proteogenomic strategies aim to refine genome-wide annotations of protein coding features by using actual protein level observations. Most of the currently applied proteogenomic approaches include integrative analysis of multiple types of high-throughput omics data, e.g., genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, etc. Recent efforts towards creating a human proteome map were primarily targeted to experimentally detect at least one protein product for each gene in the genome and extensively utilized proteogenomic approaches. The 14 year long wait to get a draft human proteome map, after completion of similar efforts to sequence the genome, explains the huge complexity and technical hurdles of such efforts. Further, the integrative analysis of large-scale multi-omics datasets inherent to these studies becomes a major bottleneck to their success. However, recent developments of various analysis tools and pipelines dedicated to proteogenomics reduce both the time and complexity of such analysis.

Identification of prognostic coagulation-related signatures in clear cell renal cell carcinoma through integrated multi-omics analysis and machine learning,"Clear cell renal cell carcinoma is a threat to public health with high morbidity and mortality. Clinical evidence has shown that cancer-associated thrombosis poses significant challenges to treatments, including drug resistance and difficulties in surgical decision-making in ccRCC. However, the coagulation pathway, one of the core mechanisms of cancer-associated thrombosis, recently found closely related to the tumor microenvironment and immune-related pathway, is rarely researched in ccRCC. Therefore, we integrated bulk RNA-seq data, DNA mutation and methylation data, single-cell data, and proteomic data to perform a comprehensive analysis of coagulation-related genes in ccRCC. First, we demonstrated the importance of the coagulation-related gene set by consensus clustering. Based on machine learning, we identified 5 coagulation signature genes and verified their clinical value in TCGA, ICGC, and E-MTAB-1980 databases. It's also demonstrated that the specific expression patterns of coagulation signature genes driven by CNV and methylation were closely correlated with pathways including apoptosis, immune infiltration, angiogenesis, and the construction of extracellular matrix. Moreover, we identified two types of tumor cells in single-cell data by machine learning, and the coagulation signature genes were differentially expressed in two types of tumor cells.

Deciphering the genetic architecture of human brain structure and function: a brief survey on recent advances of neuroimaging genomics,"Brain imaging genomics is an emerging interdisciplinary field, where integrated analysis of multimodal medical image-derived phenotypes (IDPs) and multi-omics data, bridging the gap between macroscopic brain phenotypes and their cellular and molecular characteristics. This approach aims to better interpret the genetic architecture and molecular mechanisms associated with brain structure, function and clinical outcomes. More recently, the availability of large-scale imaging and multi-omics datasets from the human brain has afforded the opportunity to the discovering of common genetic variants contributing to the structural and functional IDPs of the human brain. By integrative analyses with functional multi-omics data from the human brain, a set of critical genes, functional genomic regions and neuronal cell types have been identified as significantly associated with brain IDPs. Here, we review the recent advances in the methods and applications of multi-omics integration in brain imaging analysis. We highlight the importance of functional genomic datasets in understanding the biological functions of the identified genes and cell types that are associated with brain IDPs. Moreover, we summarize well-known neuroimaging genetics datasets and discuss challenges and future directions in this field.",36847697,,10.1093/bib/bbad060,0,Briefings in bioinformatics,100912837,13.994
Knowledge Base Commons (KBCommons) v1.1: a universal framework for multi-omics data integration and biological discoveries,"Background:Knowledge Base Commons (KBCommons) v1.1 is a universal and all-inclusive web-based framework providing generic functionalities for storing, sharing, analyzing, exploring, integrating and visualizing multiple organisms' genomics and integrative omics data. KBCommons is designed and developed to integrate diverse multi-level omics data and to support biological discoveries for all species via a common platform.Methods:KBCommons has four modules including data storage, data processing, data accessing, and web interface for data management and retrieval.

Assessment of local and systemic signature of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) in children through multi-omics approaches,"Background:Eosinophilic oesophagitis (EoE) is a chronic food allergic disorder limited to oesophageal mucosa whose pathogenesis is still only partially understood. Moreover, its diagnosis and follow-up need repeated endoscopies due to absence of non-invasive validated biomarkers. In the present study, we aimed to deeply describe local immunological and molecular components of EoE in well-phenotyped children, and to identify potential circulating EoE-biomarkers.Methods:Blood and oesophageal biopsies were collected simultaneously from French children with EoE (n=17) and from control subjects (n=15). Untargeted transcriptomics analysis was performed on mRNA extracted from biopsies using microarrays. In parallel, we performed a comprehensive analysis of immune components on both cellular and soluble extracts obtained from both biopsies and blood, using flow cytometry. Finally, we performed non-targeted plasma metabolomics using liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS). Uni/multivariate supervised and non-supervised statistical analyses were then conducted to identify significant and discriminant components associated with EoE within local and/or systemic transcriptomics, immunologic and metabolomics datasets. As a proof of concept, we conducted multi-omics data integration to identify a plasmatic signature of EoE.Results:French children with EoE shared the same transcriptomic signature as US patients. Network visualization of differentially expressed (DE) genes highlighted the major dysregulation of innate and adaptive immune processes, but also of pathways involved in epithelial cells and barrier functions, and in perception of chemical stimuli. Immune analysis of biopsies highlighted EoE is associated with dysregulation of both type (T) 1, T2 and T3 innate and adaptive immunity, in a highly inflammatory milieu. Although an immune signature of EoE was found in blood, untargeted metabolomics more efficiently discriminated children with EoE from control subjects, with dysregulation of vitamin B6 and various amino acids metabolisms. Multi-blocks integration suggested that an EoE plasma signature may be identified by combining metabolomics and cytokines datasets.Conclusions:Our study strengthens the evidence that EoE results from alterations of the oesophageal epithelium associated with altered immune responses far beyond a simplistic T2 dysregulation. As a proof of concept, combining metabolomics and cytokines data may provide a set of potential plasma biomarkers for EoE diagnosis, which needs to be confirmed on a larger and independent cohort.",37006253,PMC10050742,10.3389/fimmu.2023.1108895,4,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,8.786
Molecular mechanisms reconstruction from single-cell multi-omics data with HuMMuS,"Motivation:The molecular identity of a cell results from a complex interplay between heterogeneous molecular layers. Recent advances in single-cell sequencing technologies have opened the possibility to measure such molecular layers of regulation.Results:Here, we present HuMMuS, a new method for inferring regulatory mechanisms from single-cell multi-omics data. Differently from the state-of-the-art, HuMMuS captures cooperation between biological macromolecules and can easily include additional layers of molecular regulation. We benchmarked HuMMuS with respect to the state-of-the-art on both paired and unpaired multi-omics datasets. Our results proved the improvements provided by HuMMuS in terms of transcription factor (TF) targets, TF binding motifs and regulatory regions prediction. Finally, once applied to snmC-seq, scATAC-seq and scRNA-seq data from mouse brain cortex, HuMMuS enabled to accurately cluster scRNA profiles and to identify potential driver TFs.Availability and implementation:HuMMuS is available at https://github.com/cantinilab/HuMMuS.",38460192,PMC11065476,10.1093/bioinformatics/btae143,0,"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",9808944,6.931
"Multi-omics analysis reveals genomic, clinical and immunological features of SARS-CoV-2 virus target genes in pan-cancer","The SARS-CoV-2 virus, also known as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, has raised great threats to humans. The connection between the SARS-CoV-2 virus and cancer is currently unclear. In this study, we thus evaluated the multi-omics data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database utilizing genomic and transcriptomic techniques to fully identify the SARS-CoV-2 target genes (STGs) in tumor samples from 33 types of cancers. The expression of STGs was substantially linked with the immune infiltration and may be used to predict survival in cancer patients. STGs were also substantially associated with immunological infiltration, immune cells, and associated immune pathways. At the molecular level, the genomic changes of STGs were frequently related with carcinogenesis and patient survival. In addition, pathway analysis revealed that STGs were involved in the control of signaling pathways associated with cancer. The prognostic features and nomogram of clinical factors of STGs in cancers have been developed. Lastly, by mining the cancer drug sensitivity genomics database, a list of potential STG-targeting medicines was compiled. Collectively, this work demonstrated comprehensively the genomic alterations and clinical characteristics of STGs, which may offer new clues to explore the mechanisms on a molecular level between SARS-CoV-2 virus and cancers as well as provide new clinical guidance for cancer patients who are threatened by the COVID-19 epidemic.",36875081,PMC9982007,10.3389/fimmu.2023.1112704,2,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,8.786
An integrated Bayesian framework for multi-omics prediction and classification,"With the growing commonality of multi-omics datasets, there is now increasing evidence that integrated omics profiles lead to more efficient discovery of clinically actionable biomarkers that enable better disease outcome prediction and patient stratification. Several methods exist to perform host phenotype prediction from cross-sectional, single-omics data modalities but decentralized frameworks that jointly analyze multiple time-dependent omics data to highlight the integrative and dynamic impact of repeatedly measured biomarkers are currently limited. In this article, we propose a novel Bayesian ensemble method to consolidate prediction by combining information across several longitudinal and cross-sectional omics data layers. Unlike existing frequentist paradigms, our approach enables uncertainty quantification in prediction as well as interval estimation for a variety of quantities of interest based on posterior summaries. We apply our method to four published multi-omics datasets and demonstrate that it recapitulates known biology in addition to providing novel insights while also outperforming existing methods in estimation, prediction, and uncertainty quantification.

DriverDBv4: a multi-omics integration database for cancer driver gene research,"Advancements in high-throughput technology offer researchers an extensive range of multi-omics data that provide deep insights into the complex landscape of cancer biology. However, traditional statistical models and databases are inadequate to interpret these high-dimensional data within a multi-omics framework. To address this limitation, we introduce DriverDBv4, an updated iteration of the DriverDB cancer driver gene database (http://driverdb.bioinfomics.org/). This updated version offers several significant enhancements: (i) an increase in the number of cohorts from 33 to 70, encompassing approximately 24 000 samples; (ii) inclusion of proteomics data, augmenting the existing types of omics data and thus expanding the analytical scope; (iii) implementation of multiple multi-omics algorithms for identification of cancer drivers; (iv) new visualization features designed to succinctly summarize high-context data and redesigned existing sections to accommodate the increased volume of datasets and (v) two new functions in Customized Analysis, specifically designed for multi-omics driver identification and subgroup expression analysis. DriverDBv4 facilitates comprehensive interpretation of multi-omics data across diverse cancer types, thereby enriching the understanding of cancer heterogeneity and aiding in the development of personalized clinical approaches. The database is designed to foster a more nuanced understanding of the multi-faceted nature of cancer.",37956338,PMC10767848,10.1093/nar/gkad1060,0,Nucleic acids research,411011,19.16
A comparative study of multi-omics integration tools for cancer driver gene identification and tumour subtyping,"Oncogenesis and cancer can arise as a consequence of a wide range of genomic aberrations including mutations, copy number alterations, expression changes and epigenetic modifications encompassing multiple omics layers. Integrating genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic and epigenomic datasets via multi-omics analysis provides the opportunity to derive a deeper and holistic understanding of the development and progression of cancer. There are two primary approaches to integrating multi-omics data: multi-staged (focused on identifying genes driving cancer) and meta-dimensional (focused on establishing clinically relevant tumour or sample classifications). A number of ready-to-use bioinformatics tools are available to perform both multi-staged and meta-dimensional integration of multi-omics data. In this study, we compared nine different integration tools using real and simulated cancer datasets. The performance of the multi-staged integration tools were assessed at the gene, function and pathway levels, while meta-dimensional integration tools were assessed based on the sample classification performance. Additionally, we discuss the influence of factors such as data representation, sample size, signal and noise on multi-omics data integration. Our results provide current and much needed guidance regarding selection and use of the most appropriate and best performing multi-omics integration tools.",31774481,PMC7711266,10.1093/bib/bbz121,28,Briefings in bioinformatics,100912837,13.994
Development of a multi-omics extraction method for ecotoxicology: investigation of the reproductive cycle of Gammarus fossarum,"Omics study exemplified by proteomics, lipidomics or metabolomics, provides the opportunity to get insight of the molecular modifications occurring in living organisms in response to contaminants or in different physiological conditions. However, individual omics discloses only a single layer of information leading to a partial image of the biological complexity. Multiplication of samples preparation and processing can generate analytical variations resulting from several extractions and instrumental runs. To get all the -omics information at the proteins, metabolites and lipids level coming from a unique sample, a specific sample preparation must be optimized. In this study, we streamlined a biphasic extraction procedure based on a MTBE/Methanol mixture to provide the simultaneous extraction of polar (proteins, metabolites) and apolar compounds (lipids) for multi-omics analyses from a unique biological sample by a liquid chromatography (LC)/mass spectrometry (MS)/MS-based targeted approach. We applied the methodology for the study of female amphipod Gammarus fossarum during the reproductive cycle. Multivariate data analyses including Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis and multiple factor analysis were applied for the integration of the multi-omics data sets and highlighted molecular signatures, specific to the different stages.",36113334,,10.1016/j.talanta.2022.123806,1,Talanta,2984816R,0.0
Similarity Fusion via Exploiting High Order Proximity for Cancer Subtyping,"Identifying cancer subtypes holds essential promise for improving prognosis and personalized treatment. Cancer subtyping based on multi-omics data has become a hotspot in bioinformatics research. One of the critical approaches of handling data heterogeneity in multi-omics data is first modeling each omics data as a separate similarity graph. Then, the information of multiple graphs is integrated into a unified graph. However, a significant challenge is how to measure the similarity of nodes in each graph and preserve cluster information of each graph. To that end, we exploit a new high order proximity in each graph and propose a similarity fusion method to fuse the high order proximity of multiple graphs while preserving cluster information of multiple graphs. Compared with the current techniques employing the first order proximity, exploiting high order proximity contributes to attaining accurate similarity. The proposed similarity fusion method makes full use of the complementary information from multi-omics data. Experiments in six benchmark multi-omics datasets and two individual cancer case studies confirm that our proposed method achieves statistically significant and biologically meaningful cancer subtypes.",34971537,,10.1109/TCBB.2021.3139597,1,IEEE/ACM transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics,101196755,3.702
Cancer subtype identification by consensus guided graph autoencoders,"Motivation:Cancer subtype identification aims to divide cancer patients into subgroups with distinct clinical phenotypes and facilitate the development for subgroup specific therapies. The massive amount of multi-omics datasets accumulated in the public databases have provided unprecedented opportunities to fulfill this task. As a result, great computational efforts have been made to accurately identify cancer subtypes via integrative analysis of these multi-omics datasets.Results:In this article, we propose a Consensus Guided Graph Autoencoder (CGGA) to effectively identify cancer subtypes. First, we learn for each omic a new feature matrix by using graph autoencoders, where both structure information and node features can be effectively incorporated during the learning process. Second, we learn a set of omic-specific similarity matrices together with a consensus matrix based on the features obtained in the first step. The learned omic-specific similarity matrices are then fed back to the graph autoencoders to guide the feature learning. By iterating the two steps above, our method obtains a final consensus similarity matrix for cancer subtyping. To comprehensively evaluate the prediction performance of our method, we compare CGGA with several approaches ranging from general-purpose multi-view clustering algorithms to multi-omics-specific integrative methods. The experimental results on both generic datasets and cancer datasets confirm the superiority of our method. Moreover, we validate the effectiveness of our method in leveraging multi-omics datasets to identify cancer subtypes. In addition, we investigate the clinical implications of the obtained clusters for glioblastoma and provide new insights into the treatment for patients with different subtypes.Availabilityand implementation:The source code of our method is freely available at https://github.com/alcs417/CGGA.Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",34289034,,10.1093/bioinformatics/btab535,5,"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",9808944,6.931
Proteogenomic studies on cancer drug resistance: towards biomarker discovery and target identification,"Chemoresistance is a major obstacle for current cancer treatment. Proteogenomics is a powerful multi-omics research field that uses customized protein sequence databases generated by genomic and transcriptomic information to identify novel genes (e.g. noncoding, mutation and fusion genes) from mass spectrometry-based proteomic data. By identifying aberrations that are differentially expressed between tumor and normal pairs, this approach can also be applied to validate protein variants in cancer, which may reveal the response to drug treatment. Areas covered: In this review, we will present recent advances in proteogenomic investigations of cancer drug resistance with an emphasis on integrative proteogenomic pipelines and the biomarker discovery which contributes to achieving the goal of using precision/personalized medicine for cancer treatment. Expert commentary: The discovery and comprehensive understanding of potential biomarkers help identify the cohort of patients who may benefit from particular treatments, and will assist real-time clinical decision-making to maximize therapeutic efficacy and minimize adverse effects. With the development of MS-based proteomics and NGS-based sequencing, a growing number of proteogenomic tools are being developed specifically to investigate cancer drug resistance.",28276747,,10.1080/14789450.2017.1299006,4,Expert review of proteomics,101223548,4.25
Metabolic and signalling network maps integration: application to cross-talk studies and omics data analysis in cancer,"Background:The interplay between metabolic processes and signalling pathways remains poorly understood. Global, detailed and comprehensive reconstructions of human metabolism and signalling pathways exist in the form of molecular maps, but they have never been integrated together. We aim at filling in this gap by integrating of both signalling and metabolic pathways allowing a visual exploration of multi-level omics data and study of cross-regulatory circuits between these processes in health and in disease.Results:We combined two comprehensive manually curated network maps. Atlas of Cancer Signalling Network (ACSN), containing mechanisms frequently implicated in cancer; and ReconMap 2.0, a comprehensive reconstruction of human metabolic network. We linked ACSN and ReconMap 2.0 maps via common players and represented the two maps as interconnected layers using the NaviCell platform for maps exploration ( https://navicell.curie.fr/pages/maps_ReconMap%202.html ). In addition, proteins catalysing metabolic reactions in ReconMap 2.0 were not previously visually represented on the map canvas. This precluded visualisation of omics data in the context of ReconMap 2.0. We suggested a solution for displaying protein nodes on the ReconMap 2.0 map in the vicinity of the corresponding reaction or process nodes. This permits multi-omics data visualisation in the context of both map layers. Exploration and shuttling between the two map layers is possible using Google Maps-like features of NaviCell. The integrated networks ACSN-ReconMap 2.0 are accessible online and allows data visualisation through various modes such as markers, heat maps, bar-plots, glyphs and map staining. The integrated networks were applied for comparison of immunoreactive and proliferative ovarian cancer subtypes using transcriptomic, copy number and mutation multi-omics data. A certain number of metabolic and signalling processes specifically deregulated in each of the ovarian cancer sub-types were identified.Conclusions:As knowledge evolves and new omics data becomes more heterogeneous, gathering together existing domains of biology under common platforms is essential. We believe that an integrated ACSN-ReconMap 2.0 networks will help in understanding various disease mechanisms and discovery of new interactions at the intersection of cell signalling and metabolism. In addition, the successful integration of metabolic and signalling networks allows broader systems biology approach application for data interpretation and retrieval of intervention points to tackle simultaneously the key players coordinating signalling and metabolism in human diseases.",30999838,PMC6471697,10.1186/s12859-019-2682-z,7,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,3.307
Three-in-one method for high throughput plant multi-omics,"Multi-omics has gained momentum over the past few years especially in plant single cell-type analysis as they aim to understand cellular molecular networks across different levels of genetic information flow. For multi-omics sample preparation, molecular extractions performed non-simultaneously create rooms for variation, inaccurate data, waste of limited samples, resources and labor. Here we optimized a protocol for 3-in-1 simultaneous extraction of RNA, metabolites, and proteins from the same single cell-type sample. We adapted a commercially available RNA kit with a few modifications to obtain high quality starting materials for sequencing and LC-MS/MS-based metabolomics and proteomics. RNAs are bound to the column, metabolites were extracted in a polar solvent and proteins are precipitated using acetone. This creates an all-in-one workflow using a standard RNA kit. Little training is required to carry out this protocol as it is simple and easy to use. It may be used with a wide range of plant species and different amounts of starting materials, including single cells.",37087185,,10.1016/bs.mie.2022.08.039,0,Methods in enzymology,212271,1.682
Integration of Metabolomic and Proteomic Data to Uncover Actionable Metabolic Pathways,"Mass spectrometry (MS) is an important tool for biological studies because it is capable of interrogating a diversity of biomolecules (proteins, drugs, metabolites) not captured via alternate genomic platforms. Unfortunately, downstream data analysis becomes complicated when attempting to evaluate and integrate measurements of different molecular classes and requires the aggregation of expertise from different relevant disciplines. This complexity represents a significant bottleneck that limits the routine deployment of MS-based multi-omic methods, despite the unmatched biological and functional insight the data can provide. To address this unmet need, our group introduced Omics Notebook as an open-source framework for facilitating exploratory analysis, reporting and integrating MS-based multi-omic data in a way that is automated, reproducible and customizable. By deploying this pipeline, we have devised a framework for researchers to more rapidly identify functional patterns across complex data types and focus on statistically significant and biologically interesting aspects of their multi-omic profiling experiments. This chapter aims to describe a protocol which leverages our publicly accessible tools to analyze and integrate data from high-throughput proteomics and metabolomics experiments and produce reports that will facilitate more impactful research, cross-institutional collaborations, and wider data dissemination.",37191795,,10.1007/978-1-0716-3163-8_10,1,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,0.0
COmic: convolutional kernel networks for interpretable end-to-end learning on (multi-)omics data,"Motivation:The size of available omics datasets is steadily increasing with technological advancement in recent years. While this increase in sample size can be used to improve the performance of relevant prediction tasks in healthcare, models that are optimized for large datasets usually operate as black boxes. In high-stakes scenarios, like healthcare, using a black-box model poses safety and security issues. Without an explanation about molecular factors and phenotypes that affected the prediction, healthcare providers are left with no choice but to blindly trust the models. We propose a new type of artificial neural network, named Convolutional Omics Kernel Network (COmic). By combining convolutional kernel networks with pathway-induced kernels, our method enables robust and interpretable end-to-end learning on omics datasets ranging in size from a few hundred to several hundreds of thousands of samples. Furthermore, COmic can be easily adapted to utilize multiomics data.Results:We evaluated the performance capabilities of COmic on six different breast cancer cohorts. Additionally, we trained COmic models on multiomics data using the METABRIC cohort. Our models performed either better or similar to competitors on both tasks. We show how the use of pathway-induced Laplacian kernels opens the black-box nature of neural networks and results in intrinsically interpretable models that eliminate the need for post hoc explanation models.Availability and implementation:Datasets, labels, and pathway-induced graph Laplacians used for the single-omics tasks can be downloaded at https://ibm.ent.box.com/s/ac2ilhyn7xjj27r0xiwtom4crccuobst/folder/48027287036.

Multi-omics analysis in human retina uncovers ultraconserved cis-regulatory elements at rare eye disease loci,"Cross-species genome comparisons have revealed a substantial number of ultraconserved non-coding elements (UCNEs). Several of these elements have proved to be essential tissue- and cell type-specific cis-regulators of developmental gene expression. Here, we characterize a set of UCNEs as candidate CREs (cCREs) during retinal development and evaluate the contribution of their genomic variation to rare eye diseases, for which pathogenic non-coding variants are emerging. Integration of bulk and single-cell retinal multi-omics data reveals 594 genes under potential cis-regulatory control of UCNEs, of which 45 are implicated in rare eye disease. Mining of candidate cis-regulatory UCNEs in WGS data derived from the rare eye disease cohort of Genomics England reveals 178 ultrarare variants within 84 UCNEs associated with 29 disease genes. Overall, we provide a comprehensive annotation of ultraconserved non-coding regions acting as cCREs during retinal development which can be targets of non-coding variation underlying rare eye diseases.",38383453,PMC10881467,10.1038/s41467-024-45381-1,0,Nature communications,101528555,17.694
Deeply integrating latent consistent representations in high-noise multi-omics data for cancer subtyping,"Cancer is a complex and high-mortality disease regulated by multiple factors. Accurate cancer subtyping is crucial for formulating personalized treatment plans and improving patient survival rates. The underlying mechanisms that drive cancer progression can be comprehensively understood by analyzing multi-omics data. However, the high noise levels in omics data often pose challenges in capturing consistent representations and adequately integrating their information. This paper proposed a novel variational autoencoder-based deep learning model, named Deeply Integrating Latent Consistent Representations (DILCR). Firstly, multiple independent variational autoencoders and contrastive loss functions were designed to separate noise from omics data and capture latent consistent representations. Subsequently, an Attention Deep Integration Network was proposed to integrate consistent representations across different omics levels effectively. Additionally, we introduced the Improved Deep Embedded Clustering algorithm to make integrated variable clustering friendly. The effectiveness of DILCR was evaluated using 10 typical cancer datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas and compared with 14 state-of-the-art integration methods. The results demonstrated that DILCR effectively captures the consistent representations in omics data and outperforms other integration methods in cancer subtyping. In the Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma case study, cancer subtypes were identified by DILCR with significant biological significance and interpretability.",38426322,PMC10939425,10.1093/bib/bbae061,0,Briefings in bioinformatics,100912837,13.994
Multi-omics and machine learning for the prevention and management of female reproductive health,"Females typically carry most of the burden of reproduction in mammals. In humans, this burden is exacerbated further, as the evolutionary advantage of a large and complex human brain came at a great cost of women's reproductive health. Pregnancy thus became a highly demanding phase in a woman's life cycle both physically and emotionally and therefore needs monitoring to assure an optimal outcome. Moreover, an increasing societal trend towards reproductive complications partly due to the increasing maternal age and global obesity pandemic demands closer monitoring of female reproductive health. This review first provides an overview of female reproductive biology and further explores utilization of large-scale data analysis and -omics techniques (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics) towards diagnosis, prognosis, and management of female reproductive disorders. In addition, we explore machine learning approaches for predictive models towards prevention and management. Furthermore, mobile apps and wearable devices provide a promise of continuous monitoring of health. These complementary technologies can be combined towards monitoring female (fertility-related) health and detection of any early complications to provide intervention solutions. In summary, technological advances (e.g., omics and wearables) have shown a promise towards diagnosis, prognosis, and management of female reproductive disorders. Systematic integration of these technologies is needed urgently in female reproductive healthcare to be further implemented in the national healthcare systems for societal benefit.",36909346,PMC9996332,10.3389/fendo.2023.1081667,4,Frontiers in endocrinology,101555782,6.055
A semi-supervised approach for the integration of multi-omics data based on transformer multi-head self-attention mechanism and graph convolutional networks,"Background and objectives:Comprehensive analysis of multi-omics data is crucial for accurately formulating effective treatment plans for complex diseases. Supervised ensemble methods have gained popularity in recent years for multi-omics data analysis. However, existing research based on supervised learning algorithms often fails to fully harness the information from unlabeled nodes and overlooks the latent features within and among different omics, as well as the various associations among features. Here, we present a novel multi-omics integrative method MOSEGCN, based on the Transformer multi-head self-attention mechanism and Graph Convolutional Networks(GCN), with the aim of enhancing the accuracy of complex disease classification. MOSEGCN first employs the Transformer multi-head self-attention mechanism and Similarity Network Fusion (SNF) to separately learn the inherent correlations of latent features within and among different omics, constructing a comprehensive view of diseases. Subsequently, it feeds the learned crucial information into a self-ensembling Graph Convolutional Network (SEGCN) built upon semi-supervised learning methods for training and testing, facilitating a better analysis and utilization of information from multi-omics data to achieve precise classification of disease subtypes.Results:The experimental results show that MOSEGCN outperforms several state-of-the-art multi-omics integrative analysis approaches on three types of omics data: mRNA expression data, microRNA expression data, and DNA methylation data, with accuracy rates of 83.0% for Alzheimer's disease and 86.7% for breast cancer subtyping. Furthermore, MOSEGCN exhibits strong generalizability on the GBM dataset, enabling the identification of important biomarkers for related diseases.Conclusion:MOSEGCN explores the significant relationship information among different omics and within each omics' latent features, effectively leveraging labeled and unlabeled information to further enhance the accuracy of complex disease classification. It also provides a promising approach for identifying reliable biomarkers, paving the way for personalized medicine.",38254021,PMC10802018,10.1186/s12864-024-09985-7,0,BMC genomics,100965258,4.547
A new high-throughput screening methodology for the discovery of cancer-testis antigen using multi-omics data,"Background:Cancer/testis antigens (CTAs), also known as tumor-specific antigens (TSAs) are specifically expressed in cancer cells and exhibit high immunogenicity, making them promising targets for immunotherapy and cancer vaccines.Methods:A new integrated high-throughput screening methodology for CTAs was proposed in this study through combining DNA methylation and RNA sequencing data. Briefly, the genes with increased transcript level and decreased DNA methylation were identified by multi-omics analysis. RNA sequencing studies in cell lines exposed to DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors were performed to validate the inherent causal relationship between DNA hypomethylation and gene expression upregulation.Results:We proposed a new integrated high-throughput screening methodology for identification of CTAs using multi-omics analysis. In addition, we tested the feasibility of this method using gastric cancer (GC) as an example. In GC, we identified over 2000 primary candidate CTAs and ultimately identified 20 CTAs with significant tissue-specificity, including a testis-specific serine protease TESSP1/PRSS41. Integrated analysis confirmed that PRSS41 expression was reactivated in gastrointestinal cancers by promoter DNA hypomethylation at the CpG site (cg08104780).

[Progress in omics research of Aspergillus niger],"Aspergillus niger, as an important industrial fermentation strain, is widely applied in the production of organic acids and industrial enzymes. With the development of diverse omics technologies, the data of genome, transcriptome, proteome and metabolome of A. niger are increasing continuously, which declared the coming era of big data for the research in fermentation process of A. niger. The data analysis from single omics and the comparison of multi-omics, to the integrations of multi-omics based on the genome-scale metabolic network model largely extends the intensive and systematic understanding of the efficient production mechanism of A. niger.

Ambiguity in logic-based models of gene regulatory networks: An integrative multi-perturbation analysis,"Most studies of gene regulatory network (GRN) inference have focused extensively on identifying the interaction map of the GRNs. However, in order to predict the cellular behavior, modeling the GRN in terms of logic circuits, i.e., Boolean networks, is necessary. The perturbation techniques, e.g., knock-down and over-expression, should be utilized for identifying the underlying logic behind the interactions. However, we will show that by using only transcriptomic data obtained by single-perturbation experiments, we cannot observe all regulatory interactions, and this invisibility causes ambiguity in our model. Consequently, we need to employ the data of multiple omics layers (genome, transcriptome, and proteome) as well as multiple perturbation experiments to reduce or eliminate ambiguity in our modeling. In this paper, we introduce a multi-step perturbation experiment to deal with ambiguity. Moreover, we perform a thorough analysis to investigate which types of perturbations and omics layers play the most important role in the unambiguous modeling of the GRNs and how much ambiguity will be eliminated by considering more perturbations and more omics layers. Our analysis shows that performing both knock-down and over-expression is necessary in order to achieve the least ambiguous model. Moreover, the more steps of the perturbation are taken, the more ambiguity is eliminated. In addition, we can even achieve an unambiguous model of the GRN by using multi-step perturbation and integrating transcriptomic, protein-protein interaction, and cis-element data. Finally, we demonstrate the effect of utilizing different types of perturbation experiment and integrating multi-omics data on identifying the logic behind the regulatory interactions in a synthetic GRN. In conclusion, relying on the results of only knock-down experiments and not including as many omics layers as possible in the GRN inference, makes the results ambiguous, unreliable, and less accurate.",30458000,PMC6245684,10.1371/journal.pone.0206976,1,PloS one,101285081,3.752
DELFOS-drug efficacy leveraging forked and specialized networks-benchmarking scRNA-seq data in multi-omics-based prediction of cancer sensitivity,"Motivation:Cancer is currently one of the most notorious diseases, with over 1 million deaths in the European Union alone in 2022. As each tumor can be composed of diverse cell types with distinct genotypes, cancer cells can acquire resistance to different compounds. Moreover, anticancer drugs can display severe side effects, compromising patient well-being. Therefore, novel strategies for identifying the optimal set of compounds to treat each tumor have become an important research topic in recent decades.Results:To address this challenge, we developed a novel drug response prediction algorithm called Drug Efficacy Leveraging Forked and Specialized networks (DELFOS). Our model learns from multi-omics data from over 65 cancer cell lines, as well as structural data from over 200 compounds, for the prediction of drug sensitivity. We also evaluated the benefits of incorporating single-cell expression data to predict drug response. DELFOS was validated using datasets with unseen cell lines or drugs and compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms, achieving a high prediction performance on several correlation and error metrics. Overall, DELFOS can effectively leverage multi-omics data for the prediction of drug responses in thousands of drug-cell line pairs.Availability and implementation:The DELFOS pipeline and associated data are available at github.com/MoreiraLAB/delfos.",37862234,PMC10627353,10.1093/bioinformatics/btad645,0,"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",9808944,6.931
Con-AAE: contrastive cycle adversarial autoencoders for single-cell multi-omics alignment and integration,"Motivation:We have entered the multi-omics era and can measure cells from different aspects. Hence, we can get a more comprehensive view by integrating or matching data from different spaces corresponding to the same object. However, it is particularly challenging in the single-cell multi-omics scenario because such data are very sparse with extremely high dimensions. Though some techniques can be used to measure scATAC-seq and scRNA-seq simultaneously, the data are usually highly noisy due to the limitations of the experimental environment.Results:To promote single-cell multi-omics research, we overcome the above challenges, proposing a novel framework, contrastive cycle adversarial autoencoders, which can align and integrate single-cell RNA-seq data and single-cell ATAC-seq data. Con-AAE can efficiently map the above data with high sparsity and noise from different spaces to a coordinated subspace, where alignment and integration tasks can be easier. We demonstrate its advantages on several datasets.Availability and implementation:Zenodo link: https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/368779433. github: https://github.com/kakarotcq/Con-AAE.",36975610,PMC10101696,10.1093/bioinformatics/btad162,4,"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",9808944,6.931
A multi-omics dataset of human transcriptome and proteome stable reference,"The development of high-throughput omics technology has greatly promoted the development of biomedicine. However, the poor reproducibility of omics techniques limits their application. It is necessary to use standard reference materials of complex RNAs or proteins to test and calibrate the accuracy and reproducibility of omics workflows. The transcriptome and proteome of most cell lines shift during culturing, which limits their applicability as standard samples. In this study, we demonstrated that the human hepatocellular cell line MHCC97H has a very stable transcriptome (r = 0.983~0.997) and proteome (r = 0.966~0.988 for data-dependent acquisition, r = 0.970~0.994 for data-independent acquisition) after 9 subculturing generations, which allows this steady standard sample to be consistently produced on an industrial scale in long term. Moreover, this stability was maintained across labs and platforms. In sum, our study provides omics standard reference material and reference datasets for transcriptomic and proteomics research. This helps to further standardize the workflow and data quality of omics techniques and thus promotes the application of omics technology in precision medicine.",37443183,PMC10344951,10.1038/s41597-023-02359-w,2,Scientific data,101640192,8.501
Interactive gene identification for cancer subtyping based on multi-omics clustering,"Recent advances in multi-omics databases offer the opportunity to explore complex systems of cancers across hierarchical biological levels. Some methods have been proposed to identify the genes that play a vital role in disease development by integrating multi-omics. However, the existing methods identify the related genes separately, neglecting the gene interactions that are related to the multigenic disease. In this study, we develop a learning framework to identify the interactive genes based on multi-omics data including gene expression. Firstly, we integrate different omics based on their similarities and apply spectral clustering for cancer subtype identification. Then, a gene co-expression network is construct for each cancer subtype. Finally, we detect the interactive genes in the co-expression network by learning the dense subgraphs based on the L1prosperities of eigenvectors in the modularity matrix. We apply the proposed learning framework on a multi-omics cancer dataset to identify the interactive genes for each cancer subtype. The detected genes are examined by DAVID and KEGG tools for systematic gene ontology enrichment analysis. The analysis results show that the detected genes have relationships to cancer development and the genes in different cancer subtypes are related to different biological processes and pathways, which are expected to yield important references for understanding tumor heterogeneity and improving patient survival.",36804215,,10.1016/j.ymeth.2023.02.005,0,"Methods (San Diego, Calif.)",9426302,4.647
Identification of molecular signatures and pathways involved in Rett syndrome using a multi-omics approach,"Background:Rett syndrome (RTT) is a neurodevelopmental disorder mainly caused by mutations in the methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 gene (MECP2). MeCP2 is a multi-functional protein involved in many cellular processes, but the mechanisms by which its dysfunction causes disease are not fully understood. The duplication of the MECP2 gene causes a distinct disorder called MECP2 duplication syndrome (MDS), highlighting the importance of tightly regulating its dosage for proper cellular function. Additionally, some patients with mutations in genes other than MECP2 exhibit phenotypic similarities with RTT, indicating that these genes may also play a role in similar cellular functions. The purpose of this study was to characterise the molecular alterations in patients with RTT in order to identify potential biomarkers or therapeutic targets for this disorder.Methods:We used a combination of transcriptomics (RNAseq) and proteomics (TMT mass spectrometry) to characterise the expression patterns in fibroblast cell lines from 22 patients with RTT and detected mutation in MECP2, 15 patients with MDS, 12 patients with RTT-like phenotypes and 13 healthy controls. Transcriptomics and proteomics data were used to identify differentially expressed genes at both RNA and protein levels, which were further inspected via enrichment and upstream regulator analyses and compared to find shared features in patients with RTT.Results:We identified molecular alterations in cellular functions and pathways that may contribute to the disease phenotype in patients with RTT, such as deregulated cytoskeletal components, vesicular transport elements, ribosomal subunits and mRNA processing machinery. We also compared RTT expression profiles with those of MDS seeking changes in opposite directions that could lead to the identification of MeCP2 direct targets. Some of the deregulated transcripts and proteins were consistently affected in patients with RTT-like phenotypes, revealing potentially relevant molecular processes in patients with overlapping traits and different genetic aetiology.Conclusions:The integration of data in a multi-omics analysis has helped to interpret the molecular consequences of MECP2 dysfunction, contributing to the characterisation of the molecular landscape in patients with RTT. The comparison with MDS provides knowledge of MeCP2 direct targets, whilst the correlation with RTT-like phenotypes highlights processes potentially contributing to the pathomechanism leading these disorders.",37710353,PMC10503149,10.1186/s40246-023-00532-1,1,Human genomics,101202210,6.481
ScSmOP: a universal computational pipeline for single-cell single-molecule multiomics data analysis,"Single-cell multiomics techniques have been widely applied to detect the key signature of cells. These methods have achieved a single-molecule resolution and can even reveal spatial localization. These emerging methods provide insights elucidating the features of genomic, epigenomic and transcriptomic heterogeneity in individual cells. However, they have given rise to new computational challenges in data processing. Here, we describe Single-cell Single-molecule multiple Omics Pipeline (ScSmOP), a universal pipeline for barcode-indexed single-cell single-molecule multiomics data analysis. Essentially, the C language is utilized in ScSmOP to set up spaced-seed hash table-based algorithms for barcode identification according to ligation-based barcoding data and synthesis-based barcoding data, followed by data mapping and deconvolution. We demonstrate high reproducibility of data processing between ScSmOP and published pipelines in comprehensive analyses of single-cell omics data (scRNA-seq, scATAC-seq, scARC-seq), single-molecule chromatin interaction data (ChIA-Drop, SPRITE, RD-SPRITE), single-cell single-molecule chromatin interaction data (scSPRITE) and spatial transcriptomic data from various cell types and species. Additionally, ScSmOP shows more rapid performance and is a versatile, efficient, easy-to-use and robust pipeline for single-cell single-molecule multiomics data analysis.",37779245,,10.1093/bib/bbad343,0,Briefings in bioinformatics,100912837,13.994
Contrastively generative self-expression model for single-cell and spatial multimodal data,"Advances in single-cell multi-omics technology provide an unprecedented opportunity to fully understand cellular heterogeneity. However, integrating omics data from multiple modalities is challenging due to the individual characteristics of each measurement. Here, to solve such a problem, we propose a contrastive and generative deep self-expression model, called single-cell multimodal self-expressive integration (scMSI), which integrates the heterogeneous multimodal data into a unified manifold space. Specifically, scMSI first learns each omics-specific latent representation and self-expression relationship to consider the characteristics of different omics data by deep self-expressive generative model. Then, scMSI combines these omics-specific self-expression relations through contrastive learning. In such a way, scMSI provides a paradigm to integrate multiple omics data even with weak relation, which effectively achieves the representation learning and data integration into a unified framework. We demonstrate that scMSI provides a cohesive solution for a variety of analysis tasks, such as integration analysis, data denoising, batch correction and spatial domain detection. We have applied scMSI on various single-cell and spatial multimodal datasets to validate its high effectiveness and robustness in diverse data types and application scenarios.",37507114,,10.1093/bib/bbad265,1,Briefings in bioinformatics,100912837,13.994
Multiomix: a cloud-based platform to infer cancer genomic and epigenomic events associated with gene expression modulation,"Motivation:Large-scale cancer genome projects have generated genomic, transcriptomic, epigenomic and clinicopathological data from thousands of samples in almost every human tumor site. Although most omics data and their associated resources are publicly available, its full integration and interpretation to dissect the sources of gene expression modulation require specialized knowledge and software.Results:We present Multiomix, an interactive cloud-based platform that allows biologists to identify genetic and epigenetic events associated with the transcriptional modulation of cancer-related genes through the analysis of multi-omics data available on public functional genomic databases or user-uploaded datasets. Multiomix consists of an integrated set of functions, pipelines and a graphical user interface that allows retrieval, aggregation, analysis and visualization of different omics data sources. After the user provides the data to be analyzed, Multiomix identifies all significant correlations between mRNAs and non-mRNA genomics features (e.g. miRNA, DNA methylation and CNV) across the genome, the predicted sequence-based interactions (e.g. miRNA-mRNA) and their associated prognostic values.Availability and implementation:Multiomix is available at https://www.multiomix.org.

Exploring Computational Data Amplification and Imputation for the Discovery of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) Biomarkers from Limited Human Datasets,"Background:Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a devastating disease with serious health complications. Early T1D biomarkers that could enable timely detection and prevention before the onset of clinical symptoms are paramount but currently unavailable. Despite their promise, omics approaches have so far failed to deliver such biomarkers, likely due to the fragmented nature of information obtained through the single omics approach. We recently demonstrated the utility of parallel multi-omics for the identification of T1D biomarker signatures. Our studies also identified challenges.Methods:Here, we evaluated a novel computational approach of data imputation and amplification as one way to overcome challenges associated with the relatively small number of subjects in these studies.Results:Using proprietary algorithms, we amplified our quadra-omics (proteomics, metabolomics, lipidomics, and transcriptomics) dataset from nine subjects a thousand-fold and analyzed the data usingIngenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA)software to assess the change in its analytical capabilities and biomarker prediction power in the amplified datasets compared to the original. These studies showed the ability to identify an increased number of T1D-relevant pathways and biomarkers in such computationally amplified datasets, especially, at imputation ratios close to the ""golden ratio"" of 38.2%:61.8%. Specifically, theCanonical PathwayandDiseases and Functionsmodules identified higher numbers of inflammatory pathways and functions relevant to autoimmune T1D, including novel ones not identified in the original data. TheBiomarker Predictionmodule also predicted in the amplified data several unique biomarker candidates with direct links to T1D pathogenesis.Conclusions:These preliminary findings indicate that such large-scale data imputation and amplification approaches are useful in facilitating the discovery of candidate integrated biomarker signatures of T1D or other diseases by increasing the predictive range of existing data mining tools, especially when the size of the input data is inherently limited.",36291653,PMC9599756,10.3390/biom12101444,2,Biomolecules,101596414,6.064
TransSurv: Transformer-Based Survival Analysis Model Integrating Histopathological Images and Genomic Data for Colorectal Cancer,"Survival analysis is a significant study in cancer prognosis, and the multi-modal data, including histopathological images, genomic data, and clinical information, provides unprecedented opportunities for its development. However, because of the high dimensionality and the heterogeneity of histopathological images and genomic data, acquiring effective predictive characters from these multi-modal data has always been a challenge for survival analysis. In this article, we propose a transformer-based survival analysis model (TransSurv) for colorectal cancer that can effectively integrate intra-modality and inter-modality features of histopathological images, genomic data, and clinical information. Specifically, to integrate the intra-modality relationship of image patches, we develop a multi-scale histopathological features fusion transformer (MS-Trans). Furthermore, we provide a cross-modal fusion transformer based on cross attention for multi-scale pathological representation and multi-omics representation, which includes RNA-seq expression and copy number alteration (CNA). At the output layer of the TransSurv, we adopt the Cox layer to integrate multi-modal fusion representation with clinical information for end-to-end survival analysis. The experimental results on the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) colorectal cancer cohort demonstrate that the proposed TransSurv outperforms the existing methods and improves the prognosis prediction of colorectal cancer.",35976825,,10.1109/TCBB.2022.3199244,3,IEEE/ACM transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics,101196755,3.702
Multi-omics analysis reveals epigenetically regulated processes and patient classification in lung adenocarcinoma,"Aberrant DNA methylation is a hallmark of many cancer types. Despite our knowledge of epigenetic and transcriptomic alterations in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), we lack robust multi-modal molecular classifications for patient stratification. This is partly because the impact of epigenetic alterations on lung cancer development and progression is still not fully understood. To that end, we identified disease-associated processes under epigenetic regulation in LUAD. We performed a genome-wide expression-methylation Quantitative Trait Loci (emQTL) analysis by integrating DNA methylation and gene expression data from 453 patients in the TCGA cohort. Using a community detection algorithm, we identified distinct communities of CpG-gene associations with diverse biological processes. Interestingly, we identified a community linked to hormone response and lipid metabolism; the identified CpGs in this community were enriched in enhancer regions and binding regions of transcription factors such as FOXA1/2, GRHL2, HNF1B, AR, and ESR1. Furthermore, the CpGs were connected to their associated genes through chromatin interaction loops. These findings suggest that the expression of genes involved in hormone response and lipid metabolism in LUAD is epigenetically regulated through DNA methylation and enhancer-promoter interactions. By applying consensus clustering on the integrated expression-methylation pattern of the emQTL-genes and CpGs linked to hormone response and lipid metabolism, we further identified subclasses of patients with distinct prognoses. This novel patient stratification was validated in an independent patient cohort of 135 patients and showed increased prognostic significance compared to previously defined molecular subtypes.",38489486,,10.1002/ijc.34915,0,International journal of cancer,42124,7.316
Integrated multi-omics data analyses for exploring the co-occurring and mutually exclusive gene alteration events in colorectal cancer,"Co-occurring and mutually exclusive gene alteration events are helpful for understanding carcinogenesis but systematic screening for such events is quite limited. We conducted pairwise screening tests to identify ""hit pairs"" in colorectal cancer (CRC) by utilizing the cross-omics data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Numerous hit pairs involving somatic mutations, copy number variations, and DNA methylation were found to occur nonrandomly in CRC, such as KRAS and HOXB6, SMAD4 and PMEPA1. Based on these hit pairs, we identified 32 synthetic lethal pairs and 7,527 co-occurring pairs relating to drug response. Our further biological experiments showed that the co-occurrence of mutant FCGBP and NUDT12 silencing (or mutant TMC3 and RPS6KA6 silencing) with small interfering RNA reduced cell viability. Moreover, novel hit pairs could influence prognosis. The patients who carried concurrent mutations of IRF5 and NEFH, SYNE1 and TTN, or MUC16 and NEFH had worse survival outcomes. Particularly, the presence of mutant SYNE1 and TTN pair not only affects prognosis, but also is related to CRC patients' response to drug treatment. Our ""hit pair"" genes may provide insights into colorectal carcinogenesis and help open new avenues for CRC therapy.",32485022,,10.1002/humu.24059,7,Human mutation,9215429,4.7
Windows Scanning Multiomics: Integrated Metabolomics and Proteomics,"Metabolomics and proteomics offer significant advantages in understanding biological mechanisms at two hierarchical levels. However, conventional single omics analysis faces challenges due to the high demand for specimens and the complexity of intrinsic associations. To obtain comprehensive and accurate system biological information, we developed a multiomics analytical method called Windows Scanning Multiomics (WSM). In this method, we performed simultaneous extraction of metabolites and proteins from the same sample, resulting in a 10% increase in the coverage of the identified biomolecules. Both metabolomics and proteomics analyses were conducted by using ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS), eliminating the need for instrument conversions. Additionally, we designed an R-based program (WSM.R) to integrate mathematical and biological correlations between metabolites and proteins into a correlation network. The network created from simultaneously extracted biomolecules was more focused and comprehensive compared to those from separate extractions. Notably, we excluded six pairs of false-positive relationships between metabolites and proteins in the network established using simultaneously extracted biomolecules. In conclusion, this study introduces a novel approach for multiomics analysis and data processing that greatly aids in bioinformation mining from multiomics results. This method is poised to play an indispensable role in systems biology research.",38095040,,10.1021/acs.analchem.3c03785,0,Analytical chemistry,370536,8.008
A multi-omics approach reveals mechanisms of nanomaterial toxicity and structure-activity relationships in alveolar macrophages,"In respect to the high number of released nanomaterials and their highly variable properties, novel grouping approaches are required based on the effects of nanomaterials. Proper grouping calls for a combination of an experimental setup with a higher number of structurally similar nanomaterials and for employing integrated omics approaches to identify the mode of action. Here, we analyzed the effects of seven well-characterized NMs comprising different chemical compositions, sizes and chemical surface modifications on the rat alveolar macrophage cell line NR8383. The NMs were investigated at three doses ranging from 2.5 to 10 µg/cm2after 24 h incubation using an integrated multi-omics approach involving untargeted proteomics, targeted metabolomics, and src homology 2 (SH2) profiling. By using Weighted Gene Correlation Network Analysis (WGCNA) for the integrative data, we identified correlations of molecular pathways with physico-chemical properties and toxicological endpoints. The three investigated SiO2 variants induced strong alterations in all three omics approaches and were, therefore, be classified as ""active."" Two organic phthalocyanines showed minor responses and Mn2O3 induced a different molecular response pattern than the other NMs. WGCNA revealed that agglomerate size and surface area as well as LDH release are among the most important parameters correlating with nanotoxicology. Moreover, we identified key drivers that can serve as representative biomarker candidates, supporting the value of multi-omics approaches to establish integrated approaches to testing and assessment (IATAs).",31774342,,10.1080/17435390.2019.1684592,10,Nanotoxicology,101233132,5.881
StellarPath: Hierarchical-vertical multi-omics classifier synergizes stable markers and interpretable similarity networks for patient profiling,"The Patient Similarity Network paradigm implies modeling the similarity between patients based on specific data. The similarity can summarize patients' relationships from high-dimensional data, such as biological omics. The end PSN can undergo un/supervised learning tasks while being strongly interpretable, tailored for precision medicine, and ready to be analyzed with graph-theory methods. However, these benefits are not guaranteed and depend on the granularity of the summarized data, the clarity of the similarity measure, the complexity of the network's topology, and the implemented methods for analysis. To date, no patient classifier fully leverages the paradigm's inherent benefits. PSNs remain complex, unexploited, and meaningless. We present StellarPath, a hierarchical-vertical patient classifier that leverages pathway analysis and patient similarity concepts to find meaningful features for both classes and individuals. StellarPath processes omics data, hierarchically integrates them into pathways, and uses a novel similarity to measure how patients' pathway activity is alike. It selects biologically relevant molecules, pathways, and networks, considering molecule stability and topology. A graph convolutional neural network then predicts unknown patients based on known cases. StellarPath excels in classification performances and computational resources across sixteen datasets. It demonstrates proficiency in inferring the class of new patients described in external independent studies, following its initial training and testing phases on a local dataset. It advances the PSN paradigm and provides new markers, insights, and tools for in-depth patient profiling.",38607982,PMC11042724,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012022,0,PLoS computational biology,101238922,4.779
Biomarker discovery for chronic liver diseases by multi-omics - a preclinical case study,"Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a major cause of liver fibrosis with increasing prevalence worldwide. Currently there are no approved drugs available. The development of new therapies is difficult as diagnosis and staging requires biopsies. Consequently, predictive plasma biomarkers would be useful for drug development. Here we present a multi-omics approach to characterize the molecular pathophysiology and to identify new plasma biomarkers in a choline-deficient L-amino acid-defined diet rat NASH model. We analyzed liver samples by RNA-Seq and proteomics, revealing disease relevant signatures and a high correlation between mRNA and protein changes. Comparison to human data showed an overlap of inflammatory, metabolic, and developmental pathways. Using proteomics analysis of plasma we identified mainly secreted proteins that correlate with liver RNA and protein levels. We developed a multi-dimensional attribute ranking approach integrating multi-omics data with liver histology and prior knowledge uncovering known human markers, but also novel candidates. Using regression analysis, we show that the top-ranked markers were highly predictive for fibrosis in our model and hence can serve as preclinical plasma biomarkers. Our approach presented here illustrates the power of multi-omics analyses combined with plasma proteomics and is readily applicable to human biomarker discovery.",31992752,PMC6987209,10.1038/s41598-020-58030-6,10,Scientific reports,101563288,4.996
Cancer Subtype Discovery Based on Integrative Model of Multigenomic Data,"One major goal of large-scale cancer omics study is to understand molecular mechanisms of cancer and find new biomedical targets. To deal with the high-dimensional multidimensional cancer omics data (DNA methylation, mRNA expression, etc.), which can be used to discover new insight on identifying cancer subtypes, clustering methods are usually used to find an effective low-dimensional subspace of the original data and then cluster cancer samples in the reduced subspace. However, due to data-type diversity and big data volume, few methods can integrate these data and map them into an effective low-dimensional subspace. In this paper, we develop a dimension-reduction and data-integration method for indentifying cancer subtypes, named Scluster. First, Scluster, respectively, projects the different original data into the principal subspaces by an adaptive sparse reduced-rank regression method. Then, a fused patient-by-patient network is obtained for these subgroups through a scaled exponential similarity kernel method. Finally, candidate cancer subtypes are identified using spectral clustering method. We demonstrate the efficiency of our Scluster method using three cancers by jointly analyzing mRNA expression, miRNA expression, and DNA methylation data. The evaluation results and analyses show that Scluster is effective for predicting survival and identifies novel cancer subtypes of large-scale multi-omics data.",28113782,,10.1109/TCBB.2016.2621769,14,IEEE/ACM transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics,101196755,3.702

Integrating Single-Cell Methylome and Transcriptome Data with MAPLE,"As a mechanism of epigenetic gene regulation, DNA methylation has crucial roles in developmental and differentiation programs. Thanks to the recently introduced bisulfite-sequencing-based methods, it is possible to profile the entire methylome at single-cell resolution. However, analysis of single-cell methylome data is challenging due to data sparsity and moderate correlation with transcript level. Our recently developed computational framework, MAPLE, addresses these challenges using supervised learning models. Using both genomic sequence and methylation information as the input, MAPLE predicts activity for each gene, which can be used to integrate with transcriptome data from the same cell types. Here, we provide an overview of our method and detailed guidance on how to use it for the integration of methylome and transcriptome data.",36723808,,10.1007/978-1-0716-2962-8_4,0,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,0.0
Knowledge boosting: a graph-based integration approach with multi-omics data and genomic knowledge for cancer clinical outcome prediction,"Objective:Cancer can involve gene dysregulation via multiple mechanisms, so no single level of genomic data fully elucidates tumor behavior due to the presence of numerous genomic variations within or between levels in a biological system. We have previously proposed a graph-based integration approach that combines multi-omics data including copy number alteration, methylation, miRNA, and gene expression data for predicting clinical outcome in cancer. However, genomic features likely interact with other genomic features in complex signaling or regulatory networks, since cancer is caused by alterations in pathways or complete processes.Methods:Here we propose a new graph-based framework for integrating multi-omics data and genomic knowledge to improve power in predicting clinical outcomes and elucidate interplay between different levels. To highlight the validity of our proposed framework, we used an ovarian cancer dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas for predicting stage, grade, and survival outcomes.Results:Integrating multi-omics data with genomic knowledge to construct pre-defined features resulted in higher performance in clinical outcome prediction and higher stability. For the grade outcome, the model with gene expression data produced an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.7866. However, models of the integration with pathway, Gene Ontology, chromosomal gene set, and motif gene set consistently outperformed the model with genomic data only, attaining AUCs of 0.7873, 0.8433, 0.8254, and 0.8179, respectively.Conclusions:Integrating multi-omics data and genomic knowledge to improve understanding of molecular pathogenesis and underlying biology in cancer should improve diagnostic and prognostic indicators and the effectiveness of therapies.",25002459,PMC4433357,10.1136/amiajnl-2013-002481,41,Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,9430800,7.942
Multi-omics cluster defines the subtypes of CRC with distinct prognosis and tumor microenvironment,"Background:Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a complex malignancy characterized by diverse molecular profiles, clinical outcomes, and limited precision in prognostic markers. Addressing these challenges, this study utilized multi-omics data to define consensus molecular subtypes in CRC and elucidate their association with clinical outcomes and underlying biological processes.Methods:Consensus molecular subtypes were obtained by applying ten integrated multi-omics clustering algorithms to analyze TCGA-CRC multi-omics data, including mRNA, lncRNA, miRNA, DNA methylation CpG sites, and somatic mutation data. The association of subtypes with prognoses, enrichment functions, immune status, and genomic alterations were further analyzed. Next, we conducted univariate Cox and Lasso regression analyses to investigate the potential prognostic application of biomarkers associated with multi-omics subtypes derived from weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). The function of one of the biomarkers MID2 was validated in CRC cell lines.Results:Two CRC subtypes linked to distinct clinical outcomes were identified in TCGA-CRC cohort and validated with three external datasets. The CS1 subtype exhibited a poor prognosis and was characterized by higher tumor-related Hallmark pathway activity and lower metabolism pathway activity. In addition, the CS1 was predicted to have less immunotherapy responder and exhibited more genomic alteration compared to CS2. Then a prognostic model comprising five genes was established, with patients in the high-risk group showing substantial concordance with the CS1 subtype, and those in the low-risk group with the CS2 subtype. The gene MID2, included in the prognostic model, was found to be correlated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway and distinct DNA methylation patterns. Knockdown of MID2 in CRC cells resulted in reduced colony formation, migration, and invasion capacities.Conclusion:The integrative multi-omics subtypes proposed potential biomarkers for CRC and provided valuable knowledge for precision oncology.",38549156,PMC10976740,10.1186/s40001-024-01805-8,1,European journal of medical research,9517857,4.981
Bayesian structural equation modeling in multiple omics data with application to circadian genes,"Motivation:It is well known that the integration among different data-sources is reliable because of its potential of unveiling new functionalities of the genomic expressions, which might be dormant in a single-source analysis. Moreover, different studies have justified the more powerful analyses of multi-platform data. Toward this, in this study, we consider the circadian genes' omics profile, such as copy number changes and RNA-sequence data along with their survival response. We develop a Bayesian structural equation modeling coupled with linear regressions and log normal accelerated failure-time regression to integrate the information between these two platforms to predict the survival of the subjects. We place conjugate priors on the regression parameters and derive the Gibbs sampler using the conditional distributions of them.Results:Our extensive simulation study shows that the integrative model provides a better fit to the data than its closest competitor. The analyses of glioblastoma cancer data and the breast cancer data from TCGA, the largest genomics and transcriptomics database, support our findings.Availability and implementation:The developed method is wrapped in R package available at https://github.com/MAITYA02/semmcmc.Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",32369552,PMC7332567,10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa286,4,"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",9808944,6.931
Unraveling phenotypic variance in metabolic syndrome through multi-omics,"Complex multi-omics effects drive the clustering of cardiometabolic risk factors, underscoring the imperative to comprehend how individual and combined omics shape phenotypic variation. Our study partitions phenotypic variance in metabolic syndrome (MetS), blood glucose (GLU), triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and blood pressure through genome, transcriptome, metabolome, and exposome (i.e., lifestyle exposome) analyses. Our analysis included a cohort of 62,822 unrelated individuals with white British ancestry, sourced from the UK biobank. We employed linear mixed models to partition phenotypic variance using the restricted maximum likelihood (REML) method, implemented in MTG2 (v2.22). We initiated the analysis by individually modeling omics, followed by subsequent integration of pairwise omics in a joint model that also accounted for the covariance and interaction between omics layers. Finally, we estimated the correlations of various omics effects between the phenotypes using bivariate REML. Significant proportions of the MetS variance were attributed to distinct data sources: genome (9.47%), transcriptome (4.24%), metabolome (14.34%), and exposome (3.77%). The phenotypic variances explained by the genome, transcriptome, metabolome, and exposome ranged from 3.28% for GLU to 25.35% for HDL-C, 0% for GLU to 19.34% for HDL-C, 4.29% for systolic blood pressure (SBP) to 35.75% for TG, and 0.89% for GLU to 10.17% for HDL-C, respectively. Significant correlations were found between genomic and transcriptomic effects for TG and HDL-C. Furthermore, significant interaction effects between omics data were detected for both MetS and its components. Interestingly, significant correlation of omics effect between the phenotypes was found. This study underscores omics' roles, interaction effects, and random-effects covariance in unveiling phenotypic variation in multi-omics domains.",38095720,,10.1007/s00439-023-02619-0,0,Human genetics,7613873,5.881
DevOmics: an integrated multi-omics database of human and mouse early embryo,"Transcriptomic and epigenetic alterations during early embryo development have been proven to play essential roles in regulating the cell fate. Nowadays, advances in single-cell transcriptomics and epigenomics profiling techniques provide large volumes of data for understanding the molecular regulatory mechanisms in early embryos and facilitate the investigation of assisted reproductive technology as well as preimplantation genetic testing. However, the lack of integrated data collection and unified analytic procedures greatly limits their usage in scientific research and clinical application. Hence, it is necessary to establish a database integrating the regulatory information of human and mouse early embryos with unified analytic procedures. Here, we introduce DevOmics (http://devomics.cn/), which contains normalized gene expression, DNA methylation, histone modifications (H3K4me3, H3K9me3, H3K27me3, H3K27ac), chromatin accessibility and 3D chromatin architecture profiles of human and mouse early embryos spanning six developmental stages (zygote, 2cell, 4cell, 8cell, morula and blastocyst (ICM, TE)). The current version of DevOmics provides Search and Advanced Search for retrieving genes a researcher is interested in, Analysis Tools including the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) analysis for acquiring DEGs between different types of samples, allelic explorer for displaying allele-specific gene expression as well as epigenetic modifications and correlation analysis for showing the dynamic changes in different layers of data across developmental stages, as well as Genome Browser and Ortholog for visualization. DevOmics offers a user-friendly website for biologists and clinicians to decipher molecular regulatory mechanisms of human and mouse early embryos.",34097004,,10.1093/bib/bbab208,10,Briefings in bioinformatics,100912837,13.994
Protocol for a scoping review of multi-omic analysis for rare diseases,"Introduction:The development of next generation sequencing technology has enabled cost-efficient, large scale, multiple 'omic' analysis, including epigenomic, genomic, metabolomic, phenomic, proteomic and transcriptomic research. These integrated approaches hold significant promise for rare disease research, with the potential to aid biomarker discovery, improve our understanding of disease pathogenesis and identify novel therapeutic targets. In this paper we outline a systematic approach for a scoping review designed to evaluate what primary research has been performed to date on multi-omics and rare disease.Methods and analysis:This protocol was designed using the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology for scoping reviews. Databases to be searched will include: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus and Google Scholar for primary studies relevant to the key terms 'multi-omics' and 'rare disease', published prior to 30thDecember 2018. Grey literature databases GreyLit and OpenGrey will also be searched, as well as reverse citation screening of relevant articles and forward citation searching using Web of Science Cited Reference Search Tool. Data extraction will be performed using customised forms and a narrative synthesis of the results will be presented.Ethics and dissemination:As a secondary analysis study with no primary data generated, this scoping review does not require ethical approval. We anticipate this review will highlight a gap in rare disease research and provide direction for novel research. The completed review will be submitted for publication in peer-reviewed journals and presented at relevant conferences discussing rare disease research and/or molecular strategies.",31061034,PMC6501961,10.1136/bmjopen-2018-026278,2,BMJ open,101552874,3.006
Molecular insights into sex-specific metabolic alterations in Alzheimer's mouse brain using multi-omics approach,"Background:Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by altered cellular metabolism in the brain. Several of these alterations have been found to be exacerbated in females, known to be disproportionately affected by AD. We aimed to unravel metabolic alterations in AD at the metabolic pathway level and evaluate whether they are sex-specific through integrative metabolomic, lipidomic, and proteomic analysis of mouse brain tissue.Methods:We analyzed male and female triple-transgenic mouse whole brain tissue by untargeted mass spectrometry-based methods to obtain a molecular signature consisting of polar metabolite, complex lipid, and protein data. These data were analyzed using multi-omics factor analysis. Pathway-level alterations were identified through joint pathway enrichment analysis or by separately evaluating lipid ontology and known proteins related to lipid metabolism.Results:Our analysis revealed significant AD-associated and in part sex-specific alterations across the molecular signature. Sex-dependent alterations were identified in GABA synthesis, arginine biosynthesis, and in alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism. AD-associated alterations involving lipids were also found in the fatty acid elongation pathway and lysophospholipid metabolism, with a significant sex-specific effect for the latter.Conclusions:Through multi-omics analysis, we report AD-associated and sex-specific metabolic alterations in the AD brain involving lysophospholipid and amino acid metabolism. These findings contribute to the characterization of the AD phenotype at the molecular level while considering the effect of sex, an overlooked yet determinant metabolic variable.",36624525,PMC9827669,10.1186/s13195-023-01162-4,2,Alzheimer's research & therapy,101511643,8.823
An unsupervised learning approach to identify novel signatures of health and disease from multimodal data,"Background:Modern medicine is rapidly moving towards a data-driven paradigm based on comprehensive multimodal health assessments. Integrated analysis of data from different modalities has the potential of uncovering novel biomarkers and disease signatures.Methods:We collected 1385 data features from diverse modalities, including metabolome, microbiome, genetics, and advanced imaging, from 1253 individuals and from a longitudinal validation cohort of 1083 individuals. We utilized a combination of unsupervised machine learning methods to identify multimodal biomarker signatures of health and disease risk.Results:Our method identified a set of cardiometabolic biomarkers that goes beyond standard clinical biomarkers. Stratification of individuals based on the signatures of these biomarkers identified distinct subsets of individuals with similar health statuses. Subset membership was a better predictor for diabetes than established clinical biomarkers such as glucose, insulin resistance, and body mass index. The novel biomarkers in the diabetes signature included 1-stearoyl-2-dihomo-linolenoyl-GPC and 1-(1-enyl-palmitoyl)-2-oleoyl-GPC. Another metabolite, cinnamoylglycine, was identified as a potential biomarker for both gut microbiome health and lean mass percentage. We identified potential early signatures for hypertension and a poor metabolic health outcome. Additionally, we found novel associations between a uremic toxin, p-cresol sulfate, and the abundance of the microbiome genera Intestinimonas and an unclassified genus in the Erysipelotrichaceae family.Conclusions:Our methodology and results demonstrate the potential of multimodal data integration, from the identification of novel biomarker signatures to a data-driven stratification of individuals into disease subtypes and stages-an essential step towards personalized, preventative health risk assessment.",31924279,PMC6953286,10.1186/s13073-019-0705-z,18,Genome medicine,101475844,15.266
HyperTMO: a trusted multi-omics integration framework based on hypergraph convolutional network for patient classification,"Motivation:The rapid development of high-throughput biomedical technologies can provide researchers with detailed multi-omics data. The multi-omics integrated analysis approach based on machine learning contributes a more comprehensive perspective to human disease research. However, there are still significant challenges in representing single-omics data and integrating multi-omics information.Results:This article presents HyperTMO, a Trusted Multi-Omics integration framework based on Hypergraph convolutional network for patient classification. HyperTMO constructs hypergraph structures to represent the association between samples in single-omics data, then evidence extraction is performed by hypergraph convolutional network, and multi-omics information is integrated at an evidence level. Last, we experimentally demonstrate that HyperTMO outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in breast cancer subtype classification and Alzheimer's disease classification tasks using multi-omics data from TCGA (BRCA) and ROSMAP datasets. Importantly, HyperTMO is the first attempt to integrate hypergraph structure, evidence theory, and multi-omics integration for patient classification. Its accurate and robust properties bring great potential for applications in clinical diagnosis.Availability and implementation:HyperTMO and datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/ippousyuga/HyperTMO.",38530977,,10.1093/bioinformatics/btae159,0,"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",9808944,6.931
Learning Consistency and Specificity of Cells From Single-Cell Multi-Omic Data,"Advancements in single-cell technologies concomitantly develop the epigenomic and transcriptomic profiles at the cell levels, providing opportunities to explore the potential biological mechanisms. Even though significant efforts have been dedicated to them, it remains challenging for the integration analysis of multi-omic data of single-cell because of the heterogeneity, complicated coupling and interpretability of data. To handle these issues, we propose a novel self-representation Learning-based Multi-omics data Integrative Clustering algorithm (sLMIC) for the integration of single-cell epigenomic profiles (DNA methylation or scATAC-seq) and transcriptomic (scRNA-seq), which the consistent and specific features of cells are explicitly extracted facilitating the cell clustering. Specifically, sLMIC constructs a graph for each type of single-cell data, thereby transforming omics data into multi-layer networks, which effectively removes heterogeneity of omic data. Then, sLMIC employs the low-rank and exclusivity constraints to separate the self-representation of cells into two parts, i.e., the shared and specific features, which explicitly characterize the consistency and diversity of omic data, providing an effective strategy to model the structure of cell types. Feature extraction and cell clustering are jointly formulated as an overall objective function, where latent features of data are obtained under the guidance of cell clustering. The extensive experimental results on 13 multi-omics datasets of single-cell from diverse organisms and tissues indicate that sLMIC observably exceeds the advanced algorithms regarding various measurements.",38709615,,10.1109/JBHI.2024.3370868,0,IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics,101604520,7.021
Integrated Omics Reveal the Molecular Characterization and Pathogenic Mechanism of Rosacea,"Recent efforts have described the transcriptomic landscape of rosacea. However, little is known about its proteomic characteristics. In this study, the proteome and phosphoproteome of lesional skin, paired nonlesional skin, and healthy skin were analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. The molecular characteristics and potential pathogenic mechanism of rosacea were demonstrated by integrating the proteome, phosphoproteome, and previous transcriptome. The proteomic data revealed a significant upregulation of inflammation- and axon extension-related proteins in lesional skin and nonlesional skin versus in healthy skin, implying an inflammatory and nerve-hypersensitive microenvironment in rosacea skin. Of these, axon-related proteins (DPYSL2 and DBNL) were correlated with the Clinician's Erythema Assessment score, and neutrophil-related proteins (ELANE and S100A family) were correlated with the Investigator's Global Assessment score. Moreover, comorbidity-related proteins were differentially expressed in rosacea; of these, SNCA was positively correlated with Clinician's Erythema Assessment score, implying a potential correlation between rosacea and comorbidities. Subsequently, the integrated proteome and transcriptome demonstrated consistent immune disturbances at both the transcriptional and protein levels. The integrative analysis of the proteome and phosphoproteome revealed the key transcription factor network and kinase network that drive the dysregulation of immunity and vasculature in rosacea. In conclusion, our multiomics analysis enables more comprehensive insight into rosacea and offers an opportunity for, to our knowledge, previously unreported treatment strategies.",37437773,,10.1016/j.jid.2023.05.028,2,The Journal of investigative dermatology,426720,7.59
Multi-omics characterization of synthetic lethality-related molecular features: implications for SL-based therapeutic target screening,"Synthetic lethality (SL) represents the co-occurrence of two or more non-lethal disordered genes that could lead to cell death. SL-based anticancer therapeutics could specifically kill the cancer cells carrying the targeted mutated gene while leaving normal cells alive. Recent large-scale computational and experimental screenings provide rich resources of SL information while lacking systematic research on molecular features of SL genes. Combined with comprehensive multi-omics data analysis and experimental validation of one SL gene pair, Guo et al. portrayed a systematic layout of cancer-specific SL interactions that could improve understanding of carcinogenesis and potentially assist the subsequent screening of anticancer therapeutic targets.",36461713,,10.1111/febs.16692,1,The FEBS journal,101229646,5.622
