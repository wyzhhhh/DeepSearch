31042697,Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of Alzheimer's disease.,10.1038/s41586-019-1195-2,"Alzheimer's disease is a pervasive neurodegenerative disorder, the molecular        complexity of which remains poorly understood. Here, we analysed 80,660        single-nucleus transcriptomes from the prefrontal cortex of 48 individuals with        varying degrees of Alzheimer's disease pathology. Across six major brain cell        types, we identified transcriptionally distinct subpopulations, including those        associated with pathology and characterized by regulators of myelination,        inflammation, and neuron survival. The strongest disease-associated changes        appeared early in pathological progression and were highly cell-type specific,        whereas genes upregulated at late stages were common across cell types and        primarily involved in the global stress response. Notably, we found that female        cells were overrepresented in disease-associated subpopulations, and that        transcriptional responses were substantially different between sexes in several        cell types, including oligodendrocytes. Overall, myelination-related processes        were recurrently perturbed in multiple cell types, suggesting that myelination        has a key role in Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology. Our single-cell        transcriptomic resource provides a blueprint for interrogating the molecular and        cellular basis of Alzheimer's disease.",PMC6865822,Nature,0410462

A total of 1,130,767 nuclei per cells from 149 adult        postmortem brains and 72 organoid samples were used. The results showed the best        performance of dtangle for estimating cell proportions and bMIND for estimating        sample-wise cell-type gene expressions. For eight brain cell types, 25,273        cell-type eQTLs were identified with deconvoluted expressions (decon-eQTLs). The        results showed that decon-eQTLs explained more schizophrenia GWAS heritability        than bulk tissue or single-cell eQTLs did alone. Differential gene expressions        associated with Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and brain development were        also examined using the deconvoluted data. Our findings, which were replicated in        bulk tissue and single-cell data, provided insights into the biological        applications of deconvoluted data in multiple brain disorders.",PMC11114236,Science advances,101653440

However, we still lack        consensus on a more foundational question: whether quantitative shifts in cell        types-the functional unit of life-contribute to neuropsychiatric disorders.        Leveraging advances in human brain single-cell methylomics, we deconvolve seven        major cell types using bulk DNA methylation profiling across 1270 postmortem        brains, including from individuals diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease,        schizophrenia, and autism. We observe and replicate cell-type compositional        shifts for Alzheimer's disease (endothelial cell loss), autism (increased        microglia), and schizophrenia (decreased oligodendrocytes), and find age- and        sex-related changes. Multiple layers of evidence indicate that endothelial cell        loss contributes to Alzheimer's disease, with comparable effect size to APOE        genotype among older people. Genome-wide association identified five genetic loci        related to cell-type composition, involving plausible genes for the neurovascular        unit (P2RX5 and TRPV3) and excitatory neurons (DPY30 and MEMO1).

AD is characterized        by neuronal loss, the classic feature of the disease that underlies brain        atrophy. However, GWAS reports and recent single-nucleus RNA sequencing        (snRNA-seq) efforts have highlighted that glial cells, particularly microglia,        claim a central role in AD pathophysiology. Here, we tailor pattern-learning        algorithms to explore distinct gene programs by integrating the entire        transcriptome, yielding distributed AD-predictive modules within the brain's        major cell-types. We show that these learned modules are biologically meaningful        through the identification of new and relevant enriched signaling cascades. The        predictive nature of our modules, especially in microglia, allows us to infer        each subject's progression along a disease pseudo-trajectory, confirmed by        post-mortem pathological brain tissue markers. Additionally, we quantify the        interplay between pairs of cell-type modules in the AD brain, and localized known        AD risk genes to enriched module gene programs.

The recent single-cell        sequencing technology has revolutionized genetic and genomic resolution by        enabling scientists to explore the diversity of gene expression patterns at the        finest resolution. Most existing studies have solely focused on molecular        perturbations within each cell, but cells live in microenvironments rather than        in isolated entities. Here, we leveraged the large-scale and publicly available        single-nucleus RNA sequencing in the human prefrontal cortex to investigate        cell-to-cell communication in healthy brains and their perturbations in AD. We        uniformly processed the snRNA-seq with strict QCs and labeled canonical cell        types consistent with the definitions from the BRAIN Initiative Cell Census        Network. From ligand and receptor gene expression, we built a high-confidence        cell-to-cell communication network to investigate signaling differences between        AD and healthy brains. RESULTS: Specifically, we first performed broad        communication pattern analyses to highlight that biologically related cell types        in normal brains rely on largely overlapping signaling networks and that the AD        brain exhibits the irregular inter-mixing of cell types and signaling pathways.        Secondly, we performed a more focused cell-type-centric analysis and found that        excitatory neurons in AD have significantly increased their communications to        inhibitory neurons, while inhibitory neurons and other non-neuronal cells        globally decreased theirs to all cells. Then, we delved deeper with a        signaling-centric view, showing that canonical signaling pathways CSF, TGFβ, and        CX3C are significantly dysregulated in their signaling to the cell type        microglia/PVM and from endothelial to neuronal cells for the WNT pathway.        Finally, after extracting 23 known AD risk genes, our intracellular communication        analysis revealed a strong connection of extracellular ligand genes APP, APOE,        and PSEN1 to intracellular AD risk genes TREM2, ABCA1, and APP in the        communication from astrocytes and microglia to neurons. CONCLUSIONS: In summary,        with the novel advances in single-cell sequencing technologies, we show that        cellular signaling is regulated in a cell-type-specific manner and that improper        regulation of extracellular signaling genes is linked to intracellular risk        genes, giving the mechanistic intra- and inter-cellular picture of AD.",PMC11089696,BMC neuroscience,100966986
38740758,Reduction of spermine synthase enhances autophagy to suppress Tau accumulation.,10.1038/s41419-024-06720-8,"Precise polyamine metabolism regulation is vital for cells and organisms.        Mutations in spermine synthase (SMS) cause Snyder-Robinson intellectual        disability syndrome (SRS), characterized by significant spermidine accumulation        and autophagy blockage in the nervous system. Emerging evidence connects        polyamine metabolism with other autophagy-related diseases, such as Tauopathy,        however, the functional intersection between polyamine metabolism and autophagy        in the context of these diseases remains unclear. Here, we altered SMS expression        level to investigate the regulation of autophagy by modulated polyamine        metabolism in Tauopathy in Drosophila and human cellular models. Interestingly,        while complete loss of Drosophila spermine synthase (dSms) impairs lysosomal        function and blocks autophagic flux recapitulating SRS disease phenotype, partial        loss of dSms enhanced autophagic flux, reduced Tau protein accumulation, and led        to extended lifespan and improved climbing performance in Tauopathy flies.        Measurement of polyamine levels detected a mild elevation of spermidine in flies        with partial loss of dSms. Similarly, in human neuronal or glial cells, partial        loss of SMS by siRNA-mediated knockdown upregulated autophagic flux and reduced        Tau protein accumulation. Importantly, proteomics analysis of postmortem brain        tissue from Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients showed a significant albeit modest        elevation of SMS level. Taken together, our study uncovers a functional        correlation between polyamine metabolism and autophagy in AD: SMS reduction        upregulates autophagy, suppresses Tau accumulation, and ameliorates        neurodegeneration and cell death. These findings provide a new potential        therapeutic target for AD.",PMC11091227,Cell death & disease,101524092
38715083,Promoting Alzheimer's disease research and therapy with stem cell technology.,10.1186/s13287-024-03737-w,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent form of dementia leading to        memory loss, reduced cognitive and linguistic abilities, and decreased self-care.        Current AD treatments aim to relieve symptoms and slow disease progression, but a        cure is elusive due to limited understanding of the underlying disease        mechanisms. MAIN CONTENT: Stem cell technology has the potential to revolutionize        AD research. With the ability to self-renew and differentiate into various cell        types, stem cells are valuable tools for disease modeling, drug screening, and        cell therapy. Recent advances have broadened our understanding beyond the        deposition of amyloidβ (Aβ) or tau proteins in AD to encompass risk genes, immune        system disorders, and neuron-glia mis-communication, relying heavily on stem        cell-derived disease models. These stem cell-based models (e.g., organoids and        microfluidic chips) simulate in vivo pathological processes with extraordinary        spatial and temporal resolution. Stem cell technologies have the potential to        alleviate AD pathology through various pathways, including immunomodulation,        replacement of damaged neurons, and neurotrophic support. In recent years,        transplantation of glial cells like oligodendrocytes and the infusion of exosomes        have become hot research topics. CONCLUSION: Although stem cell-based models and        therapies for AD face several challenges, such as extended culture time and low        differentiation efficiency, they still show considerable potential for AD        treatment and are likely to become preferred tools for AD research.",PMC11077895,Stem cell research & therapy,101527581

To maintain network stability in the face of        altered synaptic activity, neurons engage a feedback mechanism termed homeostatic        scaling; however, this process is thought to be disrupted during disease        progression. Previous proteomics studies have shown that one of the most highly        regulated proteins in cell culture models of homeostatic scaling is the small        secretory chaperone proSAAS. Our prior work has shown that proSAAS exhibits        anti-aggregant behavior against alpha synuclein and β-amyloid fibrillation in        vitro, and is upregulated in cell models of proteostatic stress. However, the        specific role that this protein might play in homeostatic scaling, and its        anti-aggregant role in Alzheimer's progression, is not clear. To learn more about        the role of proSAAS in maintaining hippocampal proteostasis, we compared its        expression in a primary neuron model of homeostatic scaling to other synaptic        components using Western blotting and qPCR, revealing that proSAAS protein        responses to homeostatic up- and down-regulation were significantly higher than        those of two other synaptic vesicle components, 7B2 and carboxypeptidase E.        However, proSAAS mRNA expression was static, suggesting translational control        (and/or reduced degradation). ProSAAS was readily released upon depolarization of        differentiated hippocampal cultures, supporting its synaptic localization.        Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated abundant proSAAS within the mossy fiber        layer of the hippocampus in both wild-type and 5xFAD mice; in the latter, proSAAS        was also concentrated around amyloid plaques. Interestingly, overexpression of        proSAAS in the CA1 region via stereotaxic injection of proSAAS-encoding AAV2/1        significantly decreased amyloid plaque burden in 5xFAD mice. We hypothesize that        dynamic changes in proSAAS expression play a critical role in hippocampal        proteostatic processes, both in the context of normal homeostatic plasticity and        in the control of protein aggregation during Alzheimer's disease progression.",PMC11071301,bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology,101680187

A major goal in AD research is to identify new        therapeutic pathways by studying the molecular and cellular changes in the        disease, either downstream or upstream of the pathological hallmarks. In this        study, we present a comprehensive investigation of cellular heterogeneity from        the temporal cortex region of 40 individuals, comprising healthy donors and        individuals with differing tau and amyloid burden. Using single-nucleus        transcriptome analysis of 430,271 nuclei from both gray and white matter of these        individuals, we identified cell type-specific subclusters in both neuronal and        glial cell types with varying degrees of association with AD pathology. In        particular, these associations are present in layer specific glutamatergic        (excitatory) neuronal types, along with GABAergic (inhibitory) neurons and glial        subtypes. These associations were observed in early as well as late pathological        progression. We extended this analysis by performing multiplexed in situ        hybridization using the CARTANA platform, capturing 155 genes in 13 individuals        with varying levels of tau pathology. By modeling the spatial distribution of        these genes and their associations with the pathology, we not only replicated key        findings from our snRNA data analysis, but also identified a set of cell        type-specific genes that show selective enrichment or depletion near pathological        inclusions.

Single-cell RNA sequencing        (scRNA-seq) enables high-resolution identification of cells and exploration of        cell heterogeneity, shedding light on cell differentiation/maturation and        functional differences. Recent advancements in multimodal sequencing technologies        have focused on improving access to cell-specific subgroups for functional        genomics analysis. To facilitate the functional annotation of cell groups and        characterization of molecular mechanisms underlying cell trajectories, we        introduce the Pathways, Annotated Gene Lists, and Gene Signatures Electronic        Repository for Single-Cell Functional Genomics Analysis (PAGER-scFGA). Results:        We have developed PAGER-scFGA, which integrates cell functional annotations and        gene-set enrichment analysis into popular single-cell analysis pipelines such as        Scanpy. Using differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from pairwise cell clusters,        PAGER-scFGA infers cell functions through the enrichment of potential cell-marker        genesets. Moreover, PAGER-scFGA provides pathways, annotated gene lists, and gene        signatures (PAGs) enriched in specific cell subsets with tissue compositions and        continuous transitions along cell trajectories. Additionally, PAGER-scFGA enables        the construction of a gene subcellular map based on DEGs and allows examination        of the gene functional compartments (GFCs) underlying cell        maturation/differentiation. In a real-world case study of mouse natural killer        (mNK) cells, PAGER-scFGA revealed two major stages of natural killer (NK) cells        and three trajectories from the precursor stage to NK T-like mature stage within        blood, spleen, and bone marrow tissues. As the trajectories progress to later        stages, the DEGs exhibit greater divergence and variability. However, the DEGs in        different trajectories still interact within a network during NK cell maturation.        Notably, PAGER-scFGA unveiled cell cytotoxicity, exocytosis, and the response to        interleukin (IL) signaling pathways and associated network models during the        progression from precursor NK cells to mature NK cells. Conclusion: PAGER-scFGA        enables in-depth exploration of functional insights and presents a comprehensive        knowledge map of gene networks and GFCs, which can be utilized for future studies        and hypothesis generation.

Because of the rare existence and random localization of these cells        in the brain, their molecular profiles and disease-specific heterogeneities        remain unclear. Through a bioinformatics approach that allows integrated analyses        of multiple single-nucleus transcriptome datasets from human brain samples, these        rare cell populations were identified and selected for further characterization.        Our analyses indicated that these cell cycle-related events occur predominantly        in excitatory neurons and that cellular senescence is likely their immediate        terminal fate. Quantitatively, the number of cell cycle re-engaging and senescent        neurons decreased during the normal brain aging process, but in the context of        late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), these cells accumulate instead.        Transcriptomic profiling of these cells suggested that disease-specific        differences were predominantly tied to the early stage of the senescence process,        revealing that these cells presented more proinflammatory, metabolically        deregulated, and pathology-associated signatures in disease-affected brains.        Similarly, these general features of cell cycle re-engaging neurons were also        observed in a subpopulation of dopaminergic neurons identified in the Parkinson's        disease (PD)-Lewy body dementia (LBD) model.

Moreover,        synaptic loss correlates with a decline in cognitive function, providing an        opportunity to investigate therapeutic strategies to target synapses and synaptic        tau to rescue or prevent cognitive decline in AD. One of the promising synaptic        targets is the 5-HT4 serotonergic receptor present postsynaptically in the brain        structures involved in the memory processes. 5-HT4R stimulation exerts        synaptogenic and pro-cognitive effects involving synapse-to-nucleus signaling        essential for synaptic plasticity. However, it is not known whether 5-HT4R        activation has a therapeutic effect on tau pathology. METHODS: The goal of this        study was to investigate the impact of chronic stimulation of 5-HT4R by two        agonists, prucalopride and RS-67333, in PS19 mice, a model of tauopathy. We        utilized gradient assays to isolate pre- and post-synaptic compartments, followed        by biochemical analyses for tau species and ubiquitinated proteins in the        synaptic compartments and total brain tissue. Next, we performed kinetic assays        to test the proteasome's hydrolysis capacity in treatment conditions. Moreover,        behavioral tests such as the open field and non-maternal nest-building tests were        used to evaluate anxiety-like behaviors and hippocampal-related cognitive        functioning in the treatment paradigm. RESULTS: Our results show that 5-HT4R        agonism reduced tauopathy, reduced synaptic tau, increased proteasome activity,        and improved cognitive functioning in PS19 mice. Our data suggest that enhanced        proteasome activity by synaptic mediated signaling leads to the enhanced turnover        of tau initially within synapses where the receptors are localized, and over        time, the treatment attenuated the accumulation of tau aggregation and improved        cognitive functioning of the PS19 mice. CONCLUSION: Therefore, stimulation of        5-HT4R offers a promising therapy to rescue synapses from the accumulation of        toxic synaptic tau, evident in the early stages of AD.",PMC11024353,Frontiers in cellular neuroscience,101477935

Since neuroinflammation is a        known key element in the pathogenesis of COVID-19, one might expect the        dysregulation of microglial function to severely impact both functional and        structural plasticity, leading to the cognitive sequelae that appear in the        pathogenesis of Long COVID.

Elderly cognitively healthy individuals        with APOEε4 also exist, suggesting the presence of cellular mechanisms that        counteract the pathological effects of APOEε4; however, these mechanisms are        unknown. We hypothesized that APOEε4 carriers without dementia might carry        genetic variations that could protect them from developing APOEε4-mediated AD        pathology. To test this, we leveraged whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data in the        National Institute on Aging Alzheimer's Disease Family Based Study (NIA-AD FBS),        Washington Heights/Inwood Columbia Aging Project (WHICAP), and Estudio Familiar        de Influencia Genetica en Alzheimer (EFIGA) cohorts and identified potentially        protective variants segregating exclusively among unaffected APOEε4 carriers. In        homozygous unaffected carriers above 70 years old, we identified 510 rare coding        variants. Pathway analysis of the genes harboring these variants showed        significant enrichment in extracellular matrix (ECM)-related processes,        suggesting protective effects of functional modifications in ECM proteins. We        prioritized two genes that were highly represented in the ECM-related gene        ontology terms, (FN1) and collagen type VI alpha 2 chain (COL6A2) and are known        to be expressed at the blood-brain barrier (BBB), for postmortem validation and        in vivo functional studies. An independent analysis in a large cohort of 7185        APOEε4 homozygous carriers found that rs140926439 variant in FN1 was protective        of AD (OR = 0.29; 95% CI [0.11, 0.78], P = 0.014) and delayed age at onset of        disease by 3.37 years (95% CI [0.42, 6.32], P = 0.025). The FN1 and COL6A2        protein levels were increased at the BBB in APOEε4 carriers with AD. Brain        expression of cognitively unaffected homozygous APOEε4 carriers had significantly        lower FN1 deposition and less reactive gliosis compared to homozygous APOEε4        carriers with AD, suggesting that FN1 might be a downstream driver of        APOEε4-mediated AD-related pathology and cognitive decline. To validate our        findings, we used zebrafish models with loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in        fn1b-the ortholog for human FN1. We found that fibronectin LOF reduced gliosis,        enhanced gliovascular remodeling, and potentiated the microglial response,        suggesting that pathological accumulation of FN1 could impair toxic protein        clearance, which is ameliorated with FN1 LOF. Our study suggests that vascular        deposition of FN1 is related to the pathogenicity of APOEε4, and LOF variants in        FN1 may reduce APOEε4-related AD risk, providing novel clues to potential        therapeutic interventions targeting the ECM to mitigate AD risk.",PMC11006751,Acta neuropathologica,0412041

Understanding        the cellular diversity and molecular variations underlying these functions holds        promise for developing novel therapeutics, with specific emphasis on the        neuromuscular system's functional diversity. The nematode intestine, crucial for        anthelmintic therapies, exhibits diverse cellular phenotypes, and unraveling this        diversity at the single-cell level is essential for advancing knowledge in        anthelmintic research across various organ systems. RESULTS: Here, using novel        single-cell transcriptomics datasets, we delineate cellular diversity within the        intestine of adult female Ascaris suum, a parasitic nematode species that infects        animals and people. Gene transcripts expressed in individual nuclei of untreated        intestinal cells resolved three phenotypic clusters, while lower stringency        resolved additional subclusters and more potential diversity. Clusters 1 and 3        phenotypes displayed variable congruence with scRNA phenotypes of C. elegans        intestinal cells, whereas the A. suum cluster 2 phenotype was markedly unique.        Distinct functional pathway enrichment characterized each A. suum intestinal cell        cluster. Cluster 2 was distinctly enriched for Clade III-associated genes,        suggesting it evolved within clade III nematodes. Clusters also demonstrated        differential transcriptional responsiveness to nematode intestinal toxic        treatments, with Cluster 2 displaying the least responses to short-term        intra-pseudocoelomic nematode intestinal toxin treatments. CONCLUSIONS: This        investigation presents advances in knowledge related to biological differences        among major cell populations of adult A. suum intestinal cells.

Using antemortem assessments        of BPSD in AD, we demonstrate that individual BPSD can be grouped into 4 domain        factors in our cohort: affective, apathy, agitation, and psychosis. Then, we        performed a transcriptome-wide analysis for each domain utilizing bulk RNA-seq of        post-mortem anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) tissues. Though all 4 domains are        associated with a predominantly downregulated pattern of hundreds of        differentially expressed genes (DEGs), most DEGs are unique to each domain, with        only 22 DEGs being common to all BPSD domains, including TIMP1. Weighted gene        co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) yielded multiple transcriptional modules        that were shared between BPSD domains or unique to each domain, and NetDecoder        was used to analyze context-dependent information flow through the biological        network. For the agitation domain, we found that all DEGs and a highly associated        transcriptional module were functionally enriched for ECM-related genes including        TIMP1, TAGLN, and FLNA. Another unique transcriptional module also associated        with the agitation domain was enriched with genes involved in post-synaptic        signaling, including DRD1, PDE1B, CAMK4, and GABRA4. By comparing        context-dependent changes in DEGs between cases and control networks, ESR1 and        PARK2 were implicated as two high-impact genes associated with agitation that        mediated significant information flow through the biological network.

WM changes have overwhelmingly been investigated in typical, amnestic        mild cognitive impairment and AD; fewer studies have addressed WM change in        atypical, non-amnestic syndromes. We hypothesized each non-amnestic AD syndrome        would exhibit WM differences from amnestic and other non-amnestic syndromes.        MATERIALS AND METHODS: Participants included 45 cognitively normal (CN)        individuals; 41 amnestic AD patients; and 67 patients with non-amnestic AD        syndromes including logopenic-variant primary progressive aphasia (lvPPA, n        = 32), posterior cortical atrophy (PCA, n = 17), behavioral variant AD (bvAD, n        = 10), and corticobasal syndrome (CBS, n = 8). All had T1-weighted MRI and        30-direction diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). We performed whole-brain        deterministic tractography between 148 cortical and subcortical regions;        connection strength was quantified by tractwise mean generalized fractional        anisotropy. Regression models assessed effects of group and phenotype as well as        associations with grey matter volume. Topological analyses assessed differences        in persistent homology (numbers of graph components and cycles). Additionally, we        tested associations of topological metrics with global cognition, disease        duration, and DWI microstructural metrics. RESULTS: Both amnestic and        non-amnestic patients exhibited lower WM connection strength than CN participants        in corpus callosum, cingulum, and inferior and superior longitudinal fasciculi.        Overall, non-amnestic patients had more WM disease than amnestic patients. LvPPA        patients had left-lateralized WM degeneration; PCA patients had reductions in        connections to bilateral posterior parietal, occipital, and temporal areas.        Topological analysis showed the non-amnestic but not the amnestic group had more        connected components than controls, indicating persistently lower connectivity.        Longer disease duration and cognitive impairment were associated with more        connected components and fewer cycles in individuals' brain graphs. DISCUSSION:        We have previously reported syndromic differences in GM degeneration and tau        accumulation between AD syndromes; here we find corresponding differences in WM        tracts connecting syndrome-specific epicenters. Determining the reasons for        selective WM degeneration in non-amnestic AD is a research priority that will        require integration of knowledge from neuroimaging, biomarker, autopsy, and        functional genetic studies. Furthermore, longitudinal studies to determine the        chronology of WM vs. GM degeneration will be key to assessing evidence for        WM-mediated tau spread.",PMC10986184,Frontiers in neuroscience,101478481

The transcriptomic profiling of these        populations has led to the subclassification of specific disease-associated        microglia and microglia clusters in neurodegenerative diseases. A common profile        includes the downregulation of homeostasis and the upregulation of inflammatory        markers. Furthermore, there is concordance in few clusters between murine and        human samples. Apolipoprotein E, which has long been considered a high-risk        factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease, is strongly regulated in both these        murine and human clusters. Transforming growth factor-β plays an essential role        during the development and maturation of microglia. In a pathological state, it        attenuates their activation and is involved in numerous cell regulatory        processes. Transforming growth factor-β also has an influence on the deposition        of amyloid-beta, as it is involved in the regulation of key proteins and        molecules.

RNA velocity captures        the rate of change of gene expression by comparing intronic and exonic sequence        counts. We performed differential analyses to find the significant genes driving        both cell type-specific RNA velocity and expression differences in AD,        extensively compared these two transcriptomic metrics, and clarified their        associations with multiple neuropathologic traits. The results were        cross-validated in an independent dataset. Comparison of AD pathology-associated        RNA velocity with parallel gene expression differences reveals sets of genes and        molecular pathways that underlie the dynamic and static regimes of cell        type-specific dysregulations underlying the disease. Differential RNA velocity        and its linked progressive neuropathology point to significant dysregulations in        synaptic organization and cell development across cell types.

In addition, MSUT2 regulates many gene transcripts, including the        Adenosine Receptor 1 (A1AR), and we show that down regulation or inhibition of        A1AR modulates the activity of the ""ArfGAP with SH3 Domain, Ankyrin Repeat, and        PH Domain 1 protein"" (ASAP1), thereby influencing the internalization of        pathogenic tau seeds into neurons resulting in reduction of tau pathology.",PMC10933148,Acta neuropathologica,0412041

Single        loops do not predict expression changes; however, the severity and direction of        change in mRNA levels and single-cell burst frequency strongly correlate with the        number of FAD-gained or -lost promoter-enhancer loops. Classic architectural        proteins CTCF and cohesin do not change occupancy in FAD-mutant neurons. Instead,        we unexpectedly find TAATTA motifs amenable to binding by DLX homeodomain        transcription factors and changing noncoding RNAPolII signal at FAD-dynamic        promoter-enhancer loops.

By examining cell type-specific and cell type-agnostic AD-related        gene activity changes and their sex-dimorphism for individual genes, pathways and        cellular sub-networks, we identified both statistically significant alterations        and interpreted the upstream mechanisms controlling them. Our results confirm        several significant sex-dependent alterations in gene activity in the THY-Tau22        model mice compared to controls, with more pronounced alterations in females.        Both changes shared across multiple cell types and cell type-specific changes        were observed. The differential genes showed significant over-representation of        known AD-relevant processes, such as pathways associated with neuronal        differentiation, programmed cell death and inflammatory responses. Regulatory        network analysis of these genes revealed upstream regulators that modulate many        of the downstream targets with sex-dependent changes.

AD pathology involves        protein acetylation. Previous studies have mainly focused on histone acetylation        in AD, however, the roles of nonhistone acetylation in AD are less explored.        METHODS: The protein acetylation and expression levels were detected by western        blotting and co-immunoprecipitation. The stoichiometry of acetylation was        measured by home-made and site-specific antibodies against acetylated-CaM        (Ac-CaM) at K22, K95, and K116. Hippocampus-dependent learning and memory were        evaluated by using the Morris water maze, novel object recognition, and        contextual fear conditioning tests. RESULTS: We showed that calmodulin (CaM)        acetylation is reduced in plasma of AD patients and mice. CaM acetylation and its        target Ca(2+) /CaM-dependent kinase II α (CaMKIIα) activity were severely        impaired in AD mouse brain. The stoichiometry showed that Ac-K22, K95-CaM        acetylation were decreased in AD patients and mice. Moreover, we screened and        identified that lysine deacetylase 9 (HDAC9) was the main deacetylase for CaM.

Computational methods for deconvolution have been developed and        benchmarked against simulated data, pseudobulked sc/snRNA-seq data, or        immunohistochemistry reference data. A major limitation in developing improved        deconvolution algorithms has been the lack of integrated datasets with orthogonal        measurements of gene expression and estimates of cell type proportions on the        same tissue sample. Deconvolution algorithm performance has not yet been        evaluated across different RNA extraction methods (cytosolic, nuclear, or whole        cell RNA), different library preparation types (mRNA enrichment vs. ribosomal RNA        depletion), or with matched single cell reference datasets.

The importance of mitochondrial dysfunction in AD        pathogenesis, while previously underrecognized, is now more and more appreciated.        Mitochondria are an essential organelle involved in cellular bioenergetics and        signaling pathways. Mitochondrial processes crucial for synaptic activity such as        mitophagy, mitochondrial trafficking, mitochondrial fission, and mitochondrial        fusion are dysregulated in the AD brain.

Nonetheless,        early studies argued that single-nucleus analysis yielded results comparable to        cellular samples if pre-mRNA measurements were included. However, typical        workflows do not distinguish between pre-mRNA and mRNA when estimating gene        expression, and variation in their relative abundances across cell types has        received limited attention. These gaps are especially important given that        incorporating pre-mRNA has become commonplace for both assays, despite known gene        length bias in pre-mRNA capture.

Using single nuclei RNA-sequencing, we        identified both canonical (e.g., dopamine receptor subtype) and less abundant        cell populations (e.g., interneurons) in human dorsal striatum. Pathways related        to neurodegeneration, interferon response, and DNA damage were significantly        enriched in striatal neurons of individuals with OUD. DNA damage markers were        also elevated in striatal neurons of opioid-exposed rhesus macaques. Sex-specific        molecular differences in glial cell subtypes associated with chronic stress were        found in OUD, particularly female individuals. Together, we describe different        cell types in human dorsal striatum and identify cell type-specific alterations        in OUD.",PMC10831093,Nature communications,101528555

Especially the extent of m(1)A mRNA methylation is highly        discussed due to methodological differences. However, one single m(1)A site in        mitochondrial ND5 mRNA was unanimously reported by different groups. ND5 is a        subunit of complex I of the respiratory chain. It is considered essential for the        coupling of oxidation and proton transport. Here we demonstrate that this m(1)A        site might be involved in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). One of        the pathological hallmarks of this neurodegenerative disease is mitochondrial        dysfunction, mainly induced by Amyloid β (Aβ). Aβ mainly disturbs functions of        complex I and IV of the respiratory chain. However, the molecular mechanism of        complex I dysfunction is still not fully understood. We found enhanced m(1)A        methylation of ND5 mRNA in an AD cell model as well as in AD patients. Formation        of this m(1)A methylation is catalyzed by increased TRMT10C protein levels,        leading to translation repression of ND5. As a consequence, here demonstrated for        the first time, TRMT10C induced m(1)A methylation of ND5 mRNA leads to        mitochondrial dysfunction. Our findings suggest that this newly identified        mechanism might be involved in Aβ-induced mitochondrial dysfunction.",,Molecular psychiatry,9607835

Here, we show that        activation of G-protein coupled receptor 3 (GPR3) in Kupffer cells stimulates        glycolysis and protects mice from obesity and fatty liver disease. GPR3        activation induces a rapid increase in glycolysis via formation of complexes        between β-arrestin2 and key glycolytic enzymes as well as sustained increase in        glycolysis through transcription of glycolytic genes. In mice, GPR3 activation in        Kupffer cells results in enhanced glycolysis, reduced inflammation and inhibition        of high-fat diet induced obesity and liver pathogenesis. In human fatty liver        biopsies, GPR3 activation increases expression of glycolytic genes and reduces        expression of inflammatory genes in a population of disease-associated        macrophages.

Interestingly,        activated astrocytes in AD show abnormalities in their lipid content and        metabolism. In particular, the expression of apolipoprotein E (ApoE), a lipid        transporter, is decreased. Because ApoE has anti-inflammatory and amyloid β        (Aβ)-metabolizing effects, the nuclear receptors, retinoid X receptor (RXR) and        LXR, which are involved in ApoE expression, are considered promising therapeutic        targets for AD. However, the therapeutic effects of agents targeting these        receptors are limited or vary considerably among groups, indicating the        involvement of an unknown pathological factor that modifies astrocyte and ApoE        function. Here, we focused on the signaling lipid, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P),        which is mainly produced by sphingosine kinase 2 (SphK2) in the brain. Using        astrocyte models, we found that upregulation of SphK2/S1P signaling suppressed        ApoE induction by both RXR and LXR agonists. We also found that SphK2 activation        reduced RXR binding to the APOE promoter region in the nucleus, suggesting the        nuclear function of SphK2/S1P. Intriguingly, suppression of SphK2 activity by RNA        knockdown or specific inhibitors upregulated lipidated ApoE induction.        Furthermore, the induced ApoE facilitates Aβ uptake in astrocytes. Together with        our previous findings that SphK2 activity is upregulated in AD brain and promotes        Aβ production in neurons, these results indicate that SphK2/S1P signaling is a        promising multifunctional therapeutic target for AD that can modulate astrocyte        function by stabilizing the effects of RXR and LXR agonists, and simultaneously        regulate neuronal pathogenesis.",PMC10907773,Journal of lipid research,0376606

Numerous studies        have suggested a correlation between Alzheimer's disease and inflammation.        Microglia mainly participate in the inflammatory response in the brain.        Currently, ample evidence has shown that microglia are closely related to the        occurrence and development of Alzheimer's disease. OBJECTIVE: We opted for        bibliometric analysis to comprehensively summarize the advancements in the study        of microglia in Alzheimer's disease, aiming to provide researchers with current        trends and future research directions. METHODS: All articles and reviews        pertaining to microglia in Alzheimer's disease from 2000 to 2022 were downloaded        through Web of Science Core Collection.

Neuroinflammation mediated by        microglia and brain-resident macrophages plays a crucial role in AD        pathogenesis(1-5), though the mechanisms by which age, genes, and other risk        factors interact remain largely unknown. Somatic mutations accumulate with age        and lead to clonal expansion of many cell types, contributing to cancer and many        non-cancer diseases(6,7). Here we studied somatic mutation in normal aged and AD        brains by three orthogonal methods and in three independent AD cohorts. Analysis        of bulk RNA sequencing data from 866 samples from different brain regions        revealed significantly higher (~two-fold) overall burdens of somatic        single-nucleotide variants (sSNVs) in AD brains compared to age-matched controls.        Molecular-barcoded deep (>1000X) gene panel sequencing of 311 prefrontal cortex        samples showed enrichment of sSNVs and somatic insertions and deletions (sIndels)        in cancer driver genes in AD brain compared to control, with recurrent, and often        multiple, mutations in genes implicated in clonal hematopoiesis (CH)(8,9).        Pathogenic sSNVs were enriched in CSF1R+ microglia of AD brains, and the high        proportion of microglia (up to 40%) carrying some sSNVs in cancer driver genes        suggests mutation-driven microglial clonal expansion (MiCE). Analysis of        single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNAseq) from temporal neocortex of 62 additional        AD cases and controls exhibited nominally increased mosaic chromosomal        alterations (mCAs) associated with CH(10,11). Microglia carrying mCA showed        upregulated pro-inflammatory genes, resembling the transcriptomic features of        disease-associated microglia (DAM) in AD. Our results suggest that somatic driver        mutations in microglia are common with normal aging but further enriched in AD        brain, driving MiCE with inflammatory and DAM signatures.

In        this study, we utilized the stereotactic delivery of adeno-associated virus        (AAV)-DUSP4 to overexpress DUSP4 in the dorsal hippocampus of 5xFAD and wildtype        (WT) mice, then used mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics along with the        label-free quantification to profile the proteome and phosphoproteome in the        hippocampus. We identified protein expression and phosphorylation patterns        modulated in 5xFAD mice and examined the sex-specific impact of DUSP4        overexpression on the 5xFAD proteome/phosphoproteome. In 5xFAD mice, a        substantial number of proteins were up- or down-regulated in both male and female        mice in comparison to age and sex-matched WT mice, many of which are involved in        AD-related biological processes, such as activated immune response or suppressed        synaptic activities. Many proteins in pathways, such as immune response were        found to be suppressed in response to DUSP4 overexpression in male 5xFAD mice. In        contrast, such a shift was absent in female mice. For the phosphoproteome, we        detected an array of phosphorylation sites regulated in 5xFAD compared to WT and        modulated via DUSP4 overexpression in each sex. Interestingly, 5xFAD- and        DUSP4-associated phosphorylation changes occurred in opposite directions.        Strikingly, both the 5xFAD- and DUSP4-associated phosphorylation changes were        found to be mostly in neurons and play key roles in neuronal processes and        synaptic functions. Site-centric pathway analysis revealed that both the 5xFAD-        and DUSP4-associated phosphorylation sites were enriched for a number of kinase        sets in females but only a limited number of sets of kinases in male mice.

Although        Aβ causes neuronal mitochondria reactive oxidative stress in vitro, this has        never been directly observed in vivo in the living mouse brain. Here, we tested        for the first time whether Aβ plaques and soluble Aβ oligomers induce        mitochondrial oxidative stress in surrounding neurons in vivo, and whether this        neurotoxic effect can be abrogated using mitochondrial-targeted antioxidants.        METHODS: We expressed a genetically encoded fluorescent ratiometric        mitochondria-targeted reporter of oxidative stress in mouse models of the disease        and performed intravital multiphoton microscopy of neuronal mitochondria and Aβ        plaques.

Within the CNS, APOE is produced by a variety of cell types under different        conditions, posing a challenge for studying its roles in AD pathogenesis.        However, through powerful advances in research tools and the use of novel cell        culture and animal models, researchers have recently begun to study the roles of        APOE4 in AD in a cell type-specific manner and at a deeper and more mechanistic        level than ever before. In particular, cutting-edge omics studies have enabled        APOE4 to be studied at the single-cell level and have allowed the identification        of critical APOE4 effects in AD-vulnerable cellular subtypes. Through these        studies, it has become evident that APOE4 produced in various types of CNS cell -        including astrocytes, neurons, microglia, oligodendrocytes and vascular cells -        has diverse roles in AD pathogenesis. Here, we review these scientific advances        and propose a cell type-specific APOE4 cascade model of AD. In this model,        neuronal APOE4 emerges as a crucial pathological initiator and driver of AD        pathogenesis, instigating glial responses and, ultimately, neurodegeneration. In        addition, we provide perspectives on future directions for APOE4 research and        related therapeutic developments in the context of AD.",PMC11073858,Nature reviews.

Cell-cell communications within ME play important        roles in disease progression and immunotherapy response and are novel and        critical therapeutic targets. Though many tools of scRNA-seq analysis have been        developed to investigate the heterogeneity and sub-populations of cells, few were        designed for uncovering cell-cell communications of ME and predicting the        potentially effective drugs to inhibit the communications. Moreover, the data        analysis processes of discovering signaling communication networks and effective        drugs using scRNA-seq data are complex and involve a set of critical analysis        processes and external supportive data resources, which are difficult for        researchers who have no strong computational background and training in scRNA-seq        data analysis.

The cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this        clinical phenomenon remain elusive and ill-defined. METHODS: In-depth analyses        were performed with multiple human LOAD single-nucleus transcriptome datasets to        thoroughly characterize cell populations in the cerebral cortex. ROSMAP bulk        human brain tissue transcriptome and DNA methylome datasets were also included        for validation. Detailed assessments of microglial cell subpopulations and their        relevance to sex-biased changes at the tissue level were performed. Clinical        trait associations, cell evolutionary trajectories, and transcription regulon        analyses were conducted. RESULTS: The relative numbers of functionally defective        microglia were aberrantly increased uniquely among affected females.        Substratification of the microglia into different subtypes according to their        transcriptomic signatures identified a group of female-enriched and        disease-associated microglia (FDAMic), the numbers of which were positively        associated with disease severity. Phenotypically, these cells exhibit        transcriptomic signatures that support active proliferation, MHC class II        autoantigen presentation and amyloid-β binding, but they are also likely        defective in phagocytosis. FDAMic are likely evolved from female activated        response microglia (ARMic) with an APOE4 background and compromised estrogen        receptor (ER) signaling that is deemed to be active among most subtypes of        microglia. CONCLUSION: This study offered important insights at both the cellular        and molecular levels into how ER signaling affects microglial heterogeneity and        function. FDAMic are associated with more advanced pathologies and severe trends        of cognitive decline. Their emergence could, at least in part, explain the        phenomenon of greater penetrance of the APOE4 genotype found in females. The        biases of FDAMic emergence toward female sex and APOE4 status may also explain        why hormone replacement therapy is more effective in APOE4 carriers. The        pathologic nature of FDAMic suggests that selective modulations of these cells        may help to regain brain neuroimmune homeostasis, serving as a new target for        future drug development.",PMC10765928,Journal of neuroinflammation,101222974

In Alzheimer's disease, TDP-43 pathology is predominantly        observed in the limbic system and correlates with cognitive decline and reduced        hippocampal volume. Disruption of nuclear TDP-43 function leads to abnormal RNA        splicing and incorporation of erroneous cryptic exons in numerous transcripts        including Stathmin-2 (STMN2, also known as SCG10) and UNC13A, recently reported        in tissues from patients with ALS and FTD. Here, we identify both STMN2 and        UNC13A cryptic exons in Alzheimer's disease patients, that correlate with TDP-43        pathology burden, but not with amyloid-β or tau deposits. We also demonstrate        that processing of the STMN2 pre-mRNA is more sensitive to TDP-43 loss of        function than UNC13A. In addition, full-length RNAs encoding STMN2 and UNC13A are        suppressed in large RNA-seq datasets generated from Alzheimer's disease        post-mortem brain tissue.

However, those advances have been mostly        limited to transcriptomic data. With recent developments in single-cell DNA        methylation (scDNAm), there are emerging opportunities for deconvolving bulk DNAm        data, particularly for solid tissues like brain that lack cell-type references.        Due to technical limitations, current scDNAm sequences represent a small        proportion of the whole genome for each single cell, and those detected regions        differ across cells. This makes scDNAm data ultra-high dimensional and        ultra-sparse. To deal with these challenges, we introduce scMD (single cell        Methylation Deconvolution), a cellular deconvolution framework to reliably        estimate cell type fractions from tissue-level DNAm data. To analyze large-scale        complex scDNAm data, scMD employs a statistical approach to aggregate scDNAm data        at the cell cluster level, identify cell-type marker DNAm sites, and create        precise cell-type signature matrixes that surpass state-of-the-art sorted-cell or        RNA-derived references. Through thorough benchmarking in several datasets, we        demonstrate scMD's superior performance in estimating cellular fractions from        bulk DNAm data.

In addition,        nearly all Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Frontotemporal Degeneration        (FTD), and a large portion of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) exhibit neuronal TDP-43        aggregation, leading to loss of nuclear function, but whether TDP-43 is similarly        altered in human BBB ECs is unknown. Here we utilize a novel technique for the        enrichment of endothelial and microglial nuclei from human cortical brain        tissues, combined with inCITE-seq, to analyze nuclear proteins and RNA        transcripts in a large cohort of healthy and diseased donors. Our findings reveal        a unique transcriptional signature in nearly half of the capillary endothelial        cells across neurodegenerative states, characterized by reduced levels of nuclear        β-Catenin and canonical downstream genes, and an increase in TNF/NF-kB target        genes. We demonstrate that this does not correlate with increased nuclear        p65/NF-kB, but rather a specific loss of nuclear TDP-43 in these disease        associated ECs. Comparative analysis in animal models with targeted disruption of        TDP-43 shows that this is sufficient to drive these transcriptional alterations.        This work reveals that TDP-43 is a critical governor of the transcriptional        output from nuclear p65/NF-kB, which has paradoxical roles in barrier maintenance        and also barrier compromising inflammatory responses, and suggests that disease        specific loss in ECs contributes to BBB defects observed in the progression of        AD, ALS and FTD.",PMC10760156,bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology,101680187

Aging is a complex and dynamic        process which influences distinct cell types in a myriad of ways. The cellular        architecture of the mammalian brain is heterogeneous and diverse, making it        challenging to identify precise areas and cell types of the brain that are more        susceptible to aging than others. Here, we present a high-resolution single-cell        RNA sequencing dataset containing ~1.2 million high-quality single-cell        transcriptomic profiles of brain cells from young adult and aged mice across both        sexes, including areas spanning the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain.

METHODS: We systematically        assessed the intercellular communication networks by using a discovery snRNA-seq        dataset comprising 69,499 nuclei from 48 human postmortem prefrontal cortex (PFC)        samples. We replicated the findings using an independent snRNA-seq dataset of        56,440 nuclei from 18 PFC samples. By integrating genetic signals from AD        genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary statistics and whole genome        sequencing (WGS) data, we prioritized AD-associated Gene Ontology (GO) terms        containing dysregulated LR interactions.

RESULTS: We        identified 190 dysregulated LR interactions across six major cell types in AD        PFC, of which 107 pairs were replicated. Among the replicated LR signals, we        found globally downregulated communications in the astrocytes-to-neurons        signaling axis, characterized, for instance, by the downregulation of        APOE-related and Calmodulin (CALM)-related LR interactions and their potential        regulatory connections to target genes.

In in vitro systems, microglia preferentially        upregulate the iron importer, divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1, gene name        Slc11a2) in response to inflammatory stimuli, and it has been shown that iron can        augment cellular inflammation, suggesting a feed-forward loop between mechanisms        involved in iron import and inflammatory signaling. However, it is not understood        how microglial iron import mechanisms contribute to inflammation in vivo, or        whether altering a microglial iron-related gene affects the inflammatory        response. These studies aimed to determine the effect of knocking down microglial        iron import gene Slc11a2 on the inflammatory response in vivo. We generated a        novel model of tamoxifen-inducible, microglial-specific Slc11a2 knockdown using        Cx3cr1(Cre-ERT2) mice. Transgenic male and female mice were administered        intraperitoneal saline or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and assessed for sickness        behavior post-injection.

A subset of mice was assessed in a        behavioral test battery following LPS-induced sickness recovery. Control male,        but not female, mice significantly upregulated microglial Slc11a2 at 4 and 24 h        following LPS. In Slc11a2 knockdown mice, we observed an improvement in the acute        behavioral sickness response post-LPS in male, but not female, animals. Microglia        from male, but not female, knockdown animals exhibited a significant decrease in        LPS-provoked pro-inflammatory cytokine expression after 24 h. RNASeq data from        male knockdown microglia 4 h post-LPS revealed a robust downregulation in        inflammatory genes including Il6, Tnfα, and Il1β, and an increase in        anti-inflammatory and homeostatic markers (e.g., Tgfbr1, Cx3cr1, and Trem2). This        corresponded with a profound decrease in plasma pro-inflammatory cytokines 4 h        post-LPS.

The degeneration of        dopaminergic neurons in the basal ganglia is the primary pathological feature of        Parkinson's disease. Due to a lack of integrated analysis of multiomics datasets        across multiple basal ganglia brain regions, very little is known about the        regulatory mechanisms of this area. FINDINGS: We utilized high-throughput        transcriptomic and epigenomic analysis to profile over 270,000 single-nucleus        cells to create a cellular atlas of the basal ganglia, characterizing the        cellular composition of 4 regions of basal ganglia in adult macaque brain,        including the striatum, substantia nigra (SN), globus pallidum, and amygdala. We        found a distinct epigenetic regulation on gene expression of neuronal and        nonneuronal cells across regions in basal ganglia. We identified a cluster of        SN-specific astrocytes associated with neurodegenerative diseases and further        explored the conserved and primate-specific transcriptomics in SN cell types        across human, macaque, and mouse. Finally, we integrated our epigenetic landscape        of basal ganglia cells with human disease heritability and identified a        regulatory module consisting of candidate cis-regulatory elements that are        specific to medium spiny neurons and associated with schizophrenia.

Recent work has identified certain        subpopulations of neurons in a few focal regions of interest, such as the        entorhinal cortex, that are selectively vulnerable to tau pathology in AD.        However, the cellular underpinnings of regional susceptibility to tau pathology        are currently unknown, primarily because whole-brain maps of a comprehensive        collection of cell types have been inaccessible. Here, we deployed a recent        cell-type mapping pipeline, Matrix Inversion and Subset Selection (MISS), to        determine the brain-wide distributions of pan-hippocampal and neocortical        neuronal and non-neuronal cells in the mouse using recently available single-cell        RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) data. We then performed a robust set of analyses to        identify general principles of cell-type-based selective vulnerability using        these cell-type distributions, utilizing 5 transgenic mouse studies that        quantified regional tau in 12 distinct PS19 mouse models. Using our approach,        which constitutes the broadest exploration of whole-brain selective vulnerability        to date, we were able to discover cell types and cell-type classes that conferred        vulnerability and resilience to tau pathology. Hippocampal glutamatergic neurons        as a whole were strongly positively associated with regional tau deposition,        suggesting vulnerability, while cortical glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons were        negatively associated. Among glia, we identified oligodendrocytes as the        single-most strongly negatively associated cell type, whereas microglia were        consistently positively correlated. Strikingly, we found that there was no        association between the gene expression relationships between cell types and        their vulnerability or resilience to tau pathology. When we looked at the        explanatory power of cell types versus GWAS-identified AD risk genes, cell type        distributions were consistently more predictive of end-timepoint tau pathology        than regional gene expression. To understand the functional enrichment patterns        of the genes that were markers of the identified vulnerable or resilient cell        types, we performed gene ontology analysis. We found that the genes that are        directly correlated to tau pathology are functionally distinct from those that        constitutively embody the vulnerable cells. In short, we have demonstrated that        regional cell-type composition is a compelling explanation for the selective        vulnerability observed in tauopathic diseases at a whole-brain level and is        distinct from that conferred by risk genes. These findings may have implications        in identifying cell-type-based therapeutic targets.",PMC10705232,bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology,101680187

Disruptions in cortisol regulation due to chronic stress, disease,        and aging have profound implications for multiple bodily systems. Animal models        have been instrumental in elucidating these complex cortisol dynamics during        stress, shedding light on the interplay between physiological, neuroendocrine,        and immune factors in the stress response.

The aim of this study        is to investigate expression patterns of microglial-related genes in ALS spinal        cord. METHODS: We analyzed mRNA expression levels via RT-qPCR of several        microglia-related genes in their homeostatic and DAM state in postmortem tissue        (anterior horn of the spinal cord) from 20 subjects with ALS-TDP43 and 19        controls donors from the Navarrabiomed Biobank.

While ""the Amyloid Cascade Hypothesis,"" the abnormal        accumulation of amyloid-β in the brain, has been the most prevalent theory for        AD, mounting evidence from clinical and epidemiological studies suggest that        defects in cerebral vessels and hypoperfusion appear prior to other pathological        manifestations and might contribute to AD, leading to ""the Vascular Hypothesis.""        However, assessment of structural and functional integrity of the cerebral        vasculature in vivo in the brain from AD rodent models has been challenging owing        to the limited spatiotemporal resolution of conventional imaging technologies.        METHODS: We employed two in vivo imaging technologies, i.e., Dual-Wavelength        Imaging (DWI) and Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), to evaluate cerebrovascular        reactivity (CVR; responsiveness of blood vessels to vasoconstriction as triggered        by cocaine) in a relatively large field of view of the cortex in vivo, and 3D        quantitative cerebrovascular blood flow (CBF) imaging in living transgenic AD        mice at single vessel resolution. RESULTS: Our results showed significantly        impaired CVR and reduced CBF in basal state in transgenic AD mice compared to        non-transgenic littermates in an early stage of AD progression. Changes in total        hemoglobin (Δ[HbT]) in response to vasoconstriction were significantly attenuated        in AD mice, especially in arteries and tissue, and the recovery time of Δ[HbT]        after vasoconstriction was shorter for AD than WT in all types of vessels and        cortical tissue, thereby indicating hypoperfusion and reduced vascular        flexibility. Additionally, our 3D OCT images revealed that CBF velocities in        arteries were slower and that the microvascular network was severely disrupted in        the brain of AD mice.

METHODS: To address        this problem, we investigated cellular metabolism and immune responses        (""immunometabolism endophenotype"") across AD individuals as a function of sex        with diverse clinical diagnosis of cognitive status at death (cogdx), Braak        staging, and Consortium to Establish a Registry for AD (CERAD) scores using human        cortex metabolomics and transcriptomics data from the Religious Orders Study /        Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP) cohort.

Starting        with OPC functions, we delve into the transformation of OPCs to myelin-producing        oligodendrocytes, the intricate signaling interactions with other cells in the        central nervous system (CNS), and the fascinating process of phagocytosis, which        influences the function of OPCs and affects CNS homeostasis.

In the context of AD,        the deterioration of the local microenvironment in the brain is discussed, mainly        focusing on neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and the accumulation of toxic        proteins. The detrimental changes disturb the delicate balance in the brain,        impacting the regenerative capacity of OPCs and compromising myelin integrity.        Under pathological conditions, OPCs experience significant alterations in        migration and proliferation, leading to impaired differentiation and a reduced        ability to produce mature oligodendrocytes.

Understanding the origin of        microglia has been a subject of great interest, and emerging evidence suggests        that microglia consist of multiple subpopulations with unique molecular and        functional characteristics. These subpopulations of microglia may exhibit        specialized roles in response to different environmental cues as in disease        conditions. The newfound understanding of microglial heterogeneity has        significant implications for elucidating their roles in both physiological and        pathological conditions. In the context of disease, microglia have been studied        rigorously as they play a very important role in neuroinflammation. Dysregulated        microglial activation and function contribute to chronic inflammation. Further        exploration of microglial heterogeneity and their interactions with other cell        types in the CNS will undoubtedly pave the way to novel therapeutic strategies        targeting microglia-mediated pathologies. In this review, we discuss the latest        advances in the field of microglia research, focusing specifically on the origin        and subpopulations of microglia, the populations of microglia types in the brains        of patients with neurodegenerative diseases, and how microglia are regulated in        the healthy CNS.",PMC10839410,FEBS open bio,101580716

Integrating this body of transcriptomic        evidence into a comprehensive and reproducible framework poses several        computational challenges. Here, we introduce ZEBRA, a large single-cell and        single-nucleus RNA-seq database. ZEBRA integrates and normalizes gene expression        and metadata from 33 studies, encompassing 4.2 million human and mouse brain        cells sampled from 39 brain regions. It incorporates samples from patients with        neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and        Multiple sclerosis, as well as samples from relevant mouse models.

Enteric gliosis of the        intestinal muscularis externa (ME) has been identified as part of POI        development. However, the glia-restricted responses and activation mechanisms are        poorly understood. The sympathetic nervous system becomes rapidly activated by        abdominal surgery. It modulates intestinal immunity, innervates all intestinal        layers, and directly interfaces with enteric glia. We hypothesized that        sympathetic innervation controls enteric glia reactivity in response to surgical        trauma. METHODS: Sox10(iCreERT2)/Rpl22(HA/+) mice were subjected to a mouse model        of laparotomy or intestinal manipulation to induce POI. Histological, protein,        and transcriptomic analyses were performed to analyze glia-specific responses.        Interactions between the sympathetic nervous system and enteric glia were studied        in mice chemically depleted of TH(+) sympathetic neurons and glial-restricted        Sox10(iCreERT2)/JellyOP(fl/+)/Rpl22(HA/+) mice, allowing optogenetic stimulation        of β-adrenergic downstream signaling and glial-specific transcriptome analyses. A        laparotomy model was used to study the effect of sympathetic signaling on enteric        glia in the absence of intestinal manipulation. Mechanistic studies included        adrenergic receptor expression profiling in vivo and in vitro and adrenergic        agonism treatments of primary enteric glial cell cultures to elucidate the role        of sympathetic signaling in acute enteric gliosis and POI. RESULTS: With ~ 4000        differentially expressed genes, the most substantial enteric glia response occurs        early after intestinal manipulation. During POI, enteric glia switch into a        reactive state and continuously shape their microenvironment by releasing        inflammatory and migratory factors. Sympathetic denervation reduced the        inflammatory response of enteric glia in the early postoperative phase.        Optogenetic and pharmacological stimulation of β-adrenergic downstream signaling        triggered enteric glial reactivity. Finally, distinct adrenergic agonists        revealed β-1/2 adrenoceptors as the molecular targets of sympathetic-driven        enteric glial reactivity. CONCLUSIONS: Enteric glia act as early responders        during post-traumatic intestinal injury and inflammation. Intact sympathetic        innervation and active β-adrenergic receptor signaling in enteric glia is a        trigger of the immediate glial postoperative inflammatory response. With        immune-activating cues originating from the sympathetic nervous system as early        as the initial surgical incision, adrenergic signaling in enteric glia presents a        promising target for preventing POI development.",PMC10631040,Journal of neuroinflammation,101222974

By analyzing MG transcriptomes from 4 AD patient and 7 mouse AD        datasets, 409 human and 777 mouse AD MG DEGs were identified, of which 37 were        found common in both species. Through further combinatory analysis with        transcriptome from MG Aβ phagocytosis model, we identified 130        functional-validated Aβ phagocytic AD MG DEGs (20 in human AD, 110 in mouse AD),        which reflected a compensatory activation of Aβ phagocytosis. Interestingly, we        identified 14 human Aβ phagocytic AD MG DEGs which represented impaired MG Aβ        phagocytosis in human AD. Finally, through a cascade of meta-analysis of        transcriptome of AD MG, functional phagocytosis, HHcy MG, and human AD brain        methylome dataset, we identified 5 HHcy-suppressed phagocytic AD MG DEGs (Flt1,        Calponin 3, Igf1, Cacna2d4, and Celsr) which were reported to regulate MG/MΦ        migration and Aβ phagocytosis. CONCLUSIONS: We established molecular signatures        for a compensatory response of Aβ phagocytosis activation in human and mouse AD        MG and impaired Aβ phagocytosis in human AD MG. Our discoveries suggested that        hypomethylation may modulate HHcy-suppressed MG Aβ phagocytosis in AD.",PMC10546779,Alzheimer's research & therapy,101511643

Although numerous LOAD-associated loci have been        discovered, the causal variants and their target genes remain largely unknown.        Since the brain is composed of heterogenous cell subtypes, it is imperative to        study the brain on a cell subtype specific level to explore the biological        processes underlying LOAD. METHODS: Here, we present the largest parallel        single-nucleus (sn) multi-omics study to simultaneously profile gene expression        (snRNA-seq) and chromatin accessibility (snATAC-seq) to date, using nuclei from        12 normal and 12 LOAD brains. We identified cell subtype clusters based on gene        expression and chromatin accessibility profiles and characterized cell        subtype-specific LOAD-associated differentially expressed genes (DEGs),        differentially accessible peaks (DAPs) and cis co-accessibility networks (CCANs).        RESULTS: Integrative analysis defined disease-relevant CCANs in multiple cell        subtypes and discovered LOAD-associated cell subtype-specific candidate cis        regulatory elements (cCREs), their candidate target genes, and trans-interacting        transcription factors (TFs), some of which, including ELK1, JUN, and SMAD4 in        excitatory neurons, were also LOAD-DEGs. Finally, we focused on a subset of cell        subtype-specific CCANs that overlap known LOAD-GWAS regions and catalogued        putative functional SNPs changing the affinities of TF motifs within LOAD-cCREs        linked to LOAD-DEGs, including APOE and MYO1E in a specific subtype of microglia        and BIN1 in a subpopulation of oligodendrocytes. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge,        this study represents the most comprehensive systematic interrogation to date of        regulatory networks and the impact of genetic variants on gene dysregulation in        LOAD at a cell subtype resolution. Our findings reveal crosstalk between        epigenetic, genomic, and transcriptomic determinants of LOAD pathogenesis and        define catalogues of candidate genes, cCREs, and variants involved in LOAD        genetic etiology and the cell subtypes in which they act to exert their        pathogenic effects. Overall, these results suggest that cell subtype-specific        cis-trans interactions between regulatory elements and TFs, and the genes        dysregulated by these networks contribute to the development of LOAD.",PMC10546724,Cell & bioscience,101561195

To address this, we develop Multi-subject Dynamic        Community Detection (MuDCoD) for multi-subject community detection in        personalized dynamic gene networks from scRNA-seq.

Newer deconvolution        methodologies, such as MuSiC, use cell-type signatures derived from single-cell        RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data to make these calculations. Single-nuclei        RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) reference data can be used instead of scRNA-seq data        for tissues such as human brain where single-cell data are difficult to obtain,        but accuracy suffers due to sequencing differences between the technologies.        RESULTS: We propose a modification to MuSiC entitled 'DeTREM' which compensates        for sequencing differences between the cell-type signature and bulk RNA-seq        datasets in order to better predict cell-type fractions. We show DeTREM to be        more accurate than MuSiC in simulated and real human brain bulk RNA-sequencing        datasets with various cell-type abundance estimates.

We further assess studies that integrate multi-omics in        data mining which provide convoluted biological insights and offer        proof-of-concept proposition towards systems bioinformatics in the reconstruction        of brain networks. Finally, we recommend a combination of high dimensional        bioinformatics analysis with experimental validation to achieve translational        neuroscience applications including biomarker discovery, therapeutic development,        and elucidation of disease mechanisms.

Pharmacological inhibition or genetic        knockdown of P2X(7)R ameliorates cognitive deficits and reduces pathological tau        burden in mice that model aspects of tauopathy, including mice expressing mutant        human frontotemporal dementia (FTD)-causing forms of tau. However, disagreements        remain over which glial cell types express P2X(7)R and therefore the mechanism of        action is unresolved. Here, we show that P2X(7)R protein levels increase in human        AD post-mortem brain, in agreement with an upregulation of P2RX7 mRNA observed in        transcriptome profiles from the AMP-AD consortium. P2X(7)R protein increases        mirror advancing Braak stage and coincide with synapse loss. Using RNAScope we        detect P2RX7 mRNA in microglia and astrocytes in human AD brain, including in the        vicinity of senile plaques. In cultured microglia, P2X(7)R activation modulates        the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway by promoting the formation of active complexes and        release of IL-1β. In astrocytes, P2X(7)R activates NFκB signalling and increases        production of the cytokines CCL2, CXCL1 and IL-6 together with the acute phase        protein Lcn2. To further explore the role of P2X(7)R in a disease-relevant        context, we expressed wild-type or FTD-causing mutant forms of tau in mouse        organotypic brain slice cultures. Inhibition of P2X(7)R reduces insoluble tau        levels without altering soluble tau phosphorylation or synaptic localisation,        suggesting a non-cell autonomous role of glial P2X(7)R on pathological tau        aggregation.

Impairment of homeostatic regulation has been linked to synapse        destabilization during the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent        epigenetic and transcriptomic characterizations of the nervous system have        revealed intricate molecular details about the aging brain and the pathogenesis        of neurodegenerative diseases. Yet, how abnormal epigenetic and transcriptomic        alterations in different cell types in AD affect synaptic homeostatic plasticity        remains to be elucidated. Various glial cell types play critical roles in        modulating synaptic functions both during the aging process and in the context of        AD. Here, we investigated the impact of glial dysregulation of histone        acetylation and transcriptome in AD on synaptic homeostatic plasticity, using        computational analysis combined with electrophysiological methods in Drosophila.        By integrating snRNA-seq and H3K9ac ChIP-seq data from the same AD patient        cohort, we pinpointed cell type-specific signature genes that were        transcriptionally altered by histone acetylation. We subsequently investigated        the role of these glial genes in regulating presynaptic homeostatic potentiation        in Drosophila. Remarkably, nine glial-specific genes, which were identified        through our computational method as targets of H3K9ac and transcriptional        dysregulation, were found to be crucial for the regulation of synaptic        homeostatic plasticity in Drosophila. Our genetic evidence connects abnormal        glial transcriptomic changes in AD with the impairment of homeostatic plasticity        in the nervous system.

However, the        intrinsic key regulators underlying neurotoxic reactive astrocytes induction are        unknown. Here we show that the transmembrane protein 164 (TMEM164) is an        early-response intrinsic factor that regulates neurotoxic astrocyte reactivity.        TMEM164 overexpression inhibits the induction of neurotoxic reactive astrocytes,        maintains normal astrocytic functions and suppresses neurotoxic reactive        astrocyte-mediated neuronal death by decreasing the secretion of neurotoxic        saturated lipids.

Here, we demonstrated that        neuronal overexpression of amyloid β (Aβ) causes abnormal histone acetylation in        peripheral glia and completely blocks presynaptic homeostatic potentiation (PHP)        at the neuromuscular junction in Drosophila The synaptic deficits caused by Aβ        overexpression in motoneurons are associated with motor function impairment at        the adult stage. Moreover, we found that a sphingosine analog drug, Fingolimod,        ameliorates synaptic homeostatic plasticity impairment, abnormal glial histone        acetylation, and motor behavior defects in the Aβ models. We further demonstrated        that perineurial glial sphingosine kinase 2 (Sk2) is not only required for PHP,        but also plays a beneficial role in modulating PHP in the Aβ models. Glial        overexpression of Sk2 rescues PHP, glial histone acetylation, and motor function        deficits that are associated with Aβ in Drosophila Finally, we showed that glial        overexpression of Sk2 restores PHP and glial histone acetylation in a genetic        loss-of-function mutant of the Spt-Ada-Gcn5 Acetyltransferase complex, strongly        suggesting that Sk2 modulates PHP through epigenetic regulation.

It is known that Fingolimod enhances the        cognitive function in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the role of        sphingosine kinases in AD is not clear. We bridge this knowledge gap by        demonstrating the relationship between impaired homeostatic plasticity and AD. We        show that sphingosine kinase 2 (Sk2) in glial cells is necessary for homeostatic        plasticity and that glial Sk2-mediated epigenetic signaling has a protective role        in synapse stabilization. Our findings demonstrate the potential of the glial        sphingosine signaling as a key player in glia-neuron interactions during        homeostatic plasticity, suggesting it could be a promising target for sustaining        synaptic function in AD.",PMC10586542,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for,8102140

This is important as being able to        precisely estimate the cell-type proportions may avoid unreliable results in        downstream analyses particularly for the multiple cell-types that had low        abundances.

Regardless of natural aging or pathological aging,        the decline in cognitive function is one of the most obvious features in the        process of brain aging. Brain aging is a key factor for several neuropsychiatric        disorders and for most neurodegenerative diseases characterized by onset        typically occurring late in life and with worsening of symptoms over time.        Therefore, the early prevention and intervention of aging progression are        particularly important. Since there is no unified conclusion about the plasma        diagnostic biomarkers of brain aging, this paper innovatively employed the        combined multi-omics analysis to delineate the plasma markers of brain aging.        METHODS: In order to search for specific aging markers in plasma during cerebral        cortex aging, we used multi-omics analysis to screen out differential        genes/proteins by integrating two prefrontal cortex (PFC) single-nucleus        transcriptome sequencing (snRNA-seq) datasets and one plasma proteome sequencing        datasets. Then plasma samples were collected from 20 young people and 20 elder        people to verify the selected differential genes/proteins with ELISA assay.        RESULTS: We first integrated snRNA-seq data of the post-mortem human PFC and        generated profiles of 65,064 nuclei from 14 subjects across adult (44-58 years),        early-aging (69-79 years), and late-aging (85-94 years) stages. Seven major cell        types were classified based on established markers, including oligodendrocyte,        excitatory neurons, oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, astrocytes, microglia,        inhibitory neurons, and endotheliocytes. A total of 93 cell-specific genes were        identified to be significantly associated with age. Afterward, plasma proteomics        data from 2,925 plasma proteins across 4,263 young adults to nonagenarians (18-95        years old) were combined with the outcomes from snRNA-seq data to obtain 12        differential genes/proteins (GPC5, CA10, DGKB, ST6GALNAC5, DSCAM, IL1RAPL2,        TMEM132C, VCAN, APOE, PYH1R, CNTN2, SPOCK3). Finally, we verified the 12        differential genes by ELISA and found that the expression trends of five        biomarkers (DSCAM, CNTN2, IL1RAPL2, CA10, GPC5) were correlated with brain aging.        CONCLUSION: Five differentially expressed proteins (DSCAM, CNTN2, IL1RAPL2, CA10,        GPC5) can be considered as one of the screening indicators of brain aging, and        provide a scientific basis for clinical diagnosis and intervention.",PMC10394382,Frontiers in aging neuroscience,101525824

Astrocytes secrete neuroactive molecules that regulate synapse        formation and maturation. They also express hundreds of G protein-coupled        receptors (GPCRs) that, once activated by neurotransmitters, trigger        intracellular signalling pathways that can trigger the release of        gliotransmitters which, in turn, modulate synaptic transmission and        neuroplasticity. Considering this, it is not surprising that astrocytic        dysfunction, leading to synaptic impairment, is consistently described as a        factor in brain diseases, whether they emerge early or late in life due to        genetic or environmental factors. Here, we provide an overview of the literature        showing that activation of genetically engineered GPCRs, known as Designer        Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs), to specifically        modulate astrocyte activity partially mimics endogenous signalling pathways in        astrocytes and improves neuronal function and behavior in normal animals and        disease models. Therefore, we propose that expressing these genetically        engineered GPCRs in astrocytes could be a promising strategy to explore (new)        signalling pathways which can be used to manage brain disorders. The precise        molecular, functional and behavioral effects of this type of manipulation,        however, differ depending on the DREADD receptor used, targeted brain region and        timing of the intervention, between healthy and disease conditions. This is        likely a reflection of regional and disease/disease progression-associated        astrocyte heterogeneity.

To identify reactivity-associated genes, linear        regressions of gene expression versus reactivity were used to identify the top 52        upregulated and 144 downregulated genes. Gene Ontology analysis revealed that        upregulated genes were associated with cellular growth, responses to metal ions,        inflammation, and proteostasis.

METHODS: By using the CAGE (Cap Analysis of Gene        Expression) read alignment files for 439 human cell and tissue types (including        primary cells, tissues and cell lines) from FANTOM5 project, we predicted        enhancer-promoter interactions (EPIs) of 439 cell and tissue types in human, and        examined their reliability. Then we evaluated the genetic heritability of 17        diverse brain disorders and behavioral-cognitive phenotypes in each neural cell        type, brain region, and developmental stage. Furthermore, we prioritized genes        associated with brain disorders and phenotypes by leveraging the EPIs in each        neural cell and tissue type, and analyzed their pleiotropy and functionality for        different categories of disorders and phenotypes. Finally, we characterized the        spatiotemporal expression dynamics of these associated genes in cells and        tissues. RESULTS: We found that identified EPIs showed activity specificity and        network aggregation in cell and tissue types, and enriched TF binding in neural        cells played key roles in synaptic plasticity and nerve cell development, i.e.,        EGR1 and SOX family.

37433768,Role of neuroinflammation in neurodegeneration development.,10.1038/s41392-023-01486-5,"Studies in neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's        disease and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington's disease, and so on, have        suggested that inflammation is not only a result of neurodegeneration but also a        crucial player in this process. Protein aggregates which are very common        pathological phenomenon in neurodegeneration can induce neuroinflammation which        further aggravates protein aggregation and neurodegeneration. Actually,        inflammation even happens earlier than protein aggregation. Neuroinflammation        induced by genetic variations in CNS cells or by peripheral immune cells may        induce protein deposition in some susceptible population. Numerous signaling        pathways and a range of CNS cells have been suggested to be involved in the        pathogenesis of neurodegeneration, although they are still far from being        completely understood. Due to the limited success of traditional treatment        methods, blocking or enhancing inflammatory signaling pathways involved in        neurodegeneration are considered to be promising strategies for the therapy of        neurodegenerative diseases, and many of them have got exciting results in animal        models or clinical trials. Some of them, although very few, have been approved by        FDA for clinical usage. Here we comprehensively review the factors affecting        neuroinflammation and the major inflammatory signaling pathways involved in the        pathogenicity of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease,        Parkinson's disease, and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

Here we introduce the Multi-Nucleic Acid Interaction Mapping in Single        Cell (MUSIC) technique for concurrent profiling of multiplex chromatin        interactions, gene expression, and RNA-chromatin associations within individual        nuclei. Applied to 14 human frontal cortex samples from elderly donors, MUSIC        delineates diverse cortical cell types and states. We observed the nuclei        exhibiting fewer short-range chromatin interactions are correlated with an        ""older"" transcriptomic signature and with Alzheimer's pathology. Furthermore, the        cell type exhibiting chromatin contacts between cis expression quantitative trait        loci (cis eQTLs) and a promoter tends to be the cell type where these cis eQTLs        specifically affect their target gene's expression. Additionally, the female        cortical cells exhibit highly heterogeneous interactions between the XIST        non-coding RNA and Chromosome X, along with diverse spatial organizations of the        X chromosomes.

In this sense, women are more affected by AD than        men, but their reserve or resilience mechanisms might delay symptom onset. The        aim of this review was to explore what is known about mechanisms underlying        women's risk and resilience in AD and identify emerging themes in this area that        merit further research. We conducted a review of studies analyzing molecular        mechanisms that may induce neuroplasticity in women, as well as cognitive and        brain reserve. We also analyzed how the loss of steroid hormones in aging may be        linked to AD. We included empirical studies with human and animal models,        literature reviews as well as meta-analyses. Our search identified the importance        of 17-b-estradiol (E2) as a mechanism driving cognitive and brain reserve in        women.

Differences between moderate and advanced        stages of AD have not yet been fully characterized. MATERIALS AND METHODS:        Herein, we performed a transcript-resolution analysis in 454 AD-related samples,        including 145 non-demented control, 140 asymptomatic AD (AsymAD), and 169 AD        samples. We comparatively characterized the transcriptome dysregulation in AsymAD        and AD samples at transcript level. RESULTS: We identified 4,056 and 1,200        differentially spliced alternative splicing events (ASEs) that might play roles        in the disease progression of AsymAD and AD, respectively. Our further analysis        revealed 287 and 222 isoform switching events in AsymAD and AD, respectively. In        particular, a total of 163 and 119 transcripts showed increased usage, while 124        and 103 transcripts exhibited decreased usage in AsymAD and AD, respectively. For        example, gene APOA2 showed no expression changes between AD and non-demented        control samples, but expressed higher proportion of transcript ENST00000367990.3        and lower proportion of transcript ENST00000463812.1 in AD compared to        non-demented control samples.

Part of the challenge in reaching a nuanced        understanding is the presence of multiple risk factors that interact to        potentiate adverse consequences. To address modifiable risk factors and mitigate        downstream effects, it is necessary, although difficult, to tease apart the        contribution of an individual risk factor by accounting for concurrent factors        such as advanced age, cardiovascular risk, and genetic predisposition. Using a        case-control design, we investigated the influence of asthma, a highly prevalent        chronic inflammatory disease of the airways, on brain health in participants        recruited to the Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (31 asthma        patients, 186 non-asthma controls, aged 45-90 years, 62.2% female, 92.2%        cognitively unimpaired), a sample enriched for parental history of Alzheimer's        disease. Asthma status was determined using detailed prescription information. We        employed multi-shell diffusion weighted imaging scans and the three-compartment        neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging model to assess white and gray        matter microstructure. We used cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers to examine evidence        of Alzheimer's disease pathology, glial activation, neuroinflammation and        neurodegeneration. We evaluated cognitive changes over time using a preclinical        Alzheimer cognitive composite. Using permutation analysis of linear models, we        examined the moderating influence of asthma on relationships between diffusion        imaging metrics, CSF biomarkers, and cognitive decline, controlling for age, sex,        and cognitive status. We ran additional models controlling for cardiovascular        risk and genetic risk of Alzheimer's disease, defined as a carrier of at least        one apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele. Relative to controls, greater Alzheimer's        disease pathology (lower amyloid-β(42)/amyloid-β(40), higher        phosphorylated-tau-181) and synaptic degeneration (neurogranin) biomarker        concentrations were associated with more adverse white matter metrics (e.g. lower        neurite density, higher mean diffusivity) in patients with asthma. Higher        concentrations of the pleiotropic cytokine IL-6 and the glial marker S100B were        associated with more salubrious white matter metrics in asthma, but not in        controls. The adverse effects of age on white matter integrity were accelerated        in asthma. Finally, we found evidence that in asthma, relative to controls,        deterioration in white and gray matter microstructure was associated with        accelerated cognitive decline. Taken together, our findings suggest that asthma        accelerates white and gray matter microstructural changes associated with aging        and increasing neuropathology, that in turn, are associated with more rapid        cognitive decline.

Several available computational approaches focus on the        identification of spatially variable genes (SVGs), genes whose expression        patterns vary in space. The detection of SVGs is analogous to the identification        of differentially expressed genes and permits us to understand how genes and        associated molecular processes are spatially distributed within cellular niches.        However, the expression activities of SVGs fail to encode all information        inherent in the spatial distribution of cells. Here, we devised a deep learning        model, Spatially Informed Artificial Intelligence (SPIN-AI), to identify        spatially predictive genes (SPGs), whose expression can predict how cells are        organized in space. We used SPIN-AI on spatial transcriptomic data from squamous        cell carcinoma (SCC) as a proof of concept. Our results demonstrate that SPGs not        only recapitulate the biology of SCC but also identify genes distinct from SVGs.        Moreover, we found a substantial number of ribosomal genes that were SPGs but not        SVGs. Since SPGs possess the capability to predict spatial cellular organization,        we reason that SPGs capture more biologically relevant information for a given        cellular niche than SVGs. Thus, SPIN-AI has broad applications for detecting SPGs        and uncovering which biological processes play important roles in governing        cellular organization.",PMC10296445,Biomolecules,101596414

Neuroinflammation has gained        traction as a possible therapeutic target for neurodegeneration, however, the        precise function of microglia in specific neurodegenerative disorders is an        ongoing area of research. Genetic studies offer valuable insights into        understanding causality, rather than merely observing a correlation. Genome-wide        association studies (GWAS) have identified many genetic loci that are linked to        susceptibility to neurodegenerative disorders. (Post)-GWAS studies have        determined that microglia likely play an important role in the development of        Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD).

Post-GWAS challenges include the identification of target cell        (sub)type(s), causal variants, and target genes.

Deciphering        diabetes-linked molecular mechanisms in cells of the cerebral cortex could        uncover novel therapeutic targets. METHODS: Single-cell transcriptomic sequencing        (scRNA-seq) was conducted on the cerebral cortex in a mouse model of type 2        diabetes (db/db mice) and in non-diabetic control mice in order to identify gene        expression changes in distinct cell subpopulations and alterations in cell type        composition. Immunohistochemistry and metabolic assessment were used to validate        the findings from scRNA-seq and to investigate whether these cell-specific        dysfunctions impact the neurovascular unit (NVU). Furthermore, the behavioural        and cognitive alterations related to these dysfunctions in db/db mice were        assessed via Morris water maze and novel object discrimination tests. Finally,        results were validated in post-mortem sections and protein isolates from        individuals with type 2 diabetes. RESULTS: Compared with non-diabetic control        mice, the db/db mice demonstrated disrupted brain function as revealed by losses        in episodic and spatial memory and this occurred concomitantly with dysfunctional        NVU, neuronal circuitry and cerebral atrophy. scRNA-seq of db/db mouse cerebral        cortex revealed cell population changes in neurons, glia and microglia linked to        functional regulatory disruption including neuronal maturation and altered        metabolism. These changes were validated through immunohistochemistry and protein        expression analysis not just in the db/db mouse cerebral cortex but also in        post-mortem sections and protein isolates from individuals with type 2 diabetes        (74.3 ± 5.5 years) compared with non-diabetic control individuals (87.0 ± 8.5        years). Furthermore, metabolic and synaptic gene disruptions were evident in        cortical NVU cell populations and associated with a decrease in vascular density.        CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Taken together, our data reveal disruption in the        cellular and molecular architecture of the cerebral cortex induced by diabetes,        which can explain, at least in part, the basis for progressive cognitive decline        in individuals with type 2 diabetes.

Such admixed populations, descended from more than one ancestral        population, can present challenges for genetic studies, including limited sample        sizes and unique analytical constraints. Therefore, CH populations and other        admixed populations have not been well represented in studies of AD, and much of        the genetic variation contributing to AD risk in these populations remains        unknown. Here, we conduct genome-wide analysis of AD in multiplex CH families        from the Alzheimer Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP).

Amyloid-β (Aβ) is thought to        have an association with microglia activation and trigger neuroinflammation in        AD. However, inflammation response in brain disorders is heterogenous, and thus,        it is necessary to unveil the specific gene module of neuroinflammation caused by        Aβ in AD, which might provide novel biomarkers for AD diagnosis and help        understand the mechanism of the disease. METHODS: Transcriptomic datasets of        brain region tissues from AD patients and the corresponding normal tissues were        first used to identify gene modules through the weighted gene co-expression        network analysis (WGCNA) method. Then, key modules highly associated with Aβ        accumulation and neuroinflammatory response were pinpointed by combining module        expression score and functional information. Meanwhile, the relationship of the        Aβ-associated module to the neuron and microglia was explored based on snRNA-seq        data. Afterward, transcription factor (TF) enrichment and the SCENIC analysis        were performed on the Aβ-associated module to discover the related upstream        regulators, and then a PPI network proximity method was employed to repurpose the        potential approved drugs for AD. RESULTS: A total of 16 co-expression modules        were primarily obtained by the WGCNA method. Among them, the green module was        significantly correlated with Aβ accumulation, and its function was mainly        involved in neuroinflammation response and neuron death. Thus, the module was        termed the amyloid-β induced neuroinflammation module (AIM). Moreover, the module        was negatively correlated with neuron percentage and showed a close association        with inflammatory microglia. Finally, based on the module, several important TFs        were recognized as potential diagnostic biomarkers for AD, and then 20 possible        drugs including ibrutinib and ponatinib were picked out for the disease.        CONCLUSION: In this study, a specific gene module, termed AIM, was identified as        a key sub-network of Aβ accumulation and neuroinflammation in AD. Moreover, the        module was verified as having an association with neuron degeneration and        inflammatory microglia transformation. Moreover, some promising TFs and potential        repurposing drugs were presented for AD based on the module.

Here, we report that microglial deletion of        miR-155 induces a pre-MGnD activation state via interferon-γ (IFN-γ) signaling,        and blocking IFN-γ signaling attenuates MGnD induction and microglial        phagocytosis. Single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis of microglia from an AD mouse        model identifies Stat1 and Clec2d as pre-MGnD markers. This phenotypic transition        enhances amyloid plaque compaction, reduces dystrophic neurites, attenuates        plaque-associated synaptic degradation and improves cognition. Our study        demonstrates a miR-155-mediated regulatory mechanism of MGnD and the beneficial        role of IFN-γ-responsive pre-MGnD in restricting neurodegenerative pathology and        preserving cognitive function in an AD mouse model, highlighting miR-155 and        IFN-γ as potential therapeutic targets for AD.",PMC10619638,Nature neuroscience,9809671

However, the molecular mechanisms of cognitive decline        during normal aging remain elusive. RESULTS: Using the GTEx transcriptomic data        from 13 brain regions, we identified aging-associated molecular alterations and        cell-type compositions in males and females. We further constructed gene        co-expression networks and identified aging-associated modules and key regulators        shared by both sexes or specific to males or females. A few brain regions such as        the hippocampus and the hypothalamus show specific vulnerability in males, while        the cerebellar hemisphere and the anterior cingulate cortex regions manifest        greater vulnerability in females than in males. Immune response genes are        positively correlated with age, whereas those involved in neurogenesis are        negatively correlated with age. Aging-associated genes identified in the        hippocampus and the frontal cortex are significantly enriched for gene signatures        implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. In the hippocampus, a        male-specific co-expression module is driven by key synaptic signaling regulators        including VSNL1, INA, CHN1 and KCNH1; while in the cortex, a female-specific        module is associated with neuron projection morphogenesis, which is driven by key        regulators including SRPK2, REPS2 and FXYD1. In the cerebellar hemisphere, a        myelination-associated module shared by males and females is driven by key        regulators such as MOG, ENPP2, MYRF, ANLN, MAG and PLP1, which have been        implicated in the development of AD and other neurodegenerative diseases.        CONCLUSIONS: This integrative network biology study systematically identifies        molecular signatures and networks underlying brain regional vulnerability to        aging in males and females.

The EES-induced patterns were        fundamentally different in that they included flexor-extensor and left-right        alternations, hallmarks of locomotor CPGs, and showed spontaneous errors in        rhythmicity. These motor deletions, with preserved cycle frequency and period        when rhythmic activity resumed, were previously reported only in animal studies        and suggest a separation between rhythm generation and pattern formation.

Consequently, there is an urgent need for animal models that recapitulate        the age-related spatial and temporal complexity and patterns of pathology        identical to human AD. Our research in aging nonhuman primate models involving        rhesus macaques has revealed naturally occurring amyloid and tau pathology,        including the formation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles comprising        hyperphosphorylated tau. Moreover, rhesus macaques exhibit synaptic dysfunction        in association cortices and cognitive impairments with advancing age, and thus        can be used to interrogate the etiological mechanisms that generate        neuropathological cascades in sporadic AD. Particularly, unique molecular        mechanisms (eg, feedforward cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate [cAMP]-Protein        kinase A (PKA)-calcium signaling) in the newly evolved primate dorsolateral        prefrontal cortex are critical for persistent firing required for subserving        higher-order cognition. For example, dendritic spines in primate dorsolateral        prefrontal cortex contain a specialized repertoire of proteins to magnify        feedforward cAMP-PKA-calcium signaling such as N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptors        and calcium channels on the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (eg, ryanodine        receptors). This process is constrained by phosphodiesterases (eg, PDE4) that        hydrolyze cAMP and calcium-buffering proteins (eg, calbindin) in the cytosol.        However, genetic predispositions and age-related insults exacerbate feedforward        cAMP-Protein kinase A-calcium signaling pathways that induce a myriad of        downstream effects, including the opening of K+ channels to weaken network        connectivity, calcium-mediated dysregulation of mitochondria, and activation of        inflammatory cascades to eliminate synapses, thereby increasing susceptibility to        atrophy.

Ample evidence shows that the pathophysiology of these disorders is        contributed by orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) alterations, yet the underlying        molecular mechanisms remain elusive. To address this knowledge gap, we performed        the first-ever RNA sequencing study of postmortem OFC samples from subjects with        a lifetime diagnosis of ASPD and/or CD. METHODS: The transcriptomic profiles of        OFC samples from subjects with ASPD and/or CD were compared to those of        unaffected age-matched controls (n = 9/group). RESULTS: The OFC of        ASPD/CD-affected subjects displayed significant differences in the expression of        328 genes.

Brain ageing affects oligodendrocytes and the structural        integrity of myelin sheaths(1), the latter of which is associated with secondary        neuroinflammation(2,3). As oligodendrocytes support axonal energy metabolism and        neuronal health(4-7), we hypothesized that loss of myelin integrity could be an        upstream risk factor for neuronal amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition, the central        neuropathological hallmark of AD. Here we identify genetic pathways of myelin        dysfunction and demyelinating injuries as potent drivers of amyloid deposition in        mouse models of AD. Mechanistically, myelin dysfunction causes the accumulation        of the Aβ-producing machinery within axonal swellings and increases the cleavage        of cortical amyloid precursor protein. Suprisingly, AD mice with dysfunctional        myelin lack plaque-corralling microglia despite an overall increase in their        numbers. Bulk and single-cell transcriptomics of AD mouse models with myelin        defects show that there is a concomitant induction of highly similar but distinct        disease-associated microglia signatures specific to myelin damage and amyloid        plaques, respectively. Despite successful induction, amyloid disease-associated        microglia (DAM) that usually clear amyloid plaques are apparently distracted to        nearby myelin damage. Our data suggest a working model whereby age-dependent        structural defects of myelin promote Aβ plaque formation directly and indirectly        and are therefore an upstream AD risk factor.

Here, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq)        to measure the genome-wide profiles of histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation        (H3K4me3) and histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac), both of which are        associated with transcriptional activation in the prefrontal cortex of humans,        chimpanzees, and rhesus macaques. RESULTS: We found a discrete functional        association, in which (H3K4me3)HP gain was significantly associated with        myelination assembly and signaling transmission, while (H3K4me3)HP loss played a        vital role in synaptic activity. Moreover, (H3K27ac)HP gain was enriched in        interneuron and oligodendrocyte markers, and (H3K27ac)HP loss was enriched in CA1        pyramidal neuron markers. Using strand-specific RNA sequencing (ssRNA-seq), we        first demonstrated that approximately 7 and 2% of human-specific expressed genes        were epigenetically marked by (H3K4me3)HP and (H3K27ac)HP, respectively,        providing robust support for causal involvement of histones in gene expression.        We also revealed the co-activation role of epigenetic modification and        transcription factors in human-specific transcriptome evolution. Mechanistically,        histone-modifying enzymes at least partially contribute to an epigenetic        disturbance among primates, especially for the H3K27ac epigenomic marker. In line        with this, peaks enriched in the macaque lineage were found to be driven by        upregulated acetyl enzymes. CONCLUSIONS: Our results comprehensively elucidated a        causal species-specific gene-histone-enzyme landscape in the prefrontal cortex        and highlighted the regulatory interaction that drove transcriptional activation.",PMC10210484,BMC biology,101190720

Using single-nucleus RNA sequencing, we describe nine CeA cell        clusters, of which four are mostly associated with appetitive and two with        aversive behaviors. To analyze the activation mechanism of appetitive CeA        neurons, we characterized serotonin receptor 2a (Htr2a)-expressing neurons        (CeA(Htr2a)) that comprise three appetitive clusters and were previously shown to        promote feeding. In vivo calcium imaging revealed that CeA(Htr2a) neurons are        activated by fasting, the hormone ghrelin, and the presence of food. Moreover,        these neurons are required for the orexigenic effects of ghrelin. Appetitive CeA        neurons responsive to fasting and ghrelin project to the parabrachial nucleus        (PBN) causing inhibition of target PBN neurons.

Whereas tau- and aging-induced gene expression strongly overlap (93%),        they differ in the affected cell types. In contrast to the broad impact of aging,        tau-triggered changes are strongly polarized to excitatory neurons and glia.        Further, tau can either activate or suppress innate immune gene expression        signatures in a cell-type-specific manner.

Using single nucleus RNA sequencing        of human post-mortem white matter samples from the brain, cerebellum and spinal        cord and subsequent tissue-based validation we found substantial glial        heterogeneity with tissue region: we identified region-specific oligodendrocyte        precursor cells (OPCs) that retain developmental origin markers into adulthood,        distinguishing them from mouse OPCs. Region-specific OPCs give rise to similar        oligodendrocyte populations, however spinal cord oligodendrocytes exhibit markers        such as SKAP2 which are associated with increased myelin production and we found        a spinal cord selective population particularly equipped for producing long and        thick myelin sheaths based on the expression of genes/proteins such as HCN2.        Spinal cord microglia exhibit a more activated phenotype compared to brain        microglia, suggesting that the spinal cord is a more pro-inflammatory        environment, a difference that intensifies with age. Astrocyte gene expression        correlates strongly with CNS region, however, astrocytes do not show a more        activated state with region or age. Across all glia, sex differences are subtle        but the consistent increased expression of protein-folding genes in male donors        hints at pathways that may contribute to sex differences in disease        susceptibility.

Increased        p-tau181 levels correlate well with amyloid-β (Aβ) pathology and precede        neurofibrillary tangle formation in the early stage of AD; however, the        relationship between p-tau181 and Aβ-mediated pathology is less well understood.        We recently reported that p-tau181 represents axonal abnormalities in mice with        Aβ pathology (AppNLGF). However, from which neuronal subtype(s) these        p-tau181-positive axons originate remains elusive. OBJECTIVE: The main purpose of        this study is to differentiate neuronal subtype(s) and elucidate damage        associated with p-tau181-positive axons by immunohistochemical analysis of        AppNLGF mice brains. METHODS: Colocalization between p-tau181 and (1)        unmyelinated axons positive for vesicular acetylcholine transporter or        norepinephrine transporter and (2) myelinated axons positive for vesicular        glutamate transporter, vesicular GABA transporter, or parvalbumin in the brains        of 24-month-old AppNLGF and control mice without Aβ pathology were analyzed.

RESULTS: Of the modules significantly associated with NPs and/or NFTs, the        mbPRSs from two modules (M6 and M9) showed distinct associations with language        and visuospatial functioning, respectively. They matched clinical subtypes and        brain atrophy at specific regions. DISCUSSION: Our findings demonstrate that        polygenic profiling based on co-expressed gene sets can explain heterogeneity in        AD patients, enabling genetically informed patient stratification and precision        medicine in AD. HIGHLIGHTS: Co-expression gene-network analysis in Alzheimer's        disease (AD) brains identified gene sets (modules) associated with AD        heterogeneity. AD-associated modules were selected when genes in each module were        enriched for neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Polygenic risk scores        from two selected modules were linked to the matching cognitively defined AD        subgroups (language and visuospatial subgroups). Polygenic risk scores from the        two modules were associated with cognitive performance in language and        visuospatial domains and the associations were confirmed in regional-specific        brain atrophy data.",PMC10638468,Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association,101231978

Neuroinflammation, defined as the activation of glial cells        such as microglia and astrocytes, is observed surrounding senile plaques and        affected neurons in AD. Recently conducted genome-wide association studies (GWAS)        indicate that a large section of identified AD risk genes are involved in immune        responses and are enriched in microglia. Microglia are innate immune cells in the        central nervous system (CNS), which are involved in immune surveillance and        maintenance of homeostasis in the CNS. Recently, a novel subpopulation of        activated microglia named as disease-associated microglia (DAM), also known as        activated response microglia (ARM) or microglial neurodegenerative phenotype        (MGnD), was identified in AD model mice. These microglia closely associate with        β-amyloid (Aβ) plaques and exhibit characteristic gene expression profiles        accompanied with reduced expressions of homeostatic microglial genes. However, it        remains unclear whether decreased homeostatic microglia functions or increased        DAM/ARM/MGnD functions correlate with the degree of neuronal loss in AD. To        translate the results of rodent studies to human AD, precuneus, the brain region        vulnerable to β-amyloid accumulation in preclinical AD, is of high interest, as        it can provide novel insights into the mechanisms of microglia response to Aβ in        early AD. In this study, we performed comparative analyses of gene expression        profiles of microglia among three representative neurodegenerative mouse models        and the human precunei with early AD pathology. We proceeded to evaluate the        identified genes as potential therapeutic targets for AD. We believe that our        findings will provide important resources to better understand the role of glial        dysfunction in AD.",PMC10170691,Inflammation and regeneration,101479577

Reactive astrocytes are important in the onset and        progression of many neuropathologies, such as neurotrauma, stroke, and        neurodegenerative diseases. Single-cell transcriptomics has revealed remarkable        heterogeneity of reactive astrocytes, indicating their multifaceted functions in        a whole spectrum of neuropathologies, with important temporal and spatial        resolution, both in the brain and in the spinal cord.

Among the major FTLD pathological subgroups, FTLD with        TDP-43 positive inclusions (FTLD-TDP) and FTLD with tau-positive inclusions        (FTLD-tau) are the most common, representing about 90% of the cases. Although        alterations in DNA methylation have been consistently associated with        neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's        disease, little is known for FTLD and its heterogeneous subgroups and subtypes.        The main goal of this study was to investigate DNA methylation variation in        FTLD-TDP and FTLD-tau. We used frontal cortex genome-wide DNA methylation        profiles from three FTLD cohorts (142 FTLD cases and 92 controls), generated        using the Illumina 450K or EPIC microarrays. We performed epigenome-wide        association studies (EWAS) for each cohort followed by meta-analysis to identify        shared differentially methylated loci across FTLD subgroups/subtypes. In        addition, we used weighted gene correlation network analysis to identify        co-methylation signatures associated with FTLD and other disease-related traits.        Wherever possible, we also incorporated relevant gene/protein expression data.        After accounting for a conservative Bonferroni multiple testing correction, the        EWAS meta-analysis revealed two differentially methylated loci in FTLD, one        annotated to OTUD4 (5'UTR-shore) and the other to NFATC1 (gene body-island). Of        these loci, OTUD4 showed consistent upregulation of mRNA and protein expression        in FTLD. In addition, in the three independent co-methylation networks,        OTUD4-containing modules were enriched for EWAS meta-analysis top loci and were        strongly associated with the FTLD status. These co-methylation modules were        enriched for genes implicated in the ubiquitin system, RNA/stress granule        formation and glutamatergic synaptic signalling. Altogether, our findings        identified novel FTLD-associated loci, and support a role for DNA methylation as        a mechanism involved in the dysregulation of biological processes relevant to        FTLD, highlighting novel potential avenues for therapeutic development.",PMC10261190,Acta neuropathologica,0412041

To identify potential        therapeutic targets for AD, an integrative network analysis was previously        carried out using 364 human postmortem control, mild cognitive impairment, and AD        brains. This analysis identified proline endopeptidase-like protein (PREPL), an        understudied protein, as a downregulated protein in late-onset AD patients. In        this study we investigate the role of PREPL. Analyses of data from human        postmortem samples and PREPL knockdown (KD) cells suggest that PREPL expression        modulates pathways associated with protein trafficking, synaptic activities, and        lipid metabolism. Furthermore, PREPL KD impairs cell proliferation and modulates        the structure of vesicles, levels of neuropeptide-processing enzymes, and        secretion of neuropeptides. In addition, decrease in PREPL levels leads to        changes in the levels of a number of synaptic proteins as well as changes in the        levels of secreted amyloid beta (Aβ) 42 peptide and Tau phosphorylation. Finally,        we report that local decrease in PREPL levels in mouse hippocampus attenuates        long-term potentiation, suggesting a role in synaptic plasticity. Together, our        results indicate that PREPL affects neuronal function by modulating protein        trafficking and synaptic function, an important mechanism of AD pathogenesis.        SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Integrative network analysis reveals proline        endopeptidase-like protein (PREPL) to be downregulated in human sporadic        late-onset Alzheimer's disease brains.

Since the cellular mechanisms governing this        relationship are poorly understood, we explored whether ATP-sensitive potassium        (KATP) channels, which couple changes in energy availability with cellular        excitability, play a role in AD pathogenesis. First, we demonstrate that KATP        channel subunits Kir6.2/KCNJ11 and SUR1/ABCC8 were expressed on excitatory and        inhibitory neurons in the human brain, and cortical expression of KCNJ11 and        ABCC8 changed with AD pathology in humans and mice. Next, we explored whether        eliminating neuronal KATP channel activity uncoupled the relationship between        metabolism, excitability, and Aβ pathology in a potentially novel mouse model of        cerebral amyloidosis and neuronal KATP channel ablation (i.e., amyloid precursor        protein [APP]/PS1 Kir6.2-/- mouse). Using both acute and chronic paradigms, we        demonstrate that Kir6.2-KATP channels are metabolic sensors that regulate        hyperglycemia-dependent increases in interstitial fluid levels of Aβ,        amyloidogenic processing of APP, and amyloid plaque formation, which may be        dependent on lactate release. These studies identify a potentially new role for        Kir6.2-KATP channels in AD and suggest that pharmacological manipulation of        Kir6.2-KATP channels holds therapeutic promise in reducing Aβ pathology in        patients with diabetes or prediabetes.",PMC10386887,JCI insight,101676073

Because the        incidence rate of Alzheimer disease (AD) increases exponentially with age,        investigating the association between AD and the accumulation of somatic mutation        can help understand the etiology of AD. METHODS: We designed a somatic mutation        detection workflow by contrasting genotypes derived from whole-genome sequencing        (WGS) data with genotypes derived from scRNA-seq data and applied this workflow        to 76 participants from the Religious Order Study and the Rush Memory and Aging        Project (ROSMAP) cohort. We focused only on excitatory neurons, the dominant cell        type in the scRNA-seq data. RESULTS: We identified 196 sites that harbored at        least 1 individual with an excitatory neuron-specific somatic mutation (ENSM),        and these 196 sites were mapped to 127 genes. The single base substitution (SBS)        pattern of the putative ENSMs was best explained by signature SBS5 from the        Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) mutational signatures, a        clock-like pattern correlating with the age of the individual. The count of ENSMs        per individual also showed an increasing trend with age. Among the mutated sites,        we found 2 sites tend to have more mutations in older individuals (16:6899517        [RBFOX1], p = 0.04; 4:21788463 [KCNIP4], p < 0.05). In addition, 2 sites were        found to have a higher odds ratio to detect a somatic mutation in AD samples        (6:73374221 [KCNQ5], p = 0.01 and 13:36667102 [DCLK1], p = 0.02). Thirty-two        genes that harbor somatic mutations unique to AD and the KCNQ5 and DCLK1 genes        were used for gene ontology (GO)-term enrichment analysis. We found the        AD-specific ENSMs enriched in the GO-term ""vocalization behavior"" and        ""intraspecies interaction between organisms."" Of interest we observed both        age-specific and AD-specific ENSMs enriched in the K(+) channel-associated genes.        DISCUSSION: Our results show that combining scRNA-seq and WGS data can        successfully detect putative somatic mutations.

Multiple methods that are sensitive to axon orientations,        from microscopy to magnetic resonance imaging, aim to reconstruct the brain's        structural connectome. As billions of nerve fibers traverse the brain with        various possible geometries at each point, resolving fiber crossings is necessary        to generate accurate structural connectivity maps. However, doing so with        specificity is a challenging task because signals originating from oriented        fibers can be influenced by brain (micro)structures unrelated to myelinated        axons. X-ray scattering can specifically probe myelinated axons due to the        periodicity of the myelin sheath, which yields distinct peaks in the scattering        pattern. Here, we show that small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) can be used to        detect myelinated, axon-specific fiber crossings. We first demonstrate the        capability using strips of human corpus callosum to create artificial double- and        triple-crossing fiber geometries, and we then apply the method in mouse, pig,        vervet monkey, and human brains.

We propose that some pathophysiological and        clinical forms of the disease may arise from structural and metabolic disorders        in the processes of myelination/demyelination of brain regions where the        accumulation of non-functional toxic proteins is important. In these forms, the        primacy of the deleterious role of amyloid peptides would be a matter of        questioning and the initiating role of neuropathology would be primarily the fact        of dysmyelination.",PMC10067200,Acta neuropathologica communications,101610673

The accumulation of scRNA-seq studies and biological        knowledge leads to several well-maintained cell marker databases. Manually        examining the cell marker lists against these databases can be difficult due to        the large amount of available information. Additionally, simply overlapping the        two lists without considering gene ranking might lead to unreliable results.        Thus, an automated method with careful statistical testing is needed to        facilitate the usage of these databases. RESULTS: We develop a user-friendly        computational tool, EasyCellType, which automatically checks an input marker list        obtained by differential expression analysis against the databases and provides        annotation recommendations in graphical outcomes. The package provides two        statistical tests, gene set enrichment analysis and a modified version of        Fisher's exact test, as well as customized database and tissue type choices. We        also provide an interactive shiny application to annotate cells in a        user-friendly graphical user interface.

Emerging evidence connects polyamine        metabolism with the autophagy pathway, however the role of polyamines in        Tauopathy remains unclear. In the present study we investigated the role of        spermine synthase (SMS) in autophagy regulation and tau protein processing in        Drosophila and human cellular models of Tauopathy. Our previous study showed that        Drosophila spermine synthase (dSms) deficiency impairs lysosomal function and        blocks autophagy flux. Interestingly, partial loss-of-function of SMS in        heterozygous dSms flies extends lifespan and improves the climbing performance of        flies with human Tau (hTau) overexpression. Mechanistic analysis showed that        heterozygous loss-of-function mutation of dSms reduces hTau protein accumulation        through enhancing autophagic flux. Measurement of polyamine levels detected a        mild elevation of spermidine in flies with heterozygous loss of dSms. SMS        knock-down in human neuronal or glial cells also upregulates autophagic flux and        reduces Tau protein accumulation. Proteomics analysis of postmortem brain tissue        from AD patients showed a significant albeit modest elevation of SMS protein        level in AD-relevant brain regions compared to that of control brains        consistently across several datasets. Taken together, our study uncovers a        correlation between SMS protein level and AD pathogenesis and reveals that SMS        reduction upregulates autophagy, promotes Tau clearance, and reduces Tau protein        accumulation.

METHODS: We performed laser capture microdissection of Aβ plaques, the        50μm halo around them, tangles with the 50μm halo around them, and areas distant        (>50μm) from plaques and tangles in the temporal cortex of AD and control donors,        followed by RNA-sequencing. RESULTS: Aβ plaques exhibited upregulated microglial        (neuroinflammation/phagocytosis) and downregulated neuronal        (neurotransmission/energy metabolism) genes, whereas tangles had mostly        downregulated neuronal genes. Aβ plaques had more differentially expressed genes        than tangles. We identified a gradient Aβ plaque>peri-plaque>tangle>distant for        these changes.

In recent years, computational approaches based on multiomics data have        provided an unprecedented opportunity for drug discovery since they can        substantially lower the costs and boost the efficiency. In this study, we        intended to identify potential drug candidates for different pathological stages        of AD by computationally repurposing Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved        drugs.

Previous single-cell and        bulk expression Alzheimer's studies have reported conflicting findings about the        key cell types and cellular pathways whose expression is primarily altered in        this disease. We re-analyzed these data in a uniform, coherent manner aiming to        resolve and extend past findings. Our analysis sheds light on the observation        that females have higher AD incidence than males. METHODS: We re-analyzed three        single-cell transcriptomics datasets. We used the software Model-based Analysis        of Single-cell Transcriptomics (MAST) to seek differentially expressed genes        comparing AD cases to matched controls for both sexes together and each sex        separately. We used the GOrilla software to search for enriched pathways among        the differentially expressed genes. Motivated by the male/female difference in        incidence, we studied genes on the X-chromosome, focusing on genes in the        pseudoautosomal region (PAR) and on genes that are heterogeneous across        individuals or tissues for X-inactivation. We validated findings by analyzing        bulk AD datasets from the cortex in the Gene Expression Omnibus. RESULTS: Our        results resolve a contradiction in the literature, showing that by comparing AD        patients to unaffected controls, excitatory neurons have more differentially        expressed genes than do other cell types. Synaptic transmission and related        pathways are altered in a sex-specific analysis of excitatory neurons. PAR genes        and X-chromosome heterogeneous genes, including, for example, BEX1 and ELK1, may        contribute to the difference in sex incidence of Alzheimer's disease. GRIN1,        stood out as an overexpressed autosomal gene in cases versus controls in all        three single-cell datasets and as a functional candidate gene contributing to        pathways upregulated in cases. DISCUSSION: Taken together, these results point to        a potential linkage between two longstanding questions concerning AD        pathogenesis, involving which cell type is the most important and why females        have a higher incidence than males. HIGHLIGHTS: By reanalyzing three, published,        single-cell RNAseq datasets, we resolved a contradiction in the literature and        showed that when comparing AD patients to unaffected controls, excitatory neurons        have more differentially expressed genes than do other cell types.Further        analysis of the published single-cell datasets showed that synaptic transmission        and related pathways are altered in a sex-specific analysis of excitatory        neurons.Combining analysis of single-cell datasets and publicly available bulk        transcriptomics datasets revealed that X-chromosome genes, such as BEX1, ELK1,        and USP11, whose X-inactivation status is heterogeneous may contribute to the        higher incidence in females of Alzheimer's disease.",PMC9983144,"Alzheimer's & dementia (New York, N.

Through a        multilevel approach based on AD datasets and a novel chemogenetic method that        resolves the genomic binding profile of dimeric transcription factors (ChIPmera),        we find that CREB3L2-ATF4 activates a transcription network that interacts with        roughly half of the genes differentially expressed in AD, including subsets        associated with β-amyloid and tau neuropathologies. CREB3L2-ATF4 activation        drives tau hyperphosphorylation and secretion in neurons, in addition to        misregulating the retromer, an endosomal complex linked to AD pathogenesis.

Increased Abeta damages myelin to form a vicious injury cycle. Thus,        white matter injury, cholesterol dysmetabolism and Abeta dysmetabolism interact        to produce or worsen AD neuropathology. The amyloid cascade is the leading        hypothesis for the cause of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The failure of clinical        trials based on this hypothesis has raised other possibilities. Even with a        possible new success (Lecanemab), it is not clear whether this is a cause or a        result of the disease. With the discovery in 1993 that the apolipoprotein E type        4 allele (APOE4) was the major risk factor for sporadic, late-onset AD (LOAD),        there has been increasing interest in cholesterol in AD since APOE is a major        cholesterol transporter. Recent studies show that cholesterol metabolism is        intricately involved with Abeta (Aβ)/amyloid transport and metabolism, with        cholesterol down-regulating the Aβ LRP1 transporter and upregulating the Aβ RAGE        receptor, both of which would increase brain Aβ. Moreover, manipulating        cholesterol transport and metabolism in rodent AD models can ameliorate pathology        and cognitive deficits, or worsen them depending upon the manipulation. Though        white matter (WM) injury has been noted in AD brain since Alzheimer's initial        observations, recent studies have shown abnormal white matter in every AD brain.        Moreover, there is age-related WM injury in normal individuals that occurs        earlier and is worse with the APOE4 genotype. Moreover, WM injury precedes        formation of plaques and tangles in human Familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) and        precedes plaque formation in rodent AD models. Restoring WM in rodent AD models        improves cognition without affecting AD pathology. Thus, we postulate that the        amyloid cascade, cholesterol dysmetabolism and white matter injury interact to        produce and/or worsen AD pathology. We further postulate that the primary        initiating event could be related to any of the three, with age a major factor        for WM injury, diet and APOE4 and other genes a factor for cholesterol        dysmetabolism, and FAD and other genes for Abeta dysmetabolism.",PMC9950279,Frontiers in aging neuroscience,101525824

Results showed that        HFD-fed FABP4 knockout mice have a hippocampal transcriptome consistent with        neuroprotection, including associations with decreased proinflammatory signaling,        ER stress, apoptosis, and cognitive decline. This is accompanied by an increase        in transcripts upregulating neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity, long-term        potentiation, and spatial working memory.

We collectively refer to these        subpopulations as lipid-associated macrophages or LAMs. Importantly, this        particular activation state is characterized by increased expression of genes        involved in the phagocytic clearance of lipid-rich cellular debris        (efferocytosis), including several AD risk genes. METHODS: We used sc/nRNA-seq        data from human and mouse microglia from healthy and diseased brains and        macrophages from other lipid-rich tissues to reconstruct gene regulatory networks        and identify transcriptional regulators whose regulons are enriched for LAM        response genes (LAM TFs) across species. We then used gene knock-down/knock-out        strategies to validate some of these LAM TFs in human THP-1 macrophages and        iPSC-derived microglia in vitro, as well as mouse microglia in vivo. RESULTS: We        nominate 11 strong candidate LAM TFs shared across human and mouse networks        (BHLHE41, HIF1A, ID2, JUNB, MAF, MAFB, MEF2A, MEF2C, NACA, POU2F2 and SPI1). We        also demonstrate a strong enrichment of AD risk alleles in the cistrome of        BHLHE41 (and its close homolog BHLHE40), thus implicating its regulon in the        modulation of disease susceptibility. Loss or reduction of BHLHE40/41 expression        in human THP-1 macrophages and iPSC-derived microglia, as well as loss of        Bhlhe40/41 in mouse microglia led to increased expression of LAM response genes,        specifically those involved in cholesterol clearance and lysosomal processing,        with a concomitant increase in cholesterol efflux and storage, as well as        lysosomal mass and degradative capacity. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, this study        nominates transcriptional regulators of the LAM response, experimentally        validates BHLHE40/41 in human and mouse macrophages/microglia, and provides novel        targets for therapeutic modulation of macrophage/microglia function in AD and        other disorders of lipid-rich tissues.",PMC9948946,bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology,101680187

Although the molecular        mechanisms of this increased risk are unclear, APOE4 is known to alter immune        signaling and lipid and glucose metabolism. Astrocytes provide various forms of        support to neurons, including regulating neuronal metabolism and immune responses        through cytokine signaling. Changes in astrocyte function because of APOE4 may        therefore decrease neuronal support, leaving neurons more vulnerable to stress        and disease insults. To determine whether APOE4 alters astrocyte neuronal support        functions, we measured glycolytic and oxidative metabolism of neurons treated        with conditioned media from APOE4 or APOE3 (the common, risk-neutral variant)        primary astrocyte cultures. We found that APOE4 neurons treated with conditioned        media from resting APOE4 astrocytes had similar metabolism to APOE3 neurons        treated with media from resting APOE3 astrocytes, but treatment with astrocytic        conditioned media from astrocytes challenged with amyloid-β (Aβ), a key        pathological protein in AD, caused APOE4 neurons to increase their basal        mitochondrial and glycolytic metabolic rates more than APOE3 neurons. These        changes were not because of differences in astrocytic lactate production or        glucose utilization, but instead correlated with increased glycolytic ATP        production and a lack of cytokine secretion in response to Aβ. Additionally, we        identified that astrocytic cytokine signatures could predict basal metabolism of        neurons treated with the astrocytic conditioned media. Together, these findings        suggest that in the presence of Aβ, APOE4 astrocytes alter immune and metabolic        functions that result in a compensatory increase in neuronal metabolic stress.",PMC10903110,Journal of neurochemistry,2985190R

Here, we identify a        pathogenic microglial subset which expresses the CD11c surface marker as the sole        producer of Osteopontin (OPN) in the 5XFAD mouse model of AD. OPN production        divides Disease-Associated Microglia (DAM) into two functionally distinct        subsets, i.e., a protective CD11c(+)OPN(-) subset that robustly ingests amyloid β        (Aβ) in a noninflammatory fashion and a pathogenic CD11c(+)OPN(+) subset that        produces proinflammatory cytokines and fails to ingest significant amounts of Aβ.        Genetic ablation of OPN or administration of monoclonal anti-OPN antibody to        5XFAD mice reduces proinflammatory microglia, plaque formation, and numbers of        dystrophic neurites and results in improved cognitive function.

Using antemortem assessments        of BPSD in AD, we demonstrate that individual BPSD can be grouped into 4 domain        factors in our sample: affective, apathy, agitation, and psychosis. Then, we        performed a transcriptome-wide analysis for each domain utilizing bulk RNA-seq of        post-mortem anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) tissue. Though all 4 domains are        associated with a predominantly downregulated pattern of hundreds of        differentially expressed genes (DEGs), most DEGs are unique to each domain, with        only 22 DEGs being common to all BPSD domains, including TIMP1. Weighted gene        co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) yielded multiple transcriptional modules        that were shared between BPSD domains or unique to each domain, and NetDecoder        was used to analyze context-dependent information flow through the biological        network. For the agitation domain, we found that all DEGs and a highly correlated        transcriptional module were functionally enriched for ECM-related genes including        TIMP1, TAGLN, and FLNA.

Identifying and understanding the biochemical changes that sensitize the        ageing brain to neurodegeneration will provide new opportunities for dementia        prevention and treatment. This study aimed to determine how ageing and major        genetic risk factors for dementia affect the hippocampal proteome and lipidome of        neurologically-normal humans over the age of 65. The hippocampus was chosen as it        is highly susceptible to atrophy with ageing and in several neurodegenerative        diseases. Methods Mass spectrometry-based proteomic and lipidomic analysis of CA1        hippocampus samples from 74 neurologically normal human donors, aged 66-104, was        used in combination with multiple regression models and gene set enrichment        analysis to identify age-dependent changes in the proteome and lipidome. ANOVA        was used to test the effect of major dementia risk alleles in the TMEM106B and        APOE genes on the hippocampal proteome and lipidome, adjusting for age, gender,        and post-mortem interval. Results Forty proteins were associated with age at        false discovery rate-corrected P < 0.05, including proteins that regulate cell        adhesion, the cytoskeleton, amino acid and lipid metabolism, and ribosomal        subunits. Transmembrane protein 106B (TMEM106B), a regulator of lysosomal and        oligodendrocyte function, was regulated with greatest effect size. The increase        in TMEM106B levels with age was specific to carriers of the rs1990622-A allele in        the TMEM106B gene that is associated with increased risk for frontotemporal        dementia, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and hippocampal sclerosis        with ageing. Hippocampal lipids were not significantly affected by APOE genotype,        however levels of myelin-enriched sulfatides and hexosylceramides were        significantly lower, and polyunsaturated phospholipids were higher, in        rs1990622-A carriers after controlling for APOE genotype. Conclusions Our study        provides the first evidence that TMEM106B protein abundance is increased with        brain ageing in humans, and the first evidence that the major TMEM106B dementia        risk allele affects brain lipid homeostasis, with a clear effect on myelin lipid        content.

However, multiple        works defend a dynamic role dependent on experience. This has allowed the        development of a new concept called myelin plasticity that contributes, together        with synaptic plasticity, to the long-term changes that occur in neuronal        circuits during learning and memory. Therefore, this review will address the        latest published data regarding the role of myelination with memory. DEVELOPMENT:        Evidence from human neuroimaging studies demonstrates that myelination can change        due to activity-dependent modulation, such that learning can modify the axon        myelination. Alternatively, it has also been shown that interfering with        myelination, using transgenic rodent models, significantly impairs memory        processes. This has important implications in alterations as severe as        Alzheimer's disease, where transcriptional changes and in the phenotype of cells        associated with the myelination process begin to be described.

Our statistical model uses a common latent variable to        interpret the common source of variances in two different data modalities. Our        approach jointly learns an inference model and two modality-specific non-linear        models by leveraging variational inference and deep learning. We perform VIMCCA        and compare it with 10 existing state-of-the-art algorithms on four paired        multi-modal datasets sequenced by different protocols. Results demonstrate that        VIMCCA facilitates integrating various types of joint-modality data, thus leading        to more reliable and accurate downstream analysis. VIMCCA improves our ability to        identify novel or rare cell subtypes compared to existing widely used methods.        Besides, it can also facilitate inferring cell lineage based on joint-modality        profiles. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The VIMCCA algorithm has been        implemented in our toolkit package scbean (≥0.5.0), and its code has been        archived at https://github.com/jhu99/scbean under MIT license.

The analysis identified a locus in CDKN2B-AS1 (rs6475609, p = 7.13 ×        10(-8)) that almost reached genome-wide significance and four additional loci        that were suggestively significant.

We also correlated EL-associated SNPs with serum        proteins to link our findings to potential biological mechanisms that may be        related to EL and are under genetic regulation. The findings from the proteomic        analyses suggested that longevity-promoting alleles of significant genetic        variants either provided EL cases with more youthful molecular profiles compared        to controls or provided some form of protection from other illnesses, such as        Alzheimer's disease, and disease progressions.",PMC9820206,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791

The main protein        components of these hallmarks include Aβ40, Aβ42, tau, phosphor-tau, and APOE. We        hypothesize that genetic variants influence the levels and solubility of these        AD-related proteins in the brain; identifying these may provide key insights into        disease pathogenesis. METHODS: Genome-wide genotypes were collected from 441 AD        cases, imputed to the haplotype reference consortium (HRC) panel, and filtered        for quality and frequency. Temporal cortex levels of five AD-related proteins        from three fractions, buffer-soluble (TBS), detergent-soluble (Triton-X = TX),        and insoluble (Formic acid = FA), were available for these same individuals.        Variants were tested for association with each quantitative biochemical measure        using linear regression, and GSA-SNP2 was used to identify enriched Gene Ontology        (GO) terms. Implicated variants and genes were further assessed for association        with other relevant variables. RESULTS: We identified genome-wide significant        associations at seven novel loci and the APOE locus. Genes and variants at these        loci also associate with multiple AD-related measures, regulate gene expression,        have cell-type specific enrichment, and roles in brain health and other        neuropsychiatric diseases. Pathway analysis identified significant enrichment of        shared and distinct biological pathways. CONCLUSIONS: Although all biochemical        measures tested reflect proteins core to AD pathology, our results strongly        suggest that each have unique genetic architecture and biological pathways that        influence their specific biochemical states in the brain. Our novel approach of        deep brain biochemical endophenotype GWAS has implications for pathophysiology of        proteostasis in AD that can guide therapeutic discovery efforts focused on these        proteins.",PMC9825010,Molecular neurodegeneration,101266600

Although degeneration of neurons is a prominent feature that        undoubtedly contributes to and defines NDD pathology, it is now clear that        neuronal cell death is by no means mediated solely by cell-autonomous mechanisms.        Oligodendrocytes (OLs), the myelinating cells of the central nervous system        (CNS), enable rapid transmission of electrical signals and provide metabolic and        trophic support to neurons.

In the absence of caspase-8,        mice are embryonic lethal due to excessive receptor interacting protein kinase        3-dependent (RIPK3-dependent) necroptosis. Compound RIPK3 and caspase-8 mutants        rescue embryonic lethality, which we leveraged to examine the roles of these        pathways in an amyloid β-mediated (Aβ-mediated) mouse model of AD. We found that        combined deletion of caspase-8 and RIPK3, but not RIPK3 alone, led to diminished        Aβ deposition and microgliosis in the mouse model of AD carrying human presenilin        1 and amyloid precursor protein with 5 familial AD mutations (5xFAD). Despite its        well-known role in cell death, caspase-8 did not appear to affect cell loss in        the 5xFAD model. In contrast, we found that caspase-8 was a critical regulator of        Aβ-driven inflammasome gene expression and IL-1β release. Interestingly, loss of        RIPK3 had only a modest effect on disease progression, suggesting that inhibition        of necroptosis or RIPK3-mediated cytokine pathways is not critical during        midstages of Aβ amyloidosis.

Indeed, deficient        Wnt signaling is causally related to increased expression of DKK1, an endogenous        negative Wnt regulator, and synapse loss, both of which likely contribute to        cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Increasingly, AD research efforts        have probed the neuroinflammatory role of microglia, the resident immune cells of        the CNS, which have furthermore been shown to be modulated by Wnt signaling. The        DKK1 homolog DKK2 has been previously identified as an activated response and/or        disease-associated microglia (DAM/ARM) gene in a mouse model of AD. Here, we        performed a detailed analysis of DKK2 in mouse models of neurodegeneration, and        in human AD brain. In APP/PS1 and APP(NL-G-F) AD mouse model brains as well as in        SOD1(G93A) ALS mouse model spinal cords, but not in control littermates, we        demonstrated significant microgliosis and microglial Dkk2 mRNA upregulation in a        disease-stage-dependent manner.

To        validate the observation in AD mouse models, we also generated a snRNA-Seq        dataset from the human superior frontal gyrus (SFG) and entorhinal cortex (ERC)        at different Braak stages. RESULTS: We show that during early-stage disease,        interferon signaling induces a subtype of microglia termed Early-stage        AD-Associated Microglia (EADAM) in response to both Aβ and tau pathologies.        During late-stage disease, a second microglia subtype termed Late-stage        AD-Associated Microglia (LADAM) is detected. While similar microglia subtypes are        observed in other models of neurodegenerative disease, the magnitude and        composition of gene signatures found in EADAM and LADAM are distinct, suggesting        the necessity of both Aβ and tau pathologies to elicit their emergence.        Importantly, the pattern of EADAM- and LADAM-associated gene expression is        observed in microglia from AD brains, during the early (Braak II)- or late (Braak        VI/V)- stage of the disease, respectively. Furthermore, we show that several        Siglec genes are selectively expressed in either EADAM or LADAM. Siglecg is        expressed in white-matter-associated LADAM, and expression of Siglec-10, the        human orthologue of Siglecg, is progressively elevated in an AD-stage-dependent        manner but not shown in non-AD tauopathy. CONCLUSIONS: Using scRNA-Seq in mouse        models bearing amyloid-β and/or tau pathologies, we identify novel microglia        subtypes induced by the combination of Aβ and tau pathologies in a disease        stage-specific manner. Our findings suggest that both Aβ and tau pathologies are        required for the disease stage-specific induction of EADAM and LADAM. In        addition, we revealed Siglecs as biomarkers of AD progression and potential        therapeutic targets.",PMC9762062,Molecular neurodegeneration,101266600

However, the study-specific focus on individual cell        types, disease models or experimental approaches has limited our ability to infer        common and disease-specific responses. This meta-analysis integrates bulk and        single-cell transcriptomic datasets of microglia and monocytes from disease        models of autoimmunity, neurodegeneration, sterile injury, and infection to build        a comprehensive resource connecting myeloid responses across CNS disease. We        demonstrate that the bulk microglial and monocyte program is highly contingent on        the disease environment, challenging the notion of a universal microglial disease        signature. Integration of six single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets revealed that        these disease-specific signatures are likely driven by differing proportions of        unique myeloid subpopulations that were individually expanded in different        disease settings. These subsets were functionally-defined as        neurodegeneration-associated, inflammatory, interferon-responsive, phagocytic,        antigen-presenting, and lipopolysaccharide-responsive cellular states, revealing        a core set of myeloid responses at the single-cell level that are conserved        across CNS pathology. Showcasing the predictive and practical value of this        resource, we performed differential expression analysis on microglia and        monocytes across disease and identified Cd81 as a new neuroinflammatory-stable        gene that accurately identified microglia and distinguished them from        monocyte-derived cells across all experimental models at both the bulk and        single-cell level. Together, this resource dissects the influence of disease        environment on shared immune response programmes to build a unified perspective        of myeloid behavior across CNS pathology.",PMC10952672,Glia,8806785

We review the roles of innate and adaptive immunity, their niches,        their communication, and their contributions to AD development and progression.        We also summarize the cellular compositions and physiological functions of immune        cells in the parenchyma, together with those in the brain border structures that        form a dynamic disease-related immune niche. We propose that both innate and        adaptive immune responses in brain parenchyma and border structures could serve        as important therapeutic targets for treating both the pre-symptomatic and the        symptomatic stages of AD.",PMC9772134,Immunity,9432918

Among the increasing        number of genetic risk factors identified, the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene        remains the strongest and most prevalent, impacting more than half of all AD        cases. While the ε4 allele of the APOE gene significantly increases AD risk, the        ε2 allele is protective relative to the common ε3 allele. These gene alleles        encode three apoE protein isoforms that differ at two amino acid positions. The        primary physiological function of apoE is to mediate lipid transport in the brain        and periphery; however, additional functions of apoE in diverse biological        functions have been recognized. Pathogenically, apoE seeds amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques        in the brain with apoE4 driving earlier and more abundant amyloids. ApoE isoforms        also have differential effects on multiple Aβ-related or Aβ-independent pathways.        The complexity of apoE biology and pathobiology presents challenges to designing        effective apoE-targeted therapeutic strategies.

A central role of α-synuclein in the selective neurodegeneration of        Parkinson's disease has been speculated, as its level of expression critically        determines the propensity of this protein to misfold. To investigate whether the        propensity of neuronal cell loss is associated with the level of endogenous        α-synuclein expression, non-transgenic rats were given a single intravenous        administration of α-synuclein pre-formed fibrils (PFFs) reversibly complexed with        the rabies virus glycoprotein peptide (RVG9R). The number of surviving cells in        different neuronal populations was systematically quantified using unbiased        stereology. Our data demonstrated that a non-selective, transvascular delivery of        α-synuclein PFFs led to a time-dependent loss of specific populations of midbrain        (but not olfactory) dopaminergic neurons, medullary (but not pontine) cholinergic        neurons, and brainstem serotonergic neurons.

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) techniques        provide potential solutions to analyze cellular composition of complex brain        tissue and explore cellular and molecular biological mechanisms of AD. METHODS:        We investigated cellular heterogeneity in AD via utilization of bioinformatic        analysis of scRNA-seq in AD patients and healthy controls from the Gene        Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The ""GOplot"" package was applied to explore        possible biological processes in oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and        oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). Expression patterns and biological        functions of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from scRNA-seq data were        validated in RNA sequencing data. DEGs in astrocytes interacted with        ferroptosis-related genes in FerrDb. CCK-8 and EdU assays were performed to        measure cell proliferation ability. ROS, Fe(2+) level, mitochondrial membrane        potentials, iron concentrations, and total iron binding capacity (TIBC) in serum        were evaluated. Y-maze and elevated maze were used to measure anxiety-like        behavior. Autonomous and exploration behaviors or learning and memory ability in        mice were analyzed using open field test and novel object recognition test.        RESULTS: Multiple clusters were identified, including oligodendrocytes,        astrocytes, OPCs, neurons, microglia, doublets, and endothelial cells. Astrocytes        were significantly decreased in AD, while oligodendrocytes and OPCs increased.        Cell-to-cell ligand-receptor interaction analysis revealed that astrocytes,        neurons, and OPCs mainly established contacts with other cells via the NRG3-ERBB4        ligand-receptor pair. GO and KEGG analyses found that astrocytes were enriched in        the ferroptosis pathway. FTH1 and SAT1 in astrocytes were identified as hub mRNAs        associated with ferroptosis. Serum iron concentration of 5xFAD mice was higher        than that of WT, and emotional and cognitive function were significantly impaired        as compared to WT. Serum iron concentration was negatively correlated with number        of astrocytes and percentage of time spent entering the novelty arm in the Y-maze        test, while it was positively correlated with percentage of time spent in the        central area. Meanwhile, number of astrocytes was negatively correlated with        percentage of time spent in the central area, while it was positively correlated        with percentage of time spent entering the novelty arm. CONCLUSIONS: Through        scRNA-seq analysis, we found that ferroptosis was activated in astrocytes and may        contribute to the pathophysiological process in the entorhinal cortex. FTH1 and        SAT1 were identified to impact astrocyte ferroptosis. Emotional and cognitive        impairment in AD was associated with astrocyte ferroptosis.

The AstTau system        develops much of the neuronal and astrocytic pathology observed in tauopathies        including misfolded, phosphorylated, oligomeric, and fibrillar tau, strong        neurodegeneration, and reactive astrogliosis.

Using an integrated        approach of mouse genetics, live cell imaging, electron microscopy, and        biochemistry, we show that mature oligodendrocytes require macroautophagy to        degrade cell autonomously their myelin by consolidating cytosolic and        transmembrane myelin proteins into an amphisome intermediate prior to        degradation. We find that disruption of autophagic myelin turnover leads to        changes in myelin sheath structure, ultimately impairing neural function and        culminating in an adult-onset progressive motor decline, neurodegeneration, and        death.

METHODS: We developed The        Alzheimer's Cell Atlas (TACA) by compiling an AD brain cell atlas consisting of        over 1.1 million cells/nuclei across 26 data sets, covering major brain regions        (hippocampus, cerebellum, prefrontal cortex, and so on) and cell types        (astrocyte, microglia, neuron, oligodendrocytes, and so on). We conducted nearly        1400 differential expression comparisons to identify cell type-specific molecular        alterations (e.g., case vs healthy control, sex-specific, apolipoprotein E (APOE)        ε4/ε4, and TREM2 mutations). Each comparison was followed by protein-protein        interaction module detection, functional enrichment analysis, and omics-informed        target and drug (over 700,000 perturbation profiles) screening. Over 400        cell-cell interaction analyses using 6000 ligand-receptor interactions were        conducted to identify the cell-cell communication networks in AD. RESULTS: All        results are integrated into TACA (https://taca.lerner.ccf.org/), a new web portal        with cell type-specific, abundant transcriptomic information, and 12 interactive        visualization tools for AD. DISCUSSION: We envision that TACA will be a highly        valuable resource for both basic and translational research in AD, as it provides        abundant information for AD pathobiology and actionable systems biology tools for        drug discovery. HIGHLIGHTS: We compiled an Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain cell        atlas consisting of more than 1.1 million cells/nuclei transcriptomes from 26        data sets, covering major brain regions (cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum) and        cell types (e.g., neuron, oligodendrocyte, astrocyte, and microglia).We conducted        over 1400 differential expression (DE) comparisons to identify cell type-specific        gene expression alterations. Major comparison types are (1) AD versus healthy        control; (2) sex-specific DE, (3) genotype-driven DE (i.e., apolipoprotein E        [APOE] ε4/ε4 vs APOE ε3/ε3; TREM2(R47H) vs common variants) analysis; and (4)        others. Each comparison was further followed by (1) human protein-protein        interactome network module analysis, (2) pathway enrichment analysis, and (3)        gene-set enrichment analysis.For drug screening, we conducted gene set enrichment        analysis for all the comparisons with over 700,000 drug perturbation profiles        connecting more than 10,000 human genes and 13,000 drugs/compounds.A total of        over 400 analyses of cell-cell interactions against 6000 experimentally validated        ligand-receptor interactions were conducted to reveal the disease-relevant        cell-cell communications in AD.",PMC9558163,"Alzheimer's & dementia (New York, N.

However, the molecular mechanisms and biological        processes of neuroinflammation remain unclear and have not well delineated using        transcriptomics data available. Our objectives are to uncover the core        neuroinflammation signaling pathways in AD using integrative network analysis on        the transcriptomics data. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From a novel perspective, i.e.,        investigating weakly activated molecular signals (rather than the strongly        activated molecular signals), we developed integrative and systems biology        network analysis to uncover potential core neuroinflammation signaling targets        and pathways in AD using the two large-scale transcriptomics datasets, i.e., Mayo        Clinic (77 controls and 81 AD samples) and ROSMAP (97 controls and 260 AD        samples). RESULTS: Our analysis identified interesting core neuroinflammation        signaling pathways, which are not systematically reported in the previous studies        of AD. Specifically, we identified 7 categories of signaling pathways implicated        on AD and related to virus infection: immune response, x-core signaling,        apoptosis, lipid dysfunctional, biosynthesis and metabolism, and mineral        absorption signaling pathways. More interestingly, most of the genes in the virus        infection, immune response, and x-core signaling pathways are associated with        inflammation molecular functions. The x-core signaling pathways were defined as a        group of 9 signaling proteins: MAPK, Rap1, NF-kappa B, HIF-1, PI3K-Akt, Wnt,        TGF-beta, Hippo, and TNF, which indicated the core neuroinflammation signaling        pathways responding to the low-level and weakly activated inflammation and        hypoxia and leading to the chronic neurodegeneration. It is interesting to        investigate the detailed signaling cascades of these weakly activated        neuroinflammation signaling pathways causing neurodegeneration in a chronic        process, and consequently uncover novel therapeutic targets for effective AD        treatment and prevention.

Single-cell mass        spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics enables the high-throughput examination of        protein expression at the single-cell level with wide applicability, and with        spatial and temporal resolution, applicable to the study of cellular development,        disease, effect of treatment, etc. The study of single-cell proteomics has lagged        behind genomics and transcriptomics largely because proteins from single-cell        samples cannot be amplified as DNA and RNA can using well established techniques        such as PCR.

Applying BFGWAS_QUANT        to study five Alzheimer disease (AD)-related phenotypes using individual-level        GWAS data (n = ∼1,000), we found that histone modification annotations have        higher enrichment than expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) annotations for        all considered phenotypes, with the highest enrichment in H3K27me3 (polycomb        regression). We also found that cis-eQTLs in microglia had higher enrichment than        eQTLs of bulk brain frontal cortex tissue for all considered phenotypes. A        similar enrichment pattern was also identified using the International Genomics        of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP) summary-level GWAS data of AD (n = ∼54,000). The        strongest known APOE E4 risk allele was identified for all five phenotypes, and        the APOE locus was validated using the IGAP data. BFGWAS_QUANT fine-mapped 32        significant variants from 1,073 genome-wide significant variants in the IGAP        data. We also demonstrated that the polygenic risk scores (PRSs) using effect        size estimates by BFGWAS_QUANT had a similar prediction accuracy as other methods        assuming a sparse causal model.

This inconsistency is present among        molecular subtypes, which has led to diagnostic ambiguity and failure in drug        development. We precisely distinguished patients of AD at the transcriptome        level. METHODS: We collected 1,240 AD brain tissue samples collected from the GEO        dataset. Consensus clustering was used to identify molecular subtypes, and the        clinical characteristics were focused on. To reveal transcriptome differences        among subgroups, we certificated specific upregulated genes and annotated the        biological function. According to RANK METRIC SCORE in GSEA, TOP10 was defined as        the hub gene. In addition, the systematic correlation between the hub gene and        ""A/T/N"" was analyzed. Finally, we used external data sets to verify the        diagnostic value of hub genes. RESULTS: We identified three molecular subtypes of        AD from 743 AD samples, among which subtypes I and III had high-risk factors, and        subtype II had protective factors. All three subgroups had higher neuritis plaque        density, and subgroups I and III had higher clinical dementia scores and        neurofibrillary tangles than subgroup II. Our results confirmed a positive        association between neurofibrillary tangles and dementia, but not neuritis        plaques. Subgroup I genes clustered in viral infection, hypoxia injury, and        angiogenesis. Subgroup II showed heterogeneity in synaptic pathology, and we        found several essential beneficial synaptic proteins. Due to presenilin one        amplification, Subgroup III was a risk subgroup suspected of familial AD,        involving abnormal neurogenic signals, glial cell differentiation, and        proliferation. Among the three subgroups, the highest combined diagnostic value        of the hub genes were 0.95, 0.92, and 0.83, respectively, indicating that the hub        genes had sound typing and diagnostic ability.

We hypothesised that sex differences in the transcriptome of human        myeloid cells may contribute to the sex difference observed in AD prevalence. To        explore this, we assessed bulk and single-nuclear RNA sequencing data sets        generated from four human derived myeloid cell populations: post-mortem        microglial nuclei, peripheral monocytes, monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) and        induced pluripotent stem cell derived microglial-like cells (MGLs).

In addition,        these inflammation-associated gene sets were found to be enriched in peripheral        monocytes isolated from postmenopausal women and in MDMs obtained from        premenopausal individuals relative to age-matched males. Expression of these gene        sets did not differ in MDMs derived from women whose blood was sampled across the        menstrual cycle or in MGLs cultured with 17β-oestradiol. This suggests that the        observed gene set enrichments in myeloid cells from women were not being driven        by acute hormonal influences. Together, these data support the hypothesis that        the increased prevalence of AD in women may be partly explained by a myeloid cell        phenotype biased towards expression of biological processes relevant to AD.",PMC9535846,Journal of neuroinflammation,101222974

Safe and effective delivery of neurotherapeutics in        Alzheimer's like central nervous system (CNS) disorders still remains elusive        despite the major advances in both neuroscience and drug delivery research. The        blood-brain barrier (BBB) with its tight endothelial cell layer surrounded by        astrocyte foot processes poses as a major barrier for the entry of drugs into the        brain. Nasal drug delivery has emerged as a reliable method to bypass this        blood-brain barrier and deliver a wide range of neurotherapeutic agents to the        brain effectively. This nasal route comprises the olfactory or trigeminal nerves        originating from the brain and terminating into the nasal cavity at the        respiratory epithelium or olfactory neuroepithelium. They represent the most        direct method of noninvasive entry into the brain, opening the most suitable        therapeutic avenue for treatment of neurological diseases. Also, drugs loaded        into nanocarriers can have better interaction with the mucosa that assists in the        direct brain delivery of active molecules bypassing the BBB and achieving rapid        cerebrospinal fluid levels. Lipid particulate systems, emulsion-based systems,        vesicular drug delivery systems, and other nanocarriers have evolved as promising        drug delivery approaches for the effective brain delivery of anti-Alzheimer's        drugs with improved permeability and bioavailability via the nasal route. Charge,        size, nature of neurotherapeutics, and formulation excipients influence the        effective and targeted drug delivery using nanocarriers via the nasal route. This        article elaborates on the recent advances in nanocarrier-based nasal drug        delivery systems for the direct and effective brain delivery of the        neurotherapeutic molecules. Additionally, we have attempted to highlight various        experimental strategies, underlying mechanisms in the pathogenesis and therapy of        central nervous system diseases, computational approaches, and clinical        investigations pursued so far to attain and enhance the direct delivery of        therapeutic agents to the brain via the nose-to-brain route, using nanocarriers.",PMC9513345,Frontiers in pharmacology,101548923

Here, we characterize DSB-bearing neurons from        the CK-p25 mouse model of neurodegeneration using single-nucleus, bulk, and        spatial transcriptomic techniques. DSB-bearing neurons enter a late-stage DNA        damage response marked by nuclear factor κB (NFκB)-activated senescent and        antiviral immune pathways. In humans, Alzheimer's disease pathology is closely        associated with immune activation in excitatory neurons. Spatial transcriptomics        reveal that regions of CK-p25 brain tissue dense with DSB-bearing neurons harbor        signatures of inflammatory microglia, which is ameliorated by NFκB knockdown in        neurons. Inhibition of NFκB in DSB-bearing neurons also reduces microglia        activation in organotypic mouse brain slice culture. In conclusion, DSBs activate        immune pathways in neurons, which in turn adopt a senescence-associated secretory        phenotype to elicit microglia activation.

Genetic studies have identified AD        risk genes including the most prominent, APOE, of which the ɛ4 allele increases        risk in a dose-dependent manner. A breakthrough discovery enabled the creation of        human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) that can be differentiated into        various brain cell types, facilitating AD research in genetically human models.        Herein, we provide a brief background on AD in the context of APOE susceptibility        and feature work employing hiPSC-derived brain cell and tissue models to        interrogate the contribution of APOE in driving AD pathology. Such models have        delivered crucial insights into cellular mechanisms and cell type-specific roles        underlying the perturbed biological functions that trigger pathogenic cascades        and propagate neurodegeneration.

However, the compartmentalized pathology of the        disease affecting various anatomical regions including gray and white matter and        lack of appropriate disease models impede understanding of the disease. Utilizing        single-nucleus RNA-sequencing and multiplex spatial RNA mapping, we generated an        integrated transcriptomic map comprising leukocortical, cerebellar and spinal        cord areas in normal and MS tissues that captures regional subtype diversity of        various cell types with an emphasis on astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. While we        found strong cross-regional diversity among glial subtypes in control tissue,        regional signatures become more obscure in MS. This suggests that patterns of        transcriptomic changes in MS are shared across regions and converge on specific        pathways, especially those regulating cellular stress and immune activation. In        addition, we found evidence that a subtype of white matter oligodendrocytes        appearing across all three CNS regions adopt pro-remyelinating gene signatures in        MS. In summary, our data suggest that cross-regional transcriptomic glial        signatures overlap in MS, with different reactive glial cell types capable of        either exacerbating or ameliorating pathology.",PMC9547805,Acta neuropathologica,0412041

While astrocytes contribute to both pathologic        mechanisms, the role of their mitochondria, which is essential for signaling and        maintenance of these processes, has been largely understudied. The current work        provides the first direct evidence that the mitochondrial metabolic switch        17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 10 (17βHSD10) is expressed and active in        murine astrocytes from different brain regions. While it is known that this        protein is overexpressed in the brains of AD patients, we found that 17βHSD10 is        also upregulated in astrocytes exposed to amyloidogenic and ischemic stress.        Importantly, such catalytic overexpression of 17βHSD10 inhibits mitochondrial        respiration during increased energy demand. This observation contrasts with what        has been found in neuronal and cancer model systems, which suggests        astrocyte-specific mechanisms mediated by the protein. Furthermore, the catalytic        upregulation of the enzyme exacerbates astrocytic damage, reactive oxygen species        (ROS) generation and mitochondrial network alterations during amyloidogenic        stress. On the other hand, 17βHSD10 inhibition through AG18051 counters most of        these effects.

36083008,"A machine learning-based method for automatically identifying novel cells in        annotating single-cell RNA-seq data.",10.1093/bioinformatics/btac617,"MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has been widely used to        decompose complex tissues into functionally distinct cell types. The first and        usually the most important step of scRNA-seq data analysis is to accurately        annotate the cell labels. In recent years, many supervised annotation methods        have been developed and shown to be more convenient and accurate than        unsupervised cell clustering. One challenge faced by all the supervised        annotation methods is the identification of the novel cell type, which is defined        as the cell type that is not present in the training data, only exists in the        testing data. Existing methods usually label the cells simply based on the        correlation coefficients or confidence scores, which sometimes results in an        excessive number of unlabeled cells. RESULTS: We developed a straightforward yet        effective method combining autoencoder with iterative feature selection to        automatically identify novel cells from scRNA-seq data. Our method trains an        autoencoder with the labeled training data and applies the autoencoder to the        testing data to obtain reconstruction errors. By iteratively selecting features        that demonstrate a bi-modal pattern and reclustering the cells using the selected        feature, our method can accurately identify novel cells that are not present in        the training data. We further combined this approach with a support vector        machine to provide a complete solution for annotating the full range of cell        types. Extensive numerical experiments using five real scRNA-seq datasets        demonstrated favorable performance of the proposed method over existing methods        serving similar purposes.

However, no studies to date have investigated cell type-specific        transcriptomic changes associated with volitional opioid taking. Here, we use        single nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNAseq) to comprehensively characterize cell        type-specific alterations of the NAc transcriptome in rats self-administering        morphine. One cohort of male Brown Norway rats was injected with acute morphine        (10 mg/kg, i.p.) or saline. A second cohort of rats was allowed to        self-administer intravenous morphine (1.0 mg/kg/infusion) for 10 consecutive        days. Each morphine-experienced rat was paired with a yoked saline control rat.        snRNAseq libraries were generated from NAc punches and used to identify cell        type-specific gene expression changes associated with volitional morphine taking.        We identified 1106 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the acute morphine        group, compared to 2453 DEGs in the morphine self-administration group, across 27        distinct cell clusters. Importantly, we identified 1329 DEGs that were specific        to morphine self-administration. DEGs were identified in novel clusters of        astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and D1R- and D2R-expressing medium spiny neurons in        the NAc. Cell type-specific DEGs included Rgs9, Celf5, Oprm1, and Pde10a.        Upregulation of Rgs9 and Celf5 in D2R-expressing neurons was validated by        RNAscope. Approximately 85% of all oligodendrocyte DEGs, nearly all of which were        associated with morphine taking, were identified in two subtypes. Bioinformatic        analyses identified cell type-specific upstream regulatory mechanisms of the        observed transcriptome alterations and downstream signaling pathways, including        both novel and previously identified molecular pathways. These findings show that        volitional morphine taking is associated with distinct cell type-specific        transcriptomic changes in the rat NAc and highlight specific striatal cell        populations and novel molecular substrates that could be targeted to reduce        compulsive opioid taking.",PMC9458645,Translational psychiatry,101562664

Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is an important hormone that        contributes to growth, cell proliferation, and autophagy and is also expressed in        the brain. Here, we assessed the clinical data from TBI patients and performed        both in vitro and in vivo experiments with proteomic and gene-chip analysis to        assess the functions of IGF-1 in mitophagy following TBI. We show that reduced        plasma IGF-1 is correlated with cognition in TBI patients. Overexpression of        astrocytic IGF-1 improves cognitive dysfunction and mitophagy in TBI mice.        Mechanically, proteomics data show that the IGF-1-related NF-κB pathway        transcriptionally regulates decapping mRNA2 (Dcp2) and miR-let-7, together with        IGF-1R to orchestrate mitophagy in TBI. Finally, we demonstrate that brain injury        induces impaired mitophagy at the chronic stage and that IGF-1 treatment could        facilitate the mitophagy markers via exosomal miR-let-7e. By showing that IGF-1        is an important mediator of the beneficial effect of the neural-endocrine network        in TBI models, our findings place IGF-1/IGF-1R as a potential target capable of        noncoding RNAs and opposing mitophagy failure and cognitive impairment in TBI.",PMC9433209,Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity,101479826

It has strong antioxidant properties that improve        mitochondrial function. We investigated if ALA improves mitochondrial dysfunction        in a cellular model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: SH-SY5Y-APP(695) cells        were used as a model for an early stage of AD. Vector-transfected SH-SY5Y-MOCK        cells served as controls. Using these cells, we investigated mitochondrial        respiration (OXPHOS), mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), adenosine        triphosphate (ATP) production, and citrate synthase activity (CS) in cells        treated with ALA. Cells were treated for 24 h with different concentrations of        ALA and with or without the complex I inhibitor rotenone. RESULTS: Incubation        with ALA showed a significant increase in ATP levels in both SH-SY5Y-APP(695) and        SH-SY5Y-MOCK cells. MMP levels were elevated in SH-SY5Y-MOCK cells, treatment        with rotenone showed a reduction in MMP, which could be partly alleviated after        incubation with ALA in SH-SY5Y-MOCK cells. ALA treatment showed significant        differences in respiration chain complex activities in SH-SY5Y-MOCK cells.        Citrate synthase activity was unaffected. ROS levels were significantly lower in        both cell lines treated with ALA. CONCLUSIONS: ALA increased the activity of the        different complexes of the respiratory chain, and consequently enhanced the MMP,        leading to increased ATP levels indicating improved mitochondrial function. ALA        only marginally protects from additional rotenone-induced mitochondrial stress.",PMC9409376,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791

Although the protein        architecture and machinery for protein translation at synapses are extensively        studied, the impact that local changes in the mRNA reservoir have on AD        progression is largely unknown. Here, we investigated the changes in        transcriptomic profiles in the synaptodendrosomes purified from the cortices of        AD mice at ages 3 and 6 months, a stage when early signatures of synaptic        dysfunction are revealed. The transcriptomic profiles of synaptodendrosomes        showed a greater number of localized differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in        6-month-old AD mice compared with mice 3 months of age. Gene Ontology (GO)        analysis showed that these DEGs are majorly enriched in mitochondrial biogenesis        and metabolic activity. More specifically, we further identified three        representative DEGs in mitochondrial and metabolic pathways-Prnp, Cst3, and        Cox6c-that regulate the dendritic spine density and morphology in neurons. Taken        together, this study provides insights into the transcriptomic changes in        synaptodendrosomes during AD progression, which may facilitate the development of        intervention strategies targeting local translation to ameliorate the        pathological progression of AD.",PMC9408306,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791

The number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was not large        enough to build context-specific gene regulatory networks for each individual        cell type, and thus, we focused on the study of cell types with dominant changes        and included analyses of changes across the combination of cell types.

Owing to recent advances in single-cell RNA sequencing        (scRNA-seq) and the availability of large amounts of bulk RNA-seq data in        disease-relevant tissues, various deconvolution methods have been developed.        However, the performance of existing methods heavily relies on the quality of        information provided by external data sources, such as the selection of scRNA-seq        data as a reference and prior biological information. RESULTS: We present the        Integrated and Robust Deconvolution (InteRD) algorithm to infer cell-type        proportions from target bulk RNA-seq data. Owing to the innovative use of        penalized regression with a new evaluation criterion for deconvolution, InteRD        has three primary advantages. First, it is able to effectively integrate        deconvolution results from multiple scRNA-seq datasets. Second, InteRD calibrates        estimates from reference-based deconvolution by taking into account extra        biological information as priors.

The demyelinated areas were        confined to cortical and subcortical areas including the corpus callosum and        hippocampus. The intensity of demyelination correlated with behavioral deficits        of gait and associative recognition memory performances. By Evans blue        angiography, we detected blood-brain barrier (BBB) leakage as another early        pathological change affecting frontal and parietal cortex in eNOS-deficient mice.        Sodium nitrate fortified drinking water provided to young and middle-aged        eNOS-deficient mice completely prevented non-perfusion, BBB leakage, and white        matter pathology, indicating that impaired endothelium-derived NO signaling may        have caused these pathological events. Furthermore, genome-wide transcriptomic        analysis revealed altered gene clusters most related to mitochondrial respiratory        pathways selectively in the white matter of young eNOS-deficient mice. Using        eNOS-deficient mice, we identified BBB breakdown and hypoperfusion as the two        earliest pathological events, resulting from insufficient vascular NO signaling.        We speculate that the compromised BBB and mild chronic hypoperfusion trigger        vascular damage, along with oxidative stress and astrogliosis, accounting for the        white matter pathological changes in the eNOS-deficient mouse model. We conclude        that eNOS-deficient mice represent an ideal spontaneous evolving model for        studying the earliest events leading to white matter changes, which will be        instrumental to future therapeutic testing of drug candidates and for targeting        novel/specific vascular mechanisms contributing to VCID and AD.",PMC9734049,Molecular psychiatry,9607835
35947618,The neuropeptide landscape of human prefrontal cortex.,10.1073/pnas.2123146119,"Human prefrontal cortex (hPFC) is a complex brain region involved in cognitive        and emotional processes and several psychiatric disorders. Here, we present an        overview of the distribution of the peptidergic systems in 17 subregions of hPFC        and three reference cortices obtained by microdissection and based on RNA        sequencing and RNAscope methods integrated with published single-cell        transcriptomics data. We detected expression of 60 neuropeptides and 60        neuropeptide receptors in at least one of the hPFC subregions. The results reveal        that the peptidergic landscape in PFC consists of closely located and        functionally different subregions with unique peptide/transmitter-related        profiles. Neuropeptide-rich PFC subregions were identified, encompassing regions        from anterior cingulate cortex/orbitofrontal gyrus. Furthermore, marked        differences in gene expression exist between different PFC regions (>5-fold;        cocaine and amphetamine-regulated transcript peptide) as well as between PFC        regions and reference regions, for example, for somatostatin and several        receptors. We suggest that the present approach allows definition of, still        hypothetical, microcircuits exemplified by glutamatergic neurons expressing a        peptide cotransmitter either as an agonist (hypocretin/orexin) or antagonist        (galanin). Specific neuropeptide receptors have been identified as possible        targets for neuronal afferents and, interestingly, peripheral blood-borne peptide        hormones (leptin, adiponectin, gastric inhibitory peptide, glucagon-like        peptides, and peptide YY). Together with other recent publications, our results        support the view that neuropeptide systems may play an important role in hPFC and        underpin the concept that neuropeptide signaling helps stabilize circuit        connectivity and fine-tune/modulate PFC functions executed during health and        disease.",PMC9388106,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876

Molecular pathways that trigger reactive        astrocytes may represent important targets to preserve normal homeostatic        maintenance and modify disease progression. METHODS: Semaphorin 4D (SEMA4D)        expression in the context of disease-associated neuropathology was assessed in        postmortem brain sections of patients with Huntington's (HD) and Alzheimer's        disease (AD), as well as in mouse models of HD (zQ175) and AD (CVN;        APPSwDI/NOS2(-/-)) by immunohistochemistry. Effects of SEMA4D antibody blockade        were assessed in purified astrocyte cultures and in the CVN mouse AD model. CVN        mice were treated weekly from 26 to 38 weeks of age; thereafter mice underwent        cognitive assessment and brains were collected for histopathology. RESULTS: We        report here that SEMA4D is upregulated in neurons during progression of        neurodegenerative diseases and is a trigger of reactive astrocytes. Evidence of        reactive astrocytes in close proximity to neurons expressing SEMA4D is detected        in brain sections of patients and mouse models of HD and AD. We further report        that SEMA4D-blockade prevents characteristic loss of GABAergic synapses and        restores spatial memory and learning in CVN mice, a disease model that appears to        reproduce many features of AD-like pathology including neuroinflammation. In        vitro mechanistic studies demonstrate that astrocytes express cognate receptors        for SEMA4D and that ligand binding triggers morphological variations, and changes        in expression of key membrane receptors and enzymes characteristic of reactive        astrocytes. These changes include reductions in EAAT-2 glutamate transporter and        glutamine synthetase, key enzymes in neurotransmitter recycling, as well as        reduced GLUT-1 glucose and MCT-4 lactate transporters, that allow astrocytes to        couple energy metabolism with synaptic activity. Antibody blockade of SEMA4D        prevented these changes and reversed functional deficits in glucose uptake.        CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these results suggest that SEMA4D blockade may        ameliorate disease pathology by preserving normal astrocyte function and reducing        the negative consequences of reactive astrogliosis.",PMC9356477,Journal of neuroinflammation,101222974

How the interaction of APOE4 microglia        with neurons differs from microglia expressing the disease-neutral APOE3 allele        remains unknown. Here, we employ CRISPR-edited induced pluripotent stem cells        (iPSCs) to dissect the impact of APOE4 in neuron-microglia communication. Our        results reveal that APOE4 induces a lipid-accumulated state that renders        microglia weakly responsive to neuronal activity. By examining the        transcriptional signatures of APOE3 versus APOE4 microglia in response to        neuronal conditioned media, we established that neuronal cues differentially        induce a lipogenic program in APOE4 microglia that exacerbates pro-inflammatory        signals. Through decreased uptake of extracellular fatty acids and lipoproteins,        we identified that APOE4 microglia disrupts the coordinated activity of neuronal        ensembles.

OBJECTIVE: We        aimed to understand the transcriptome characteristics of the cortex of        neurodegenerative diseases and to provide an insight into the target genes of        differently expressed microRNAs in the occurrence and development of        neurodegenerative diseases. METHODS: The Limma package of R software was used to        analyze GSE33000, GSE157239, GSE64977 and GSE72962 datasets to identify the        differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and microRNAs in the cortex of        neurodegenerative diseases. Bioinformatics methods, such as GO enrichment        analysis, KEGG enrichment analysis and gene interaction network analysis, were        used to explore the biological functions of DEGs. Weighted gene co-expression        network analysis (WGCNA) was used to cluster DEGs into modules. RNA22, miRDB,        miRNet 2.0 and TargetScan7 databases were performed to predict the target genes        of microRNAs. RESULTS: Among 310 Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, 157        Huntington's disease (HD) patients and 157 non-demented control (Con)        individuals, 214 co-DEGs were identified. Those co-DEGs were filtered into 2        different interaction network complexes, representing immune-related genes and        synapserelated genes. The WGCNA results identified five modules: yellow, blue,        green, turquoise, and brown. Most of the co-DEGs were clustered into the        turquoise module and blue module, which respectively regulated synapse-related        function and immune-related function. In addition, human microRNA-4433        (hsa-miR-4443), which targets 18 co-DEGs, was the only 1 co-up-regulated microRNA        identified in the cortex of neurodegenerative diseases. CONCLUSION: 214 DEGs and        5 modules regulate the immune-related and synapse-related function of the cortex        in neurodegenerative diseases.

In this        study, we performed an eQTL analysis using single-nuclei RNA sequencing from 192        individuals in eight brain cell types derived from the prefrontal cortex,        temporal cortex and white matter. We identified 7,607 eGenes, a substantial        fraction (46%, 3,537/7,607) of which show cell-type-specific effects, with        strongest effects in microglia. Cell-type-level eQTLs affected more constrained        genes and had larger effect sizes than tissue-level eQTLs. Integration of brain        cell type eQTLs with genome-wide association studies (GWAS) revealed novel        relationships between expression and disease risk for neuropsychiatric and        neurodegenerative diseases. For most GWAS loci, a single gene co-localized in a        single cell type, providing new clues into disease etiology.

Currently, it is still unclear        how tau accumulates within specific cortical systems and whether in situ genetic        traits play a role in this circuit-based propagation progression. In this study,        using two independent cohorts of cognitively normal older participants, we reveal        the brain network foundation of tau spreading and its association with using        high-resolution transcriptomic genetic data. We observed that specific        connectomic and genetic gradients exist along the tau spreading network. In        particular, we identified 577 genes whose expression is associated with the        spatial spreading of tau. Within this set of genes, APOE and glutamatergic        synaptic genes, such as SLC1A2, play a central role. Thus, our study        characterizes neurogenetic topological vulnerabilities in distinctive brain        circuits of tau spreading and suggests that drug development strategies targeting        the gradient expression of this set of genes should be explored to help reduce or        prevent pathological tau accumulation.",PMC9942690,Science translational medicine,101505086

We predict that there is a        bidirectional promoter that potentially regulates the expression of THAP9 and        THAP9-AS1. Although both THAP9 and THAP9-AS1 are reported to be involved in        various cancers, their correlative roles on each other's expression has not been        explored. We analyzed the expression levels, prognosis, and predicted biological        functions of the two genes across different cancer datasets (TCGA, GTEx). We        observed that although the expression levels of the two genes, THAP9 and        THAP9-AS1, varied in different tumors, the expression of the gene pair was        strongly correlated with patient prognosis; higher expression of the gene pair        was usually linked to poor overall and disease-free survival. Thus, THAP9 and        THAP9-AS1 may serve as potential clinical biomarkers of tumor prognosis. Further,        we performed a gene co-expression analysis (using WGCNA) followed by a        differential gene correlation analysis (DGCA) across 22 cancers to identify genes        that share the expression pattern of THAP9 and THAP9-AS1. Interestingly, in both        normal and cancer samples, THAP9 and THAP9-AS1 often co-express; moreover, their        expression is positively correlated in each cancer type, suggesting the        coordinated regulation of this H2H gene pair.",PMC9326536,Non-coding RNA,101652294

Measurements of correlation most typically rely on        linear relationships. However, a linear relationship does not always model        pairwise functional-related dependence between genes. In this paper, we first        compared 6 different correlation methods in their ability to capture complex        dependence between genes in three different tissues. Next, we compared their        gene-pairwise coefficient results and corresponding WGCNA results. Finally, we        applied a recently proposed correlation method, Hellinger correlation, as a more        sensitive correlation measurement in WGCNA. To test this method, we constructed        gene networks containing co-expression gene modules from RNA-seq data of human        frontal cortex from Alzheimer's disease patients. To test the generality, we also        used a microarray data set from human frontal cortex, single cell RNA-seq data        from human prefrontal cortex, RNA-seq data from human temporal cortex, and GTEx        data from heart. The Hellinger correlation method captures essentially similar        results as other linear correlations in WGCNA, but provides additional new        functional relationships as exemplified by uncovering a link between inflammation        and mitochondria function. We validated the network constructed with the        microarray and single cell sequencing data sets and a RNA-seq dataset of temporal        cortex. We observed that this new correlation method enables the detection of        non-linear biologically meaningful relationships among genes robustly and        provides a complementary new approach to WGCNA.

Gene regulatory network, a key molecular        mechanism linking transcription factors (TFs) and regulatory elements to govern        gene expression, can change across cell types in the human brain and thus serve        as a model for studying gene dysregulation in AD. However, AD-induced regulatory        changes across brain cell types remains uncharted. To address this, we integrated        single-cell multi-omics datasets to predict the gene regulatory networks of four        major cell types, excitatory and inhibitory neurons, microglia and        oligodendrocytes, in control and AD brains. Importantly, we analyzed and compared        the structural and topological features of networks across cell types and        examined changes in AD. Our analysis shows that hub TFs are largely common across        cell types and AD-related changes are relatively more prominent in some cell        types (e.g., microglia). The regulatory logics of enriched network motifs (e.g.,        feed-forward loops) further uncover cell type-specific TF-TF cooperativities in        gene regulation. The cell type networks are also highly modular and several        network modules with cell-type-specific expression changes in AD pathology are        enriched with AD-risk genes. The further disease-module-drug association analysis        suggests cell-type candidate drugs and their potential target genes. Finally, our        network-based machine learning analysis systematically prioritized cell type risk        genes likely involved in AD. Our strategy is validated using an independent        dataset which showed that top ranked genes can predict clinical phenotypes (e.g.,        cognitive impairment) of AD with reasonable accuracy. Overall, this single-cell        network biology analysis provides a comprehensive map linking genes, regulatory        networks, cell types and drug targets and reveals cell-type gene dysregulation in        AD.",PMC9333448,PLoS computational biology,101238922

SARS-CoV-2 targets angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)        before entering vital organs of the body, including the brain. Studies have shown        systemic inflammation, cellular senescence, and viral toxicity-mediated        multi-organ failure occur during infectious periods. However, prognostic        investigations suggest that both acute and long-term neurological complications,        including predisposition to irreversible neurodegenerative diseases, can be a        serious concern for COVID-19 survivors, especially the elderly population.

METHODS: To better        understand the genetic contribution of this region to PD and to identify novel        mechanisms conferring risk for the disease, we fine-mapped the 17q21.31 locus by        constructing discrete haplotype blocks from genetic data. We used digital PCR to        assess copy number variation associated with PD-associated blocks, and used human        brain postmortem RNA-seq data to identify candidate genes that were then further        investigated using in vitro models and human brain tissue. RESULTS: We identified        three novel H1 sub-haplotype blocks across the 17q21.31 locus associated with PD        risk. Protective sub-haplotypes were associated with increased LRRC37A/2 copy        number and expression in human brain tissue. We found that LRRC37A/2 is a        membrane-associated protein that plays a role in cellular migration, chemotaxis        and astroglial inflammation. In human substantia nigra, LRRC37A/2 was primarily        expressed in astrocytes, interacted directly with soluble α-synuclein, and        co-localized with Lewy bodies in PD brain tissue. CONCLUSION: These data indicate        that a novel candidate gene, LRRC37A/2, contributes to the association between        the 17q21.31 locus and PD via its interaction with α-synuclein and its effects on        astrocytic function and inflammatory response. These data are the first to        associate the genetic association at the 17q21.31 locus with PD pathology, and        highlight the importance of variation at the 17q21.31 locus in the regulation of        multiple genes other than MAPT and KANSL1, as well as its relevance to        non-neuronal cell types.",PMC9284779,Molecular neurodegeneration,101266600

35820938,Modulation of C5a-C5aR1 signaling alters the dynamics of AD progression.,10.1186/s12974-022-02539-2,"BACKGROUND: The complement system is part of the innate immune system that clears        pathogens and cellular debris. In the healthy brain, complement influences        neurodevelopment and neurogenesis, synaptic pruning, clearance of neuronal blebs,        recruitment of phagocytes, and protects from pathogens. However, excessive        downstream complement activation that leads to generation of C5a, and C5a        engagement with its receptor C5aR1, instigates a feed-forward loop of        inflammation, injury, and neuronal death, making C5aR1 a potential therapeutic        target for neuroinflammatory disorders. C5aR1 ablation in the Arctic (Arc) model        of Alzheimer's disease protects against cognitive decline and neuronal injury        without altering amyloid plaque accumulation. METHODS: To elucidate the effects        of C5a-C5aR1 signaling on AD pathology, we crossed Arc mice with a        C5a-overexpressing mouse (ArcC5a+) and tested hippocampal memory. RNA-seq was        performed on hippocampus and cortex from Arc, ArcC5aR1KO, and ArcC5a+ mice at        2.7-10 months and age-matched controls to assess mechanisms involved in each        system. Immunohistochemistry was used to probe for protein markers of microglia        and astrocytes activation states. RESULTS: ArcC5a+ mice had accelerated cognitive        decline compared to Arc. Deletion of C5ar1 delayed or prevented the expression of        some, but not all, AD-associated genes in the hippocampus and a subset of        pan-reactive and A1 reactive astrocyte genes, indicating a separation between        genes induced by amyloid plaques alone and those influenced by C5a-C5aR1        signaling. Biological processes associated with AD and AD mouse models, including        inflammatory signaling, microglial cell activation, and astrocyte migration, were        delayed in the ArcC5aR1KO hippocampus. Interestingly, C5a overexpression also        delayed the increase of some AD-, complement-, and astrocyte-associated genes,        suggesting the possible involvement of neuroprotective C5aR2. However, these        pathways were enhanced in older ArcC5a+ mice compared to Arc.        Immunohistochemistry confirmed that C5a-C5aR1 modulation in Arc mice delayed the        increase in CD11c-positive microglia, while not affecting other pan-reactive        microglial or astrocyte markers. CONCLUSION: C5a-C5aR1 signaling in AD largely        exerts its effects by enhancing microglial activation pathways that accelerate        disease progression. While C5a may have neuroprotective effects via C5aR2,        engagement of C5a with C5aR1 is detrimental in AD models. These data support        specific pharmacological inhibition of C5aR1 as a potential therapeutic strategy        to treat AD.",PMC9277945,Journal of neuroinflammation,101222974

The overlap in symptoms is hypothesized to stem from        partially shared genetics and underlying neurobiological mechanisms. To delineate        conservation between transcriptional patterns across PTSD and MDD, the authors        examined gene expression in the human cortex and amygdala in these disorders.        METHODS: RNA sequencing was performed in the postmortem brain of two prefrontal        cortex regions and two amygdala regions from donors diagnosed with PTSD (N=107)        or MDD (N=109) as well as from neurotypical donors (N=109). RESULTS: The authors        identified a limited number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) specific to        PTSD, with nearly all mapping to cortical versus amygdala regions.

Emerging findings have revealed that disruption of        nuclear processes play key roles in ND pathogenesis. The nucleus is a nexus for        gene regulation and cellular processes that together, may underlie        pathomechanisms of NDs. Furthermore, many genetic risk factors for NDs encode        proteins that are either present in the nucleus or are involved in nuclear        processes (for example, RNA binding proteins, epigenetic regulators, or        nuclear-cytoplasmic transport proteins).

To shed light        into these questions, plasma levels of amyloid-β fragment 1-42 (Aβ(1-42)) and        neurofilament light chain (NfL) were measured using ultra-sensitive        single-molecule array (Simoa) assays, and the intracortical myelin content was        estimated with the ratio T1-weigthed/T2-weighted (T1w/T2w) in 133 cognitively        normal older adults.

We apply this protocol to in vivo RNA-seq data        from individuals with Alzheimer's disease and demonstrate how estimates of        differential stability can be leveraged to infer the regulatory factors        underlying them.",,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969

They play vital physiological roles in        the adult brain and during development. Microglia are particularly in the        spotlight because many genetic risk factors recently identified for        neurodegenerative diseases are largely expressed in microglia. Rare polymorphisms        in these risk alleles lead to abnormal activity of microglia under traumatic or        disease conditions. METHODS: In the present study, to investigate the        multifaceted functions of human microglia, we established a novel robust protocol        to generate microglia from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) using a        combination of cytokines and small chemicals essential for microglia ontogeny.        Moreover, we highly enhanced the microglial differentiation efficiency by forcing        the expression of PU.1, a crucial transcription factor for microglial        development, during posterior mesoderm differentiation. RESULTS: By our novel        method, we demonstrated the generation of a greater number of hiPSC-derived        microglia (hiMGLs, approximately 120-folds) than the prior methods (at most        40-folds). Over 90% of the hiMGLs expressed microglia-specific markers, such as        CX3CR1 and IBA-1. Whole-transcriptome analysis revealed that these hiMGLs are        similar to human primary microglia but differ from monocytes/macrophages.        Furthermore, the specific physiological functions of microglia were confirmed        through indices of lipopolysaccharide responsiveness, phagocytotic ability, and        inflammasome formation. By co-culturing these hiMGLs with mouse primary neurons,        we demonstrated that hiMGLs can regulate the activity and maturation of neurons.        CONCLUSIONS: In this study, our new simple, rapid, and highly efficient method        for generating microglia from hiPSCs will prove useful for future investigations        on microglia in both physiological and disease conditions, as well as for drug        discovery.",PMC9248164,Inflammation and regeneration,101479577

Here, to provide a better understanding of AHN        in primates and to reveal more novel markers for distinct cell types,        droplet-based single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) is used to investigate        the cellular heterogeneity and molecular characteristics of the hippocampi in        macaques across the lifespan and in aged humans. All of the major cell types in        the hippocampus and their expression profiles were identified. The dynamics of        the neurogenic lineage was revealed and the diversity of astrocytes and microglia        was delineated. In the neurogenic lineage, the regulatory continuum from adult        neural stem cells (NSCs) to immature and mature granule cells was investigated. A        group of primate-specific markers were identified. We validated ETNPPL as a        primate-specific NSC marker and verified STMN1 and STMN2 as immature neuron        markers in primates.

A decrease in autophagy during aging contributes to brain disorders by        accumulating potentially toxic substrates in neurons. Rubicon is a        well-established inhibitor of autophagy in all cells. However, Rubicon        participates in different pathways depending on cell type, and little information        is currently available on neuronal Rubicon's role in the AD context. Here, we        investigated the cell-specific expression of Rubicon in postmortem brain samples        from AD patients and 5xFAD mice and its impact on amyloid β burden in vivo and        neuroblastoma cells. Further, we assessed Rubicon levels in human-induced        pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), derived from early-to-moderate AD and in        postmortem samples from severe AD patients. We found increased Rubicon levels in        AD-hiPSCs and postmortem samples and a notable Rubicon localization in neurons.        In AD transgenic mice lacking Rubicon, we observed intensified amyloid β burden        in the hippocampus and decreased Pacer and p62 levels.

35706029,Microglial amyloid beta clearance is driven by PIEZO1 channels.,10.1186/s12974-022-02486-y,"BACKGROUND: Microglia are the endogenous immune cells of the brain and act as        sensors of pathology to maintain brain homeostasis and eliminate potential        threats. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), toxic amyloid beta (Aβ) accumulates in the        brain and forms stiff plaques. In late-onset AD accounting for 95% of all cases,        this is thought to be due to reduced clearance of Aβ. Human genome-wide        association studies and animal models suggest that reduced clearance results from        aberrant function of microglia. While the impact of neurochemical pathways on        microglia had been broadly studied, mechanical receptors regulating microglial        functions remain largely unexplored. METHODS: Here we showed that a        mechanotransduction ion channel, PIEZO1, is expressed and functional in human and        mouse microglia. We used a small molecule agonist, Yoda1, to study how activation        of PIEZO1 affects AD-related functions in human induced pluripotent stem cell        (iPSC)-derived microglia-like cells (iMGL) under controlled laboratory        experiments. Cell survival, metabolism, phagocytosis and lysosomal activity were        assessed using real-time functional assays. To evaluate the effect of activation        of PIEZO1 in vivo, 5-month-old 5xFAD male mice were infused daily with Yoda1 for        two weeks through intracranial cannulas. Microglial Iba1 expression and Aβ        pathology were quantified with immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy.        Published human and mouse AD datasets were used for in-depth analysis of PIEZO1        gene expression and related pathways in microglial subpopulations. RESULTS: We        show that PIEZO1 orchestrates Aβ clearance by enhancing microglial survival,        phagocytosis, and lysosomal activity. Aβ inhibited PIEZO1-mediated calcium        transients, whereas activation of PIEZO1 with a selective agonist, Yoda1,        improved microglial phagocytosis resulting in Aβ clearance both in human and        mouse models of AD. Moreover, PIEZO1 expression was associated with a unique        microglial transcriptional phenotype in AD as indicated by assessment of cellular        metabolism, and human and mouse single-cell datasets. CONCLUSION: These results        indicate that the compromised function of microglia in AD could be improved by        controlled activation of PIEZO1 channels resulting in alleviated Aβ burden.        Pharmacological regulation of these mechanoreceptors in microglia could represent        a novel therapeutic paradigm for AD.",PMC9199162,Journal of neuroinflammation,101222974

While mouse models based on overexpression of mutated        transgenes have yielded key insights in mechanisms of disease, those models are        subject to artifacts, including random genetic integration of the transgene,        ectopic expression and non-physiological protein levels. The genetic engineering        of novel mouse models using knock-in approaches addresses some of those        limitations. With mounting evidence of the role played by microglia in AD,        high-dimensional approaches to phenotype microglia in those models are critical        to refine our understanding of the immune response in the brain. METHODS: We        engineered a novel App knock-in mouse model (App(SAA)) using homologous        recombination to introduce three disease-causing coding mutations (Swedish,        Arctic and Austrian) to the mouse App gene. Amyloid-β pathology,        neurodegeneration, glial responses, brain metabolism and behavioral phenotypes        were characterized in heterozygous and homozygous App(SAA) mice at different ages        in brain and/ or biofluids. Wild type littermate mice were used as experimental        controls. We used in situ imaging technologies to define the whole-brain        distribution of amyloid plaques and compare it to other AD mouse models and human        brain pathology. To further explore the microglial response to AD relevant        pathology, we isolated microglia with fibrillar Aβ content from the brain and        performed transcriptomics and metabolomics analyses and in vivo brain imaging to        measure energy metabolism and microglial response. Finally, we also characterized        the mice in various behavioral assays. RESULTS: Leveraging multi-omics        approaches, we discovered profound alteration of diverse lipids and metabolites        as well as an exacerbated disease-associated transcriptomic response in microglia        with high intracellular Aβ content. The App(SAA) knock-in mouse model        recapitulates key pathological features of AD such as a progressive accumulation        of parenchymal amyloid plaques and vascular amyloid deposits, altered astroglial        and microglial responses and elevation of CSF markers of neurodegeneration. Those        observations were associated with increased TSPO and FDG-PET brain signals and a        hyperactivity phenotype as the animals aged. DISCUSSION: Our findings demonstrate        that fibrillar Aβ in microglia is associated with lipid dyshomeostasis consistent        with lysosomal dysfunction and foam cell phenotypes as well as profound        immuno-metabolic perturbations, opening new avenues to further investigate        metabolic pathways at play in microglia responding to AD-relevant pathogenesis.        The in-depth characterization of pathological hallmarks of AD in this novel and        open-access mouse model should serve as a resource for the scientific community        to investigate disease-relevant biology.",PMC9188195,Molecular neurodegeneration,101266600

However, the precise roles of microglia associated with mitigating ROS        damage, and molecular markers of heterogenetic microglia in the I/R damaged brain        has not been clarified. Here, we identified a new type of microglia associated        with stroke in the I/R injured brain.

We classified        a unique type of microglia with enhanced antioxidant function and markers similar        to those of disease-associated microglia (DAM), designated them as        stroke-associated microglia (SAM). The representative antioxidant enzyme,        Peroxiredoxin-1 (Prdx1), was predominantly expressed in SAM and mediated ROS        defense genes, including Txn1, Srx1, Mt1, and Mt2.

It was observed that CPF supplementation altered the specific        composition and function of gut microbiota and metabolites induced by circadian        rhythm disruption. Analysis showed that the abundance of Akkermansia increased,        while the abundance of Clostridiales and Ruminiclostridium displayed a        significant downward trend after the CPF intervention. Correlation analysis also        revealed that these gut microbes had certain correlations with the metabolites,        suggesting that CPFs help the intestinal microbiota to repair the intestinal        environment and modulate the release of some beneficial metabolites. Notably,        single-cell RNA-seq revealed that CPF supplementation significantly regulated the        expression of genes associated with circadian rhythm, myelination, and        neurodegenerative diseases.

Novel approaches using        circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) have the potential to revolutionize our        understanding of neurodegenerative disorders. Methods: We performed DNA        methylation profiling of cfDNA from AD patients and compared them to cognitively        normal controls. Six Artificial Intelligence (AI) platforms were utilized for the        diagnosis of AD while enrichment analysis was used to elucidate the pathogenesis        of AD. Results: A total of 3684 CpGs were significantly (adj. p-value < 0.05)        differentially methylated in AD versus controls. All six AI algorithms achieved        high predictive accuracy (AUC = 0.949−0.998) in an independent test group. As an        example, Deep Learning (DL) achieved an AUC (95% CI) = 0.99 (0.95−1.0), with        94.5% sensitivity and specificity. Conclusion: We describe numerous        epigenetically altered genes which were previously reported to be differentially        expressed in the brain of AD sufferers. Genes identified by AI to be the best        predictors of AD were either known to be expressed in the brain or have been        previously linked to AD. We highlight enrichment in the Calcium signaling        pathway, Glutamatergic synapse, Hedgehog signaling pathway, Axon guidance and        Olfactory transduction in AD sufferers.

The        intracellular aggregation of hyper-phosphorylated tau and the extracellular        aggregation of amyloid beta plaques form the basis of Alzheimer's disease        pathology. The major hallmark of Parkinson's disease is the loss of dopaminergic        neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, following the formation of Lewy        bodies, which consists primarily of alpha-synuclein aggregates.

Past        transcriptomic analyses in AD have revealed APOE genotype-specific transcriptomic        differences; however, these differences have not been explored at a single-cell        level. To elucidate more complex APOE genotype-specific disease-relevant changes        masked by the bulk analysis, we leverage the first two single-nucleus RNA        sequencing AD datasets from human brain samples, including nearly 55,000 cells        from the prefrontal and entorhinal cortices. In each brain region, we performed a        case versus control APOE genotype-stratified differential gene expression        analysis and pathway network enrichment in astrocytes, microglia, neurons,        oligodendrocytes, and oligodendrocyte progenitor cells. We observed more global        transcriptomic changes in APOE4 positive AD cells and identified differences        across APOE genotypes primarily in glial cell types.

For this,        diagnostic methods that can assess disease progression non-invasively before the        onset of AD symptoms are essential, and it would be valuable to incorporate the        concept of neurotheranostics, which simultaneously enables diagnosis and        treatment.

However, mechanisms        connecting AD with alcohol use have not been identified. Both heavy alcohol use        and AD feature increased proinflammatory signaling. Therefore, we hypothesized        that adolescent binge ethanol would increase AD molecular and behavioral        pathology in adulthood through proinflammatory signaling. The 3xTg-AD mouse model        (APPSwe, tauP301, Psen1(tm1Mpm)) which features amyloid (Aβ) and tau pathology        beginning at 6-12 months underwent adolescent intermittent ethanol (AIE,        5 g/kg/d, i.g., P25-55) with assessment of AD pathologic mediators at P200. A        second group of mice received AIE +/- minocycline (30 mg/kg/d, IP) followed by        behavioral testing in adulthood. Behavioral testing and age of testing included:        locomotor activity and exploration (27-28 weeks), novel object recognition (NORT,        28-30 weeks), 3-chamber sociability and social memory (29-31 weeks), prepulse        inhibition (PPI, 30-32 weeks), Morris Water Maze with reversal (MWM,        31-35 weeks), and Piezo sleep monitoring (35-37 weeks). We found that AIE        increased levels of neurotoxic Aβ(1-42) in adult female hippocampus as well as        intraneuronal Aβ(1-42) in amygdala and entorhinal cortex. Phosphorylated tau at        residue Thr181 (p-tau-181) was also increased in female hippocampus by AIE.        Several proinflammatory genes were persistently increased by AIE in the female        hippocampus, including IL-1β, MCP-1, IL-6, and IFNα. Expression of these genes        was strongly correlated with the levels of Aβ(1-42) and p-tau-181 in hippocampus.        AIE caused persistent decreases in locomotor activity (open-field and NORT        habituation) and increased anxiety-like behavior (thigmotaxis) while reducing        memory retention. Treatment with the anti-inflammatory compound minocycline        during AIE blocked persistent increases in Aβ(1-42) in amygdala and p-tau-181 in        hippocampus, and prevented AIE-induced thigmotaxis and memory loss. Together,        these data find that adolescent binge ethanol enhances AD molecular and        behavioral pathology in adulthood through proinflammatory signaling.

Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia, is        characterized by amyloid and tau pathology with amyloid accumulation thought to        precipitate tau pathology, neurodegeneration, and dementia. The Religious Orders        Study and Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP) cohort is a unique resource with        quantitative pathology from multiple brain regions, RNA sequencing, and        longitudinal cognitive data.

In the present study, we examined which pathologies        and genes were related to cognitive status (dementia, mild impairment, and no        cognitive impairment) and rate of cognitive decline. Tau load in the anterior        cingulate and ADAMTS2, encoding a metallopeptidase, were the respective regional        pathology and gene most associated with cognitive decline, while PRTN3, encoding        a serine protease, was the key protective feature. ADAMTS2, but not PRTN3, was        related to amyloid and tau load in the previous study while LTF was not related        to cognitive decline here.

Studying        individuals who are resilient to the cognitive consequences of Alzheimer's        disease neuropathology may uncover novel therapeutic targets to treat Alzheimer's        disease. It is well established that there are sex differences in response to        Alzheimer's disease pathology, and growing evidence suggests that genetic factors        may contribute to these differences. Taken together, we sought to elucidate        sex-specific genetic drivers of resilience. We extended our recent large scale        genomic analysis of resilience in which we harmonized cognitive data across four        cohorts of cognitive ageing, in vivo amyloid PET across two cohorts, and autopsy        measures of amyloid neuritic plaque burden across two cohorts. These data were        leveraged to build robust, continuous resilience phenotypes. With these        phenotypes, we performed sex-stratified [n (males) = 2093, n (females) = 2931]        and sex-interaction [n (both sexes) = 5024] genome-wide association studies        (GWAS), gene and pathway-based tests, and genetic correlation analyses to clarify        the variants, genes and molecular pathways that relate to resilience in a        sex-specific manner. Estimated among cognitively normal individuals of both        sexes, resilience was 20-25% heritable, and when estimated in either sex among        cognitively normal individuals, resilience was 15-44% heritable. In our GWAS, we        identified a female-specific locus on chromosome 10 [rs827389, β        (females) = 0.08, P (females) = 5.76 × 10-09, β (males) = -0.01, P(males) = 0.70,        β (interaction) = 0.09, P (interaction) = 1.01 × 10-04] in which the minor allele        was associated with higher resilience scores among females. This locus is located        within chromatin loops that interact with promoters of genes involved in RNA        processing, including GATA3. Finally, our genetic correlation analyses revealed        shared genetic architecture between resilience phenotypes and other complex        traits, including a female-specific association with frontotemporal dementia and        male-specific associations with heart rate variability traits. We also observed        opposing associations between sexes for multiple sclerosis, such that more        resilient females had a lower genetic susceptibility to multiple sclerosis, and        more resilient males had a higher genetic susceptibility to multiple sclerosis.        Overall, we identified sex differences in the genetic architecture of resilience,        identified a female-specific resilience locus and highlighted numerous        sex-specific molecular pathways that may underly resilience to Alzheimer's        disease pathology. This study illustrates the need to conduct sex-aware genomic        analyses to identify novel targets that are unidentified in sex-agnostic models.        Our findings support the theory that the most successful treatment for an        individual with Alzheimer's disease may be personalized based on their biological        sex and genetic context.",PMC9337804,Brain : a journal of neurology,0372537

Chaperone proteins perform vital functions in the        maintenance of cellular proteostasis, and chaperone-based therapies that promote        sequestration of toxic aggregates may prove useful in blocking the development of        neurodegenerative disease. We previously demonstrated that proSAAS, a small        secreted neuronal protein, exhibits potent chaperone activity against protein        aggregation in vitro and blocks the cytotoxic effects of amyloid and synuclein        oligomers in cell culture systems. We now examine whether cytoplasmic expression        of proSAAS results in interactions with protein aggregates in this cellular        compartment. We report that expression of proSAAS within the cytoplasm generates        dense, membraneless 2 μm proSAAS spheres which progressively fuse to form larger        spheres, suggesting liquid droplet-like properties. ProSAAS spheres selectively        accumulate a C-terminally truncated fluorescently tagged form of TDP-43,        initiating its cellular redistribution; these TDP-43-containing spheres also        exhibit dynamic fusion. Efficient encapsulation of TDP-43 into proSAAS spheres is        driven by its C-terminal prion-like domain; spheres must be formed for        sequestration to occur. Three proSAAS sequences, a predicted coiled-coil, a        conserved region (residues 158-169), and the positively charged sequence 181-185,        are all required for proSAAS to form spheres able to encapsulate TDP-43        aggregates. Substitution of lysines for arginines in the 181-185 sequence results        in nuclear translocation of proSAAS and encapsulation of nuclear-localized        TDP-43(216-414). As a functional output, we demonstrate that proSAAS expression        results in cytoprotection against full-length TDP-43 toxicity in yeast. We        conclude that proSAAS can act as a functional holdase for TDP-43 via this        phase-separation property, representing a cytoprotectant whose unusual        biochemical properties can potentially be exploited in the design of therapeutic        molecules.",PMC9731516,ACS chemical neuroscience,101525337

We developed a senescence eigengene approach        to identify these rare cells within large, diverse populations of postmortem        human brain cells. Eigengenes are useful when no single gene reliably captures a        phenotype, like senescence; they also help to reduce noise, which is important in        large transcriptomic datasets where subtle signals from low-expressing genes can        be lost. Each of our eigengenes detected ~2% senescent cells from a population of        ~140,000 single nuclei derived from 76 postmortem human brains with various        levels of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. More than 97% of the senescent        cells were excitatory neurons and overlapped with tau-containing neurofibrillary        tangles (NFTs). Cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 2D (CDKN2D/p19) was predicted        as the most significant contributor to the primary senescence eigengene.

OBJECTIVE: To determine if proSAAS        overexpression is neuroprotective in animal models of Parkinson's disease.        METHODS: proSAAS- or GFP-encoding lentivirus was injected together with human        aSyn-expressing AAV unilaterally into the substantia nigra of rats and motor        asymmetry assessed using a battery of motor performance tests. Dopamine neuron        survival was assessed by nigral stereology and striatal tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)        densitometry. To examine transsynaptic spread of aSyn, aSyn AAV was injected into        the vagus of mice in the presence of AAVs encoding either GFP or proSAAS; the        spread of aSyn-positive neurites into rostral nuclei was quantified following        immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Coinjection of proSAAS-encoding lentivirus        profoundly reduced the motor asymmetry caused by unilateral nigral AAV-mediated        human aSyn overexpression. This was accompanied by significant amelioration of        the human aSyn-induced loss of both nigral TH-positive cells and striatal        TH-positive terminals, demonstrating clear proSAAS-mediated protection of the        nigrostriatal tract. ProSAAS overexpression reduced human aSyn protein levels in        nigra and striatum and reduced the loss of TH protein in both regions. Following        vagal administration of human aSyn-encoding AAV, the number of human        aSyn-positive neurites in the pons and caudal midbrain was considerably reduced        in mice coinjected with proSAAS-, but not GFP-encoding AAV, supporting        proSAAS-mediated blockade of transsynaptic aSyn transmission.

Therefore, in iPSC-MG, ferritin appeared to be        regulated by iron revels rather than inflammation. Further investigation showed        that while IFN-γ induced pro-inflammatory activation, iron treatment dampened        both classic pro- and anti-inflammatory activation on a transcriptomic level.        Notably, iron-loaded microglia showed strong upregulation of cellular stress        response pathways, the NRF2 pathway, and other oxidative stress pathways.        Functionally, iPSC-MG exhibited altered phagocytosis and impaired mitochondrial        metabolism following iron treatment.

IDDs are characterized by significant impairment in        intellectual and adaptive functioning, and both genetic and environmental factors        underpin IDD biology. Molecular and genetic stratification of IDDs remain        challenging mainly due to overlapping factors and comorbidity. Advances in high        throughput sequencing, imaging, and tools to record behavioral data at scale have        greatly enhanced our understanding of the molecular, cellular, structural, and        environmental basis of some IDDs. Fueled by the ""big data"" revolution, artificial        intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies have brought a whole new        paradigm shift in computational biology. Evidently, the ML-driven approach to        clinical diagnoses has the potential to augment classical methods that use        symptoms and external observations, hoping to push the personalized treatment        plan forward. Therefore, integrative analyses and applications of ML technology        have a direct bearing on discoveries in IDDs. The application of ML to IDDs can        potentially improve screening and early diagnosis, advance our understanding of        the complexity of comorbidity, and accelerate the identification of biomarkers        for clinical research and drug development. For more than five decades, the IDDRC        network has supported a nexus of investigators at centers across the USA, all        striving to understand the interplay between various factors underlying IDDs. In        this review, we introduced fast-increasing multi-modal data types, highlighted        example studies that employed ML technologies to illuminate factors and        biological mechanisms underlying IDDs, as well as recent advances in ML        technologies and their applications to IDDs and other neurological diseases.

The accumulation of amyloid        beta (Aβ) in the brain has historically been associated with AD, and recent        evidence suggests that neuroinflammation plays a central role in its origin and        progression. These observations have given rise to the theory that Aβ is the        primary trigger of AD, and induces proinflammatory activation of immune brain        cells (i.e., microglia), which culminates in neuronal damage and cognitive        decline. To test this hypothesis, many in vitro systems have been established to        study Aβ-mediated activation of innate immune cells. Nevertheless, the        transcriptional resemblance of these models to the microglia in the AD brain has        never been comprehensively studied on a genome-wide scale. METHODS: We used bulk        RNA-seq to assess the transcriptional differences between in vitro cell types        used to model neuroinflammation in AD, including several established, primary and        iPSC-derived immune cell lines (macrophages, microglia and astrocytes) and their        similarities to primary cells in the AD brain. We then analyzed the        transcriptional response of these innate immune cells to synthetic Aβ or LPS and        INFγ. RESULTS: We found that human induced pluripotent stem cell (hIPSC)-derived        microglia (IMGL) are the in vitro cell model that best resembles primary        microglia. Surprisingly, synthetic Aβ does not trigger a robust transcriptional        response in any of the cellular models analyzed, despite testing a wide variety        of Aβ formulations, concentrations, and treatment conditions. Finally, we found        that bacterial LPS and INFγ activate microglia and induce transcriptional changes        that resemble many, but not all, aspects of the transcriptomic profiles of        disease associated microglia (DAM) present in the AD brain. CONCLUSIONS: These        results suggest that synthetic Aβ treatment of innate immune cell cultures does        not recapitulate transcriptional profiles observed in microglia from AD brains.        In contrast, treating IMGL with LPS and INFγ induces transcriptional changes        similar to those observed in microglia detected in AD brains.",PMC9034485,Journal of neuroinflammation,101222974

Age represents an important risk factor for the disease        but it is not known whether it is the trigger event. Materials and Methods: We        downloaded transcriptomic data related to post-mortem brain of thirty samples        gathered as young without AD (Young), old without AD (Old), and old suffering        from AD (OAD) groups. Results: Our results showed that steroid biosynthesis was        enriched and associated with aging, while sphingolipid metabolism was related to        both aging and AD. Specifically, sphingolipid metabolism is involved in the        deregulation of CERS2, UGT8, and PLPP2.

Moreover,        the analysis of the interaction networks revealed that GABAergic synapse and        Hippo signaling pathways were altered in AD condition along with mitochondrial        metabolism and RNA processing. Conclusions: Observing the particular trend of        genes related to sphingolipid metabolism that are downregulated during normal        aging and start to be upregulated with the onset of AD, we suppose that        sphingolipids could be early markers for the disease.",PMC9025366,"Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",9425208

Studies of AD patients, AD        patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons and cerebral        organoids, and human apoE4-expressing and apoE-deficient mouse models clearly        demonstrate that apoE4 provokes neuroinflammation, impairs cerebrovasculature,        and exacerbates amyloid and tau pathologies. ApoE expression is greatly        up-regulated in disease-associated microglia in mouse models of amyloidosis and        in human microglia from AD brains.

As positive effectors, microglia clear toxic proteins, whereas        as negative effectors, they release proinflammatory mediators. An imbalance of        these functions contributes to AD progression. Polymorphisms of human CD33, an        inhibitory microglial receptor, are linked to AD susceptibility; higher CD33        expression correlates with increased AD risk. CD33, also called Siglec-3, is a        member of the sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-type lectin (Siglec) family of        immune regulatory receptors. Siglec-mediated inhibition is initiated by binding        to complementary sialoglycan ligands in the tissue environment. Here, we identify        a single sialoglycoprotein in human cerebral cortex that binds CD33 as well as        Siglec-8, the most abundant Siglec on human microglia. The ligand, which we term        receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase zeta (RPTPζ)(S3L), is composed of        sialylated keratan sulfate chains carried on a minor isoform/glycoform of RPTPζ        (phosphacan) and is found in the extracellular milieu of the human brain        parenchyma.

Chronic inflammatory responses, oxidative stress,        unbalanced phagocytosis, or alteration of their core physiological roles are the        main manifestations of their detrimental states. However, if astrocytes are        directly involved in brain deterioration by exerting neurotoxic functions in        patients with NDDs is still controversial. The large spectrum of NDDs, with often        overlapping pathologies, and the technical challenges associated with the study        of human brain samples complexify the analysis of astrocyte involvement in        specific neurodegenerative cascades. With this review, we aim to provide a        translational overview about the multi-facets of astrocyte neurotoxicity ranging        from in vitro findings over mouse and human cell-based studies to rodent NDDs        research and finally evidence from patient-related research.

Compared with the pathology of CAA in humans, the pathology in most mouse        models of AD is not as evident, making it difficult to examine the contribution        of CAA to the pathogenesis of AD. On the basis of biochemical analyses that        showed blood levels of soluble amyloid precursor protein (APP) in rats and mice        were markedly lower than those measured in human samples, we hypothesized that        endothelial APP expression would be markedly lower in rodents and subsequently        generated mice that specifically express human WT APP (APP770) in endothelial        cells (ECs). The resulting EC-APP770(+) mice exhibited increased levels of serum        Aβ and soluble APP, indicating that endothelial APP makes a critical contribution        to blood Aβ levels. Even though aged EC-APP770(+) mice did not exhibit Aβ        deposition in the cortical blood vessels, crossing these animals with APP        knock-in mice (App(NL-F/NL-F)) led to an expanded CAA pathology, as evidenced by        increased amounts of amyloid accumulated in the cortical blood vessels.

The mRNA expression dataset,        GSE28146, containing 15 sample data composed of 7 AD cases from the hippocampus        region with age-matched control (n = 8, >80 years), was analyzed.

RAs perform multiple functions after stroke. The inflammatory        response of RAs may aggravate neuro-inflammation and release toxic factors to        exert neurological damage. However, RAs also reduce excitotoxicity and release        neurotrophies to promote neuroprotection.

First, the Wnt antagonist DKK1 is elevated in AD brains and is        required for amyloid-β-induced synapse loss. Second, LRP6 Wnt co-receptor is        required for synapse integrity and three variants of this receptor are linked to        late-onset AD. However, the expression/role of other Wnt signalling components        remain poorly explored in AD. Wnt receptors Frizzled1 (Fzd1), Fzd5, Fzd7 and Fzd9        are of interest due to their role in synapse formation/plasticity. Our analyses        showed reduced FZD1 and FZD7 mRNA levels in the hippocampus of human early AD        stages and in the hAPP(NLGF/NLGF) mouse model. This transcriptional        downregulation was accompanied by reduced levels of the pro-transcriptional        histone mark H4K16ac and a concomitant increase of its deacetylase Sirt2 at Fzd1        and Fzd7 promoters in AD. In vitro and in vivo inhibition of Sirt2 rescued Fzd1        and Fzd7 mRNA expression and H4K16ac levels at their promoters. In addition, we        showed that Sirt2 recruitment to Fzd1 and Fzd7 promoters is dependent on FoxO1        activity in AD, thus acting as a co-repressor. Finally, we found reduced levels        of SIRT2 inhibitory phosphorylation in nuclear samples from human early AD stages        with a concomitant increase in the SIRT2 phosphatase PP2C.

The activation of microglia, the brain immune cells, could play a role in its        selective volume loss. How subregional microglia populations vary within AD or        DLB and across these conditions remains poorly understood. Furthermore, how the        nature of the hippocampal local pathological imprint is associated with microglia        responses needs to be elucidated.

Here, using single-cell        transcriptomic analyses combined with classic anatomical, behavioral,        electrophysiological analyses, we report, with single-cell resolution, temporal        molecular and cellular changes in crush-injured adult mouse spinal cord. Data        revealed pathological changes of 12 different major cell types, three of which        infiltrated into the spinal cord at distinct times post-injury. We discovered        novel microglia and astrocyte subtypes in the uninjured spinal cord, and their        dynamic conversions into additional stage-specific subtypes/states. Most dynamic        changes occur at 3-days post-injury and by day-14 the second wave of microglial        activation emerged, accompanied with changes in various cell types including        neurons, indicative of the second round of attacks.

We collected 17 urine samples from 12 FSGS        subjects and captured these as 23 urine cell samples. The inflammatory signatures        from renal epithelial and immune cells were evaluated in bulk gene expression        data sets of FSGS and minimal change disease (MCD) (The Nephrotic Syndrome Study        Network [NEPTUNE] study) and an immune single-cell data set from lupus nephritis        (Accelerating Medicines Partnership). RESULTS: We identified immune cells,        predominantly monocytes, and renal epithelial cells in the urine. Further        analysis revealed 2 monocyte subtypes consistent with M1 and M2 monocytes. Shed        podocytes in the urine had high expression of marker genes for        epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT).

We have        developed a methodology of cyclic multiplex fluorescent immunohistochemistry on        human postmortem brains and image analysis that enables a comprehensive        morphological quantitative characterization of astrocytes and microglia in the        context of their spatial relationships with plaques and tangles. METHODS: Single        FFPE sections from the temporal association cortex of control and AD subjects        were subjected to 8 cycles of multiplex fluorescent immunohistochemistry,        including 7 astroglial, 6 microglial, 1 neuronal, Aβ, and phospho-tau markers.        Our analysis pipeline consisted of: (1) image alignment across cycles; (2)        background subtraction; (3) manual annotation of 5172 ALDH1L1+ astrocytic and        6226 IBA1+ microglial profiles; (4) local thresholding and segmentation of        profiles; (5) machine learning on marker intensity data; and (6) deep learning on        image features. RESULTS: Spectral clustering identified three phenotypes of        astrocytes and microglia, which we termed ""homeostatic,"" ""intermediate,"" and        ""reactive."" Reactive and, to a lesser extent, intermediate astrocytes and        microglia were closely associated with AD pathology (≤ 50 µm). Compared to        homeostatic, reactive astrocytes contained substantially higher GFAP and YKL-40,        modestly elevated vimentin and TSPO as well as EAAT1, and reduced GS.        Intermediate astrocytes had markedly increased EAAT2, moderately increased GS,        and intermediate GFAP and YKL-40 levels. Relative to homeostatic, reactive        microglia showed increased expression of all markers (CD68, ferritin, MHC2,        TMEM119, TSPO), whereas intermediate microglia exhibited increased ferritin and        TMEM119 as well as intermediate CD68 levels. Machine learning models applied on        either high-plex signal intensity data (gradient boosting machines) or directly        on image features (convolutional neural networks) accurately discriminated        control vs. AD diagnoses at the single-cell level. CONCLUSIONS: Cyclic multiplex        fluorescent immunohistochemistry combined with machine learning models holds        promise to advance our understanding of the complexity and heterogeneity of glial        responses as well as inform transcriptomics studies. Three distinct phenotypes        emerged with our combination of markers, thus expanding the classic binary        ""homeostatic vs. reactive"" classification to a third state, which could represent        ""transitional"" or ""resilient"" glia.",PMC8808995,Journal of neuroinflammation,101222974

The initial important step of analyzing scRNA-seq data is usually to        accurately annotate cells. The traditional approach of annotating cell types        based on unsupervised clustering and marker genes is time-consuming and        laborious. Taking advantage of the numerous existing scRNA-seq databases, many        supervised label assignment methods have been developed. One feature that many        label assignment methods shares is to label cells with low confidence as        ""unassigned."" These unassigned cells can be the result of assignment difficulties        due to highly similar cell types or caused by the presence of unknown cell types.        However, when unknown cell types are not expected, existing methods still label a        considerable number of cells as unassigned, which is not desirable. In this work,        we develop a neural network-based cell annotation method called NeuCA (Neural        network-based Cell Annotation) for scRNA-seq data obtained from well-studied        tissues. NeuCA can utilize the hierarchical structure information of the cell        types to improve the annotation accuracy, which is especially helpful when data        contain closely correlated cell types. We show that NeuCA can achieve more        accurate cell annotation results compared with existing methods.

In this        study, we investigated the performances of 8 supervised and 10 unsupervised cell        type identification methods using 14 public scRNA-seq datasets of different        tissues, sequencing protocols and species. We investigated the impacts of a        number of factors, including total amount of cells, number of cell types,        sequencing depth, batch effects, reference bias, cell population imbalance,        unknown/novel cell type, and computational efficiency and scalability. Instead of        merely comparing individual methods, we focused on factors' impacts on the        general category of supervised and unsupervised methods. We found that in most        scenarios, the supervised methods outperformed the unsupervised methods, except        for the identification of unknown cell types. This is particularly true when the        supervised methods use a reference dataset with high informational sufficiency,        low complexity and high similarity to the query dataset. However, such        outperformance could be undermined by some undesired dataset properties        investigated in this study, which lead to uninformative and biased reference        datasets.

METHODS: To address this critical        problem in the field, we have developed a network-based artificial intelligence        framework that is capable of integrating multi-omics data along with human        protein-protein interactome networks to accurately infer accurate drug targets        impacted by GWAS-identified variants to identify new therapeutics. When applied        to AD, this approach integrates GWAS findings, multi-omics data from brain        samples of AD patients and AD transgenic animal models, drug-target networks, and        the human protein-protein interactome, along with large-scale patient database        validation and in vitro mechanistic observations in human microglia cells.        RESULTS: Through this approach, we identified 103 ARGs validated by various        levels of pathobiological evidence in AD. Via network-based prediction and        population-based validation, we then showed that three drugs (pioglitazone,        febuxostat, and atenolol) are significantly associated with decreased risk of AD        compared with matched control populations. Pioglitazone usage is significantly        associated with decreased risk of AD (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.916, 95% confidence        interval [CI] 0.861-0.974, P = 0.005) in a retrospective case-control validation.        Pioglitazone is a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) agonist used        to treat type 2 diabetes, and propensity score matching cohort studies confirmed        its association with reduced risk of AD in comparison to glipizide (HR = 0.921,        95% CI 0.862-0.984, P = 0.0159), an insulin secretagogue that is also used to        treat type 2 diabetes.

Starting from the cross-sectional data in the Religious Orders Study        and Memory and Aging Project cohort (n = 634), a deep learning framework was        built to obtain a trajectory that mirrors Alzheimer's disease progression. A        severity index was defined to quantitatively measure the progression based on the        trajectory. Network analysis was then carried out to identify key gene (index        gene) modules present in the model underlying the progression. Within this data        set, severity indexes were found to be very closely correlated with all        Alzheimer's disease neuropathology biomarkers (R ∼ 0.5, P < 1e-11) and global        cognitive function (R = -0.68, P < 2.2e-16).

We validate our estimates of neuronal loss using        neuropathological atrophy scores and show that neuronal loss in the cortex can be        mainly attributed to excitatory neurons, and that increases in microglial and        endothelial cell expression are highly correlated with neuronal loss. All our        analyses identified a strong involvement of the cerebellum in the        neurodegenerative process of FTLD-TDP.

Due to its long clinical course and lack of an effective treatment, AD        has become a major public health problem in the USA and worldwide. Due to        variation in age-at-onset, AD is classified into early-onset (< 60 years) and        late-onset (≥ 60 years) forms with early-onset accounting for only 5-10% of all        cases. With the exception of a small number of early-onset cases that are        afflicted because of high penetrant single gene mutations in APP, PSEN1, and        PSEN2 genes, AD is genetically heterogeneous, especially the late-onset form        having a polygenic or oligogenic risk inheritance.

The dynamic nature of        neurological aging is exemplified during midlife in the female brain. To        investigate fundamental mechanisms of midlife aging that underlie risk for        development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in late life, we investigated the brain        at greatest risk for the disease, the aging female brain. Outcomes of our        research indicate that mid-life aging in the female is characterized by the        emergence of three phases: early chronological (pre-menopause), endocrinological        (peri-menopause) and late chronological (post-menopause) aging. The        endocrinological aging program is sandwiched between early and late chronological        aging. Throughout the three stages of midlife aging, two systems of biology,        metabolic and immune, are tightly integrated through a network of signaling        cascades. The network of signaling between these two systems of biology underlie        an orchestrated sequence of adaptative starvation responses that shift the brain        from near exclusive dependence on a single fuel, glucose, to utilization of an        auxiliary fuel derived from lipids, ketone bodies. The dismantling of the        estrogen control of glucose metabolism during mid-life aging is a critical        contributor to the shift in fuel systems and emergence of dynamic neuroimmune        phenotype. The shift in fuel reliance, puts the largest reservoir of local fatty        acids, white matter, at risk for catabolism as a source of lipids to generate        ketone bodies through astrocytic beta oxidation. APOE4 genotype accelerates the        tipping point for emergence of the bioenergetic crisis. While outcomes derived        from research conducted in the female brain are not directly translatable to the        male brain, the questions addressed in a female centric program of research are        directly applicable to investigation of the male brain. Like females, males with        AD exhibit deficits in the bioenergetic system of the brain, activation of the        immune system and hallmark Alzheimer's pathologies. The drivers and trajectory of        mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration in the male brain will undoubtedly share        common aspects with the female in addition to factors unique to the male.        Preclinical and clinical evidence indicate that midlife endocrine aging can also        be a transitional bridge to autoimmune disorders. Collectively, the data indicate        that endocrinological aging is a critical period ""tipping point"" in midlife which        can initiate emergence of the prodromal stage of late-onset-Alzheimer's disease.        Interventions that target both immune and metabolic shifts that occur during        midlife aging have the potential to alter the trajectory of Alzheimer's risk in        late life. Further, to achieve precision medicine for AD, chromosomal sex is a        critical variable to consider along with APOE genotype, other genetic risk        factors and stage of disease.",PMC8884386,Ageing research reviews,101128963

Genome-wide association studies have        linked multiple AD genetic risk factors to microglia-specific pathways. It is        plausible that microglia-derived EVs may play a role in the progression of AD by        contributing to the dissemination of insoluble pathogenic proteins, such as tau        and Aβ. Despite the potential utility of EVs as a diagnostic tool, our knowledge        of human brain EV subpopulations is limited. Here we present a method for        isolating microglial CD11b-positive small EVs from cryopreserved human brain        tissue, as well as an integrated multiomics analysis of microglial EVs enriched        from the parietal cortex of four late-stage AD (Braak V-VI) and three age-matched        normal/low pathology (NL) cases. This integrated analysis revealed 1,000        proteins, 594 lipids, and 105 miRNAs using shotgun proteomics, targeted        lipidomics, and NanoString nCounter technology, respectively. The results showed        a significant reduction in the abundance of homeostatic microglia markers P2RY12        and TMEM119, and increased levels of disease-associated microglia markers FTH1        and TREM2, in CD11b-positive EVs from AD brain compared to NL cases. Tau        abundance was significantly higher in AD brain-derived microglial EVs. These        changes were accompanied by the upregulation of synaptic and neuron-specific        proteins in the AD group. Levels of free cholesterol were elevated in microglial        EVs from the AD brain. Lipidomic analysis also revealed a proinflammatory lipid        profile, endolysosomal dysfunction, and a significant AD-associated decrease in        levels of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)-containing polyunsaturated lipids,        suggesting a potential defect in acyl-chain remodeling. Additionally, four miRNAs        associated with immune and cellular senescence signaling pathways were        significantly upregulated in the AD group. Our data suggest that loss of the        homeostatic microglia signature in late AD stages may be accompanied by        endolysosomal impairment and the release of undigested neuronal and myelin        debris, including tau, through extracellular vesicles. We suggest that the        analysis of microglia-derived EVs has merit for identifying novel EV-associated        biomarkers and providing a framework for future larger-scale multiomics studies        on patient-derived cell-type-specific EVs.",PMC8675946,Frontiers in pharmacology,101548923

How aging        contributes to the development of LOAD remains elusive. In this study, we        examined multiple large-scale transcriptomic datasets from both normal aging and        LOAD brains to understand the molecular interconnection between aging and LOAD.        We found that shared gene expression changes between aging and LOAD are mostly        seen in the hippocampal and several cortical regions. In the hippocampus, the        expression of phosphoprotein, alternative splicing and cytoskeleton genes are        commonly changed in both aging and AD, while synapse, ion transport, and synaptic        vesicle genes are commonly down-regulated. Aging-specific changes are associated        with acetylation and methylation, while LOAD-specific changes are more related to        glycoprotein (both up- and down-regulations), inflammatory response        (up-regulation), myelin sheath and lipoprotein (down-regulation). We also found        that normal aging brain transcriptomes from relatively young donors (45-70 years        old) clustered into several subgroups and some subgroups showed gene expression        changes highly similar to those seen in LOAD brains. Using brain transcriptomic        datasets from another cohort of older individuals (>70 years), we found that        samples from cognitively normal older individuals clustered with the ""healthy        aging"" subgroup while AD samples mainly clustered with the ""AD similar""        subgroups. This may imply that individuals in the healthy aging subgroup will        likely remain cognitively normal when they become older and vice versa. In        summary, our results suggest that on the transcriptome level, aging and LOAD have        strong interconnections in some brain regions in a subpopulation of cognitively        normal aging individuals. This supports the theory that the initiation of LOAD        occurs decades earlier than the manifestation of clinical phenotype and it may be        essential to closely study the ""normal brain aging"" to identify the very early        molecular events that may lead to LOAD development.",PMC8675870,Frontiers in aging neuroscience,101525824

The primary dementia-protective benefits of angiotensin II subtype 1        receptor (AT1R) blockers are believed to arise from systemic effects on blood        pressure. However, a brain-specific renin-angiotensin system (b-RAS) exists,        which can be altered by AT1R blockers. Brain RAS acts mainly through 3        angiotensin receptors: AT1R, AT2R, and AT4R.

From the 10        cases analyzed, 62 proteins were identified in at least two AD cases and two        control cases. Creatine kinase B-type (CKB), 14-3-3-γ, and heat shock cognate 71        (Hsc71), which have not been extensively studied in the context of the human AD        brain previously, were selected for further studies by immunohistochemistry        (IHC). In hippocampus, semi-quantitative measures of IHC staining of the three        proteins confirmed the findings from our proteomic analysis. Studies of the same        proteins in the frontal cortex revealed that the alterations remained for CKB and        14-3-3-γ but not for Hsc71. Protein upregulation in CA1 neurons of final stage AD        is either a result of detrimental, pathological effects, or from cell-specific        protective response mechanisms in surviving neurons. Based on previous findings        from experimental studies, CKB and Hsc71 likely exhibit protective effects,        whereas 14-3-3-γ may represent a detrimental pathway. These new players could        reflect pathways of importance for the development of new therapeutic strategies.",PMC8641652,Frontiers in aging neuroscience,101525824

Microglia, the brain-resident        macrophages, are particularly vulnerable to lysosome dysfunction because of the        phagocytic stress of clearing dying neurons, myelin, and debris. CD22 is a        negative regulator of microglial homeostasis in the aging mouse brain, and        soluble CD22 (sCD22) is increased in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with        Niemann-Pick type C disease (NPC). However, the role of CD22 in the human brain        remains unknown. In contrast to previous findings in mice, here, we show that        CD22 is expressed by oligodendrocytes in the human brain and binds to sialic        acid–dependent ligands on microglia. Using unbiased genetic and proteomic        screens, we identify insulin-like growth factor 2 receptor (IGF2R) as the binding        partner of sCD22 on human myeloid cells. Targeted truncation of IGF2R revealed        that sCD22 docks near critical mannose 6-phosphate–binding domains, where it        disrupts lysosomal protein trafficking.

The cerebral circulation plays multiple roles underscoring optimal brain        perfusion and cognition entailing moment-to-moment blood flow control, vascular        permeability, and angiogenesis. With currently no effective treatment to prevent        or delay the progression of AD, cerebrovascular microRNA (miRNA) markers        corresponding to post-transcriptional regulation may distinguish phases of AD.        OBJECTIVE: We tested the hypothesis that cerebrovascular miRNA expression        profiles indicate developmental stages of AD pathology. METHODS: Total RNA was        isolated from total brain vessel segments of male and female 3xTg-AD mice [young,        1-2 mo; cognitive impairment (CI), 4-5 mo; extracellular amyloid-β plaques (Aβ),        6-8 mo; plaques+neurofibrillary tangles (AβT), 12-15 mo].

METHODS: Brain levels of full-length protein (fl-hAPP), C-terminal        fragments (hCTFs), and amyloid beta (Aβ) peptides were measured in DS, AD-DS,        non-demented controls (ND), and sporadic AD cases.

In this review, we        summarize the genetic and transcriptomic studies of Alzheimer's disease and        related tauopathies and focus on the advantages of performing systems-level        analyses to interrogate the biological pathways underlying neurodegeneration.        Finally, we highlight new avenues of multi-omics analysis with single-cell        approaches, which provide unparalleled opportunities to systematically explore        cellular heterogeneity, and present an example of how to integrate publicly        available single-cell datasets. Systems-level analysis has illuminated the        function of many disease risk genes, but much work remains to study tauopathies        and to understand spatiotemporal gene expression changes of specific cell types.",PMC8616667,Neurobiology of disease,9500169

Microglia emerge from early erythromyeloid progenitors of the        yolk sac and enter the developing brain before the establishment of a fully        mature blood-brain barrier. In physiological conditions, during brain        development, microglia contribute to CNS homeostasis by supporting cell        proliferation of neural precursors. In post-natal life, such cells contribute to        preserving the integrity of neuronal circuits by sculpting synapses. After a CNS        injury, microglia change their morphology and down-regulate those genes        supporting homeostatic functions. However, it is still unclear whether such        changes are accompanied by molecular and functional modifications that might        contribute to the pathological process. While comprehensive transcriptome        analyses at the single-cell level have identified specific gene perturbations        occurring in the ""pathological"" microglia, still the precise        protective/detrimental role of microglia in neurological disorders is far from        being fully elucidated. In this review, the results so far obtained regarding the        role of microglia in neurodegenerative disorders will be discussed.

However, the function of OAS1 within microglia was not known. Using        genotyping from 1313 individuals with sporadic Alzheimer's disease and 1234        control individuals, we confirm the OAS1 variant, rs1131454, is associated with        increased risk for Alzheimer's disease. The same OAS1 locus has been recently        associated with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcomes, linking risk        for both diseases. The single nucleotide polymorphisms rs1131454(A) and        rs4766676(T) are associated with Alzheimer's disease, and rs10735079(A) and        rs6489867(T) are associated with severe COVID-19, where the risk alleles are        linked with decreased OAS1 expression.

Its onset is        insidious and its progression is slow, making diagnosis difficult. In addition,        its underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms remain unclear. In this study,        clustering analysis was performed on single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data        from the prefrontal cortex of 48 AD patients. Each sample module was identified        to be a specific AD cell type, eight main brain cell types were identified, and        the dysfunctional evolution of each cell type was further explored by pseudo-time        analysis. Correlation analysis was then used to explore the relationship between        AD cell types and pathological characteristics. In particular, intercellular        communication between neurons and glial cells in AD patients was investigated by        cell communication analysis. In patients, neuronal cells and glial cells        significantly correlated with pathological features, and glial cells appear to        play a key role in the development of AD through ligand-receptor axis        communication.

The complex        cellular microenvironment in the AD brain impedes our understanding of        pathogenesis. Thus, a comprehensive investigation of cell type-specific responses        in AD is crucial to provide precise molecular and cellular targets for        therapeutic development. METHODS: Here, we integrated analyzed 4,441        differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that were identified from 263,370        single-cells in cortex samples by single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq)        between 42 AD-pathology subjects and 39 normal controls within 3 studies. DEGs        were analyzed in microglia, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, excitatory neurons,        inhibitory neurons, and endothelial cells, respectively. In each cell type, we        identified both common DEGs which were observed in all 3 studies, and overlapping        DEGs which have been seen in at least 2 studies. Firstly, we showed the common        DEGs expression and explained the biological functions by comparing with existing        literature or multil-omics signaling pathways knowledgebase. We then determined        the significant modules and hub genes, and explored the biological processes        using the overlapping DEGs. Finally, we identified the common and distinct        dysregulated pathways using overall DEGs and overlapping DEGs in a cell        type-specific manner. RESULTS: Up-regulated LINGO1 has been seen in both        oligodendrocytes and excitatory neurons across 3 studies. Interestingly, genes        enriched in the mitochondrial module were up-regulated across all cell types,        which indicates mitochondrial dysfunction in the AD brain. The estrogen signaling        pathway seems to be the most common pathway that is disrupted in AD. CONCLUSION:        Together, these analyses provide detailed information of cell type-specific and        overall transcriptional changes and pathways underlying the human AD-pathology.        These findings may provide important insights for drug development to tackle this        disease.",PMC8487122,BMC neurology,100968555

Within the rewired brain ecosystem, glial cell subpopulations are        emerging hubs modulating the dialogue between the Immune System and the Central        Nervous System with important consequences in the progression of brain tumors and        other disorders. Single cell technologies are crucial not only to define and        track the origin of disease-associated cell types, but also to identify their        molecular similarities and differences that might be linked to specific brain        injuries. These altered molecular patterns derived from reprogramming the healthy        brain into an injured organ, might provide a new generation of therapeutic        targets to challenge highly prevalent and lethal brain disorders that remain        incurable with unprecedented specificity and limited toxicities. In this        perspective, we present the most relevant clinical and pre-clinical work        regarding the characterization of the heterogeneity within different components        of the microenvironment in the healthy and injured brain with a special interest        on single cell analysis. Finally, we discuss how understanding the diversity of        the brain microenvironment could be exploited for translational purposes,        particularly in primary and secondary tumors affecting the brain.",PMC8440906,Frontiers in oncology,101568867

We identified gene coexpression networks        enriched with genetic signals for Alzheimer disease and characterized the        associated networks using biological pathway analysis. The disease-implicated        modules were subsequently used as a molecular substrate for a computational drug        repositioning analysis, in which we (1) imputed genetically regulated gene        expression within Alzheimer disease implicated modules; (2) integrated the        imputed gene expression levels with drug-gene signatures from the connectivity        map to identify compounds that normalize dysregulated gene expression underlying        Alzheimer disease; and (3) prioritized drug compounds and mechanisms of action        based on the extent to which they normalize dysregulated expression signatures.        RESULTS: Genetic factors for Alzheimer disease are enriched in brain gene        coexpression networks involved in the immune response.

Recently more        attention has been given to the role of astrocytes in the process of        neurodegeneration.

Accumulating evidence suggests that chronic        neuroinflammation, mainly mediated by microglia and astrocytes, plays a causative        role in neurodegeneration in AD. Our group and others have reported early and        dramatic losses of brain sulfatide in AD cases and animal models that are        mediated by ApoE in an isoform-dependent manner and accelerated by Aβ        accumulation. To date, it remains unclear if changes in specific brain lipids are        sufficient to drive AD-related pathology. METHODS: To study the consequences of        CNS sulfatide deficiency and gain insights into the underlying mechanisms, we        developed a novel mouse model of adult-onset myelin sulfatide deficiency, i.e.,        tamoxifen-inducible myelinating glia-specific cerebroside sulfotransferase (CST)        conditional knockout mice (CST(fl/fl)/Plp1-CreERT), took advantage of        constitutive CST knockout mice (CST(-/-)), and generated CST/ApoE double knockout        mice (CST(-/-)/ApoE(-/-)), and assessed these mice using a broad range of        methodologies including lipidomics, RNA profiling, behavioral testing,        PLX3397-mediated microglia depletion, mass spectrometry (MS) imaging,        immunofluorescence, electron microscopy, and Western blot. RESULTS: We found that        mild central nervous system (CNS) sulfatide losses within myelinating cells are        sufficient to activate disease-associated microglia and astrocytes, and to        increase the expression of AD risk genes (e.g., Apoe, Trem2, Cd33, and Mmp12), as        well as previously established causal regulators of the immune/microglia network        in late-onset AD (e.g., Tyrobp, Dock, and Fcerg1), leading to chronic AD-like        neuroinflammation and mild cognitive impairment. Notably, neuroinflammation and        mild cognitive impairment showed gender differences, being more pronounced in        females than males. Subsequent mechanistic studies demonstrated that although CNS        sulfatide losses led to ApoE upregulation, genetically-induced myelin sulfatide        deficiency led to neuroinflammation independently of ApoE. These results,        together with our previous studies (sulfatide deficiency in the context of AD is        mediated by ApoE and accelerated by Aβ accumulation) placed both Aβ and ApoE        upstream of sulfatide deficiency-induced neuroinflammation, and suggested a        positive feedback loop where sulfatide losses may be amplified by increased ApoE        expression. We also demonstrated that CNS sulfatide deficiency-induced        astrogliosis and ApoE upregulation are not secondary to microgliosis, and that        astrogliosis and microgliosis seem to be driven by activation of STAT3 and        PU.1/Spi1 transcription factors, respectively. CONCLUSION: Our results strongly        suggest that sulfatide deficiency is an important contributor and driver of        neuroinflammation and mild cognitive impairment in AD pathology.",PMC8442347,Molecular neurodegeneration,101266600

The mechanism        through which TREM2 contributes to the disease (TREM2 activation vs inactivation)        is largely unknown. Here, we analyzed changes in a gene set downstream of TREM2        to determine whether TREM2 signaling is modified by AD progression. We generated        an anti-human TREM2 agonistic antibody and defined TREM2 activation in terms of        the downstream expression changes induced by this antibody in microglia developed        from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC). Differentially expressed genes        (DEGs) following TREM2 activation were compared with the gene set extracted from        microglial single nuclear RNA sequencing data of patients with AD, using gene set        enrichment analysis. We isolated an anti-TREM2-specific agonistic antibody,        Hyb87, from anti-human TREM2 antibodies generated using binding and agonism        assays, which helped us identify 300 upregulated and 251 downregulated DEGs.        Pathway enrichment analysis suggested that TREM2 activation may be associated        with Th2-related pathways. TREM2 activation was lower in AD microglia than in        microglia from healthy subjects or patients with mild cognitive impairment. TREM2        activation also showed a significant negative correlation with disease        progression. Pathway enrichment analysis of DEGs controlled by TREM2 activity        indicated that TREM2 activation in AD may lead to anti-apoptotic signaling,        immune response, and cytoskeletal changes in the microglia. We showed that TREM2        activation decreases with AD progression, in support of a protective role of        TREM2 activation in AD. In addition, the agonistic anti-TREM2 antibody can be        used to identify TREM2 activation state in AD microglia.",PMC8564098,FEBS open bio,101580716

Clinical research and genome-wide association studies have suggested a        potential contribution of the endocytic pathway to AD, with an emphasis on common        loci. However, the contribution of rare variants in this pathway to AD has not        been thoroughly investigated. In this study, we focused on the effect of rare        variants on AD by first applying a rare-variant gene-set burden analysis using        genes in the endocytic pathway on over 3,000 individuals with European ancestry        from three large whole-genome sequencing (WGS) studies. We identified significant        associations of rare-variant burden within the endocytic pathway with AD, which        were successfully replicated in independent datasets. We further demonstrated        that this endocytic rare-variant enrichment is associated with neurofibrillary        tangles (NFTs) and age-related phenotypes, increasing the risk of obtaining        severer brain damage, earlier age-at-onset, and earlier age-of-death. Next, by        aggregating rare variants within each gene, we sought to identify single        endocytic genes associated with AD and NFTs. Careful examination using NFTs        revealed one significantly associated gene, ANKRD13D. To identify functional        associations, we integrated bulk RNA-Seq data from over 600 brain tissues and        found two endocytic expression genes (eGenes), HLA-A and SLC26A7, that displayed        significant influences on their gene expressions. Differential expressions        between AD patients and controls of these three identified genes were further        examined by incorporating scRNA-Seq data from 48 post-mortem brain samples and        demonstrated distinct expression patterns across cell types. Taken together, our        results demonstrated strong rare-variant effect in the endocytic pathway on AD        risk and progression and functional effect of gene expression alteration in both        bulk and single-cell resolution, which may bring more insight and serve as        valuable resources for future AD genetic studies, clinical research, and        therapeutic targeting.",PMC8460036,PLoS genetics,101239074

This        persistent firing is the foundation for higher cognition, including working        memory, and abstract thought. However, exposure to acute uncontrollable stress        drives high levels of catecholamine release in the PFC, which activates        feedforward calcium-cAMP signaling pathways to open nearby potassium channels,        rapidly weakening synaptic connectivity to reduce persistent firing.

After over 30 years of intensive research, we have gained        extensive knowledge of the genetic and molecular factors involved and their        interplay in disease. These findings suggest that different subgroups of AD may        exist. Not only are we starting to treat autosomal dominant cases differently        from sporadic cases, but we could be observing different underlying pathological        mechanisms related to the amyloid cascade hypothesis, immune dysfunction, and a        tau-dependent pathology. Genetic, molecular, and, more recently, multi-omic        evidence support each of these scenarios, which are highly interconnected but can        also point to the different subgroups of AD. The identification of the pathologic        triggers and order of events in the disease processes are key to the design of        treatments and therapies. Prevention and treatment of AD cannot be attempted        using a single approach; different therapeutic strategies at specific disease        stages may be appropriate. For successful prevention and treatment, biomarker        assays must be designed so that patients can be more accurately monitored at        specific points during the course of the disease and potential treatment. In        addition, to advance the development of therapeutic drugs, models that better        mimic the complexity of the human brain are needed; there have been several        advances in this arena. Here, we review significant, recent developments in        genetics, omics, and molecular studies that have contributed to the understanding        of this disease.

While brain state can be defined by        ongoing neuronal population activity, such as neuronal oscillations, this is        tightly coupled with certain behavioural or vigilant states. In recent decades,        abnormalities in brain state have been recognised as biomarkers of various brain        diseases and disorders. Intriguingly, accumulating evidence also demonstrates        mutual interactions between brain states and disease pathologies: while        abnormalities in brain state arise during disease progression, manipulations of        brain state can modify disease pathology, suggesting a therapeutic potential. In        this review, by focusing on Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of        dementia, we provide an overview of how brain states change in AD patients and        mouse models, and how controlling brain states can modify AD pathology.        Specifically, we summarise the relationship between AD and changes in gamma and        slow oscillations. As pathological changes in these oscillations correlate with        AD pathology, manipulations of either gamma or slow oscillations can modify AD        pathology in mouse models.

METHODS: We conducted ATAC-seq profiling        using NeuN sorted-nuclei from 40 frozen brain tissues to determine LOAD-specific        changes in chromatin accessibility landscape in a cell-type specific manner.        RESULTS: We identified 211 LOAD-specific differential chromatin accessibility        sites in neuronal-nuclei, four of which overlapped with LOAD-GWAS regions        (±100 kb of SNP). While the non-neuronal nuclei did not show LOAD-specific        differences, stratification by sex identified 842 LOAD-specific chromatin        accessibility sites in females. Seven of these sex-dependent sites in the        non-neuronal samples overlapped LOAD-GWAS regions including APOE. LOAD loci were        functionally validated using single-nuclei RNA-seq datasets.

While they share pathological tau        aggregation as a common feature, tauopathies are distinct from one another with        respect to predominant tau isoforms that accumulate and the selective        vulnerability of brain regions and cell types that have tau inclusions. For        instance, primary tauopathies present with glial tau pathology, while it is        mostly neuronal in Alzheimer's disease (AD).

In mouse AD models, single-cell RNA sequencing        (scRNA-seq) analyses delineated this response as progressive conversion of        homeostatic microglia into disease-associated microglia (DAM); additional        reactive microglial populations have been reported in other models of        neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation. We review all of these microglial        signatures, highlighting four fundamental patterns: DAM, IFN-microglia, MHC-II        microglia, and proliferating microglia. We propose that all reported microglia        populations are either just one or a combination, depending on the clustering        strategy applied and the disease model. We further review single-nucleus RNA        sequencing (snRNA-seq) data from human AD specimens and discuss reasons for        parallels and discrepancies between human and mouse transcriptional profiles.        Finally, we outline future directions for delineating the microglial impact in AD        pathogenesis.",PMC8302448,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R

Drug repurposing, a more effective        strategy that aims to find new indications for existing drugs against other        diseases, offers benefits in AD drug development. In this study, we aim to        identify potential anti-AD agents through enrichment analysis of drug-induced        transcriptional profiles of pathways based on AD-associated risk genes identified        from genome-wide association analyses (GWAS) and single-cell transcriptomic        studies. Methods: We systematically constructed four gene lists (972 risk genes)        from GWAS and single-cell transcriptomic studies and performed functional and        genes overlap analyses in Enrichr tool. We then used a comprehensive drug        repurposing tool Gene2Drug by combining drug-induced transcriptional responses        with the associated pathways to compute candidate drugs from each gene list.        Prioritized potential candidates (eight drugs) were further assessed with        literature review. Results: The genomic-based gene lists contain late-onset AD        associated genes (BIN1, ABCA7, APOE, CLU, and PICALM) and clinical AD drug        targets (TREM2, CD33, CHRNA2, PRSS8, ACE, TKT, APP, and GABRA1). Our analysis        identified eight AD candidate drugs (ellipticine, alsterpaullone, tomelukast,        ginkgolide A, chrysin, ouabain, sulindac sulfide and lorglumide), four of which        (alsterpaullone, ginkgolide A, chrysin and ouabain) have shown repurposing        potential for AD validated by their preclinical evidence and moderate toxicity        profiles from literature. These support the value of pathway-based prioritization        based on the disease risk genes from GWAS and scRNA-seq data analysis.        Conclusion: Our analysis strategy identified some potential drug candidates for        AD.

Levels of GRKs 2, 5 and        6 are specifically decreased in the CA1 region of the AD hippocampus.

To understand the        context-specific molecular alteration, we further performed deep learning-based        single-cell transcriptomic analyses on a bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF)        dataset from moderate and severe COVID-19 patients. We discovered and replicated        the genetically regulated expression of CXCR6 and CCR9 genes. These two genes        have a protective effect on lung, and a risk effect on whole blood, respectively.        The colocalization analysis of GWAS and cis-expression quantitative trait loci        highlighted the regulatory effect on CXCR6 expression in lung and immune cells.        In the lung-resident memory CD8(+) T (T(RM)) cells, we found a 2.24-fold decrease        of cell proportion among CD8(+) T cells and lower expression of CXCR6 in the        severe patients than moderate patients. Pro-inflammatory transcriptional programs        were highlighted in the T(RM) cellular trajectory from moderate to severe        patients. CXCR6 from the 3p21.31 locus is associated with severe COVID-19. CXCR6        tends to have a lower expression in lung T(RM) cells of severe patients, which        aligns with the protective effect of CXCR6 from TWAS analysis.",PMC8216591,Human genetics,7613873

Currently, nearly 6,000 distinct rare disorders with a        known molecular basis have been described, yet establishing a specific diagnosis        based on the clinical phenotype is challenging. Increasing integration of whole        exome sequencing into routine diagnostics of rare diseases is improving        diagnostic rates. Nevertheless, about half of the patients do not receive a        genetic diagnosis due to the challenges of variant detection and interpretation.        During the last years, RNA sequencing is increasingly used as a complementary        diagnostic tool providing functional data. Initially, arbitrary thresholds have        been applied to call aberrant expression, aberrant splicing, and mono-allelic        expression. With the application of RNA sequencing to search for the molecular        diagnosis, the implementation of robust statistical models on normalized read        counts allowed for the detection of significant outliers corrected for multiple        testing. More recently, machine learning methods have been developed to improve        the normalization of RNA sequencing read count data by taking confounders into        account. Together the methods have increased the power and sensitivity of        detection and interpretation of pathogenic variants, leading to diagnostic rates        of 10-35% in rare diseases.

Unlike other        systems, the central nervous system (CNS) is separated from the peripheral immune        machinery that, for decades, has been envisioned almost entirely as detrimental        to the nervous system. New research changes this view and shows that blood-borne        immune cells (both adaptive and innate) can provide homeostatic support to the        CNS via neuroimmune communication. Neurodegeneration is mostly viewed through the        lens of the resident brain immune populations with little attention to peripheral        circulation. For example, cognition declines with impairment of peripheral        adaptive immunity but not with the removal of microglia. Therapeutic failures of        agents targeting the neuroinflammation framework (inhibiting immune response),        especially in neurodegenerative disorders, call for a reconsideration of immune        response contributions.

We tested whether dysregulation of cholesterol catabolism, through        its conversion to primary bile acids (BAs), was associated with dementia        pathogenesis. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used a 3-step study design to examine the        role of the primary BAs, cholic acid (CA), and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) as        well as their principal biosynthetic precursor, 7α-hydroxycholesterol (7α-OHC),        in dementia. In Step 1, we tested whether serum markers of cholesterol catabolism        were associated with brain amyloid accumulation, white matter lesions (WMLs), and        brain atrophy. In Step 2, we tested whether exposure to bile acid sequestrants        (BAS) was associated with risk of dementia. In Step 3, we examined plausible        mechanisms underlying these findings by testing whether brain levels of primary        BAs and gene expression of their principal receptors are altered in AD. Step 1:        We assayed serum concentrations CA, CDCA, and 7α-OHC and used linear regression        and mixed effects models to test their associations with brain amyloid        accumulation (N = 141), WMLs, and brain atrophy (N = 134) in the Baltimore        Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA). The BLSA is an ongoing, community-based        cohort study that began in 1958. Participants in the BLSA neuroimaging sample        were approximately 46% male with a mean age of 76 years; longitudinal analyses        included an average of 2.5 follow-up magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) visits. We        used the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) (N = 1,666) to        validate longitudinal neuroimaging results in BLSA. ADNI is an ongoing,        community-based cohort study that began in 2003. Participants were approximately        55% male with a mean age of 74 years; longitudinal analyses included an average        of 5.2 follow-up MRI visits. Lower serum concentrations of 7α-OHC, CA, and CDCA        were associated with higher brain amyloid deposition (p = 0.041), faster WML        accumulation (p = 0.050), and faster brain atrophy mainly (false discovery rate        [FDR] p = <0.001-0.013) in males in BLSA. In ADNI, we found a modest sex-specific        effect indicating that lower serum concentrations of CA and CDCA were associated        with faster brain atrophy (FDR p = 0.049) in males.Step 2: In the Clinical        Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) dataset, covering >4 million registrants from        general practice clinics in the United Kingdom, we tested whether patients using        BAS (BAS users; 3,208 with ≥2 prescriptions), which reduce circulating BAs and        increase cholesterol catabolism, had altered dementia risk compared to those on        non-statin lipid-modifying therapies (LMT users; 23,483 with ≥2 prescriptions).        Patients in the study (BAS/LMT) were approximately 34%/38% male and with a mean        age of 65/68 years; follow-up time was 4.7/5.7 years. We found that BAS use was        not significantly associated with risk of all-cause dementia (hazard ratio (HR) =        1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.72-1.46, p = 0.88) or its subtypes. We        found a significant difference between the risk of VaD in males compared to        females (p = 0.040) and a significant dose-response relationship between BAS use        and risk of VaD (p-trend = 0.045) in males.Step 3: We assayed brain tissue        concentrations of CA and CDCA comparing AD and control (CON) samples in the BLSA        autopsy cohort (N = 29). Participants in the BLSA autopsy cohort (AD/CON) were        approximately 50%/77% male with a mean age of 87/82 years. We analyzed        single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) data to compare brain BA receptor gene        expression between AD and CON samples from the Religious Orders Study and Memory        and Aging Project (ROSMAP) cohort (N = 46). ROSMAP is an ongoing, community-based        cohort study that began in 1994. Participants (AD/CON) were approximately 56%/36%        male with a mean age of 85/85 years. In BLSA, we found that CA and CDCA were        detectable in postmortem brain tissue samples and were marginally higher in AD        samples compared to CON. In ROSMAP, we found sex-specific differences in altered        neuronal gene expression of BA receptors in AD. Study limitations include the        small sample sizes in the BLSA cohort and likely inaccuracies in the clinical        diagnosis of dementia subtypes in primary care settings. CONCLUSIONS: We combined        targeted metabolomics in serum and amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) and        MRI of the brain with pharmacoepidemiologic analysis to implicate dysregulation        of cholesterol catabolism in dementia pathogenesis. We observed that lower serum        BA concentration mainly in males is associated with neuroimaging markers of        dementia, and pharmacological lowering of BA levels may be associated with higher        risk of VaD in males. We hypothesize that dysregulation of BA signaling pathways        in the brain may represent a plausible biologic mechanism underlying these        results. Together, our observations suggest a novel mechanism relating        abnormalities in cholesterol catabolism to risk of dementia.",PMC8158920,PLoS medicine,101231360

For differential expression        analysis in multi-subject single-cell data, negative binomial mixed models        account for both subject-level and cell-level overdispersions, but are        computationally demanding. Here, we propose an efficient NEgative Binomial mixed        model Using a Large-sample Approximation (NEBULA). The speed gain is achieved by        analytically solving high-dimensional integrals instead of using the Laplace        approximation.

Using NEBULA in Alzheimer's disease cohort data sets,        we found that the cell-level expression of APOE correlated with that of other        genetic risk factors (including CLU, CST3, TREM2, C1q, and ITM2B) in a        cell-type-specific pattern and an isoform-dependent manner in microglia.

34030626,CDSeqR: fast complete deconvolution for gene expression data from bulk tissues.,10.1186/s12859-021-04186-5,"BACKGROUND: Biological tissues consist of heterogenous populations of cells.        Because gene expression patterns from bulk tissue samples reflect the        contributions from all cells in the tissue, understanding the contribution of        individual cell types to the overall gene expression in the tissue is        fundamentally important. We recently developed a computational method, CDSeq,        that can simultaneously estimate both sample-specific cell-type proportions and        cell-type-specific gene expression profiles using only bulk RNA-Seq counts from        multiple samples. Here we present an R implementation of CDSeq (CDSeqR) with        significant performance improvement over the original implementation in MATLAB        and an added new function to aid cell type annotation. The R package would be of        interest for the broader R community. RESULT: We developed a novel strategy to        substantially improve computational efficiency in both speed and memory usage. In        addition, we designed and implemented a new function for annotating the CDSeq        estimated cell types using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. This        function allows users to readily interpret and visualize the CDSeq estimated cell        types. In addition, this new function further allows the users to annotate        CDSeq-estimated cell types using marker genes. We carried out additional        validations of the CDSeqR software using synthetic, real cell mixtures, and real        bulk RNA-seq data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Genotype-Tissue        Expression (GTEx) project. CONCLUSIONS: The existing bulk RNA-seq repositories,        such as TCGA and GTEx, provide enormous resources for better understanding        changes in transcriptomics and human diseases. They are also potentially useful        for studying cell-cell interactions in the tissue microenvironment. Bulk level        analyses neglect tissue heterogeneity, however, and hinder investigation of a        cell-type-specific expression.

Many currently untreatable        diseases arise due to variations in, and through a combination of, multiple        stressors of genetic, epigenetic, and environmental nature. Unfortunately, how        such stressors lead to a specific disease phenotype or inflict a vulnerability to        some cells and tissues but not others remains largely unknown and        unsatisfactorily addressed. Analysis of cell- and tissue-specific interactome        networks may shed light on organization of biological systems and subsequently to        disease vulnerabilities. However, deriving human interactomes across different        cell and disease contexts remains a challenge. To this end, this opinion article        links stressor-induced protein interactome network perturbations to the formation        of pathologic scaffolds termed epichaperomes, revealing a viable and reproducible        experimental solution to obtaining rigorous context-dependent interactomes.

Here we describe MAPT-AS1, a brain-enriched NAT        that is conserved in primates and contains an embedded mammalian-wide        interspersed repeat (MIR), which represses tau translation by competing for        ribosomal RNA pairing with the MAPT mRNA internal ribosome entry site(3). MAPT        encodes tau, a neuronal intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) that stabilizes        axonal microtubules. Hyperphosphorylated, aggregation-prone tau forms the        hallmark inclusions of tauopathies(4). Mutations in MAPT cause familial        frontotemporal dementia, and common variations forming the MAPT H1 haplotype are        a significant risk factor in many tauopathies(5) and Parkinson's disease.        Notably, expression of MAPT-AS1 or minimal essential sequences from MAPT-AS1        (including MIR) reduces-whereas silencing MAPT-AS1 expression increases-neuronal        tau levels, and correlate with tau pathology in human brain.

Cell        death in HD occurs primarily in striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs), but the        involvement of specific MSN subtypes and of other striatal cell types remains        poorly understood. To gain insight into cell type-specific disease processes, we        studied the nuclear transcriptomes of 4524 cells from the striatum of a        genetically precise knock-in mouse model of the HD mutation, Htt(Q175/+), and        from wild-type controls. We used 14- to 15-month-old male mice, a time point at        which multiple behavioral, neuroanatomical, and neurophysiological changes are        present but at which there is no known cell death. Thousands of differentially        expressed genes (DEGs) were distributed across most striatal cell types,        including transcriptional changes in glial populations that are not apparent from        RNA-seq of bulk tissue. Reconstruction of cell type-specific transcriptional        networks revealed a striking pattern of bidirectional dysregulation for many cell        type-specific genes. Typically, these genes were repressed in their primary cell        type, yet de-repressed in other striatal cell types. Integration with existing        epigenomic and transcriptomic data suggest that partial loss-of-function of the        polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) may underlie many of these transcriptional        changes, leading to deficits in the maintenance of cell identity across virtually        all cell types in the adult striatum.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Huntington's disease        (HD) is a dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disorder characterized by        specific loss of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the striatum, accompanied by more        subtle changes in many other cell types. It is thought that changes in        transcriptional regulation are an important underlying mechanism, but cell        type-specific gene expression changes are not well understood, particularly at        time points relevant to the onset of disease-related symptoms. Single-nucleus        (sn)RNA-seq in a genetically precise mouse model enabled us to identify novel        patterns of transcriptional dysregulation because of HD mutations, including        bidirectional dysregulation of many cell type identity genes that may be driven        by partial loss-of-function of the polycomb repressive complex (PRC).

The main pathologic feature of AD is the presence of        extracellular senile plaques and intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in        the brain. In neurodegenerative diseases, the unfolded protein response (UPR)        induced by ER stress ensures cell survival. Mesencephalic astrocyte-derived        neurotrophic factor (MANF) protects against ER stress and has been implicated in        the pathogenesis of AD. MANF is expressed in neurons of the brain and spinal        cord. However, there have been no investigations on MANF expression in the brain        of AD patients.

Recent data suggest nucleocytoplasmic transport may be        compromised by tau in Alzheimer disease. In this context, we have examined the        RNA polymerase II subunit RPB1, which is the catalytic subunit that plays a        critical role in transcription. Using immunofluorescence staining in control and        Alzheimer disease hippocampal tissue, we show that 2 phosphoisoforms of RPB1        mislocalize from the nucleus to the cytoplasm of neurons in Alzheimer disease.        The number of neurons with this cytoplasmic mislocalization is correlated with        the burden of pathologic tau (AT8-immunopositive neurons). In order to test        whether there is a causal relationship between pathologic tau and cytoplasmic        RPB1 accumulation, we used the rTg4510 mouse model, which expresses a regulatable        pathologic human tau species harboring the P301L mutation. Using        immunofluorescence staining on brain tissue from young (2.5-month-old) and aged        (8.5- to 10-month-old) rTg4510 mice, we found a tau- and age-dependent increase        in cytoplasmic mislocalization of Rpb1. In summary, this study provides evidence        that tau induces mislocalization of RPB1 in Alzheimer disease, and since RPB1 is        essential for transcription, this raises the possibility that RPB1        mislocalization could lead to fundamental alterations in neuronal health.",PMC8177848,Journal of neuropathology and experimental neurology,2985192R

However, the precise mechanisms mediating their        neurotoxicity are unclear. Our microarray analyses show that, in Drosophila        models of amyloid beta 42 toxicity, genes involved in the unfolded protein        response and metabolic processes are upregulated in brain. Comparison with the        brain transcriptome of early-stage Alzheimer's patients revealed a common        transcriptional signature, but with generally opposing directions of gene        expression changes between flies and humans. Among these differentially regulated        genes, lactate dehydrogenase (Ldh) was up-regulated by the greatest degree in        amyloid beta 42 flies and the human orthologues (LDHA and LDHB) were        down-regulated in patients. Functional analyses revealed that either        over-expression or inhibition of Ldh by RNA interference (RNAi) slightly        exacerbated climbing defects in both healthy and amyloid beta 42-induced        Drosophila. This suggests that metabolic responses to lactate dehydrogenase must        be finely-tuned, and that its observed upregulation following amyloid beta 42        production could potentially represent a compensatory protection to maintain        pathway homeostasis in this model, with further manipulation leading to        detrimental effects. The increased Ldh expression in amyloid beta 42 flies was        regulated partially by unfolded protein response signalling, as ATF4 RNAi        diminished the transcriptional response and enhanced amyloid beta 42-induced        climbing phenotypes. Further functional studies are required to determine whether        Ldh upregulation provides compensatory neuroprotection against amyloid beta        42-induced loss of activating transcription factor 4 activity and endoplasmatic        reticulum stress. Our study thus reveals dysregulation of lactate dehydrogenase        signalling in Drosophila models and patients with Alzheimer's disease, which may        lead to a detrimental loss of metabolic homeostasis. Importantly, we observed        that down-regulation of ATF4-dependent endoplasmic reticulum-stress signalling in        this context appears to prevent Ldh compensation and to exacerbate amyloid beta        42-dependent neuronal toxicity. Our findings, therefore, suggest caution in the        use of therapeutic strategies focussed on down-regulation of this pathway for the        treatment of Alzheimer's disease, since its natural response to the toxic peptide        may induce beneficial neuroprotective effects.",PMC8093921,Brain communications,101755125

Identifying common genetic variants driving differences in transcript        expression that confer AD risk is necessary to elucidate AD mechanism and develop        therapeutic interventions. We modify the FUSION transcriptome-wide association        study (TWAS) pipeline to ingest gene expression values from multiple neocortical        regions. METHODS: A combined dataset of 2003 genotypes clustered to 1000 Genomes        individuals from Utah with Northern and Western European ancestry (CEU) was used        to construct a training set of 790 genotypes paired to 888 RNASeq profiles from        temporal cortex (TCX = 248), prefrontal cortex (FP = 50), inferior frontal gyrus        (IFG = 41), superior temporal gyrus (STG = 34), parahippocampal cortex (PHG =        34), and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC = 461). Following within-tissue        normalization and covariate adjustment, predictive weights to impute expression        components based on a gene's surrounding cis-variants were trained. The FUSION        pipeline was modified to support input of pre-scaled expression values and        support cross validation with a repeated measure design arising from the presence        of multiple transcriptome samples from the same individual across different        tissues. RESULTS: Cis-variant architecture alone was informative to train weights        and impute expression for 6780 (49.67%) autosomal genes, the majority of which        significantly correlated with gene expression; FDR < 5%: N = 6775 (99.92%),        Bonferroni: N = 6716 (99.06%). Validation of weights in 515 matched genotype to        RNASeq profiles from the CommonMind Consortium (CMC) was (72.14%) in DLPFC        profiles.

The etiology of Alzheimer's is complex, with        numerous environmental and genetic factors contributing to the disease.        Late-onset AD is highly heritable (60 to 80%), and over 40 risk loci for AD have        been identified via large genome-wide association studies, most of which are        common variants with small effect sizes. Although these discoveries have provided        novel insight on biological contributors to AD, disease-modifying treatments        remain elusive. Recently, the concepts of resistance to pathology and resilience        against the downstream consequences of pathology have been of particular interest        in the Alzheimer's field as studies continue to identify individuals who evade        the pathology of the disease even into late life and individuals who have all of        the neuropathological features of AD but evade downstream neurodegeneration and        cognitive impairment.

Thanks to the recent widespread use of        matrix decomposition methods in bioinformatics, a computational framework based        on compressed sensing was adopted to reduce dimensionality. However, compressed        sensing requires an optimization strategy to learn the modular dictionaries and        activity levels from the low-dimensional random composite measurements to        reconstruct the high-dimensional gene-expression data. Considering this, here we        introduce and compare four compressed sensing frameworks coming from        nature-inspired optimization algorithms (CSCS, ABCCS, BACS and FACS) to improve        the quality of the decompression process. Several experiments establish that the        three proposed methods outperform benchmark methods on nine different datasets,        especially the FACS method. We illustrate therefore, the robustness and        convergence of FACS in various aspects; notably, time complexity and parameter        analyses highlight properties of our proposed FACS. Furthermore, differential        gene-expression analysis, cell-type clustering, gene ontology enrichment and        pathology analysis are conducted, which bring novel insights into cell-type        identification and characterization mechanisms from different perspectives.

We identified 19 genes that were        consistent with being causal in depression, acting via their respective        cis-regulated brain protein abundance. We replicated nine of these genes using an        independent depression GWAS (N = 307,353) and another human brain proteomic        dataset (N = 152). Eleven of the 19 genes also had cis-regulated mRNA levels that        were associated with depression, based on integration of the depression GWAS with        human brain transcriptomes (N = 888). Meta-analysis of the discovery and        replication proteome-wide association study analyses identified 25 brain proteins        consistent with being causal in depression, 20 of which were not previously        implicated in depression by GWAS.

One        prevailing view is that women live longer than men on average of 4.5 years, plus        there are more women aged 85 years or older than men in most global        subpopulations; and older age is the greatest risk factor for AD. However, the        differences in the actual risk of developing AD for men and women of the same age        is difficult to assess, and the findings have been mixed. An increasing body of        evidence from preclinical and clinical studies as well as the complications in        estimating incidence support the sex-specific biological mechanisms in diverging        AD risk as an important adjunct explanation to the epidemiologic perspective.        Although some of the sex differences in AD prevalence are due to differences in        longevity, other distinct biological mechanisms increase the risk and progression        of AD in women. These risk factors include (1) deviations in brain structure and        biomarkers, (2) psychosocial stress responses, (3) pregnancy, menopause, and sex        hormones, (4) genetic background (i.e., APOE), (5) inflammation, gliosis, and        immune module (i.e., TREM2), and (6) vascular disorders.

Fever and infection were the primary contributors to brain gene        expression changes, brain cell-type-specific gene expression, and cell proportion        changes. Furthermore, we also found that previous studies of gene expression in        postmortem brains were confounded by agonal factors. Therefore, correction for        agonal factors is important in the step of data preprocessing.

33838873,Brain DNA Methylation Patterns in CLDN5 Associated With Cognitive Decline.,10.1016/j.biopsych.2021.01.015,"BACKGROUND: Cognitive trajectory varies widely and can distinguish people who        develop dementia from people who remain cognitively normal. Variation in        cognitive trajectory is only partially explained by traditional neuropathologies.        We sought to identify novel genes associated with cognitive trajectory using DNA        methylation profiles from human postmortem brain. METHODS: We performed a brain        epigenome-wide association study of cognitive trajectory in 636 participants from        the ROS (Religious Orders Study) and MAP (Rush Memory and Aging Project) using        DNA methylation profiles of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. To maximize our        power to detect epigenetic associations, we used the recently developed Gene        Association with Multiple Traits test to analyze the 5 measured cognitive domains        simultaneously. RESULTS: We found an epigenome-wide association for differential        methylation of sites in the CLDN5 locus and cognitive trajectory (p = 9.96 ×        10(-7)) that was robust to adjustment for cell type proportions (p = 8.52 ×        10(-7)). This association was primarily driven by association with declines in        episodic (p = 4.65 × 10(-6)) and working (p = 2.54 × 10(-7)) memory. This        association between methylation in CLDN5 and cognitive decline was significant        even in participants with no or little signs of amyloid-β and neurofibrillary        tangle pathology. CONCLUSIONS: Differential methylation of CLDN5, a gene that        encodes an important protein of the blood-brain barrier, is associated with        cognitive trajectory beyond traditional Alzheimer's disease pathologies. The        association between CLDN5 methylation and cognitive trajectory in people with low        pathology suggests an early role for CLDN5 and blood-brain barrier dysfunction in        cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease.",PMC8329105,Biological psychiatry,0213264

Single-cell RNA sequencing        (scRNA-seq) deepens those analyses by evaluating gene expression at the cellular        level. Both data types lend insights into disease etiology. With current        technologies, scRNA-seq data are known to be noisy. Constrained by costs,        scRNA-seq data are typically generated from a relatively small number of        subjects, which limits their utility for some analyses, such as identification of        gene expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). To address these issues while        maintaining the unique advantages of each data type, we develop a Bayesian method        (bMIND) to integrate bulk and scRNA-seq data. With a prior derived from scRNA-seq        data, we propose to estimate sample-level cell type-specific (CTS) expression        from bulk expression data. The CTS expression enables large-scale sample-level        downstream analyses, such as detection of CTS differentially expressed genes        (DEGs) and eQTLs. Through simulations, we show that bMIND improves the accuracy        of sample-level CTS expression estimates and increases the power to discover CTS        DEGs when compared to existing methods. To further our understanding of two        complex phenotypes, autism spectrum disorder and Alzheimer's disease, we apply        bMIND to gene expression data of relevant brain tissue to identify CTS DEGs. Our        results complement findings for CTS DEGs obtained from snRNA-seq studies,        replicating certain DEGs in specific cell types while nominating other novel        genes for those cell types.

Numerous        therapeutics have failed to make it to the clinic, potentially due to a focus on        presumptive pathogenic proteins instead of cell-type-specific signaling        mechanisms. The tau propagation hypothesis that inter-neuronal tau transfer        drives AD pathology has recently garnered attention, as accumulation of        pathological tau in the brain has high clinical significance in correlating with        progression of cognitive AD symptoms. However, studies on tau pathology in AD are        classically neuron-centric and have greatly overlooked cell-type specific effects        of tau internalization, degradation, and propagation. While the contribution of        microglia to tau processing and propagation is beginning to be recognized and        understood, astrocytes, glial cells in the brain important for maintaining        neuronal metabolic, synaptic, trophic, and immune function which can produce,        internalize, degrade, and propagate tau are understudied in their ability to        affect AD progression through tau pathology.

However,        their role and potential mechanisms whereby they affect neuroinflammation,        amyloid pathology, and synaptic density in AD remain unclear. METHODS: To explore        the role of astrocytes on Aβ pathology and neuroinflammatory markers, we        pharmacologically ablated them in organotypic brain culture slices (OBCSs) from        5XFAD mouse model of AD and wild-type (WT) littermates with the selective        astrocytic toxin L-alpha-aminoadipate (L-AAA). To examine the effects on synaptic        circuitry, we measured dendritic spine number and size in OBCSs from Thy-1-GFP        transgenic mice incubated with synthetic Aβ42 or double transgenics        Thy-1-GFP/5XFAD mice treated with LAAA or vehicle for 24 h. RESULTS: Treatment of        OBCSs with L-AAA resulted in an increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine        IL-6 in conditioned media of WTs and 5XFAD slices, associated with changes in        microglia morphology but not in density. The profile of inflammatory markers        following astrocytic loss was different in WT and transgenic cultures, showing        reductions in inflammatory mediators produced in astrocytes only in WT sections.        In addition, pharmacological ablation of astrocytes led to an increase in Aβ        levels in homogenates of OBCS from 5XFAD mice compared with vehicle controls,        with reduced enzymatic degradation of Aβ due to lower neprilysin and        insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) expression. Furthermore, OBSCs from wild-type mice        treated with L-AAA and synthetic amyloid presented 56% higher levels of Aβ in        culture media compared to sections treated with Aβ alone, concomitant with        reduced expression of IDE in culture medium, suggesting that astrocytes        contribute to Aβ clearance and degradation. Quantification of hippocampal        dendritic spines revealed a reduction in their density following L-AAA treatment        in all groups analyzed. In addition, pharmacological ablation of astrocytes        resulted in a decrease in spine size in 5XFAD OBCSs but not in OBCSs from WT        treated with synthetic Aβ compared to vehicle control.

Now the key questions are whether synapses are targeted by        complement and, if so, which synapses are vulnerable to elimination. Here, we        review recent work implicating C1q, the initiator of the classical complement        cascade, and surrounding glia as mediators of synapse loss. We examine how        synapses could undergo apoptosis-like pathways in the Alzheimer brain, which may        lead to the externalisation of phosphatidylserine on synapses. Finally, we        discuss potential roles for microglia and astrocytes in this 'synaptic        apoptosis'. Critical insight into neuroimmune regulatory pathways on synapses        will be key to developing effective targets against pathological synapse loss in        dementia.",PMC7946395,Faculty reviews,101769226

BOLORAMIS was demonstrated on a range of cell types and human cerebral        organoids. Singleplex experiments to detect coding and non-coding RNAs in human        iPSCs showed a stem-cell signature pattern.

In the present study, we examine differences in PON1 and        PON3 protein expression in the brain of a mouse model of AD. METHODS: we used        peroxidase- and fluorescence-based immunohistochemistry in five brain regions        (olfactory bulb, forebrain, posterior midbrain, hindbrain and cerebellum) of        transgenic (Tg2576) mice with the Swedish mutation (KM670/671NL) responsible for        a familial form of AD and corresponding wild-type mice. RESULTS: We found intense        PON1 and PON3-positive staining in star-shaped cells surrounding Aβ plaques in        all the studied Tg2576 mouse-brain regions. Although we could not colocalize PON1        and PON3 with astrocytes (star-shaped cells in the brain), we found some PON3        colocalization with microglia.

In many forms of        neurodegenerative diseases, this late-onset phenomenon remains largely        unexplained. RESULTS: Analyzing single-cell RNA sequencing from Alzheimer's        disease (AD) and Huntington's disease (HD) patients, we find increased        transcriptional heterogeneity in disease-state neurons. We hypothesize that        transcriptional heterogeneity precedes neurodegenerative disease pathologies. To        test this idea experimentally, we use juvenile forms (72Q; 180Q) of HD iPSCs,        differentiate them into committed neuronal progenitors, and obtain single-cell        expression profiles. We show a global increase in gene expression variability in        HD. Autophagy genes become more stable, while energy and actin-related genes        become more variable in the mutant cells. Knocking down several differentially        variable genes results in increased aggregate formation, a pathology associated        with HD. We further validate the increased transcriptional heterogeneity in        CHD8+/- cells, a model for autism spectrum disorder. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our        results suggest that although neurodegenerative diseases develop over time,        transcriptional regulation imbalance is present already at very early        developmental stages.

The discovery of novel AD-associated genetic        variants, particularly in coding regions and from APOE ε4 non-carriers, is        critical for understanding the pathology of AD. In this study, we carried out an        exome-wide association analysis of age-of-onset of AD with ~20,000 subjects and        placed more emphasis on APOE ε4 non-carriers. Using Cox mixed-effects models, we        find that age-of-onset shows a stronger genetic signal than AD case-control        status, capturing many known variants with stronger significance, and also        revealing new variants. We identified two novel variants, rs56201815, a rare        synonymous variant in ERN1, and rs12373123, a common missense variant in SPPL2C        in the MAPT region in APOE ε4 non-carriers. Besides, a rare missense variant        rs144292455 in TACR3 showed the consistent direction of effect sizes across all        studies with a suggestive significant level. In an attempt to unravel their        regulatory and biological functions, we found that the minor allele of rs56201815        was associated with lower average FDG uptake across five brain regions in ADNI.        Our eQTL analyses based on 6198 gene expression samples from ROSMAP and GTEx        revealed that the minor allele of rs56201815 was potentially associated with        elevated expression of ERN1, a key gene triggering unfolded protein response        (UPR), in multiple brain regions, including the posterior cingulate cortex and        nucleus accumbens.

Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have        identified several genetic loci associated with the severe COVID-19 symptoms.        Delineating the genetic variants and genes is important for better understanding        its biological mechanisms. METHODS: We implemented integrative approaches,        including transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS), colocalization analysis        and functional element prediction analysis, to interpret the genetic risks using        two independent GWAS datasets in lung and immune cells. To understand the        context-specific molecular alteration, we further performed deep learning-based        single cell transcriptomic analyses on a bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF)        dataset from moderate and severe COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: We discovered and        replicated the genetically regulated expression of CXCR6 and CCR9 genes. These        two genes have a protective effect on the lung and a risk effect on whole blood,        respectively. The colocalization analysis of GWAS and cis -expression        quantitative trait loci highlighted the regulatory effect on CXCR6 expression in        lung and immune cells. In the lung resident memory CD8 (+) T (T (RM) ) cells, we        found a 3.32-fold decrease of cell proportion and lower expression of CXCR6 in        the severe than moderate patients using the BALF transcriptomic dataset.        Pro-inflammatory transcriptional programs were highlighted in T (RM) cells        trajectory from moderate to severe patients. CONCLUSIONS: CXCR6 from the 3p21 .        31 locus is associated with severe COVID-19. CXCR6 tends to have a lower        expression in lung T (RM) cells of severe patients, which aligns with the        protective effect of CXCR6 from TWAS analysis.

Mast        cells are also important resident immune cells of the CNS but they are        underappreciated and understudied. Both microglia and mast cells are endowed with        an array of signaling receptors that recognize microbes and cellular damage. As        cellular sensors and effectors in the CNS, they respond to many CNS perturbations        and have been implicated in neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Mast cells        contain numerous secretory granules packaged with a plethora of readily available        and newly synthesized compounds known as 'mast cell mediators'. Mast cells act as        'first responders' to a pathogenic stimuli and respond by degranulation and        releasing these mediators into the extracellular milieu. They alert other glial        cells, including microglia to initiate neuroinflammatory processes that culminate        in the resolution of injury. However, failure to resolve the pathogenic process        can lead to persistent activation, release of pro-inflammatory mediators and        amplification of neuroinflammatory responses, in turn, resulting in neuronal        dysfunction and demise.

This could imply dysfunctional energy        metabolism in the brain. In this study, plasma of presymptomatic PSEN1 mutation        carriers was analyzed to understand associated metabolic changes. METHODS: We        analyzed plasma from noncarriers (NC, n = 8) and presymptomatic PSEN1-H163Y        mutation carriers (MC, n = 6) via untargeted metabolomics using gas and liquid        chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry, which identified 1199 metabolites.        All the metabolites were compared between MC and NC using univariate analysis, as        well as correlated with the ratio of Aβ(1-42/A) (β) (1-40) , using Spearman's        correlation. Altered metabolites were subjected to Ingenuity Pathway Analysis        (IPA). RESULTS: Based on principal component analysis the plasma metabolite        profiles were divided into dataset A and dataset B. In dataset A, when comparing        between presymptomatic MC and NC, the levels of 79 different metabolites were        altered. Out of 79, only 14 were annotated metabolites. In dataset B, 37        metabolites were significantly altered between presymptomatic MC and NC and nine        metabolites were annotated. In both datasets, annotated metabolites represent        amino acids, fatty acyls, bile acids, hexoses, purine nucleosides, carboxylic        acids, and glycerophosphatidylcholine species. 1-docosapentaenoyl-GPC was        positively correlated, uric acid and glucose were negatively correlated with the        ratio of plasma Aβ(1-42) /Aβ(1-40) (P < 0.05).

Organotypic brain slice cultures offer a        tissue-relevant context that enables the study of CNS resident cells and the        analysis of brain slice microglial phenotypes has provided important insights, in        particular into neuroprotective functions.

We hypothesize        that positive responses to new therapies observed in validated models of AD will        provide predictive evidence for positive responses to these same therapies in AD        patients. To achieve this goal, we convened a meeting of experts to explore the        current state of AD animal models, identify knowledge gaps, and recommend actions        for development of next-generation models with better predictability. Among our        findings, we all recognize that models reflecting only single aspects of AD        pathogenesis do not mimic AD. Models or combinations of new models are needed        that incorporate genetics with environmental interactions, timing of disease        development, heterogeneous mechanisms and pathways, comorbidities, and other        pathologies that lead to AD and related dementias.

Previous studies of gene expression using bulk tissue samples often fail        to consider changes in cell-type composition when comparing AD versus control,        which can lead to differences in expression levels that are not due to        transcriptional regulation. We mined five large transcriptomic AD datasets for        conserved gene co-expression module, then analyzed differential expression and        differential co-expression within the modules between AD samples and controls. We        performed cell-type deconvolution analysis to determine whether the observed        differential expression was due to changes in cell-type proportions in the        samples or to transcriptional regulation. Our findings were validated using four        additional datasets. We discovered that the increased expression of microglia        modules in the AD samples can be explained by increased microglia proportions in        the AD samples. In contrast, decreased expression and perturbed co-expression        within neuron modules in the AD samples was likely due in part to altered        regulation of neuronal pathways. Several transcription factors that are        differentially expressed in AD might account for such altered gene regulation.        Similarly, changes in gene expression and co-expression within astrocyte modules        could be attributed to combined effects of astrogliosis and astrocyte gene        activation. Gene expression in the astrocyte modules was also strongly correlated        with clinicopathological biomarkers.

PURPOSE:        Meta-DEGs were performed to investigate dysregulated genes enriched with        neurodegenerative disorder causative or risk genes in a phenotype-specific        manner. METHODS: Six microarray datasets from PD patients and controls, for which        substantia nigra sample transcriptome data were available, were downloaded from        the NINDS data repository. Meta-DEGs were performed using two methods, combining        p-values and combing effect size, and common DEGs were used for secondary        analyses. Gene sets of cell type-enriched or disease-related genes for PD,        Alzheimer's disease (AD), and hereditary progressive ataxia were constructed by        curation of public databases and/or published literatures. RESULTS: Our        meta-analyses revealed 449 downregulated and 137 upregulated genes.        Overrepresentation analyses with cell type-enriched genes were significant in        neuron-enriched genes but not in astrocyte- or microglia-enriched genes.        Meta-DEGs were significantly enriched in causative genes for hereditary disorders        accompanying parkinsonism but not in genes associated with AD or hereditary        progressive ataxia. Enrichment of PD-related genes was highly significant in        downregulated DEGs but insignificant in upregulated genes. CONCLUSION:        Downregulated meta-DEGs were associated with PD-related genes, but not with other        neurodegenerative disorder genes.

A survey of ABCA7 protein levels in the hippocampus or        parietal cortex of 123 individuals with or without AD neuropathology showed that        individuals with low ABCA7 developed AD neuropathology at a younger age, those        with intermediate ABCA7 developed it later, and individuals who developed it very        late had high ABCA7, the same as the youngest controls.

AD is        an age-related neurodegenerative pathology with a slowly progressive and        irreversible decline of cognitive functions. One of AD's histopathological        hallmarks is the deposition of amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques in the brain.

We gathered        publicly available genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data from 177 studies        and more than one million patients to detect shared genetic patterns between the        neurodegenerative diseases on three analyzed omics-layers. The results show a        remarkably high number of shared differentially expressed genes between the        transcriptomic and proteomic levels for all conditions, while showing a        significant relation between genomic and proteomic data between AD and PD and AD        and ALS. We identified a set of 139 genes being differentially expressed in        several transcriptomic experiments of all four diseases. These 139 genes showed        overrepresented gene ontology (GO) Terms involved in the development of        neurodegeneration, such as response to heat and hypoxia, positive regulation of        cytokines and angiogenesis, and RNA catabolic process. Furthermore, the four        analyzed neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) were clustered by their mean direction        of regulation throughout all transcriptomic studies for this set of 139 genes,        with the closest relation regarding this common gene set seen between AD and HD.        GO-Term and pathway analysis of the proteomic overlap led to biological processes        (BPs), related to protein folding and humoral immune response.

Higher expression of        SPI1 is associated with increased risk for AD, while lower expression is        protective. To investigate the molecular and cellular phenotypes associated with        higher and lower expression of PU.1 in microglia, we used stable overexpression        and knock-down of PU.1 in BV2, an immortalized mouse microglial cell line.        Transcriptome analysis suggests that reduced PU.1 expression suppresses        expression of homeostatic genes similar to the disease-associated microglia        response to amyloid plaques in mouse models of AD. Moreover, PU.1 knock-down        resulted in activation of protein translation, antioxidant action and        cholesterol/lipid metabolism pathways with a concomitant decrease of        pro-inflammatory gene expression.

Here,        we use a low-cost and off-the-shelf protocol to chemically convert libraries        generated with the widely-used Chromium 10X technology to be sequenceable with        CoolMPS technology. To assess the quality and performance of converted libraries        sequenced with CoolMPS, we generated a snRNA-seq dataset from the hippocampus of        young and old mice. Native libraries were sequenced on an Illumina Novaseq and        libraries that were converted to be compatible with CoolMPS were sequenced on a        DNBSEQ-400RS.

Alzheimer's disease extracellular vesicles were        significantly enriched in epitope-specific tau oligomers in comparison to        prodromal Alzheimer's disease or control extracellular vesicles as determined by        dot blot and atomic force microscopy. Alzheimer's disease extracellular vesicles        were more efficiently internalized by murine cortical neurons, as well as more        efficient in transferring and misfolding tau, than prodromal Alzheimer's disease        and control extracellular vesicles in vitro. Strikingly, the inoculation of        Alzheimer's disease or prodromal Alzheimer's disease extracellular vesicles        containing only 300 pg of tau into the outer molecular layer of the dentate gyrus        of 18-month-old C57BL/6 mice resulted in the accumulation of abnormally        phosphorylated tau throughout the hippocampus by 4.5 months, whereas inoculation        of an equal amount of tau from control extracellular vesicles, isolated tau        oligomers, or fibrils from the same Alzheimer's disease donor showed little tau        pathology. Furthermore, Alzheimer's disease extracellular vesicles induced        misfolding of endogenous tau in both oligomeric and sarkosyl-insoluble forms in        the hippocampal region.

Lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd) are ubiquitous toxic metals        with a wide range of applications resulting in global distribution in the        environment and exposure of all living organisms on earth. In addition to being        classified as carcinogenic (Cd) and possibly carcinogenic (Pb) to humans by the        International Agency for Research on Cancer, both compounds disrupt metal        homeostasis and can cause toxic responses at the cellular and organismal levels.        Pb toxicity targets the central nervous system and evidence for that has emerged        also for Cd.

With increasing understanding of        the non-neuronal contributions to disease, the development of new methods and        models will provide further insights and address important questions regarding        the roles of astrocytes and other non-neuronal cells in AD pathophysiology.

Among the three common coding variants, APOE*ε4 increases,        whereas APOE*ε2 decreases the risk of late-onset AD compared with APOE*ε3.        Despite increased understanding of the detrimental effect of APOE*ε4, it remains        unclear how APOE*ε2 confers protection against AD. Accumulating evidence suggests        that APOE*ε2 protects against AD through both amyloid-β (Aβ)-dependent and        independent mechanisms. In addition, APOE*ε2 has been identified as a longevity        gene, suggesting a systemic effect of APOE*ε2 on the aging process. However,        APOE*ε2 is not entirely benign; APOE*ε2 carriers exhibit increased risk of        certain cerebrovascular diseases and neurological disorders. Here, we review        evidence from both human and animal studies demonstrating the protective effect        of APOE*ε2 against AD and propose a working model depicting potential underlying        mechanisms.

Previously, we discovered multiple molecular pathways and        strategies that could promote robust axon regrowth after optic nerve injury.        However, regenerated axons remain unmyelinated, and the underlying mechanisms are        elusive.

We implement this concept in ACTIONet, a comprehensive framework        that combines archetypal analysis and manifold learning to provide a ready-to-use        analytical approach for multiresolution single-cell state characterization.        ACTIONet provides a robust, reproducible, and highly interpretable single-cell        analysis platform that couples dominant pattern discovery with a corresponding        structural representation of the cell state landscape. Using multiple synthetic        and real data sets, we demonstrate ACTIONet's superior performance relative to        existing alternatives. We use ACTIONet to integrate and annotate cells across        three human cortex data sets.

Although these kinds of events are sometimes at the core of key        macroevolutionary changes, their origin and organismal function are generally        poorly understood. RESULTS: Here, we identify several previously unreported        transposable element domestication events in the human and mouse genomes. Among        them, we find a remarkable molecular domestication that gave rise to a multigenic        family in placental mammals, the Bex/Tceal gene cluster. These genes, which act        as hub proteins within diverse signaling pathways, have been associated with        neurological features of human patients carrying genomic microdeletions in        chromosome X. The Bex/Tceal genes display neural-enriched patterns and are        differentially expressed in human neurological disorders, such as autism and        schizophrenia. Two different murine alleles of the cluster member Bex3 display        morphological and physiopathological brain modifications, such as reduced        interneuron number and hippocampal electrophysiological imbalance, alterations        that translate into distinct behavioral phenotypes. CONCLUSIONS: We provide an        in-depth understanding of the emergence of a gene cluster that originated by        transposon domestication and gene duplication at the origin of placental mammals,        an evolutionary process that transformed a non-functional transposon sequence        into novel components of the eutherian genome. These genes were integrated into        existing signaling pathways involved in the development, maintenance, and        function of the CNS in eutherians. At least one of its members, Bex3, is relevant        for higher brain functions in placental mammals and may be involved in human        neurological disorders.",PMC7586669,Genome biology,100960660

While TREM2 mouse        models have provided critical insight, the normal and disease-associated        functions of TREM2 in human microglia remain unclear. To examine this question,        we profile microglia differentiated from isogenic, CRISPR-modified TREM2-knockout        induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines. By combining transcriptomic and        functional analyses with a chimeric AD mouse model, we find that TREM2 deletion        reduces microglial survival, impairs phagocytosis of key substrates including        APOE, and inhibits SDF-1α/CXCR4-mediated chemotaxis, culminating in an impaired        response to beta-amyloid plaques in vivo.

Towards understanding gene functions at higher resolution,        recent efforts have focused on predicting the functions of isoforms. However, the        performance of existing methods is far from satisfactory mainly because of the        lack of isoform-level functional annotation. RESULTS: We present IsoResolve, a        novel approach for isoform function prediction, which leverages the information        from gene function prediction models with domain adaptation (DA). IsoResolve        treats gene-level and isoform-level features as source and target domains,        respectively. It uses DA to project the two domains into a latent variable space        in such a way that the latent variables from the two domains have similar        distribution, which enables the gene domain information to be leveraged for        isoform function prediction.

In this review, we discuss the current        studies using human pluripotent stem cells focused on AD, providing convincing        evidences that this system is an excellent opportunity to advance in the        comprehension of AD pathology, which will be translated to the development of the        still missing effective therapies.",PMC7558359,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791

While        neuroprotective microglia are important for containment/clearance of Amyloid        plaques and maintaining neuronal survival, Alzheimer inflammatory microglia may        play a detrimental role by eliciting tau pathogenesis and accelerating        neurotoxicity. Regulatory T cells have been shown to suppress microglia-mediated        inflammation. However, the role of regulatory T cells in ameliorating the        proinflammatory immune response in Alzheimer's disease requires further        investigation. Forty-six patients with Alzheimer disease, 42 with mild cognitive        impairment and 41 healthy controls were studied. The phenotypes of peripheral        regulatory T cells were assessed with multicolour flow cytometry. Regulatory T        cells were co-cultured with responder T cells and proliferation was determined by        (3)H-thymidine incorporation. In separate experiments, regulatory T cells were        added to induced pluripotent stem cell-derived pro-inflammatory macrophages and        changes in interleukin-6/tumour necrosis-alpha transcripts and protein levels        were measured. Freshly isolated regulatory T cells were expanded ex vivo in the        presence of CD3/CD28 expander beads, interleukin-2 and rapamycin to promote their        suppressive function. We found that the suppressive function of regulatory T        cells on responder T-cell proliferation was compromised at the Alzheimer disease        stage, compared with mild cognitive impairment and healthy controls. CD25 mean        fluorescence intensity in regulatory T-cell population was also reduced in        Alzheimer dementia patients. Regulatory T cells did not suppress pro-inflammatory        macrophages at baseline. Following ex vivo expansion, regulatory T-cell        suppression of responder T-cell proliferation and pro-inflammatory macrophage        activation increased in both patients and controls. Expanded regulatory T cells        exerted their immunoregulatory function on pro-inflammatory macrophages through a        contact-mediated mechanism. In conclusion, regulatory T-cell immunophenotype and        function are compromised in Alzheimer's disease. Following ex vivo expansion, the        immunomodulatory function of regulatory T cells is enhanced even at advanced        stages of Alzheimer's disease. Restoration of regulatory T-cell function could be        explored as a means to modulate the inflammatory status of Alzheimer's disease.",PMC7472911,Brain communications,101755125

However, the mechanisms        underlying the beneficial effects of exercise in AD on the level of specific        brain cell types remain poorly investigated. The involvement of astrocytes in AD        pathology is widely described, but their exact role in exercise-mediated        neuroprotection warrant further investigation. Here, we investigated the effect        of long-term voluntary physical exercise on the modulation of the astrocyte        state. METHODS: Male 5xFAD mice and their wild-type littermates had free access        to a running wheel from 1.5 to 7 months of age. A battery of behavioral tests was        used to assess the effects of voluntary exercise on cognition and learning.        Neuronal loss, impairment in neurogenesis, beta-amyloid (Aβ) deposition, and        inflammation were evaluated using a variety of histological and biochemical        measurements. Sophisticated morphological analyses were performed to delineate        the specific involvement of astrocytes in exercise-induced neuroprotection in the        5xFAD mice. RESULTS: Long-term voluntary physical exercise reversed cognitive        impairment in 7-month-old 5xFAD mice without affecting neurogenesis, neuronal        loss, Aβ plaque deposition, or microglia activation. Exercise increased glial        fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) immunoreactivity and the number of GFAP-positive        astrocytes in 5xFAD hippocampi. GFAP-positive astrocytes in hippocampi of the        exercised 5xFAD mice displayed increases in the numbers of primary branches and        in the soma area. In general, astrocytes distant from Aβ plaques were smaller in        size and possessed simplified processes in comparison to plaque-associated        GFAP-positive astrocytes. Morphological alterations of GFAP-positive astrocytes        occurred concomitantly with increased astrocytic brain-derived neurotrophic        factor (BDNF) and restoration of postsynaptic protein PSD-95. CONCLUSIONS:        Voluntary physical exercise modulates the reactive astrocyte state, which could        be linked via astrocytic BDNF and PSD-95 to improved cognition in 5xFAD        hippocampi. The molecular pathways involved in this modulation could potentially        be targeted for benefit against AD.",PMC7493971,Journal of neuroinflammation,101222974

Microglia        are critical partners in neuronal wiring and function during development and        disease. Emerging literature suggests that microglia have diverse functional        roles, raising the intriguing question of which functions of microglia become        impaired in disease to undermine proper neuronal function. It is also becoming        increasingly clear that microglia exist in heterogeneous cell states. Microglial        cell states appear context-dependent, that is, age, sex, location, and health of        their microenvironment; these are further influenced by external signaling        factors including gut microbiota and lipid metabolites. These data altogether        suggest that microglia exist in functional clusters that impact, and are impacted        by, surrounding neuronal microenvironment.

Decades after their discovery, the mechanisms by which these genes cause        Alzheimer's disease (AD) or promote AD progression are not fully understood.        While it is established that presenilin (PS) enzymatic activity produces        amyloid-β (Aβ), PSs also regulate numerous other cellular functions, some of        which intersect with known pathogenic drivers of neurodegeneration. Accumulating        evidence suggests that microglia, resident innate immune cells in the central        nervous system, play a key role in AD neurodegeneration. OBJECTIVE: Previous work        has identified a regulatory role for PS2 in microglia. We hypothesized that PSEN2        variants lead to dysregulated microglia, which could further contribute to        disease acceleration. To mimic the genotype of EOFAD patients, we created a        transgenic mouse expressing PSEN2 N141I on a mouse background expressing one        wildtype PS2 and two PS1 alleles. RESULTS: Microglial expression of PSEN2 N141I        resulted in impaired γ-secretase activity as well as exaggerated inflammatory        cytokine release, NFκB activity, and Aβ internalization. In vivo, PS2 N141I mice        showed enhanced IL-6 and TREM2 expression in brain as well as reduced branch        number and length, an indication of ""activated"" morphology, in the absence of        inflammatory stimuli. LPS intraperitoneal injection resulted in higher        inflammatory gene expression in PS2 N141I mouse brain relative to controls.        CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate that PSEN2 N141I heterozygosity is        associated with disrupted innate immune homeostasis, suggesting EOFAD variants        may promote disease progression through non-neuronal cells beyond canonical        dysregulated Aβ production.",PMC7592656,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863

However, whether and how the nature of the CNS insult-acute versus        chronic-influences the astrocyte response, and whether astrocyte transcriptomic        changes in these mouse models faithfully recapitulate the astrocyte reaction in        human diseases remains to be elucidated. We hypothesized that astrocytes set off        different transcriptomic programs in response to acute versus chronic insults,        besides a shared ""pan-injury"" signature common to both types of conditions, and        investigated the presence of these mouse astrocyte signatures in transcriptomic        studies from human neurodegenerative diseases. METHODS: We performed a        meta-analysis of 15 published astrocyte transcriptomic datasets from mouse models        of acute injury (n = 6) and chronic neurodegeneration (n = 9) and identified        pan-injury, acute, and chronic signatures, with both upregulated (UP) and        downregulated (DOWN) genes. Next, we investigated these signatures in 7        transcriptomic datasets from various human neurodegenerative diseases. RESULTS:        In mouse models, the number of UP/DOWN genes per signature was 64/21 for        pan-injury and 109/79 for acute injury, whereas only 13/27 for chronic        neurodegeneration. The pan-injury-UP signature was represented by the classic        cytoskeletal hallmarks of astrocyte reaction (Gfap and Vim), plus extracellular        matrix (i.e., Cd44, Lgals1, Lgals3, Timp1), and immune response (i.e., C3,        Serping1, Fas, Stat1, Stat2, Stat3). The acute injury-UP signature was enriched        in protein synthesis and degradation (both ubiquitin-proteasome and autophagy        systems), intracellular trafficking, and anti-oxidant defense genes, whereas the        acute injury-DOWN signature included genes that regulate chromatin structure and        transcriptional activity, many of which are transcriptional repressors. The        chronic neurodegeneration-UP signature was further enriched in astrocyte-secreted        extracellular matrix proteins (Lama4, Cyr61, Thbs4), while the DOWN signature        included relevant genes such as Agl (glycogenolysis), S1pr1 (immune modulation),        and Sod2 (anti-oxidant). Only the pan-injury-UP mouse signature was clearly        present in some human neurodegenerative transcriptomic datasets. CONCLUSIONS:        Acute and chronic CNS injuries lead to distinct astrocyte gene expression        programs beyond their common astrocyte reaction signature.

Its dyshomeostasis has been        associated with accelerated cognitive decline and neurodegenerative disorders,        such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, underlying neurotoxic mechanisms        elicited by dysregulated Cu remain largely elusive. We and others previously        demonstrated that exposure to Cu in drinking water significantly exacerbated        pathological hallmarks of AD and pro-inflammatory activation of microglia,        coupled with impaired phagocytic capacity, in mouse models of AD. METHODS: In the        present study, we extended our investigation to evaluate whether chronic Cu        exposure to wild-type (WT) and J20 mouse model of AD perturbs homeostatic        dynamics of microglia and contributes to accelerated transformation of microglia        towards degenerative phenotypes that are closely associated with        neurodegeneration. We further looked for evidence of alterations in the        microglial morphology and spatial memory of the Cu-exposed mice to assess the        extent of the Cu toxicity. RESULTS: We find that chronic Cu exposure to        pre-pathological J20 mice upregulates the translation of degenerative genes and        represses homeostatic genes within microglia even in the absence amyloid-beta        plaques. We also observe similar expression signatures in Cu-exposed WT mice,        suggesting that excess Cu exposure alone could lead to perturbed microglial        homeostatic phenotypes and contribute to accelerated cognitive decline.        CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight the risk of chronic Cu exposure on cognitive        decline and altered microglia activation towards degenerative phenotypes.

Thus, AD may benefit from TREM2 activation.        Here, we examined the impact of an anti-human TREM2 agonistic mAb, AL002c, in a        mouse AD model expressing either the common variant (CV) or the R47H variant of        TREM2.

METHODS: We generated a database containing all        CSF proteins whose levels are known to be significantly altered in human AD from        47 independent, validated, proteomics studies. Using this database, which        contains 2022 AD and 2562 control human samples, we examined whether each protein        is consistently present on the basis of reliable statistical studies; and if so,        whether it is over- or under-represented in AD. Additionally, we performed a        direct analysis of available mass spectrometric data of these proteins to        generate an AD CSF peptide database with 3221 peptides for further analysis.        RESULTS: Of the 162 proteins that were identified in 2 or more studies, we        investigated their enrichment or depletion in AD CSF.

Recent evidence        suggests that meningeal lymphatic vessels are present in both the mouse and human        brain; in mice, they seem to play a role in clearing toxic amyloid-beta peptides,        which have been connected with Alzheimer disease (AD). Here, we review the        evidence linking the meningeal lymphatic system with human AD. Novel findings        suggest that the recently described meningeal lymphatic vessels could be linked        to, and possibly drain, the efferent paravascular glial lymphatic (glymphatic)        system carrying cerebrospinal fluid, after solute and immune cell exchange with        brain interstitial fluid. In so doing, the glymphatic system could contribute to        the export of toxic solutes and immune cells from the brain (an exported fluid we        wish to describe as glymph, similarly to lymph) to the meningeal lymphatic        system; the latter, by being connected with downstream anatomic regions, carries        the glymph to the conventional cervical lymphatic vessels and nodes. Thus,        abnormal function in the meningeal lymphatic system could, in theory, lead to the        accumulation, in the brain, of amyloid-beta, cellular debris, and inflammatory        mediators, as well as immune cells, resulting in damage of the brain parenchyma        and, in turn, cognitive and other neurologic dysfunctions. In addition, we        provide novel insights into APOE4-the leading genetic risk factor for AD-and its        relation to the meningeal lymphatic system. In this regard, we have reanalyzed        previously published RNA-Seq data to show that induced pluripotent stem cells        (iPSCs) carrying the APOE4 allele (either as APOE4 knock-in or stemming from        APOE4 patients) express lower levels of (a) genes associated with lymphatic        markers, and (b) genes for which well-characterized missense mutations have been        linked to peripheral lymphedema.

The complex genetically-controlled, age-, and        environmentally-dependent onset and progression of the cognitive deficits and        neuronal pathology call for better understanding of the fundamental biology of        the nervous system function. In this study, we focus on nuclear receptor binding        factor-2 (NRBF2) which modulates the transcriptional activities of retinoic acid        receptor α and retinoid X receptor α, and the autophagic activities of the        BECN1-VPS34 complex. Since both transcriptional regulation and autophagic        function are important in supporting neuronal function, we hypothesized that        NRBF2 deficiency may lead to cognitive deficits. To test this, we developed a new        mouse model with nervous system-specific knockout of Nrbf2. In a series of        behavioral assessment, we demonstrate that NRBF2 knockout in the nervous system        results in profound learning and memory deficits. Interestingly, we did not find        deficits in autophagic flux in primary neurons and the autophagy deficits were        minimal in the brain. In contrast, RNAseq analyses have identified altered        expression of genes that have been shown to impact neuronal function. The        observation that NRBF2 is involved in learning and memory suggests a new        mechanism regulating cognition involving the role of this protein in regulating        networks related to the function of retinoic acid receptors, protein folding, and        quality control.",,Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology,0376617

The increased risk of AD in women is not well understood. It        is well established that there are sex differences in metabolism and that        metabolic alterations are an early component of AD. We utilized a cross-species        approach to evaluate conserved metabolic alterations in the serum and brain of        human AD subjects, two AD mouse models, a human cell line, and two Caenorhabditis        elegans AD strains. We found a mitochondrial complex I-specific impairment in        cortical synaptic brain mitochondria in female, but not male, AD mice. In the        hippocampus, Polβ haploinsufficiency caused synaptic complex I impairment in male        and female mice, demonstrating the critical role of DNA repair in mitochondrial        function. In non-synaptic, glial-enriched, mitochondria from the cortex and        hippocampus, complex II-dependent respiration increased in female, but not male,        AD mice. These results suggested a glial upregulation of fatty acid metabolism to        compensate for neuronal glucose hypometabolism in AD. Using an unbiased        metabolomics approach, we consistently observed evidence of systemic and brain        metabolic remodeling with a shift from glucose to lipid metabolism in humans with        AD, and in AD mice. We determined that this metabolic shift is necessary for        cellular and organismal survival in C. elegans, and human cell culture AD models.        We observed sex-specific, systemic, and brain metabolic alterations in humans        with AD, and that these metabolite changes significantly correlate with amyloid        and tau pathology. Among the most significant metabolite changes was the        accumulation of glucose-6-phosphate in AD, an inhibitor of hexokinase and        rate-limiting metabolite for the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). Overall, we        identified novel mechanisms of glycolysis inhibition, PPP, and tricarboxylic acid        cycle impairment, and a neuroprotective augmentation of lipid metabolism in AD.        These findings support a sex-targeted metabolism-modifying strategy to prevent        and treat AD.",PMC7537767,Acta neuropathologica,0412041

32291306,"Intercellular Transmission of a Synthetic Bacterial Cytotoxic Prion-Like Protein        in Mammalian Cells.",10.1128/mBio.02937-19,"RepA is a bacterial protein that builds intracellular amyloid oligomers acting as        inhibitory complexes of plasmid DNA replication. When carrying a mutation        enhancing its amyloidogenesis (A31V), the N-terminal domain (WH1) generates        cytosolic amyloid particles that are inheritable within a bacterial lineage. Such        amyloids trigger in bacteria a lethal cascade reminiscent of mitochondrial        impairment in human cells affected by neurodegeneration. To fulfill all the        criteria to qualify as a prion-like protein, horizontal (intercellular)        transmissibility remains to be demonstrated for RepA-WH1. Since this is        experimentally intractable in bacteria, here we transiently expressed in a murine        neuroblastoma cell line the soluble, barely cytotoxic RepA-WH1 wild type        [RepA-WH1(WT)] and assayed its response to exposure to in vitro-assembled        RepA-WH1(A31V) amyloid fibers. In parallel, murine cells releasing RepA-WH1(A31V)        aggregates were cocultured with human neuroblastoma cells expressing        RepA-WH1(WT). Both the assembled fibers and donor-derived RepA-WH1(A31V)        aggregates induced, in the cytosol of recipient cells, the formation of cytotoxic        amyloid particles. Mass spectrometry analyses of the proteomes of both types of        injured cells pointed to alterations in mitochondria, protein quality triage,        signaling, and intracellular traffic. Thus, a synthetic prion-like protein can be        propagated to, and become cytotoxic to, cells of organisms placed at such distant        branches of the tree of life as bacteria and mammalia, suggesting that mechanisms        of protein aggregate spreading and toxicity follow default pathways.IMPORTANCE        Proteotoxic amyloid seeds can be transmitted between mammalian cells, arguing        that the intercellular exchange of prion-like protein aggregates can be a common        phenomenon. RepA-WH1 is derived from a bacterial intracellular functional amyloid        protein, engineered to become cytotoxic in Escherichia coli Here, we have studied        if such bacterial aggregates can also be transmitted to, and become cytotoxic to,        mammalian cells. We demonstrate that RepA-WH1 is capable of entering naive cells,        thereby inducing the cytotoxic aggregation of a soluble RepA-WH1 variant        expressed in the cytosol, following the same trend that had been described in        bacteria. These findings highlight the universality of one of the central        principles underlying prion biology: No matter the biological origin of a given        prion-like protein, it can be transmitted to a phylogenetically unrelated        recipient cell, provided that the latter expresses a soluble protein onto which        the incoming protein can readily template its amyloid conformation.",PMC7157824,mBio,101519231

While components of the rabies        virus genome contribute to its cytotoxic effects, the function of other neuronal        and non-neuronal cells within the vicinity of the infected host neurons in either        effecting or mitigating virally-induced tissue damage are still being elucidated.        Here, we analyzed 60,212 single-cell RNA profiles to assess both global and        cell-type-specific transcriptional responses in the mouse dorsal raphe nucleus        (DRN) following intracranial injection of glycoprotein-deleted rabies viruses and        axonal infection of dorsal raphe serotonergic neurons. Gene pathway analyses        revealed a down-regulation of genes involved in metabolic processes and        neurotransmission following infection. We also identified several        transcriptionally diverse leukocyte populations that infiltrate the brain and are        distinct from resident immune cells. Cell type-specific patterns of cytokine        expression showed that antiviral responses were likely orchestrated by Type I and        Type II interferon signaling from microglia and infiltrating CD4(+) T cells,        respectively. Additionally, we uncovered transcriptionally distinct states of        microglia along an activation trajectory that may serve different functions,        which range from surveillance to antigen presentation and cytokine secretion.        Intercellular interactions inferred from transcriptional data suggest that CD4(+)        T cells facilitate microglial state transitions during the inflammatory response.        Our study uncovers the heterogeneity of immune cells mediating neuroinflammatory        responses and provides a critical evaluation of the compatibility between        rabies-mediated connectivity mapping and single-cell transcriptional profiling.        These findings provide additional insights into the distinct contributions of        various cell types in mediating different facets of antiviral responses in the        brain and will facilitate the design of strategies to circumvent immune responses        to improve the efficacy of viral gene delivery.",PMC7098990,Frontiers in cellular neuroscience,101477935

An important aim of these studies        is the identification of candidate genes that demonstrate congruent        disease-related alterations across the different data types measured by the        study. We developed a new method to detect such candidate genes in large        multi-omic case-control studies that measure multiple data types in the same set        of samples. The method is based on a gene-centric integrative coefficient        quantifying to what degree consistent differences are observed in the different        data types. For statistical inference, a Bayesian hierarchical model is used to        study the distribution of the integrative coefficient. The model employs a        conditional autoregressive prior to integrate a functional gene network and to        share information between genes known to be functionally related. We applied the        method to an AD dataset consisting of histone acetylation, DNA methylation, and        RNA transcription data from human cortical tissue samples of 233 subjects, and we        detected 816 genes with consistent differences between persons with AD and        controls. The findings were validated in protein data and in RNA transcription        data from two independent AD studies.

Further investigation of the myeloid        network indicated an upregulation of this network in early stages of AD prior to        accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau and suggested that increased CSF1        transcription in astrocytes may contribute to microglial activation in AD. Thus,        we developed a method that integrates multiple data types and external knowledge        of gene function to detect candidate genes, applied the method to an AD dataset,        and identified several disease-related genes and processes demonstrating the        usefulness of the integrative approach.",PMC7138305,PLoS computational biology,101238922

Despite substantial efforts, genome-wide association studies have        not been able to explain most of the observed heritability. The majority of        PD-associated genetic variants are located in non-coding regions of the genome.

To explore the        protective nature of this variant, we employed latent process linear mixed models        to examine the association of p.P522R with longitudinal cognitive decline in 3595        MCI patients, and in 10,097 individuals from population-based studies.        Furthermore, association with CSF levels of pTau(181), total tau, and Aβ(1-42)        was assessed in 1261 MCI patients. We found that MCI patients who carried the        p.P522R variant showed a slower rate of cognitive decline compared to        non-carriers and that this effect was mediated by lower pTau(181) levels in CSF.        The effect size of the association of p.P522R with the cognitive decline and        pTau(181) was similar to that of APOE-ε4, the strongest genetic risk factor for        AD. Interestingly, the protective effect of p.P522R was more pronounced in MCI        patients with low Aβ(1-42) levels suggesting a role of PLCG2 in the response to        amyloid pathology. In line with this hypothesis, we observed no protective effect        of the PLCG2 variant on the cognitive decline in population-based studies        probably due to the lower prevalence of amyloid positivity in these samples        compared to MCI patients. Concerning the potential biological underpinnings, we        identified a network of co-expressed proteins connecting PLCG2 to APOE and TREM2        using unsupervised co-regulatory network analysis. The network was highly        enriched for the complement cascade and genes differentially expressed in        disease-associated microglia.

We stressed 4-month-old APP/PS1 mice using a        chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) paradigm for up to 1 month. Following        CUMS and behavioral assessments, we quantified whole protein and phosphoprotein        levels in the cortex of stressed and non-stressed APP/PS1 mice using mass        spectrometry-based proteomics.

Of these        significant phosphopeptides, only 301 were the same in males and females. These        results indicate that while both males and females undergo protein        phosphorylation changes following stress, the peptides that are phosphorylated        differ between sexes. We then used Metacore analysis to determine which        biological pathways were affected.

In addition, the discrepancy in their efficacy when translated from        preclinical models to clinical trials is addressed. Key factors that        differentiate the responsiveness to bioenergetic interventions, including sex,        apolipoprotein E genotype, and cellular diversity in the brain, are discussed.        Future Directions: We propose that the future development of        mitochondria-targeted AD therapeutics should consider the interactions between        bioenergetics and other disease mechanisms, which may require cell-type-specific        targeting to distinguish neurons and non-neuronal cells. Moreover, a successful        strategy will likely include stratification by metabolic phenotype, which varies        by sex and genetic risk profile and dynamically changes throughout the course of        disease. As the network of mitochondrial integration expands across intracellular        and systems level biology, assessment of intended, the good, versus unintended        consequences, the bad, will be required to reach the potential of mitochondrial        therapeutics.",PMC7891225,Antioxidants & redox signaling,100888899

Previous        studies have identified transcriptomic patterns in the brain associated with        alcohol dependence in both humans and animal models. But none of these studies        have systematically investigated expression within the unique cell types present        in the brain. We utilized single nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) to examine        the transcriptomes of over 16 000 nuclei isolated from the prefrontal cortex of        alcoholic and control individuals. Each nucleus was assigned to one of seven        major cell types by unsupervised clustering. Cell type enrichment patterns varied        greatly among neuroinflammatory-related genes, which are known to play roles in        alcohol dependence and neurodegeneration. Differential expression analysis        identified cell type-specific genes with altered expression in alcoholics. The        largest number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), including both        protein-coding and non-coding, were detected in astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and        microglia. To our knowledge, this is the first single cell transcriptome analysis        of alcohol-associated gene expression in any species and the first such analysis        in humans for any addictive substance.

We used        pre-symptomatic (6-months) and symptomatic (15-months) Tg2576 mouse model of AD        compared to their age-matched littermate WT control. We identified that        dysfunction of intestinal epithelial barrier (IEB), dysregulation of absorption,        and vascular Aβ deposition in the IEB occur before cerebral Aβ aggregation is        detectible. These changes in the GBA were associated with elevated inflammatory        plasma cytokines including IL-9, VEGF and IP-10. In association with reduced        cerebral myelin tight junction proteins, we identified reduced levels of systemic        vitamin B12 and decrease cubilin, an intestinal B12 transporter, after the        development of cerebral Aβ pathology. Lastly, we report Aβ deposition in the        intestinal autopsy from AD patients with confirmed cerebral Aβ pathology that is        not present in intestine from non-AD controls.

Here, we performed genome-wide circRNA        expression profiling in postmortem brains from individuals with ASD and controls        and identified 60 circRNAs and three coregulated modules that were perturbed in        ASD. By integrating circRNA, microRNA, and mRNA dysregulation data derived from        the same cortex samples, we identified 8170 ASD-associated circRNA-microRNA-mRNA        interactions. Putative targets of the axes were enriched for ASD risk genes and        genes encoding inhibitory postsynaptic density (PSD) proteins, but not for genes        implicated in monogenetic forms of other brain disorders or genes encoding        excitatory PSD proteins. This reflects the previous observation that ASD-derived        organoids show overproduction of inhibitory neurons. We further confirmed that        some ASD risk genes (NLGN1, STAG1, HSD11B1, VIP, and UBA6) were regulated by an        up-regulated circRNA (circARID1A) via sponging a down-regulated microRNA        (miR-204-3p) in human neuronal cells.

However, a large proportion (75.7%) was not attributable        to specific cells due to the heterogeneity in expression among brain cell types.        Neuronal DE genes were consistently downregulated and associated with synaptic        and neuronal processes as described previously in the field thereby validating        this approach.

Method: In this study, by reviewing 518 articles published        after 2007 on 20 diseases of the nervous system, we compiled data on 1607        mutations occurring in 365 genes, totals that are 1.9 and 3.2 times larger than        those collected in the Clinvar database, respectively. A combination with the        Clinvar data gives 2434 pathogenic mutations and 424 genes. Using this        information, we measured the genetic similarities between the diseases according        to the number of genes causing two diseases simultaneously. Further detection was        carried out on the similarity between diseases in terms of cell types.        Disease-related cell types were defined as those with disease-related gene        enrichment among the marker genes of cells, as ascertained by analyzing        single-cell sequencing data. Enrichment profiles of the disease-related genes        over 25 cell types were constructed. The disease similarity in terms of cell        types was obtained by calculating the distances between the enrichment profiles        of these genes. The same strategy was applied to measure the disease similarity        in terms of brain regions by analyzing the gene expression data from 10 brain        regions. Results: The disease similarity was first measured in terms of genes.        The result indicated that the proportions of overlapped genes between diseases        were significantly correlated to the DMN scores (phenotypic similarity), with a        Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.40 and P-value = 6.0×10(-3). The disease        similarity analysis for cell types identified that the distances between        enrichment profiles of the disease-related genes were negatively correlated to        the DMN scores, with Spearman correlation coefficient = -0.26 (P-value = 1.5 ×        10(-2)). However, the brain region enrichment profile distances of the        disease-related genes were not significantly correlated with the DMN score.        Besides the similarity of diseases, this study identified novel relationships        between diseases and cell types. Conclusion: We manually constructed the most        comprehensive dataset to date for genes with mutations related to 20 nervous        system diseases. By using this dataset, the similarities between diseases in        terms of genes and cell types were found to be significantly correlated to their        phenotypic similarity. However, the disease similarities in terms of brain        regions were not significantly correlated with the phenotypic similarities. Thus,        the phenotypic similarity between the diseases is more likely to be caused by        dysfunctions of the same genes or the same types of neurons rather than the same        brain regions.

Single-cell        sequencing studies further contributed to our understanding of microglia        heterogeneity in relation to age, sex, and CNS disease. Recently, single nucleus        gene expression profiling was performed on (frozen) CNS tissue.

Here, we        give an overview of the significant advances recently made in microglia        transcriptional profiling. In addition, we present matched cellular and nuclear        microglia RNA-seq datasets we generated from mouse and human CNS tissue to        compare cellular versus nuclear transcriptomes from fresh and frozen samples. We        demonstrate that microglia can be similarly profiled with cell and nucleus        profiling, and importantly also with nuclei isolated from frozen tissue. Nuclear        microglia transcriptomes are a reliable proxy for cellular transcriptomes.        Importantly, lipopolysaccharide-induced changes in gene expression were conserved        in the nuclear transcriptome.

Immunohistochemistry showed that SCRN1 was a neuronal protein that        abundantly accumulated in NFTs and plaque-associated dystrophic neurites        throughout the progression of AD.

However, SCRN1 did not        co-localize with phosphorylated tau inclusions in CBD, PSP or PiD.        Co-immunoprecipitation revealed that SCRN1 interacted with phosphorylated tau in        human AD brain tissue.

The importance of environmental        factors in gene environment interactions (GxE) is suggested by wide individual        differences in cognitive loss, even for carriers of AD-risk genetic variants.        RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: We propose the ""AD exposome"" to comprehensively assess        the modifiable environmental factors relevant to genetic underpinnings of        cognitive aging and AD. Analysis of endogenous and exogenous environmental        factors requires multi-generational consideration of these interactions over age        and time (GxExT). New computational approaches to the multi-level complexities        may identify accessible interventions for individual brain aging. International        collaborations on diverse populations are needed to identify the most relevant        exposures over the life course for GxE interactions.",PMC6788638,Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association,101231978
31451701,Single-Cell Quantification of mRNA Expression in The Human Brain.,10.1038/s41598-019-48787-w,"RNA analysis at the cellular resolution in the human brain is challenging. Here,        we describe an optimised approach for detecting single RNA transcripts in a        cell-type specific manner in frozen human brain tissue using multiplexed        fluorescent RNAscope probes. We developed a new robust analytical approach for        RNAscope quantification. Our method shows that low RNA integrity does not        significantly affect RNAscope signal, recapitulates bulk RNA analysis and        provides spatial context to transcriptomic analysis of human post-mortem brain at        single-cell resolution. In summary, our optimised method allows the usage of        frozen human samples from brain banks to perform quantitative RNAscope analysis.",PMC6710275,Scientific reports,101563288

The progressive extension of the average human        lifespan is bound to lead to a corresponding increase in the fraction of        cognitively impaired elderly individuals among the human population, with an        enormous societal and economic burden. At the cellular and tissue levels,        cognitive decline is linked to a reduction in specific neuronal subpopulations, a        widespread decrease in synaptic plasticity and an increase in neuroinflammation        due to an enhanced activation of astrocytes and microglia, but the molecular        mechanisms underlying these functional changes during normal aging and in        neuropathological conditions remain poorly understood. In this review, we        summarize very recent and outstanding progress in elucidating the molecular        changes associated with cognitive decline through the genome-wide profiling of        aging brain cells at different molecular levels (genomic, epigenomic,        transcriptomic, proteomic). We discuss how the correlation of different molecular        and phenotypic traits driven by mathematical and computational analyses of large        datasets has led to the prediction of key molecular nodes of neurodegenerative        pathways, and provide a few examples of candidate regulators of cognitive decline        identified with these approaches. Furthermore, we highlight the dysregulation of        the synaptic transcriptome in neuronal cells and of the inflammatory        transcriptome in glial cells as some of the key events during normal and        neuropathological human brain aging.",PMC6694319,Neurotherapeutics : the journal of the American Society for Experimental,101290381
