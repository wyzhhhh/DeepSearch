33318676,"Neuroinflammation and microglial activation in Alzheimer disease: where do we go        from here?",10.1038/s41582-020-00435-y,"Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common form of neurodegenerative disease,        estimated to contribute 60-70% of all cases of dementia worldwide. According to        the prevailing amyloid cascade hypothesis, amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition in the brain        is the initiating event in AD, although evidence is accumulating that this        hypothesis is insufficient to explain many aspects of AD pathogenesis. The        discovery of increased levels of inflammatory markers in patients with AD and the        identification of AD risk genes associated with innate immune functions suggest        that neuroinflammation has a prominent role in the pathogenesis of AD. In this        Review, we discuss the interrelationships between neuroinflammation and amyloid        and tau pathologies as well as the effect of neuroinflammation on the disease        trajectory in AD. We specifically focus on microglia as major players in        neuroinflammation and discuss the spatial and temporal variations in microglial        phenotypes that are observed under different conditions. We also consider how        these cells could be modulated as a therapeutic strategy for AD.",,Nature reviews. Neurology,101500072
38809370,"Recent Advances in Targeting Transition Metals (Copper, Iron, and Zinc) in        Alzheimer's Disease.",10.1007/s12035-024-04256-8,"Changes in the transition metal homeostasis in the brain are closely linked with        Alzheimer's disease (AD), including intraneuronal iron accumulation and        extracellular copper and zinc pooling in the amyloid plague. The brain copper,        zinc, and iron surplus are commonly acknowledged characteristics of AD, despite        disagreements among some. This has led to the theory that oxidative stress        resulting from abnormal homeostasis of these transition metals may be a causative        explanation behind AD. In the nervous system, the interaction of metals with        proteins appears to be an essential variable in the development or suppression of        neurodegeneration. Chelation treatment may be an option for treating        neurodegeneration induced by transition metal ion dyshomeostasis. Some clinicians        even recommend using chelating agents as an adjunct therapy for AD. The current        review also looks at the therapeutic strategies that have been attempted,        primarily with metal-chelating drugs. Metal buildup in the nervous system, as        reported in the AD, could be the result of compensatory mechanisms designed to        improve metal availability for physiological functions.",,Molecular neurobiology,8900963

BV2 cells were treated with Lipopolysaccharides (LPS)/Interferon-γ        (IFN-γ) to establish a microglial activation model. The glycolysis inhibitor        2-Deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) was used as a control. The expression levels of TUG1        mRNA and proinflammatory cytokines such as Interleukin-1β (IL-1β), Interleukin        -6, and Tumor Necrosis Factor-α mRNA and anti-inflammatory cytokines such as        IL-4, Arginase 1(Arg1), CD206, and Ym1 were detected by RT-qPCR. TUG1 was        silenced using TUG1 siRNA and knocked out using CRISPR/Cas9. The mRNA and protein        expression levels of key enzymes involved in glucose metabolism, such as        Hexokinase2, Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), Lactate        dehydrogenase, Glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase, and Pyruvate dehydrogenase        (PDH), were determined by RT-qPCR and Western blotting. The glycolytic rate of        microglial cells was measured using Seahorse. Differential metabolites were        determined by metabolomics, and pathway enrichment was performed using these        differential metabolites. Our findings revealed that the expression of TUG1 was        elevated in proinflammatory-activated microglia and positively correlated with        the levels of inflammatory factors. The expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines        such as IL-4, Arg1, CD206, and Ym1 were decreased when induced with LPS/IFN-γ.        However, this decrease was reversed by the treatment with 2-DG. Silencing of        GAPDH led to an increase in the expression of TUG1 and inflammatory factors. TUG1        knockout (TUG1KO) inhibited the expression of glycolytic key enzymes and promoted        the expression of oxidative phosphorylation key enzymes, shifting the metabolic        profile of activated microglia from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation.        Additionally, TUG1KO reduced the accumulation of metabolites, facilitating the        restoration of the tricarboxylic acid cycle and enhancing oxidative        phosphorylation in microglia. Furthermore, the downregulation of TUG1 was found        to reduce the expression of both proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines        under normal conditions. Interestingly, when induced with LPS/IFN-γ, TUG1        downregulation showed a potentially beneficial effect on microglia in terms of        inflammation. Downregulation of TUG1 expression inhibits glycolysis and        facilitates the shift of microglial glucose metabolism from glycolysis to        oxidative phosphorylation, promoting their transformation towards an        anti-inflammatory phenotype and exerting anti-inflammatory effects in BV2.",PMC11130314,Scientific reports,101563288

We reveal here that reactive astrocytes control cell        distancing in peri-plaque glial nets, which restricts microglial access to        amyloid deposits. This process is governed by guidance receptor Plexin-B1        (PLXNB1), a network hub gene in individuals with late-onset AD that is        upregulated in plaque-associated astrocytes. Plexin-B1 deletion in a mouse AD        model led to reduced number of reactive astrocytes and microglia in peri-plaque        glial nets, but higher coverage of plaques by glial processes, along with        transcriptional changes signifying reduced neuroinflammation. Additionally, a        reduced footprint of glial nets was associated with overall lower plaque burden,        a shift toward dense-core-type plaques and reduced neuritic dystrophy.        Altogether, our study demonstrates that Plexin-B1 regulates peri-plaque glial net        activation in AD. Relaxing glial spacing by targeting guidance receptors may        present an alternative strategy to increase plaque compaction and reduce        neuroinflammation in AD.",,Nature neuroscience,9809671

Targeting microglia and modulating their        function may have therapeutic potential for mitigating neuroinflammation and        neurodegeneration. The anti-inflammatory properties of essential oils suggest        that some of their components may be useful in regulating microglial function and        microglial-associated neuroinflammation. This study, starting from the        ethnopharmacological premises of the therapeutic benefits of aromatic plants,        assessed the evidence for the essential oil modulation of microglia,        investigating their potential pharmacological mechanisms. Current knowledge of        the phytoconstituents, safety of essential oil components, and anti-inflammatory        and potential neuroprotective effects were reviewed. This review encompasses        essential oils of Thymus spp., Artemisia spp., Ziziphora clinopodioides,        Valeriana jatamansi, Acorus spp., and others as well as some of their components        including 1,8-cineole, β-caryophyllene, β-patchoulene, carvacrol, β-ionone,        eugenol, geraniol, menthol, linalool, thymol, α-asarone, and α-thujone. Essential        oils that target PPAR/PI3K-Akt/MAPK signalling pathways could supplement other        approaches to modulate microglial-associated inflammation to treat        neurodegenerative diseases, particularly in cases where reactive microglia play a        part in the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration.",PMC11121245,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791

Neuroepigenetics bridges neuroscience and epigenetics by regulating        gene expression in the nervous system and its impact on brain function. With the        increase in research in recent years, it was observed that alterations in the        gene expression did not always originate from changes in the genetic sequence,        which has led to understanding the role of epigenetics in neurodegenerative        diseases (NDDs) including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD).        Epigenetic alterations contribute to the aberrant expression of genes involved in        neuroinflammation, protein aggregation, and neuronal death. Natural        phytochemicals have shown promise as potential therapeutic agents against NDDs        because of their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective effects in        cellular and animal models. For instance, resveratrol (grapes), curcumin        (turmeric), and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG; green tea) exhibit        neuroprotective effects through their influence on DNA methylation patterns,        histone acetylation, and non-coding RNA expression profiles. Phytochemicals also        aid in slowing disease progression, preserving neuronal function, and enhancing        cognitive and motor abilities. The present review focuses on various epigenetic        modifications involved in the pathology of NDDs, including AD and PD, gene        expression regulation related to epigenetic alterations, and the role of specific        polyphenols in influencing epigenetic modifications in AD and PD.",PMC11118909,"Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",101668981

The        designs have ensured the correct selection of patients on these trials, supported        target engagement and have been used to support claims of disease modification        and clinical efficacy. Ultimately, this has recently led to approval of        disease-modifying, amyloid-targeting therapies for AD; something that should be        noted for clinical trials investigating tau-targeting therapies for AD. There is        a clear overlap of the purpose of biomarker use at each stage of clinical        development between amyloid-targeting and tau-targeting clinical trials. However,        there are differences within the potential context of use and interpretation for        some biomarkers in particular measurements of amyloid and utility of soluble,        phosphorylated tau biomarkers. Given the complexities of tau in health and        disease, it is paramount that therapies target disease-relevant tau and, in        parallel, appropriate assays of target engagement are developed. Tau positron        emission tomography, fluid biomarkers reflecting tau pathology and downstream        measures of neurodegeneration will be important both for participant recruitment        and for monitoring disease-modification in tau-targeting clinical trials.

Recent research using the rnaset2 mutant        zebrafish model has suggested that microglia may be the drivers of the        neuropathology, due to their failure to digest apoptotic debris during        neurodevelopment. Therefore, we developed a strategy for microglial replacement        through transplantation of adult whole kidney marrow-derived macrophages into        embryonic hosts. Using live imaging, we revealed that transplant-derived        macrophages can engraft within host brains and express microglia-specific        markers, suggesting the adoption of a microglial phenotype. Tissue-clearing        strategies revealed the persistence of transplanted cells in host brains beyond        embryonic stages. We demonstrated that transplanted cells clear apoptotic cells        within the brain, as well as rescue overactivation of the antiviral response        otherwise seen in mutant larvae. RNA sequencing at the point of peak        transplant-derived cell engraftment confirms that transplantation can reduce the        brain-wide immune response and particularly, the antiviral response, in        rnaset2-deficient brains. Crucially, this reduction in neuroinflammation resulted        in behavioral rescue-restoring rnaset2 mutant motor activity to wild-type (WT)        levels in embryonic and juvenile stages. Together, these findings demonstrate the        role of microglia as the cellular drivers of neuropathology in rnaset2 mutants        and that macrophage transplantation is a viable strategy for microglial        replacement in the zebrafish. Therefore, microglia-targeted interventions may        have therapeutic benefits in RNASET2-deficient leukodystrophy.",PMC11126979,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876

TBM arises due to immune        dysregulation, but the underlying immune mechanisms are unclear. METHODS: We        performed single-cell RNA sequencing on peripheral blood mononuclear cells        (PBMCs) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cells isolated from children (n=6) with TBM        using 10 xGenomics platform. We used unsupervised clustering of cells and cluster        visualization based on the gene expression profiles, and validated the protein        and cytokines by ELISA analysis. RESULTS: We revealed for the first time 33        monocyte populations across the CSF cells and PBMCs of children with TBM. Within        these populations, we saw that CD4_C04 cells with Th17 and Th1 phenotypes and        Macro_C01 cells with a microglia phenotype, were enriched in the CSF. Lineage        tracking analysis of monocyte populations revealed myeloid cell populations, as        well as subsets of CD4 and CD8 T-cell populations with distinct effector        functions. Importantly, we discovered that complement-activated microglial        Macro_C01 cells are associated with a neuroinflammatory response that leads to        persistent meningitis. Consistently, we saw an increase in complement protein        (C1Q), inflammatory markers (CRP) and inflammatory factor (TNF-α and IL-6) in CSF        cells but not blood. Finally, we inferred that Macro_C01 cells recruit CD4_C04        cells through CXCL16/CXCR6. DISCUSSION: We proposed that the microglial Macro_C01        subset activates complement and interacts with the CD4_C04 cell subset to amplify        inflammatory signals, which could potentially contribute to augment inflammatory        signals, resulting in hyperinflammation and an immune response elicited by        Mtb-infected tissues.",PMC11091396,Frontiers in immunology,101560960

This study aimed at determining whether temporin-GHaR        peptide (GHaR) could improve cognitive function and at uncovering the underlying        mechanisms. We found that GHaR treatment alleviated LPS-induced cognitive        impairment and inhibited activation of microglia in LPS-induced mice.        Furthermore, GHaR inhibited activation of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) and        the NF-κB signaling pathway in LPS-induced mice. In vitro, GHaR inhibited M1        polarization of BV2 cells and suppressed TNF-α and IL-6 secretion. Additionally,        GHaR neuronal cell viability and apoptosis were induced by LPS-activated        microglia-conditioned medium. Moreover, in LPS-induced BV2 cells, GHaR inhibited        activation of ERS and the NF-κB signaling pathway. In summary, GHaR improved        LPS-induced cognitive and attenuated inflammatory responses via microglial        activation reversal.

Impaired amyloid beta        (Aβ) clearance is critical in the pathogenesis of sporadic AD, and blood        monocytes play an important role in Aβ clearance in the periphery. However, the        mechanism underlying the defective phagocytosis of Aβ by monocytes in AD remains        unclear. METHODS: Initially, we collected whole blood samples from sporadic AD        patients and isolated the monocytes for RNA sequencing analysis. By establishing        APP/PS1 transgenic model mice with monocyte-specific cystatin F overexpression,        we assessed the influence of monocyte-derived cystatin F on AD development. We        further used a nondenaturing gel to identify the structure of the secreted        cystatin F in plasma. Flow cytometry, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and        laser scanning confocal microscopy were used to analyse the internalization of Aβ        by monocytes. Pull down assays, bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays        and total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy were used to determine the        interactions and potential interactional amino acids between the cystatin F        protein and Aβ. Finally, the cystatin F protein was purified and injected via the        tail vein into 5XFAD mice to assess AD pathology. RESULTS: Our results        demonstrated that the expression of the cystatin F protein was specifically        increased in the monocytes of AD patients. Monocyte-derived cystatin F increased        Aβ deposition and exacerbated cognitive deficits in APP/PS1 mice. Furthermore,        secreted cystatin F in the plasma of AD patients has a dimeric structure that is        closely related to clinical signs of AD. Moreover, we noted that the cystatin F        dimer blocks the phagocytosis of Aβ by monocytes. Mechanistically, the cystatin F        dimer physically interacts with Aβ to inhibit its recognition and internalization        by monocytes through certain amino acid interactions between the cystatin F dimer        and Aβ. We found that high levels of the cystatin F dimer protein in blood        contributed to amyloid pathology and cognitive deficits as a risk factor in 5XFAD        mice. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight that the cystatin F dimer plays a        crucial role in regulating Aβ metabolism via its peripheral clearance pathway,        providing us with a potential biomarker for diagnosis and potential target for        therapeutic intervention.",PMC11088181,Journal of neuroinflammation,101222974

Although SMA is a genetic disease,        environmental factors contribute to disease progression. Common pathogen        components such as lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are considered significant        contributors to inflammation and have been associated with muscle atrophy, which        is considered a hallmark of SMA. In this study, we used the SMNΔ7 experimental        mouse model of SMA to scrutinize the effect of systemic LPS administration, a        strong pro-inflammatory stimulus, on disease outcome. Systemic LPS administration        promoted a reduction in SMN expression levels in CNS, peripheral lymphoid organs,        and skeletal muscles. Moreover, peripheral tissues were more vulnerable to        LPS-induced damage compared to CNS tissues. Furthermore, systemic LPS        administration resulted in a profound increase in microglia and astrocytes with        reactive phenotypes in the CNS of SMNΔ7 mice. In conclusion, we hereby show for        the first time that systemic LPS administration, although it may not precipitate        alterations in terms of deficits of motor functions in a mouse model of SMA, it        may, however, lead to a reduction in the SMN protein expression levels in the        skeletal muscles and the CNS, thus promoting synapse damage and glial cells'        reactive phenotype.",PMC11083572,Cells,101600052

Method: The present study investigated        protective effects of RGLS against intracerebroventricular streptozotocin        (ICV-STZ)-induced depression in a rat model of sAD and its underlying mechanism.        Effects of RGLS on depression- and anxiety-like behaviors in ICV-STZ rats were        assessed in the forced swim test, sucrose preference test, novelty-suppressed        feeding test, and open field test. Results: Behavioral tests demonstrated that        RGLS (360 and 720 mg/kg) significantly ameliorated ICV-STZ-induced depression-        and anxiety-like behaviors. Immunofluorescence, Western blot and enzyme-linked        immunosorbent assay results further demonstrated that ICV-STZ rats exhibited        microglia activation and neuroinflammatory response in the medial prefrontal        cortex (mPFC), and RGLS treatment reversed these changes, reflected by the        normalization of morphological changes in microglia and the expression of NF-κB,        NLRP3, ASC, caspase-1 and proinflammatory cytokines. Golgi staining revealed that        treatment with RGLS increased the density of mushroom spines in neurons.

Discussion: In a rat model of ICV-STZ-induced sAD, RGLS        exhibits antidepressant-like effects, the mechanism of which may be related to        suppression of the inflammatory response modulated by the NF-κB/NLRP3 pathway and        enhancement of synaptic plasticity in the mPFC.",PMC11076787,Frontiers in pharmacology,101548923

Results: Treatment with        720 mg/kg RGLS for 14 days significantly improved the reduction of total sleep        time, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep time, and non-REM sleep time in sAD rats.        The novelty recognition experiment further confirmed that RGLS prevented        cognitive impairments in sAD rats. We also found that RGLS inhibited the nuclear        factor-κB (NF-κB)/Nod-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3)        inflammatory pathway in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in sAD rats and        ameliorated the lower activity of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic neurons in the        parabrachial nucleus (PBN). Discussion: These results suggest that inhibiting the        neuroinflammatory response in the mPFC may be a mechanism by which RGLS improves        cognitive impairment. Additionally, improvements in PBN-GABAergic activity and        the suppression of neuroinflammation in the mPFC in sAD rats might be a critical        pathway to explain the preventive effects of RGLS on sleep disturbances in sAD.",PMC11076761,Frontiers in pharmacology,101548923

This study aims to clarify whether a different pattern of        neuroinflammation, such as alteration in microglial and astroglial morphology and        distribution, is present in DLB cases with and without AD co-pathology. METHODS:        The morphology and load (% area of immunopositivity) of total (Iba1) and reactive        microglia (CD68 and HLA-DR), reactive astrocytes (GFAP) and proteinopathies of        alpha-synuclein (KM51/pser129), amyloid-beta (6 F/3D) and p-tau (AT8) were        assessed in a cohort of mixed DLB + AD (n = 35), pure DLB (n = 15), pure AD        (n = 16) and control (n = 11) donors in limbic and neocortical brain regions        using immunostaining, quantitative image analysis and confocal microscopy.        Regional and group differences were estimated using a linear mixed model        analysis. RESULTS: Morphologically, reactive and amoeboid microglia were common        in mixed DLB + AD, while homeostatic microglia with a small soma and thin        processes were observed in pure DLB cases. A higher density of swollen astrocytes        was observed in pure AD cases, but not in mixed DLB + AD or pure DLB cases. Mixed        DLB + AD had higher CD68-loads in the amygdala and parahippocampal gyrus than        pure DLB cases, but did not differ in astrocytic loads. Pure AD showed higher        Iba1-loads in the CA1 and CA2, higher CD68-loads in the CA2 and subiculum, and a        higher astrocytic load in the CA1-4 and subiculum than mixed DLB + AD cases. In        mixed DLB + AD cases, microglial load associated strongly with amyloid-beta        (Iba1, CD68 and HLA-DR), and p-tau (CD68 and HLA-DR), and minimally with        alpha-synuclein load (CD68). In addition, the highest microglial activity was        found in the amygdala and CA2, and astroglial load in the CA4. Confocal        microscopy demonstrated co-localization of large amoeboid microglia with neuritic        and classic-cored plaques of amyloid-beta and p-tau in mixed DLB + AD cases.        CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, microglial activation in DLB was largely associated        with AD co-pathology, while astrocytic response in DLB was not. In addition,        microglial activity was high in limbic regions, with prevalent AD pathology.

Over the past decade, the field of intestinal        microbiota associated with aging has received considerable attention. However,        there is limited information surrounding microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA) to        further reveal the mechanism of aging. METHODS: In this study, locomotory        function and sensory function were evaluated through a series of behavioral        tests.Metabolic profiling were determined by using indirect calorimetry.16s rRNA        sequence and targeted metabolomics analyses were performed to investigate        alterations in the gut microbiota and fecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). The        serum cytokines were detected by a multiplex cytokine assay.The expression of        proinflammatory factors were detected by western blotting. RESULTS: Decreased        locomotor activity, decreased pain sensitivity, and reduced respiratory metabolic        profiling were observed in aged mice. High-throughput sequencing revealed that        the levels of genus Lactobacillus and Dubosiella were reduced, and the levels of        genus Alistipes and Bacteroides were increased in aged mice. Certain bacterial        genus were directly associated with the decline of physiological behaviors in        aged mice. Furthermore, the amount of fecal SCFAs in aged mice was decreased,        accompanied by an upregulation in the circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines and        increased expression of inflammatory factors in the brain. DISCUSSION:        Aging-induced microbial dysbiosis was closely related with the overall decline in        behavior, which may attribute to the changes in metabolic products, e.g., SCFAs,        caused by an alteration in the gut microbiota, leading to inflammaging and        contributing to neurological deficits.

Mouse models of AD and postmortem biopsy of patients        with AD reveal retinal glial activation comparable to central nervous system        immunoreactivity. We hypothesized that the surface area of putative retinal        gliosis observed in vivo using en face optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging        will be larger in patients with preclinical AD versus controls. METHODS: The        Spectralis II instrument was used to acquire macular centered 20 × 20 and 30 ×        25-degrees spectral domain OCT images of 76 participants (132 eyes). A cohort of        22 patients with preclinical AD (40 eyes, mean age = 69 years, range = 60-80        years) and 20 control participants (32 eyes, mean age = 66 years, range = 58-82        years, P = 0.11) were included for the assessment of difference in surface area        of putative retinal gliosis and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness. The        surface area of putative retinal gliosis and RNFL thickness for the nine sectors        of the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) map were compared        between groups using generalized linear mixed models. RESULTS: The surface area        of putative retinal gliosis was significantly greater in the preclinical AD group        (0.97 ± 0.55 mm2) compared to controls (0.68 ± 0.40 mm2); F(1,70) = 4.41, P =        0.039; Cohen's d = 0.61. There was no significant difference between groups for        RNFL thickness in the 9 ETDRS sectors, P > 0.05.

However, historical biomedical research on the brain has unique        characteristics that differ from those of conventional biomedical research. For        example, there are different scientific interpretations due to the high        complexity of the brain and insufficient intercommunication between researchers        of different disciplines owing to the limited conceptual and technical overlap of        distinct backgrounds.

However, the specific anti-neuralgia        mechanism of Stauntonia chinensis is unknown. In this study, the analgesic effect        of Stauntonia chinensis injection (SCI) in mice with neuropathic pain and the        possible mechanisms are explored. We find that a local injection of 0.1 mL        Stauntonia chinensis for 14 days can considerably relieve mechanical hyperalgesia        and thermal hyperalgesia in mice with sciatic chronic constriction injury (CCI).        Immunofluorescence staining shows that SCI reduces neuroinflammation in the        spinal cord of CCI mice.

While peroxisome        proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) agonists have demonstrated        potential therapeutic actions on neuroinflammation, their prolonged use, such as        with rosiglitazone, can lead to cardiac risks and lipid differentiation        disorders. In this study, we investigated the effects of a newly synthesized        PPARγ agonist, VSP-2, on secretion of inflammatory cytokines in BV2 cells.        Treatment with VSP-2 significantly reduced the mRNA and protein levels of        proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6, and tumor        necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Furthermore, VSP-2 attenuated the phosphorylation of        nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) (65 kD) and IκBα, as well as the nuclear        translocation of NF-κB (65 kD).

AIM:        To identify and validate the immune-related genes in the hippocampus associated        with T2DM-related cognitive impairment. METHODS: To identify differentially        expressed genes (DEGs) between T2DM and controls, we used data from the Gene        Expression Omnibus database GSE125387. To identify T2DM module genes, we used        Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis. All the genes were subject to Gene        Set Enrichment Analysis. Protein-protein interaction network construction and        machine learning were utilized to identify three hub genes. Immune cell        infiltration analysis was performed. The three hub genes were validated in        GSE152539 via receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Validation        experiments including reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR, Western        blotting and immunohistochemistry were conducted both in vivo and in vitro. To        identify potential drugs associated with hub genes, we used the Comparative        Toxicogenomics Database (CTD). RESULTS: A total of 576 DEGs were identified using        GSE125387. By taking the intersection of DEGs, T2DM module genes, and        immune-related genes, a total of 59 genes associated with the immune system were        identified. Afterward, machine learning was utilized to identify three hub genes        (H2-T24, Rac3, and Tfrc). The hub genes were associated with a variety of immune        cells. The three hub genes were validated in GSE152539.

RESULTS: We examined effects of Y-2        versus Eda alone by i.p. administered in 8-week-old 5×FAD mice (females) for 4        months by comparing cognitive function, Aβ pathologies, neuronal necroptosis and        neuroinflammation. Using primary neurons and astrocytes, as well as neuronal and        astrocytic cell lines, we elucidated the molecular mechanisms of Y-2 by examining        neuronal injury, astrocyte-mediated inflammation and necroptosis. Here, we find        that Y-2 improves cognitive function in AD mice. Histopathological data show that        Y-2, better than Eda alone, markedly ameliorates Aβ pathologies including Aβ        burden, astrogliosis/microgliosis, and Tau phosphorylation.

Chemerin, an adipokine implicated in neuroinflammation, acts through        its receptor, chemokine-like receptor 1 (CMKLR1), which also functions as a        receptor for amyloid β (Aβ). The impact of the chemerin/CMKLR1 axis on astrocyte        migration towards Aβ plaques is unknown. Here we investigated the effect of        CMKLR1 on astrocyte migration around Aβ deposition in APP/PS1 mice with Cmklr1        knockout (APP/PS1-Cmklr1(-/-)). CMKLR1-expressed astrocytes were upregulated in        the cortices and hippocampi of 9-month-old APP/PS1 mice.

Activation of the chemerin/CMKLR1 axis promoted the migration of primary        cultured astrocytes and U251 cells, and reduced astrocyte clustering induced by        Aβ(42). Mechanistic studies revealed that chemerin/CMKLR1 activation induced        STING phosphorylation.

Correcting the        abnormal functions of microglia is a potential therapeutic strategy for these        diseases. Nucleotide-binding domain leucine-rich repeat and pyrin        domain-containing receptor (NLRP) 3 inflammasomes are implicated in adverse        microglial activation and their inhibitors, such as the natural compounds        oridonin and shikonin, reduce microglial immune responses. We hypothesized that        some of the beneficial effects of oridonin and shikonin on microglia are        independent of their suppression of NLRP3 inflammasomes. Murine and human        microglia-like cells were stimulated with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS)        only, which did not induce NLRP3 inflammasome activation or the resulting        secretion of interleukin (IL)-1β, allowing for the identification of other        anti-inflammatory effects.

Translocator        protein (TSPO) PET, sensitive to activated microglia, shows high signal in dorsal        brainstem in humans, but the precise location and clinical correlates of this        signal are unknown. OBJECTIVE: To define age and AD associations of brainstem        TSPO PET signal in humans. METHODS: We applied new probabilistic maps of        brainstem nuclei to quantify PET-measured TSPO expression over the whole brain        including brainstem in 71 subjects (43 controls scanned using 11C-PK11195; 20        controls and 8 AD subjects scanned using 11C-PBR28). We focused on inferior        colliculi (IC) because of visually-obvious high signal in this region, and        potential relevance to auditory dysfunction in AD. We also assessed bilateral        cortex. RESULTS: TSPO expression was normally high in IC and other brainstem        regions. IC TSPO was decreased with aging (p = 0.001) and in AD subjects versus        controls (p = 0.004). In cortex, TSPO expression was increased with aging        (p = 0.030) and AD (p = 0.033). CONCLUSIONS: Decreased IC TSPO expression with        aging and AD-an opposite pattern than in cortex-highlights underappreciated        regional heterogeneity in microglia phenotype, and implicates IC in a biological        explanation for strong links between hearing loss and AD. Unlike in cerebrum,        where TSPO expression is considered pathological, activated microglia in IC and        other brainstem nuclei may play a beneficial, homeostatic role.

However, how the albumin, the        most abundant protein in the plasma, leaking through the disrupted BBB,        contributes to the neuropathology remains poorly understood. We here demonstrated        that mouse serum albumin-activated microglia induced astrocytes to A1 phenotype        to remarkably increase levels of Elovl1, an astrocytic synthase for very        long-chain saturated fatty acids, significantly promoting VLSFAs secretion and        causing neuronal lippoapoptosis through endoplasmic reticulum stress response        pathway. Moreover, MSA-activated microglia triggered remarkable tau        phosphorylation at multiple sites through NLRP3 inflammasome pathway.        Intracerebroventricular injection of MSA into the brains of C57BL/6J mice to a        similar concentration as in patient brains induced neuronal apoptosis,        neuroinflammation, increased tau phosphorylation, and decreased the spatial        learning and memory abilities, while Elovl1 knockdown significantly prevented the        deleterious effect of MSA. Overall, our study here revealed that MSA induced tau        phosphorylation and neuron apoptosis based on MSA-activated microglia and        astrocytes, respectively, showing the critical roles of MSA in initiating the        occurrence of tauopathies and cognitive decline, and providing potential        therapeutic targets for MSA-induced neuropathology in multiple neurodegenerative        disorders.",PMC11040793,Acta neuropathologica communications,101610673

Mutations in GRN are        one of the most common genetic causes of FTD, near ubiquitously resulting in        progranulin (PGRN) haploinsufficiency. Small molecules that can restore PGRN        protein to healthy levels in individuals bearing a heterozygous GRN mutation may        thus have therapeutic value. Here, we show that epigenetic modulation through        bromodomain and extra-terminal domain (BET) inhibitors (BETi) potently enhance        PGRN protein levels, both intracellularly and secreted forms, in human central        nervous system (CNS)-relevant cell types, including in microglia-like cells. In        terms of potential for disease modification, we show BETi treatment effectively        restores PGRN levels in neural cells with a GRN mutation known to cause PGRN        haploinsufficiency and FTD. We demonstrate that BETi can rapidly and durably        enhance PGRN in neural progenitor cells (NPCs) in a manner dependent upon BET        protein expression, suggesting a gain-of-function mechanism. We further describe        a CNS-optimized BETi chemotype that potently engages endogenous BRD4 and enhances        PGRN expression in neuronal cells.

Our        mini-review explores the complex relationship between bone marrow aging and its        impact on immunosenescence, specifically within the context of neurological        diseases. The bone marrow serves as a crucial hub for hematopoiesis and immune        cell production, yet with age, it undergoes significant alterations, including        alterations in hematopoietic stem cell function, niche composition, and        inflammatory signaling.

Our prior studies have revealed        that loss of Adaptor protein-4 (AP-4) complex function, linked primarily to        Spastic Paraplegia (HSP), leads to a similar build of lysosomes in structures we        term ""AP-4 dystrophies"". Surprisingly, these AP-4 dystrophies were also        characterized by enrichment of components of APP processing machinery, β-site        cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and Presenilin 2. Our studies examining whether the        abnormal axonal lysosome build up resulting from AP-4 loss could lead to        amyloidogenesis revealed that the loss of AP-4 complex function in an Alzheimer's        disease model resulted in a strong increase in size and abundance of amyloid        plaques in the hippocampus and corpus callosum as well as increased microglial        association with the plaques.

In recent years, the proportion of AD patients in        Intensive Care Units (ICU) has been on the rise. Simultaneously, the use of        mechanical ventilation (MV) is becoming more prevalent among this specific        patient group. Considering the pathophysiological characteristics of AD, the        application of MV in AD patients may lead to different outcomes. However, due to        insufficient research data, the significant impact of MV on the prognosis of AD        patients in the ICU remains unclear. Therefore, we conducted this study to        comprehensively evaluate the potential influence of MV on the survival rate of AD        patients in the ICU. METHODS: We obtained data from the MIMIC-IV database for        patients diagnosed with AD. Using propensity score matching (PSM), we paired        patients who received MV treatment with those who did not receive treatment.        Next, we conducted Cox regression analysis to evaluate the association between MV        and in-hospital mortality, 7-day mortality, 28-day mortality, 90-day mortality,        4-year mortality, length of hospital stay, and ICU stay. RESULTS: The data        analysis involved a cohort of 641 AD patients spanning from 2008 to 2019,        inclusive. Following a 1:2 propensity score matching (PSM) procedure, 300        patients were successfully paired, comprising 123 individuals who underwent MV        treatment and 177 who did not. MV demonstrated an association with an elevated        risk of in-hospital mortality (HR 5.782; 95% CI 2.981-11.216; p < 0.001), 7-day        mortality (HR 6.353; 95% CI 3.014-13.392; p < 0.001), 28-day mortality (HR 3.210;        95% CI 1.977-5.210; p < 0.001), 90-day mortality (HR 2.334; 95% CI 1.537-3.544; p        < 0.001), and 4-year mortality (HR 1.861; 95% CI 1.370-2.527; p < 0.001).        Furthermore, it was associated with a prolonged length of ICU stay [3.6(2.2,5.8)        vs. 2.2(1.6,3.7); p = 0.001]. In the subgroup analysis, we further confirmed the        robustness of the results obtained from the overall population. Additionally, we        observed a significant interaction (p-interaction <0.05) between age, admission        type, aspirin use, statin use, and the use of MV. CONCLUSION: In patients with AD        who are receiving treatment in the ICU, the use of MV has been linked to higher        short-term, medium-term, and long-term mortality rates, as well as prolong ICU        stays. Therefore, it is crucial to break away from conventional thinking and        meticulously consider both the medical condition and personal preferences of        these vulnerable patients.

Numerous        studies have asserted a close association between neuroinflammation and disrupted        cerebral energetics. During AD progression and other neurodegenerative disorders,        a persistent state of chronic neuroinflammation reportedly exacerbates        cytotoxicity and potentiates neuronal death. Here, we assessed the impact of a        neuroinflammatory challenge on metabolic demand and microvascular hemodynamics in        the somatosensory cortex of an AD mouse model. METHODS: We utilized in vivo        2-photon microscopy and the phosphorescent oxygen sensor Oxyphor 2P to measure        partial pressure of oxygen (pO2) and capillary red blood cell flux in cortical        microvessels of awake mice.

Neuroinflammation provoked significant reductions in cerebral        intravascular oxygen levels and elevated oxygen extraction in both animal groups,        without significantly altering red blood cell flux in capillaries. CONCLUSIONS:        This study provides evidence that neuroinflammation alters cerebral oxygen demand        at the early stages of AD without substantially altering vascular oxygen supply.        The results will guide our understanding of neuroinflammation's influence on        neuroimaging biomarkers for early AD diagnosis.",PMC11005245,Alzheimer's research & therapy,101511643

Urban [Apiaceae] (CAW)        has demonstrated cognitive-enhancing effects in mouse models of Alzheimer's        disease and aging, the magnitude of which is influenced by whether CAW is        delivered in the drinking water or the diet.

The effect of CAW        on neuroinflammation, however, has not been directly studied. Here, we        investigated the effect of CAW on neuroinflammation in 5xFAD mice and compared        plasma levels of CAW's active compounds following two modes of CAW        administration. METHODS: Eight-to-nine-month-old male and female 5xFAD mice and        their wild-type littermates were administered CAW in their diet or drinking water        (0 or 1,000 mg/kg/day) for five weeks. Immunohistochemistry was performed for        β-amyloid (Aβ), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and Griffonia        simplicifolia lectin I (GSL I) in the cortex and hippocampus. Gene expression of        inflammatory mediators (IL-6, TNFα, IL-1β, TREM2, AIF1, CX3CR1, CX3CL1, CD36,        C3AR1, RAGE, CCR6, CD3E) was measured in the deep grey matter. RESULTS: CAW        decreased cortical Aβ plaque burden in female 5xFAD mice administered CAW in the        drinking water but had no effect on Aβ plaques in other treatment groups. CAW did        not impact elevated levels of GFAP or GSL I in 5xFAD mice, regardless of sex,        brain region, or mode of CAW administration. In the deep grey matter, CAW        increased C3AR1 expression in 5xFAD females administered CAW in the drinking        water and decreased IL-1β expression in 5xFAD males administered CAW in the diet.        CAW had no effect, however, on gene expression levels of any other inflammatory        mediator in the deep grey, for either sex or mode of CAW administration. Mice        administered CAW in the drinking water versus the diet had significantly higher        plasma levels of CAW compounds. DISCUSSION: CAW had little impact on the        neuroinflammatory markers selected for evaluation in the present study,        suggesting that the cognitive benefits of CAW may not be mediated by an        anti-inflammatory effect or that additional molecular markers are needed to fully        characterize the effect of CAW on neuroinflammation.",PMC10999680,Frontiers in neuroscience,101478481

By forming a complex with        mitochondrial Tu translation elongation factor (TUFM), TSFM participates in        mitochondrial protein translation. We have previously reported that TUFM        regulates translation of beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) via ROS        (reactive oxygen species)-dependent mechanism, suggesting a potential role in        amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing associated with Alzheimer's disease        (AD), which led to the speculation that TSFM may regulate APP processing in a        similar way to TUFM. METHODS AND RESULTS: Here, we report that in cultured cells,        knockdown or overexpression TSFM did not change protein levels in BACE1 and APP.        Besides, the levels of cytoplasmic ROS and mitochondrial superoxide, in addition        to ATP level, cell viability and mitochondrial membrane potential were not        significantly altered by TSFM knockdown in the short term. Further transcriptome        analysis revealed that expression of majority of mitochondrial genes were not        remarkably changed by TSFM silencing. The possibility of TSFM involved in        cardiomyopathy and cancer development was uncovered using bioinformatics        analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, short-term regulation of TSFM level in        cultured cells does not cause a significant change in proteins involved in APP        processing, levels in ROS and ATP associated with mitochondrial function. Whereas        our study could contribute to comprehend certain clinical features of TSFM        mutations, the roles of TSFM in cardiomyopathy and cancer development might        deserve further investigation.",,Molecular biology reports,0403234

Current treatments are        inadequate and there is a need to develop new approaches to drug discovery.        Recently, in cancer, morphological profiling has been used in combination with        high-throughput screening of small-molecule libraries in human cells in vitro. To        test feasibility of this approach for Alzheimer's disease, we developed a cell        morphology-based drug screen centred on the risk gene, SORL1 (which encodes the        protein SORLA). Increased Alzheimer's disease risk has been repeatedly linked to        variants in SORL1, particularly those conferring loss or decreased expression of        SORLA, and lower SORL1 levels are observed in post-mortem brain samples from        individuals with Alzheimer's disease. Consistent with its role in the        endolysosomal pathway, SORL1 deletion is associated with enlarged endosomes in        neural progenitor cells and neurons. We, therefore, hypothesized that        multi-parametric, image-based cell phenotyping would identify features        characteristic of SORL1 deletion. An automated morphological profiling method        (Cell Painting) was adapted to neural progenitor cells and used to determine the        phenotypic response of SORL1(-/-) neural progenitor cells to treatment with        compounds from a small internationally approved drug library (TargetMol, 330        compounds). We detected distinct phenotypic signatures for SORL1(-/-) neural        progenitor cells compared to isogenic wild-type controls. Furthermore, we        identified 16 compounds (representing 14 drugs) that reversed the mutant        morphological signatures in neural progenitor cells derived from three SORL1(-/-)        induced pluripotent stem cell sub-clones. Network pharmacology analysis revealed        the 16 compounds belonged to five mechanistic groups: 20S proteasome, aldehyde        dehydrogenase, topoisomerase I and II, and DNA synthesis inhibitors.

At the heart of AD pathogenesis is the amyloid-β (Aβ) protein        precursor (APP), with the interaction between APP and the adaptor protein Mint2        being crucial. Despite previous explorations into the APP-Mint2 interaction, the        dynamic regulatory mechanisms by which Mint2 modulates APP binding remain poorly        understood. This study undertakes molecular dynamics simulations across four        distinct systems-free Mint2, Mint2 bound to APP, a mutant form of Mint2, and the        mutant form bound to APP-over an extensive 400 ns timeframe. Our findings reveal        that the mutant Mint2 experiences significant secondary structural        transformations, notably the formation of an α-helix in residues S55-K65 upon APP        binding, within the 400 ns simulation period. Additionally, we observed a        reduction in the active pocket size of the mutant Mint2 compared to its wild-type        counterpart, enhancing its APP binding affinity.

This study aims to        evaluate the effectiveness of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS)        as a treatment for AD by summarizing the evidence from systematic reviews (SRs)        and meta-analyses (MAs). METHODS: SRs/MAs of rTMS for AD were collected by        searching Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, PubMed, CNKI, VIP, Sino-Med,        and Wanfang databases. The search was conducted from database creation to January        23, 2024. Methodological quality, reporting quality and risk of bias were        assessed using the Assessing Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews 2        (AMSTAR-2), Risk of Bias in Systematic Reviews (ROBIS) tool and the Preferred        Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). In addition,        the quality of evidence for outcome measures was assessed using the Grading of        Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). RESULTS: Eight        SRs/MAs included in this study met the inclusion criteria. Based on the AMSTAR-2,        4 of the SRs/MA were classified as low quality, while the remaining 4 were deemed        to be of very low quality. The PRISMA analysis revealed that out of the 27 items        reporting, 16 achieved full reporting (100%). However, there were still some        deficiencies in reporting, particularly related to protocol and registration,        search strategy, risk of bias, and additional analysis. The ROBIS tool indicated        that only 3 SRs/MAs had a low risk of bias. The GRADE assessment indicated that 6        outcomes were of moderate quality (18.75%), 16 were of low quality (50%), and 10        were classified as very low quality (31.25%). CONCLUSION: Based on the evidence        collected, rTMS appears to be effective in improving cognitive function in AD        patients, although the methodological quality of the SRs/MAs reduces the        reliability of the conclusions and the overall quality is low. However, based on        the available results, we still support the value of rTMS as an intervention to        improve cognitive function in AD. In future studies, it is necessary to confirm        the efficacy of rTMS in AD patients and provide more reliable and scientific data        to contribute to evidence-based medicine.",PMC10987751,Frontiers in aging neuroscience,101525824

METHODS: The humanized APP(NL-G-F) knock-in mouse line was        crossed to the PS19 MAPT(P301S), over-expression mouse line to create the dual        APPNL-G-F/PS19 MAPTP301S line. The resulting pathologies were characterized by        immunochemical methods and PCR. RESULTS: We now report on a double transgenic        APP(NL-G-F)/PS19 MAPT(P301S) mouse that at 6 months of age exhibits robust A        plaque accumulation, intense MAPT pathology, strong inflammation and extensive        neurodegeneration. The presence of A pathology potentiated the other major        pathologies, including MAPT pathology, inflammation and neurodegeneration. MAPT        pathology neither changed levels of amyloid precursor protein nor potentiated A        accumulation. Interestingly, study of immunofluorescence in cleared brains        indicates that microglial inflammation was generally stronger in the hippocampus,        dentate gyrus and entorhinal cortex, which are regions with predominant MAPT        pathology. The APP(NL-G-F)/MAPT(P301S) mouse model also showed strong        accumulation of N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A), which was recently shown to be        elevated in the AD brain. m(6)A primarily accumulated in neuronal soma, but also        co-localized with a subset of astrocytes and microglia. The accumulation of m(6)A        corresponded with increases in METTL3 and decreases in ALKBH5, which are enzymes        that add or remove m6A from mRNA, respectively. DISCUSSION: Our understanding of        the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been hampered by lack animal        models that recapitulate the major AD pathologies, including extracellular        -amyloid (A) deposition, intracellular aggregation of microtubule associated        protein tau (MAPT), inflammation and neurodegeneration.

By applying high-throughput sequencing, we examined        the expression of differentially expressed genes in normal and CSE rats.        Subsequent RT-qPCR enabled us to measure the level of Mir155hg in rat hippocampal        tissue. Targeted knockdown of Mir155hg was achieved by the AAV9 virus.        Additionally, we utilized HE and Tunel staining to evaluate neuronal injury.        Immunofluorescence (IF), Golgi staining, and brain path clamping were also used        to detect the synaptic plasticity of hippocampal neurons. Finally, through IF        staining and Sholl analysis, we assessed the degree of microglial phagocytic        function. It was found that the expression of Mir155hg was elevated in CSE rats.        HE and Tunel staining results showed that Mir155hg knockdown suppressed the        hippocampal neuron loss and apoptosis followed CSE. IF, Golgi staining and brain        path clamp data found that Mir155hg knockdown enhanced neuronal synaptic        plasticity.

Likewise, microRNAs are involved in many        biological processes and diseases playing a key role in pathogenesis, especially        in multifactorial diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, our aim has        been to provide partial insights into the interconnection between G9a, microRNAs,        oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation. To better understand the biology of G9a,        we compared the global microRNA expression between senescence-accelerated        mouse-prone 8 (SAMP8) control mice and SAMP8 treated with G9a inhibitor UNC0642.        We found a downregulation of miR-128 after a G9a inhibition treatment, which        interestingly binds to the 3' untranslated region (3'-UTR) of        peroxisome-proliferator activator receptor γ (PPARG) mRNA. Accordingly, Pparg        gene expression levels were higher in the SAMP8 group treated with G9a inhibitor        than in the SAMP8 control group. We also observed modulation of oxidative stress        responses might be mainly driven Pparg after G9a inhibitor. To confirm these        antioxidant effects, we treated primary neuron cell cultures with hydrogen        peroxide as an oxidative insult. In this setting, treatment with G9a inhibitor        increases both cell survival and antioxidant enzymes. Moreover, up-regulation of        PPARγ by G9a inhibitor could also increase the expression of genes involved in        DNA damage responses and apoptosis. In addition, we also described that the        PPARγ/AMPK axis partially explains the regulation of autophagy markers        expression. Finally, PPARγ/GADD45α potentially contributes to enhancing synaptic        plasticity and neurogenesis after G9a inhibition.

38519490,The aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 rs671 variant enhances amyloid β pathology.,10.1038/s41467-024-46899-0,"In the ALDH2 rs671 variant, a guanine changes to an adenine, resulting in a        dramatic decrease in the catalytic activity of the enzyme. Population-based data        are contradictory about whether this variant increases the risk of Alzheimer's        disease. In East Asian populations, the prevalence of the ALDH2 rs671 variant is        30-50%, making the National Human Brain Bank for Development and Function (the        largest brain bank in East Asia) an important resource to explore the link        between the ALDH2 rs671 polymorphism and Alzheimer's disease pathology. Here,        using 469 postmortem brains, we find that while the ALDH2 rs671 variant is        associated with increased plaque deposits and a higher Aβ40/42 ratio, it is not        an independent risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. Mechanistically, we show that        lower ALDH2 activity leads to 4-HNE accumulation in the brain. The (R)-4-HNE        enantiomer adducts to residue Lys53 of C99, favoring Aβ40 generation in the Golgi        apparatus. Decreased ALDH2 activity also lowers inflammatory factor secretion, as        well as amyloid β phagocytosis and spread in brains of patients with Alzheimer's        disease. We thus define the relationship between the ALDH2 rs671 polymorphism and        amyloid β pathology, and find that ALDH2 rs671 is a key regulator of Aβ40 or Aβ42        generation.",PMC10959958,Nature communications,101528555

Changes in the proteomics        of heart and brain tissue after MI may shed new light on the mechanisms involved        in neuroinflammation. This study explored brain and heart protein changes after        MI with a data-independent acquisition (DIA) mode proteomics approach. Permanent        ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) was performed in        the heart of rats, and the immunofluorescence of microglia in the brain cortex        was performed at 1d, 3d, 5d, and 7d after MI to detect the neuroinflammation.        Then proteomics was accomplished to obtain the vital proteins in the heart and        brain post-MI. The results show that the number of microglia was significantly        increased in the Model-1d group, the Model-3d group, the Model-5d group, and the        Model-7d group compared to the Sham group. Various proteins were obtained through        DIA proteomics. Linking to key targets of brain disease, 14 proteins were        obtained in the brain cortex.

The contrast is especially stark when        compared with the major genetic risk factor for Alzheimer disease, APOE ε4, which        has an age of onset several decades earlier, a more aggressive clinical course        and more severe neuropathological findings, especially in terms of the amount of        amyloid deposition. Here, we demonstrate that brain exposure to APOE ε2 via a        gene therapy approach, which bathes the entire cortical mantle in the gene        product after transduction of the ependyma, reduces Aβ plaque deposition,        neurodegenerative synaptic loss, and, remarkably, reduces microglial activation        in an APP/PS1 mouse model despite continued expression of human APOE ε4. This        result suggests a promising protective effect of exogenous APOE ε2 and reveals a        cell nonautonomous effect of the protein on microglial activation, which we show        is similar to plaque-associated microglia in the brain of Alzheimer disease        patients who inherit APOE ε2.

Thus, a model bTNFI, the extracellular domain of type II TNF-α        receptor (TNFR), which can bind to and sequester TNF-α, was fused with a mouse        transferrin receptor antibody (TfRMAb) to enable brain delivery via BBB        TfR-mediated transcytosis. Previously, we found TfRMAb-TNFR to be protective in a        mouse model of amyloidosis (APP/PS1) and tauopathy (PS19), and herein we        investigated its effects in mice that combine both amyloidosis and tauopathy        (3xTg-AD). METHODS: Eight-month-old female 3xTg-AD mice were injected        intraperitoneally with saline (n = 11) or TfRMAb-TNFR (3 mg/kg; n = 11) three        days per week for 12 weeks. Age-matched wild-type (WT) mice (n = 9) were treated        similarly with saline. Brains were processed for immunostaining and        high-resolution multiplex NanoString GeoMx spatial proteomics. RESULTS: We        observed regional differences in proteins relevant to Aβ, tau, and        neuroinflammation in the hippocampus of 3xTg-AD mice compared with WT mice. From        64 target proteins studied using spatial proteomics, a comparison of the        Aβ-plaque bearing vs. plaque-free regions in the 3xTg-AD mice yielded 39        differentially expressed proteins (DEP) largely related to neuroinflammation (39%        of DEP) and Aβ and tau pathology combined (31% of DEP). Hippocampal spatial        proteomics revealed that the majority of the proteins modulated by TfRMAb-TNFR in        the 3xTg-AD mice were relevant to microglial function (⁓ 33%). TfRMAb-TNFR        significantly reduced mature Aβ plaques and increased Aβ-associated microglia        around larger Aβ deposits in the 3xTg-AD mice. Further, TfRMAb-TNFR increased        mature Aβ plaque-associated microglial TREM2 in 3xTg-AD mice. CONCLUSION:        Overall, despite the low visual Aβ load in the 11-month-old female 3xTg-AD mice,        our results highlight region-specific AD-relevant DEP in the hippocampus of these        mice. Chronic TfRMAb-TNFR dosing modulated several DEP involved in AD pathology        and showed a largely microglia-centric mechanism of action in the 3xTg-AD mice.",PMC10946165,Journal of translational medicine,101190741
38497073,Insights into amyloid precursor protein target through PPI network analysis.,10.6026/973206300200140,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia worldwide with        therapeutic lacunae till date. The beta-amyloid (Aβ) accumulation triggers AD        pathogenesis, though clinical trials lowering Aβ have not altered disease        outcomes suggesting other interacting factors to be identified for drug design of        AD. Therefore, it is of interest to identify potential hub proteins interlinked        with disease-driving pathways using a network-based approach for AD therapeutic        designing. Literature mining was done to identify proteins implicated in AD        etiology. Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) were retrieved from the STRING        database and merged into a single network using Cytoscape 3.10.1. The hub        proteins involved in AD etiology were predicted based on the topological        algorithms of CytoHubba. Six major proteins, with STRING database identifiers -        APP, BACE1, PSEN1, MAPT, APOE4 and TREM2, were identified to be involved in AD        pathogenesis. The merged network of PPIs of these proteins contained 51 nodes and        211 edges, as predicted by Analyzer module of Cytoscape. The Amyloid precursor        protein (APP) emerged as the highest-scoring hub protein across multiple        centrality measures and topological algorithms.

38489181,"Low-Dose Radiation Therapy Impacts Microglial Inflammatory Response without        Modulating Amyloid Load in Female TgF344-AD Rats.",10.3233/JAD-231153,"BACKGROUND: Low-dose radiation therapy (LD-RT) has demonstrated in preclinical        and clinical studies interesting properties in the perspective of targeting        Alzheimer's disease (AD), including anti-amyloid and anti-inflammatory effects.        Nevertheless, studies were highly heterogenous with respect to total doses,        fractionation protocols, sex, age at the time of treatment and delay post        treatment. Recently, we demonstrated that LD-RT reduced amyloid peptides and        inflammatory markers in 9-month-old TgF344-AD (TgAD) males. OBJECTIVE: As        multiple studies demonstrated a sex effect in AD, we wanted to validate that        LD-RT benefits are also observed in TgAD females analyzed at the same age.        METHODS: Females were bilaterally treated with 2 Gy×5 daily fractions, 2 Gy×5        weekly fractions, or 10 fractions of 1 Gy delivered twice a week. The effect of        each treatment on amyloid load and inflammation was evaluated using        immunohistology and biochemistry. RESULTS: A daily treatment did not affect        amyloid and reduced only microglial-mediated inflammation markers, the opposite        of the results obtained in our previous male study. Moreover, altered        fractionations (2 Gy×5 weekly fractions or 10 fractions of 1 Gy delivered twice a        week) did not influence the amyloid load or neuroinflammatory response in        females. CONCLUSIONS: A daily treatment consequently appears to be the most        efficient for AD. This study also shows that the anti-amyloid and        anti-inflammatory response to LD-RT are, at least partly, two distinct        mechanisms. It also emphasizes the necessity to assess the sex impact when        evaluating responses in ongoing pilot clinical trials testing LD-RT against AD.",PMC11091582,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863
38488468,Tau induces inflammasome activation and microgliosis through acetylating NLRP3.,10.1002/ctm2.1623,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related Tauopathies are characterised by        the pathologically hyperphosphorylated and aggregated microtubule-associated        protein Tau, which is accompanied by neuroinflammation mediated by activated        microglia. However, the role of Tau pathology in microglia activation or their        causal relationship remains largely elusive. METHODS: The levels of        nucleotide-binding oligomerisation domain (NOD)-like receptor pyrin domain        containing 3 (NLRP3) acetylation and inflammasome activation in multiple cell        models with Tau proteins treatment, transgenic mice with Tauopathy, and AD        patients were measured by Western blotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.        In addition, the acetyltransferase activity of Tau and NLRP3 acetylation sites        were confirmed using the test-tube acetylation assay, co-immunoprecipitation,        immunofluorescence (IF) staining, mass spectrometry and molecular docking. The        Tau-overexpressing mouse model was established by overexpression of human Tau        proteins in mouse hippocampal CA1 neurons through the adeno-associated virus        injection. The cognitive functions of Tau-overexpressing mice were assessed in        various behavioural tests, and microglia activation was analysed by Iba-1 IF        staining and [18F]-DPA-714 positron emission tomography/computed tomography        imaging. A peptide that blocks the interaction between Tau and NLRP3 was        synthesised to determine the in vitro and in vivo effects of Tau-NLRP3        interaction blockade on NLRP3 acetylation, inflammasome activation, microglia        activation and cognitive function. RESULTS: Excessively elevated NLRP3        acetylation and inflammasome activation were observed in 3xTg-AD mice,        microtubule-associated protein Tau P301S (PS19) mice and AD patients. It was        further confirmed that mimics of 'early' phosphorylated-Tau proteins which        increase at the initial stage of diseases with Tauopathy, including TauT181E,        TauS199E, TauT217E and TauS262E, significantly promoted Tau-K18 domain        acetyltransferase activity-dependent NLRP3 acetylation and inflammasome        activation in HEK293T and BV-2 microglial cells. In addition, Tau protein could        directly acetylate NLRP3 at the K21, K22 and K24 sites at its PYD domain and        thereby induce inflammasome activation in vitro. Overexpression of human Tau        proteins in mouse hippocampal CA1 neurons resulted in impaired cognitive        function, Tau transmission to microglia and microgliosis with NLRP3 acetylation        and inflammasome activation. As a targeted intervention, competitive binding of a        designed Tau-NLRP3-binding blocking (TNB) peptide to block the interaction of Tau        protein with NLRP3 inhibited the NLRP3 acetylation and downstream inflammasome        activation in microglia, thereby alleviating microglia activation and cognitive        impairment in mice. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, our findings provide evidence for        a novel role of Tau in the regulation of microglia activation through acetylating        NLRP3, which has potential implications for early intervention and personalised        treatment of AD and related Tauopathies.",PMC10941548,Clinical and translational medicine,101597971

A recent        study suggested LRRC25 is a potential risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD).        As a first step to understanding LRRC25's role in the brain and AD, we found        LRRC25 is expressed in both cell membranes and cytoplasm in a punctuate        appearance in astrocytes, microglia, and neurons in cell lines as well as mouse        brain. We also found that LRRC25 expression is both age- and brain        region-dependent and that 1-day-old (1D) pups expressed the least amount of        LRRC25 protein compared to adult ages. In the APΔE9 mice, immunoblot quantified        LRRC25 protein levels were increased by 166% (**p < 0.01) in the cortex (CX) and        by 215% (***p < 0.001) in the hippocampus (HP) relative to wild-type (WT)        controls. Both the brainstem (BS) and cerebellum (CB) showed no significant        alterations. In the 3xTg mice, only CX showed an increase of LRRC25 protein by        91% (*p < 0.05) when compared to WT controls although the increased trend was        noted in the other brain regions. In the AD patient brains also LRRC25 protein        levels were increased by 153% (***p < 0.001) when compared to normal control (NC)        subjects. Finally, LRRC25 expression in the iPSC-derived neurons quantified by        immunofluorescence was increased by 181% (**p < 0.01) in AD-derived neurons when        compared to NC-derived neurons. Thus increased LRRC25 protein in multiple models        of AD suggests that LRRC25 may play a pathogenic role in either Aβ or tau        pathology in AD. The mechanism for the increased levels of LRRC25 in AD is        unknown at present, but a previous study showed that LRRC25 levels also increase        during neonatal hypoxic-ischemia neuronal damage. Based on the evidence that        autophagy is highly dysregulated in AD, the increased LRRC25 levels may be due to        decreased autophagic degradation of LRRC25. Increased LRRC25 in turn may regulate        the stability or activity of key enzymes involved in either Aβ or        hyperphosphorylated tau generation and thus may contribute to increased plaques        and neurofibrillary tangles.",PMC10929014,Frontiers in molecular neuroscience,101477914

This study used wild-type (WT) and Gadd45a knockout (Gadd45a(-/-)) mice to        evaluate AD progression. Behavioral tests showed that Gadd45a(-/-) mice presented        lower working and spatial memory, pointing out an apparent cognitive impairment        compared with WT animals, accompanied by an increase in Tau hyperphosphorylation        and the levels of kinases involved in its phosphorylation in the hippocampus.        Moreover, Gadd45a(-/-) animals significantly increased the brain's        pro-inflammatory cytokines and modified autophagy markers. Notably, neurotrophins        and the dendritic spine length of the neurons were reduced in Gadd45a(-/-) mice,        which could contribute to the cognitive alterations observed in these animals.        Overall, these findings demonstrate that the lack of the Gadd45a gene activates        several pathways that exacerbate AD pathology, suggesting that promoting this        protein's expression or function might be a promising therapeutic strategy to        slow down AD progression.",PMC10931605,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791

A cellular trajectory analysis of the aging population was performed        using single-cell nuclear transcriptome sequencing data from patients with AD and        different ages. The genome-wide association study (GWAS) cohort of AD patients        was used as the outcome event, and the expression quantitative trait locus was        used as an instrumental variable. Causal associations between genes and AD were        analyzed by bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) and co-localization.        Finally, clinical cohorts were constructed to validate the expression of key        genes. RESULTS: A correlation between cognition and aging was demonstrated using        2,171 older adults over 60 years of age. Gene regulation analysis revealed that        most of the highly active transcription factors were concentrated in the NK cell        subpopulation of AD. NK cell trajectories were constructed for different age        populations. MR and co-localization analyses revealed that CHD6 may be one of the        factors influencing AD. CONCLUSION: We explored different levels of AD and aging        from population cohorts, single-cell data, and GWAS cohorts and found that there        may be some correlations of NK cells between aging and AD.

Here, we identify compartment-specific metabolic and        inflammatory dysregulations that are induced by HFHC diet in the 5xFAD mouse        model of AD pathology. We observe that both male and female 5xFAD mice display        exacerbated adiposity, cholesterolemia, and dysregulated insulin signaling.        Independent of biological sex, HFHC diet also resulted in altered inflammatory        cytokine profiles across the gastrointestinal, circulating, and central nervous        systems (CNS) compartments demonstrating region-specific impacts of metabolic        inflammation.

Neuroinflammation refers to the inflammatory        response in the nervous system, typically resulting from damage to neural tissue.        Immune-related processes have been identified in NTDs, however, the detailed        relationship and underlying mechanisms between neuroinflammation and NTDs remain        largely unclear. In this study, we utilized integrated multi-omics analysis to        explore the role of neuroinflammation in NTDs and identify potential prenatal        diagnostic markers using a murine model. METHODS: Nine public datasets from Gene        Expression Omnibus (GEO) and ArrayExpress were mined using integrated multi-omics        analysis to characterize the molecular landscape associated with        neuroinflammation in NTDs. Special attention was given to the involvement of        macrophages in neuroinflammation within amniotic fluid, as well as the dynamics        of macrophage polarization and their interactions with neural cells at        single-cell resolution. We also used qPCR assay to validate the key TFs and        candidate prenatal diagnostic genes identified through the integrated analysis in        a retinoic acid-induced NTDs mouse model. RESULTS: Our analysis indicated that        neuroinflammation is a critical pathological feature of NTDs, regulated both        transcriptionally and epigenetically within central nervous system tissues. Key        alterations in gene expression and pathways highlighted the crucial role of STATs        molecules in the JAK-STAT signaling pathway in regulating NTDs-associated        neuroinflammation. Furthermore, single-cell resolution analysis revealed        significant polarization of macrophages and their interaction with neural cells        in amniotic fluid, underscoring their central role in mediating neuroinflammation        associated with NTDs. Finally, we identified a set of six potential prenatal        diagnostic genes, including FABP7, CRMP1, SCG3, SLC16A10, RNASE6 and RNASE1,        which were subsequently validated in a murine NTDs model, indicating their        promise as prospective markers for prenatal diagnosis of NTDs.

Existing BBB        integrity imaging methods involve contrast agents or ionising radiation, and pose        limitations in terms of cost and logistics. Arterial spin labelling (ASL)        perfusion MRI has been recently adapted to map the BBB permeability        non-invasively. The DEveloping BBB-ASL as a non-Invasive Early biomarker (DEBBIE)        consortium aims to develop this modified ASL-MRI technique for patient-specific        and robust BBB permeability assessments. This article outlines the study design        of the DEBBIE cohorts focused on investigating the potential of BBB-ASL as an        early biomarker for AD (DEBBIE-AD). METHODS AND ANALYSIS: DEBBIE-AD consists of a        multicohort study enrolling participants with subjective cognitive decline, mild        cognitive impairment and AD, as well as age-matched healthy controls, from 13        cohorts. The precision and accuracy of BBB-ASL will be evaluated in healthy        participants. The clinical value of BBB-ASL will be evaluated by comparing        results with both established and novel AD biomarkers. The DEBBIE-AD study aims        to provide evidence of the ability of BBB-ASL to measure BBB permeability and        demonstrate its utility in AD and AD-related pathologies. ETHICS AND        DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval was obtained for 10 cohorts, and is pending for 3        cohorts. The results of the main trial and each of the secondary endpoints will        be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.",PMC10928768,BMJ open,101552874

In the context of neurodegenerative disorders such as        Alzheimer's disease (AD), inflammation plays a crucial role, often appearing as a        common manifestation despite the variability in the occurrence of other        pathophysiological hallmarks. Thus, combating neuroinflammation holds promise in        treating complex pathophysiological diseases like AD. Growing evidence suggests        the gut microbiome's crucial role in shaping the pathogenesis of AD by        influencing inflammatory mediators. Gut dysbiosis can potentially activate        neuroinflammatory pathways through bidirectional signaling of the gut-brain axis;        however, the precise mechanisms of this complex interweaved network remain        largely unclear. In these milieus, this review attempts to summarize the        contributing role of gut microbiome-mediated neuroinflammatory signals in AD        pathophysiology, while also pondering potential mechanisms through which        commensal and pathogenic gut microbes affect neuroinflammation. While certain        taxa such as Roseburia and Escherichia have been strongly correlated with AD,        other clades such as Bacteroides and Faecalibacterium exhibit variations at the        species and strain levels. In order to disentangle the inflammatory aspects of        neurodegeneration attributed to the gut microbiome, it is imperative that future        mechanistic studies investigate the species/strain-level dependency of        commensals, opportunistic, and pathogenic gut microbes that consistently show        correlations with AD patients across multiple associative studies.",PMC10917618,Microbiome research reports,9918681186206676

There is a lack of data regarding the association of RA        seropositivity and biologic agents with depression risk among individuals with        RA. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the risk of depression following RA diagnosis among        patients in South Korea. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective        cohort study included 38 487 patients with RA and a comparison group of 192 435        individuals matched 1:5 for age, sex, and index date. Data were from the Korean        National Health Insurance Service database. Participants were enrolled from 2010        to 2017 and were followed up until 2019. Participants who had previously been        diagnosed with depression or were diagnosed with depression within 1 year after        the index date were excluded. Statistical analysis was performed in May 2023.        EXPOSURES: Seropositive RA (SPRA) was defined with the International Statistical        Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)        codes M05 and enrollment in the Korean Rare and Intractable Diseases program.        Seronegative RA (SNRA) was defined with ICD-10 codes M06 (excluding M06.1 and        M06.4) and a prescription of any disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs)        for 270 days or more. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Newly diagnosed depression        (ICD-10 codes F32 or F33). RESULTS: The mean (SD) age of the total study        population was 54.6 (12.1) years, and 163 926 individuals (71.0%) were female.        During a median (IQR) follow-up of 4.1 (2.4-6.2) years, 27 063 participants        (20 641 controls and 6422 with RA) developed depression. Participants with RA had        a 1.66-fold higher risk of depression compared with controls (adjusted hazard        ratio [aHR], 1.66 [95% CI, 1.61-1.71]). The SPRA group (aHR, 1.64 [95% CI,        1.58-1.69]) and the SNRA group (aHR, 1.73 [95% CI, 1.65-1.81]) were associated        with an increased risk of depression compared with controls. Patients with RA who        used biologic or targeted synthetic DMARDs (aHR, 1.33 [95% CI, 1.20-1.47]) had a        lower risk of depression compared with patients with RA who did not use these        medications (aHR, 1.69 [95% CI, 1.64-1.74]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This        nationwide cohort study found that both SPRA and SNRA were associated with a        significantly higher risk of depression.

The association between        gut microbiota and inflammation remains unclear in LLD. We analyzed gut        microbiota characteristics and serum inflammatory cytokines in individuals with        LLD to explore the combined role of these two factors in potential biomarkers of        LLD. METHODS: This was an observational cross-sectional study. Fecal samples and        peripheral blood from 29 patients and 33 sex- and age-matched healthy controls        (HCs) were collected to detect gut microbiota and 12 inflammatory factors. We        analyzed differences in diversity and composition of gut microbiota and evaluated        relations among gut microbiota, inflammatory factors, and neuropsychological        scales. We extracted potential biomarkers using receiver-operating characteristic        curve analysis to predict LLD utilizing the combination of the microbiota and        inflammatory cytokines. RESULTS: Elevated systemic inflammatory cytokine levels        and gut microbiota dysbiosis were found in LLD patients. Relative abundance of        Verrucomicrobia at the phylum level and Megamonas, Citrobacter, and Akkermansia        at the genus level among LLD patients was lower than HCs. Abundance of        Coprococcus, Lachnobacterium, Oscillospira, and Sutterella was higher in LLD        patients. Notably, IL6, IFNγ, Verrucomicrobia, and Akkermansia levels were        correlated with depression severity. Our study identified IL6, Akkermansia, and        Sutterella as predictors of LLD, and their combination achieved an area under the        curve of 0.962 in distinguishing LLD patients from HCs. CONCLUSION: This research        offers evidence of changes within gut microbiota and systemic inflammation in        LLD.

Blackberry fruits are rich in phytochemical        compounds capable of modulating pathways involved in neuroprotection.        Additionally, drug repurposing and repositioning could also accelerate the        development of news treatments for AD. In light of the reduced brain glucose        metabolism in AD, an alternative approach has been the use of the drug metformin.        Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of treatment with        blackberry extract in a model of AD induced by streptozotocin (STZ) and compare        it with metformin treatment. Male rats were divided into groups: I - Control;        II - STZ; III - STZ + blackberry extract (100 mg/kg); IV - STZ + blackberry        extract (200 mg/kg) and V - STZ + metformin (150 mg/kg).

The present study is aimed at verifying the hypothesis        that DMF alleviates late effects of STZ (6 months after ICV injection) which        reflects advanced stage of the Alzheimer's disease (AD) in human patients.        Spatial memory was assessed with Morris water maze (MWM), general brain level of        amyloid β (Aβ) and p-tau was measured by western blot, immunofluorescent        labelling of active microglia (IBA1), Aβ and p-tau and histological assay of        neurodegeneration (Fluoro-Jade C) were performed in hippocampus and cortex.        Two-week oral therapy with DMF normalized spatial memory disrupted by STZ but had        no influence on general brain level of Aβ and p-tau. However, immunofluorescence        showed local reduction of Aβ aggregates number in parietal cortex and p-tau(+)        cells in CA2 hippocampal area. Microgliosis was alleviated by DMF in CA1 area and        parietal cortex. DMF-treated STZ injected rats showed higher number of Aβ        containing microglia than untreated group in CA2 and frontal cortex, which may be        the result of increased phagocytic activity in these areas after DMF treatment.        STZ-induced neurodegeneration was alleviated by DMF in dentate gyrus and frontal        cortex. In conclusion DMF treatment exerts beneficial effect on spatial memory in        the rat model of late stage of AD, but weakly influences neuropathological        features, as only local reduction in number of Aβ aggregates, p-tau containing        cells, neurodegeneration, and microgliosis was found.",,Molecular neurobiology,8900963

The binary concept of        microglial M1/M2 polarization paradigms during inflammatory activation has been        debated. In this study, we confirmed microglia had the most significant changes        in early DR using single-cell RNA sequencing. METHODS: A total of five retinal        specimens were collected from donor SD rats. Changes in various cells of the        retina at the early stage of DR were analyzed using single-cell sequencing        technology. RESULTS: We defined three new microglial subtypes at cellular level,        including two M1 types (Egr2(+) M1 and Egr2(-) M1) and one M2 type. We also        revealed the anatomical location between these subtypes, the dynamic changes of        polarization phenotypes, and the possible activation sequence and mutual        activation regulatory mechanism of different cells.

The present study aims to establish a cost-effective and rapid        method to model the two primary pathologies in organotypic brain slices. Coronal        hippocampal brain slices (150 µm) were generated from postnatal (day 8-10) C57BL6        wild-type mice and cultured for 9 weeks. Collagen hydrogels containing either an        empty load or a mixture of human Aβ42 and P301S aggregated tau were applied to        the slices. The media was further supplemented with various intracellular pathway        modulators or heavy metals to augment the appearance of Aβ plaques and tau NFTs,        as assessed by immunohistochemistry. Immunoreactivity for Aβ and tau was        significantly increased in the ventral areas in slices with a mixture of human        Aβ42 and P301S aggregated tau compared to slices with empty hydrogels. Aβ plaque-        and tau NFT-like pathologies could be induced independently in slices. Heavy        metals (aluminum, lead, cadmium) potently augmented Aβ plaque-like pathology,        which developed intracellularly prior to cell death. Intracellular pathway        modulators (scopolamine, wortmannin, MHY1485) significantly boosted tau NFT-like        pathologies. A combination of nanomolar concentrations of scopolamine,        wortmannin, MHY1485, lead, and cadmium in the media strongly increased Aβ plaque-        and tau NFT-like immunoreactivity in ventral areas compared to the slices with        non-supplemented media. The results highlight that we could harness the potential        of the collagen hydrogel-based spreading of human Aβ42 and P301S aggregated tau,        along with pharmacological manipulation, to produce pathologies relevant to AD.        The results offer a novel ex vivo organotypic slice model to investigate AD        pathologies with potential applications for screening drugs or therapies in the        future.",PMC10887098,Biomolecules,101596414

To        address this issue, the Lancet Commission recommends focusing on reducing        modifiable lifestyle risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, and physical        inactivity. Passive pulsatile shear stress (PPSS) interventions, which use        devices like whole-body periodic acceleration, periodic acceleration along the        Z-axis (pGz), and the Jogging Device, have shown significant systemic and        cellular effects in preclinical and clinical models which address these        modifiable risks factors.

Therefore, the target of this study was to        explore the protective action of glabridin on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced        neuroinflammation in vivo and in vitro and its mechanism. METHODS: The        neuroinflammation model was established by LPS-induced BV2 cells. The cell        viability with various concentrations of glabridin was determined by MTT assay,        and the content of NO in each group was detected. A neuroinflammatory model was        established in male C57BL/6J mice for a water maze test. Subsequently, NF-κB and        SOD indices were measured by ELISA, GFAP and IBA-1 indices were measured by        immunofluorescence, and Nissl staining was used to explore the Nissl bodies in        the hippocampus of mice. RESULTS: In vitro experiments, our results expressed        that glabridin could markedly increase the cell activity of LPS-induced BV2 cells        and reduce the NO expression in cells. It indicated that glabridin had a        remarkable impact on the neuroinflammation of LPS-induced BV2 cell protection. In        vivo neuroinflammation experiments, mice treated with different doses of        glabridin showed significantly improved ability of memory compared with the LPS        group in the Morris water maze test. The levels of NF-κB, GFAP, and the number of        positive cells in Nissl staining were decreased. High-dose glabridin        significantly increased the SOD content in the brain tissue and decreased the        IBA-1 levels. CONCLUSION: Glabridin can significantly reduce or even reverse        LPS-induced neuroinflammation, which may be related to the fact that glabridin        can reduce the NO expression, NF-κB, IBA-1, GFAP, and other inflammatory        mediators, upregulate the expression of SOD to relieve oxidative stress of brain        and inhibit the activation of gliocyte in brain tissue.",,Inflammopharmacology,9112626

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to develop and validate a        new cell model overexpressing sTGFBR3 for studying AD in vitro. METHODS: BV2        cells (a microglial cell derived from C57/BL6 murine) were used as a cell model.        Cells were then treated with different concentrations of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)        (0, 1, or 0.3 μg/mL) for 12, 24, or 48h and then with or without sodium        pervanadate (100 μM) for 30 min. Next, the effect surface optimization method was        used to determine optimal experimental conditions. Finally, the optimized model        was used to assess the effect of ZQX series compounds and vasicine on cell        viability and protein expression. Expression of TGFBR3 and TNF-α was assessed        using Western blot. MTT assay was used to assess cell viability, and enzyme-        linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was employed to evaluate extracellular TGF-β1        and sTGFBR3. RESULTS: LPS (0.3 μg/mL) treatment for 11 h at a cell density of 60%        and pervanadate concentration (100 μM) incubation for 30 min were the optimal        experimental conditions for increasing membrane protein TGFBR3 overexpression, as        well as extracellular sTGFBR3 and TGF-β1. Applying ZQX-5 and vasicine reversed        this process by reducing extracellular TGF-β1, promoting the phosphorylation of        Smad2/3, a protein downstream of TGF-β1, and inhibiting the release of the        inflammatory factor TNF-α.

Large-scale epidemiological studies associate        traffic-related particulate matter (PM) with impaired cognitive functions and        increased incidence of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease.        Inhaled components of PM may directly invade the brain via the olfactory route,        or act through peripheral system responses resulting in inflammation and        oxidative stress in the brain. Microglia are the immune cells of the brain        implicated in the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. However, it remains        unknown how PM affects live human microglia. RESULTS: Here we show that two        different PMs derived from exhausts of cars running on EN590 diesel or compressed        natural gas (CNG) alter the function of human microglia-like cells in vitro. We        exposed human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived microglia-like cells        (iMGLs) to traffic related PMs and explored their functional responses. Lower        concentrations of PMs ranging between 10 and 100 µg ml(-1) increased microglial        survival whereas higher concentrations became toxic over time. Both tested        pollutants impaired microglial phagocytosis and increased secretion of a few        proinflammatory cytokines with distinct patterns, compared to lipopolysaccharide        induced responses. iMGLs showed pollutant dependent responses to production of        reactive oxygen species (ROS) with CNG inducing and EN590 reducing ROS        production.

RESULTS: Higher baseline levels        of CSF microglial biomarkers were related to faster rates of CSF sTREM2 increase        and CSF PGRN decrease. Elevated CSF p-Tau(181) was associated with higher levels        of CSF microglial biomarkers and faster rates of CSF sTREM2 increase and CSF PGRN        decrease. In both cohorts, higher Aβ burden was associated with attenuated CSF        p-Tau(181) effects on CSF microglial biomarker increases.

Interestingly, those diseases may show onset of prodromal symptoms        early after middle age. Commonly, the evaluation of these neurodegenerative        diseases is based on the detection of biomarkers, where functional and structural        magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have shown a central role in revealing early or        prodromal phases, although it can be expensive, time-consuming, and not always        available. The aforementioned diseases have a common impact on the visual system        due to the pathophysiological mechanisms shared between the eye and the brain. In        Parkinson's disease, α-synuclein deposition in the retinal cells, as well as in        dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra, alters the visual cortex and        retinal function, resulting in modifications to the visual field. Similarly, the        visual cortex is modified by the neurofibrillary tangles and neuritic amyloid β        plaques typically seen in the Alzheimer's disease brain, and this may reflect the        accumulation of these biomarkers in the retina during the early stages of the        disease, as seen in postmortem retinas of AD patients.

This study aimed to investigate potential associations        between specific bacteria and AD pathology by examining brain tissues from        AD-associated neurodegenerative regions (frontal cortex and hippocampus) and the        non-AD-associated hypothalamus. Employing 16S rRNA gene sequencing, 30 postmortem        brain tissue samples from four individuals with normal brain histology (N) and        four AD patients were analyzed, along with three blank controls. A remarkably low        biomass characterized the brain bacteriota, with their overall structures        delineated primarily by brain regions rather than the presence of AD. While most        analyzed parameters exhibited no significant distinction in the brain bacteriota        between the N and AD groups, the unique detection of Cloacibacterium normanense        in the AD-associated neurodegenerative regions stood out.

The hallmark physiological        function of IL-38 is competitive binding to IL-36R, as does the IL-36R        antagonist. Emerging research has shown that IL-38 is abnormally expressed in the        serum and brain tissue of patients with ischemic stroke (IS) and autism spectrum        disorder (ASD), suggesting that IL-38 may play an important role in neurological        diseases. Important advances include that IL-38 alleviates neuromyelitis optica        disorder (NMOD) by inhibiting Th17 expression, improves IS by protecting against        atherosclerosis via regulating immune cells and inflammation, and reduces IL-1β        and CXCL8 release through inhibiting human microglial activity post-ASD. In        contrast, IL-38 mRNA is markedly increased and is mainly expressed in phagocytes        in spinal cord injury (SCI). IL-38 ablation attenuated SCI by reducing immune        cell infiltration. However, the effect and underlying mechanism of IL-38 in CNS        diseases remain inadequately characterized.

The currently used biomarkers help in the clinical        diagnosis, but are insufficient and do not cover all the clinical needs. METHODS:        By the means of a new immunoassay, we have measured and analyzed the proNGF        levels in 43 cerebrospinal fluids (CSF) from FTD patients, and compared the        results to those obtained in CSF from 84 Alzheimer's disease (AD), 15 subjective        memory complaints (SMC) and 13 control subjects.

However, the interactions between them have not been        fully understood. This study aimed to investigate the key factor for the        underlying interactions and shared signaling pathways in the vasculature of DR        and AD. Methods: We retrieved single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data        regarding human fibrovascular membrane (FVM) of proliferative diabetic        retinopathy (PDR) and human hippocampus vessels of AD from the NCBI-GEO database.        GSEA analysis was performed to analyze AD-related genes in endothelial cells and        pericytes of PDR.

However, the data characteristics of scATAC-seq such as excessive zeros        and large variability of chromatin accessibility across cells impose a unique        challenge for DA analysis. Existing statistical methods focus on detecting the        mean difference of the chromatin accessible regions while overlooking the        distribution difference. Motivated by real data exploration that distribution        difference exists among cell types, we introduce a novel composite statistical        test named ""scaDA"", which is based on zero-inflated negative binomial model        (ZINB), for performing differential distribution analysis of chromatin        accessibility by jointly testing the abundance, prevalence and dispersion        simultaneously.

Managing neuroinflammation to restore immune homeostasis and        decrease neuronal damage is a therapeutic approach for AD. One way to achieve        this is through exercise, which can improve brain function and protect against        neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and synaptic dysfunction in AD models.

Nonhuman primates        (NHPs) share genetic, anatomical, and physiological similarities with humans,        making them ideal model animals for investigating the pathogenesis of AD and        potential therapies. However, the use of NHPs in AD research has been hindered by        the paucity of AD monkey models due to their long generation time, ethical        considerations, and technical challenges in genetically modifying monkeys.        METHODS: Here, we developed an AD-like NHP model by overexpressing human tau in        the bilateral hippocampi of adult rhesus macaque monkeys. We evaluated the        pathological features of these monkeys with immunostaining, Nissl staining,        cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron        emission tomography (PET), and behavioural tests. RESULTS: We demonstrated that        after hippocampal overexpression of tau protein, these monkeys displayed multiple        pathological features of AD, including 3-repeat (3R)/4-repeat (4R) tau        accumulation, tau hyperphosphorylation, tau propagation, neuronal loss,        hippocampal atrophy, neuroinflammation, Aβ clearance deficits, blood vessel        damage, and cognitive decline. More interestingly, the accumulation of both 3R        and 4R tau is specific to NHPs but not found in adult rodents. CONCLUSIONS: This        work establishes a tau-induced AD-like NHP model with many key pathological and        behavioural features of AD. In addition, our model may potentially become one of        the AD NHP models adopted by researchers worldwide since it can be generated        within 2 ~ 3 months through a single injection of AAVs into the monkey brains.        Hence, our model NHPs may facilitate mechanistic studies and therapeutic        treatments for AD.",PMC10821564,Alzheimer's research & therapy,101511643

However, there has been no        systematic assessment of similarity of these cells to primary human microglia        along with their responsiveness to external cues expected of primary cells in the        brain. In this study, we performed transcriptional characterization of        commercially available human inducible pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived        microglia-like (iMGL) cells by bulk and single cell RNA sequencing to assess        their similarity with primary human microglia. To evaluate their stimulation        responsiveness, iMGL cells were treated with Liver X Receptor (LXR) pathway        agonists and their transcriptional responses characterized by bulk and single        cell RNA sequencing. Bulk transcriptome analyses demonstrate that iMGL cells have        a similar overall expression profile to freshly isolated human primary microglia        and express many key microglial transcription factors and functional and        disease-associated genes. Notably, at the single-cell level, iMGL cells exhibit        distinct transcriptional subpopulations, representing both homeostatic and        activated states present in normal and diseased primary microglia. Treatment of        iMGL cells with LXR pathway agonists induces robust transcriptional changes in        lipid metabolism and cell cycle at the bulk level. At the single cell level, we        observe heterogeneity in responses between cell subpopulations in homeostatic and        activated states and deconvolute bulk expression changes into their corresponding        single cell states.

Somatic mutations accumulate with age        and lead to clonal expansion of many cell types, contributing to cancer and many        non-cancer diseases(6,7). Here we studied somatic mutation in normal aged and AD        brains by three orthogonal methods and in three independent AD cohorts. Analysis        of bulk RNA sequencing data from 866 samples from different brain regions        revealed significantly higher (~two-fold) overall burdens of somatic        single-nucleotide variants (sSNVs) in AD brains compared to age-matched controls.        Molecular-barcoded deep (>1000X) gene panel sequencing of 311 prefrontal cortex        samples showed enrichment of sSNVs and somatic insertions and deletions (sIndels)        in cancer driver genes in AD brain compared to control, with recurrent, and often        multiple, mutations in genes implicated in clonal hematopoiesis (CH)(8,9).        Pathogenic sSNVs were enriched in CSF1R+ microglia of AD brains, and the high        proportion of microglia (up to 40%) carrying some sSNVs in cancer driver genes        suggests mutation-driven microglial clonal expansion (MiCE).

Moderate        glial cell activity can be neuroprotective; however, excessive glial cell        activation advances the pathology of Alzheimer's disease and is accompanied by        structural changes in the brain interface, with peripheral immune cells entering        the brain through the blood-brain barrier, creating a vicious circle. The        immunomodulatory properties of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are primarily        conveyed through extracellular vesicles (EVs). MSC-EVs participate in chronic        inflammatory and immune processes by transferring nucleic acids, proteins and        lipids from the parent cell to the recipient cell, thus MSC-EVs retain their        immunomodulatory capacity while avoiding the safety issues associated with living        cell therapy, making them a promising focus for immunomodulatory therapy.

This emerging trend is poised to        pose a substantial challenge to the fields of medicine and public health in the        years ahead. In this context, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is regarded as an ND that        causes recent memory loss, motor impairment and cognitive deficits. AD is the        most common cause of dementia in the elderly and its development is linked to        multifactorial interactions between the environment, genetics, aging and        lifestyle. The pathological hallmarks in AD are the accumulation of β-amyloid        peptide (Aβ), the hyperphosphorylation of tau protein, neurotoxic events and        impaired glucose metabolism. Due to pharmacological limitations and in view of        the prevailing glycemic hypometabolism, the ketogenic diet (KD) emerges as a        promising non-pharmacological possibility for managing AD, an approach that has        already demonstrated efficacy in addressing other disorders, notably epilepsy.        The KD consists of a food regimen in which carbohydrate intake is discouraged at        the expense of increased lipid consumption, inducing metabolic ketosis whereby        the main source of energy becomes ketone bodies instead of glucose. Thus, under        these dietary conditions, neuronal death via lack of energy would be decreased,        inasmuch as the metabolism of lipids is not impaired in AD. In this way, the        clinical picture of patients with AD would potentially improve via the slowing        down of symptoms and delaying of the progression of the disease. Hence, this        review aims to explore the rationale behind utilizing the KD in AD treatment        while emphasizing the metabolic interplay between the KD and the improvement of        AD indicators, drawing insights from both preclinical and clinical        investigations. Via a comprehensive examination of the studies detailed in this        review, it is evident that the KD emerges as a promising alternative for managing        AD.

Non-drug therapy is attracting more attention and may provide a        better resolution for the treatment of AD. Given the fact that hypoxia        contributes to the pathogenesis of AD, hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) may be an        effective intervention that can alleviate hypoxia and improve AD. However, it        remains unclear whether long-term HBOT intervention in the early stage of AD can        slow AD progression and ultimately prevent cognitive impairment in this disease.        In this study we applied consecutive 3-month HBOT interventions on 3-month-old        APP(swe)/PS1(dE9) AD mice which represent the early stage of AD. When the        APP(swe)/PS1(dE9) mice at 9-month-old which represent the disease stage we        measured cognitive function, 24-h blood oxygen saturation, Aβ and tau        pathologies, vascular structure and function, and neuroinflammation in        APP(swe)/PS1(dE9) mice.

MicroRNA-218-5p (miR-218-5p) is a microRNA that        plays a role in neurodevelopment and function, while its potential function in PD        and neuroinflammation remains unclear. METHODS: We explore the involvement of        miR-218-5p in the PD in a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine        (MPTP)-induced mouse model. The miR-218-5p agomir used for overexpression was        delivered into the substantia nigra (SN) by bilateral stereotaxic infusions. The        loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons and microglial inflammation in the SN was        determined using Western blotting and immunofluorescence. Motor function was        assessed using the rotarod test. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed to        explore the pathways regulated by miR-218-5p. The target genes of miR-218-5p were        predicted using TargetScan and confirmed using dual luciferase reporter assays.        The effects of miR-218-5p on microglial inflammation and related pathways were        verified in murine microglia-like BV2 cells. To stimulate BV2 cells, SH-SY5Y        cells were treated with 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP(+)) and the conditioned        media (CM) were collected. RESULTS: MiR-218-5p expression was reduced in both the        SN of MPTP-induced mice and MPP(+)-treated BV2 cells. MiR-218-5p overexpression        significantly alleviated MPTP-induced microglial inflammation, loss of DA        neurons, and motor dysfunction. RNA sequence and gene set enrichment analysis        showed that type I interferon (IFN-I) pathways were upregulated in MPTP-induced        mice, while this upregulation was reversed by miR-218-5p overexpression. A        luciferase reporter assay verified that Ddx41 was a target gene of miR-218-5p.

Curcumin is involved in several I/R injuries. However, its underlying        mechanism in SCII remains elusive. Here, curcumin attenuated oxygen and glucose        deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R)-induced oxidative injury in PC12 neuronal cells        by increasing cell viability, inhibiting cell apoptosis, lactate dehydrogenase,        malondialdehyde levels, but elevating anti-oxidative superoxide dismutase and        glutathione peroxidase levels. Furthermore, curcumin restrained OGD/R-evoked        microglia M1 activation by decreasing microglia M1 polarization marker IBA-1 and        iNOS transcripts. Moreover, the increased inflammatory cytokine levels of TNF-α        and IL-6 in microglia under OGD/R conditions were suppressed after curcumin        treatment. Importantly, neuronal cells incubated with a conditioned medium from        OGD/R-treated microglia exhibited lower cell viability and higher apoptotic        ratio, which were overturned when microglia were treated with curcumin.        Intriguingly, curcumin could inhibit the activation of the NF-κB pathway by Nrf2        enhancement in OGD/R-treated PC12 cells and microglia.

Neuroinflammation can involve the activation        of mast cells, contributing to oxidative stress, in addition to other sources of        reactive oxygen species. Antioxidants can powerfully neutralize reactive oxygen        species and free radicals, decreasing oxidative damage. Antioxidant genes, like        the manganese superoxide dismutase enzyme, can undergo epigenetic changes that        reduce their expression, thus increasing oxidative stress in tissue.        Alternatively, DNA can be altered by free radical damage. The epigenetic        landscape of these genes can change antioxidant function and may result in        neurodegenerative disease. This imbalance of free radical production and        antioxidant function increases the reactive oxygen species that cause cell damage        in neurons and is often observed as an age-related event. Increased antioxidant        expression in mice is protective against reactive oxygen species in neurons as is        the exogenous supplementation of antioxidants. Manganese superoxide dismutase        requires manganese for its enzymic function. Antioxidant therapy is considered        for age-related neurodegenerative diseases, and a new mimetic of a manganese        superoxide dismutase, avasopasem manganese, is described and suggested as a        putative treatment to reduce the oxidative stress that causes neurodegenerative        disease. The aim of this narrative review is to explore the evidence that        oxidative stress causes neurodegenerative damage and the role of antioxidant        genes in inhibiting reactive oxygen species damage.

APOE4 mouse models have provided advances in        the understanding of disease pathogenesis, but unaccounted variables like rodent        housing status may hinder translational outcomes. Non-sterile aspects like food        and bedding can be major sources of changes in rodent microflora. Alterations in        intestinal microbial ecology can cause mucosal barrier impairment and increase        pro-inflammatory signals. The present study examined the role of sterile and        non-sterile food and housing on redox indicators and the immune status of        humanized-APOE4 knock-in mice (hAPOe4). hAPOE4 mice were housed under sterile        conditions until 22 months of age, followed by the transfer of a cohort of mice        to non-sterile housing for 2 months.

This study aimed to investigate the neuroprotective        properties of Osthole against cognitive impairment in rats induced by D-galactose        and elucidate its pharmacological mechanism. The rat model was established by        subcutaneously injecting D-galactose at a dose of 150 mg/kg/day for 56 days. The        effect of Osthole on cognitive impairment was evaluated by behavior and        biochemical analysis. Subsequently, a combination of in silico prediction and        experimental validation was performed to verify the network-based predictions,        using western blot, Nissl staining, and immunofluorescence. The results        demonstrate that Osthole could improve memory dysfunction induced by D-galactose        in Sprague Dawley male rats. A network proximity-based approach and integrated        pathways analysis highlight two key AD-related pathological processes that may be        regulated by Osthole, including neuronal apoptosis, i.e., neuroinflammation.        Among them, the pro-apoptotic markers (Bax), anti-apoptotic protein (Bcl-2), the        microgliosis (Iba-1), Astro-cytosis (GFAP), and inflammatory cytokines (TNF-R1)        were evaluated in both hippocampus and cortex.

The intracisternal administration of iPSC-MSC-sEVs alleviated        NLRP3/GSDMD-mediated neuroinflammation, decreased amyloid deposition and neuronal        apoptosis, and mitigated cognitive dysfunction. Furthermore, it explored the role        of miR-223-3p in the iPSC-MSC-sEVs-mediated anti-inflammatory effects in vitro.        miR-223-3p directly targeted NLRP3, whereas inhibiting miR-223-3p almost        completely reversed the suppression of NLRP3 by MSC-sEVs, suggesting that        miR-223-3p may, at least partially, account for MSC-sEVs-mediated        anti-inflammation. Results obtained suggest that intracisternal administration of        iPSC-MSC-sEVs can reduce cognitive impairment by inhibiting NLRP3/GSDMD        neuroinflammation in a sAD mouse model.

Firstly, SD rats were        injected with Hcy (400 μg/kg) through vena caudalis, and betaine (2.5 % w/v) was        supplemented via drinking water for 14 days. Betaine supplementation could        attenuate Hcy-induced cognitive impairment in the Y maze and novel object        recognition tests by repairing brain injury.

Multivariable general linear models compared        concentrations of biomarkers in relation to a history of TBI and smoothing        splines modelled biomarkers non-linearly in the cognitively impaired groups as a        function of time since symptom onset. RESULTS: Each biomarker was higher across        stages of cognitive impairment, characterized by clinical diagnosis and        Mini-Mental State Examination performance, but these associations were not        influenced by a history of TBI. However, modelling biomarkers in relation to        duration of cognitive symptoms for ADRD showed differences by history of TBI,        with only GFAP and UCHL1 being elevated. CONCLUSIONS: Serum GFAP, NFL, T-tau, and        UCHL1 were higher across stages of cognitive impairment in this diverse clinical        cohort, regardless of TBI history, though longitudinal investigation of the        timing, order, and trajectory of the biomarkers in relation to prior TBI is        warranted.",PMC10947497,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863

We        aim to emphasize microglial signatures in physiologic brain aging and Alzheimer's        disease (AD). A systematic literature search of all published articles about        microglial senescence in human healthy aging and AD was performed, searching for        PubMed and Scopus online databases. Among 1947 articles screened, a total of 289        articles were assessed for full-text eligibility. Microglial transcriptomic,        phenotypic, and neuropathological profiles were analyzed comprising healthy aging        and AD. Our review highlights that studies on animal models only partially        clarify what happens in humans. Human and mice microglia are hugely        heterogeneous. Like a two-sided coin, microglia can be protective or harmful,        depending on the context. Brain health depends upon a balance between the actions        and reactions of microglia maintaining brain homeostasis in cooperation with        other cell types (especially astrocytes and oligodendrocytes). During aging,        accumulating oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction weaken microglia        leading to dystrophic/senescent, otherwise over-reactive, phenotype-enhancing        neurodegenerative phenomena.

Our examination of cortical microglia in        human post-mortem cSVD cortical tissue revealed distinct morphological microglial        features specific to cSVD. We identified enlarged somata, an increase in the        territory occupied by thickened microglial processes, and an expansion in the        number of vascular-associated microglia. In parallel, we characterized microglia        in a rodent model of hypertensive cSVD along different durations of arterial        hypertension, i.e., early chronic and late chronic hypertension. Microglial        somata were already enlarged in early hypertension. In contrast, at late-stage        chronic hypertension, they further exhibited elongated branches, thickened        processes, and a reduced ramification index, mirroring the findings in human        cSVD. An unbiased multidimensional flow cytometric analysis revealed phenotypic        heterogeneity among microglia cells within the hippocampus and cortex. At        early-stage hypertension, hippocampal microglia exhibited upregulated CD11b/c,        P2Y12R, CD200R, and CD86 surface expression. Detailed analysis of cell        subpopulations revealed a unique microglial subset expressing CD11b/c, CD163, and        CD86 exclusively in early hypertension. Notably, even at early-stage        hypertension, microglia displayed a higher association with cerebral blood        vessels. We identified several profound clusters of microglia expressing distinct        marker profiles at late chronic hypertensive states. In summary, our findings        demonstrate a higher vulnerability of the hippocampus, stage-specific microglial        signatures based on morphological features, and cell surface protein expression        in response to chronic arterial hypertension.

We investigate cell-type-specific        spatial transcriptomic changes induced by the Trem2(R47H) mutation to determine        the impacts of this mutation on transcriptional dysregulation. METHODS: We        profiled 15 mouse brain sections consisting of wild-type, Trem2(R47H), 5xFAD and        Trem2(R47H); 5xFAD genotypes using MERFISH spatial transcriptomics. Single-cell        spatial transcriptomics and neuropathology data were analyzed using our custom        pipeline to identify plaque and Trem2(R47H) induced transcriptomic dysregulation.        RESULTS: The Trem2(R47H) mutation induced consistent upregulation of Bdnf and        Ntrk2 across many cortical excitatory neuron types, independent of amyloid        pathology.

Their relative degree of induced neuroinflammation,        however, is not well established. Mouse models of AD that expressed either human        Aβ42 (n = 7) or human hyperphosphorylated tau protein alone (n = 3), wild type        (n = 10), and human AD samples (n = 29 with 18 controls) were studied. The        benefit of using mouse models that possess only human tau or amyloid-b is that it        allows for the individual evaluation of how each protein affects        neuroinflammation, something not possible in human tissue. Three indicators of        neuroinflammation were examined: TLRs/RIG1 expression, the density of astrocytes        and microglial cells, and well-established mediators of neuroinflammation (IL6,        TNFα, IL1β, and CXCL10). There was a statistically significant increase in        neuroinflammation with all three variables in the mouse models with human tau        only as compared to human Aβ42 only or wild-type mice (each at p < 0.0001). Only        the Aβ42 5xFAD mice (n = 4) showed statistically higher neuroinflammation versus        wild type (p = 0.0030). The human AD tissues were segregated into Aβ42 only or        hyperphosphorylated tau protein with Aβ42. The latter areas showed increased        neuroinflammation with each of the three variables compared to the areas with        only Aβ42. Of the TLRs and RIG-1, TLR8 was significantly elevated in both the        mouse model and human AD and only in areas with the abnormal tau protein. It is        concluded that although Aβ42 and hyperphosphorylated tau protein can each induce        inflammation, the latter protein is associated with a much stronger        neuroinflammatory response vis-a-vis a significantly greater activated microglial        response.",,Molecular neurobiology,8900963

In preceding studies, we showed that        antibiotic-induced perturbations of the gut microbiome of APPPS1-21 mice resulted        in significant attenuation in Aβ amyloidosis and altered microglial phenotypes        that are specific to male mice. The molecular events underlying microglial        phenotypic transitions remain unclear. Here, by generating 'APPPS1-21-CD11br'        reporter mice, we investigated the translational state of microglial/macrophage        ribosomes during their phenotypic transition and in a sex-specific manner.        METHODS: Six groups of mice that included WT-CD11br, antibiotic (ABX) or        vehicle-treated APPPS1-21-CD11br males and females were sacrificed at 7-weeks of        age (n = 15/group) and used for immunoprecipitation of microglial/macrophage        polysomes from cortical homogenates using anti-FLAG antibody. Liquid        chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry and label-free quantification        was used to identify newly synthesized peptides isolated from polysomes. RESULTS:        We show that ABX-treatment leads to decreased Aβ levels in male APPPS1-21-CD11br        mice with no significant changes in females. We identified microglial/macrophage        polypeptides involved in mitochondrial dysfunction and altered calcium signaling        that are associated with Aβ-induced oxidative stress. Notably, female mice also        showed downregulation of newly-synthesized ribosomal proteins. Furthermore, male        mice showed an increase in newly-synthesized polypeptides involved in        FcγR-mediated phagocytosis, while females showed an increase in newly-synthesized        polypeptides responsible for actin organization associated with microglial        activation. Next, we show that ABX-treatment resulted in substantial remodeling        of the epigenetic landscape, leading to a metabolic shift that accommodates the        increased bioenergetic and biosynthetic demands associated with microglial        polarization in a sex-specific manner. While microglia in ABX-treated male mice        exhibited a metabolic shift towards a neuroprotective phenotype that promotes Aβ        clearance, microglia in ABX-treated female mice exhibited loss of energy        homeostasis due to persistent mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired lysosomal        clearance that was associated with inflammatory phenotypes. CONCLUSIONS: Our        studies provide the first snapshot of the translational state of        microglial/macrophage cells in a mouse model of Aβ amyloidosis that was subject        to ABX treatment. ABX-mediated changes resulted in metabolic reprogramming of        microglial phenotypes to modulate immune responses and amyloid clearance in a        sex-specific manner. This microglial plasticity to support neuro-energetic        homeostasis for its function based on sex paves the path for therapeutic        modulation of immunometabolism for neurodegeneration.",PMC10725591,Molecular neurodegeneration,101266600

At present, the Alzheimer's        disease main risk remains genetic risks, but major environmental factors are        increasingly shown to impact Alzheimer's disease development and progression.        Microglia, the most important brain immune cells, play a central role in        Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis and are considered environmental and lifestyle        ""sensors."" Factors like environmental pollution and modern lifestyles (e.g.,        chronic stress, poor dietary habits, sleep, and circadian rhythm disorders) can        cause neuroinflammatory responses that lead to cognitive impairment via        microglial functioning and phenotypic regulation.

Glucagon-like peptide 1 exerts its effects by activating a membrane        receptor identified in many tissues, including different brain regions.        Glucagon-like peptide 1 activates several signaling pathways related to        neuroprotection, like the support of cell growth/survival, enhancement promotion        of synapse formation, autophagy, and inhibition of the secretion of        proinflammatory cytokines, microglial activation, and apoptosis during neural        morphogenesis. The glial cells, including astrocytes and microglia, maintain        metabolic homeostasis and defense against pathogens in the central nervous        system. After brain insult, microglia are the first cells to respond, followed by        reactive astrocytosis. These activated cells produce proinflammatory mediators        like cytokines or chemokines to react to the insult. Furthermore, under these        circumstances, microglia can become chronically inflammatory by losing their        homeostatic molecular signature and, consequently, their functions during many        diseases. Several processes promote the development of neurological disorders and        influence their pathological evolution: like the formation of protein aggregates,        the accumulation of abnormally modified cellular constituents, the formation and        release by injured neurons or synapses of molecules that can dampen neural        function, and, of critical importance, the dysregulation of inflammatory control        mechanisms.

CSF sTREM2, YKL-40,        clusterin, fractalkine (p < 0.001) and MCP-1 (p < 0.05) were all higher in T or        N+, with or without amyloidosis at baseline, but remained stable over time. High        CSF sTREM2 was associated with preserved cognitive function within the A+/T+ or        N+ group, relative to the cognitively impaired with the same A/T/N biomarker        profile (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Immune hypoactivation and reduced        neuron-microglia communication are observed in isolated amyloidosis while        activation and increased fractalkine accompanies tau pathology in predementia AD.        Glial hypo- and hyperactivation through the predementia AD continuum suggests        altered glial interaction with Ab and tau pathology, and may necessitate        differential treatments, depending on the stage and patient-specific activation        patterns.",PMC10720118,Journal of neuroinflammation,101222974

Lead (Pb) is a        heavy metal contaminant, which is closely related to the incidence of AD.        However, the research on the role of microglia in Pb-induced AD-like pathology is        limited. To determine the mechanism by which Pb exposure aggravates AD        progression and the role of microglial activation, we exposed APP/PS1 mice and        Aβ(1-42)-treated BV-2 cells to Pb. Our results suggested that chronic Pb exposure        exacerbated learning and memory impairments in APP/PS1 mice. Pb exposure        increased the activation of microglia in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice, which        was associated with increased deposition of Aβ(1-42), and induced hippocampal        neuron damage. Pb exposure upregulated copper transporter 1 (CTR1) and        downregulated copper P-type ATPase transporter (ATP7A) in the hippocampus of        APP/PS1 mice and Aβ(1-42)-treated BV-2 cells. Moreover, Pb enhanced mitochondrial        translocation of the mitochondrial copper transporter COX17, leading to an        increase in mitochondrial copper concentration and mitochondrial damage. This        could be reversed by copper-chelating agents or by inhibiting the mitochondrial        translocation of COX17. The increased mitochondrial copper concentration caused        by increased mitochondrial translocation of COX17 after Pb exposure may be        related to the enhanced mitochondrial import pathway of AIF/CHCHD4. These results        indicate that Pb induces the activation of microglia by increasing the        concentration of copper in the mitochondria of microglia, and microglia release        inflammatory factors to promote neuroinflammation, thus aggravating the pathology        of AD.

The lack of tumorigenic        and immunogenic properties and ability to permeate the entire brain to        incorporate into microglia following intranasal (IN) administrations makes them        an attractive biologic for curtailing chronic neuroinflammation in        neurodegenerative disorders. We tested the hypothesis that IN administrations of        hiPSC-NSC-EVs can alleviate chronic neuroinflammation and cognitive impairments        induced by the peripheral lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge. Adult male,        C57BL/6J mice received intraperitoneal injections of LPS (0.75 mg/kg) for seven        consecutive days.

A month later, mice in all        groups were investigated for cognitive function with behavioral tests and        euthanized for histological and biochemical studies. Mice receiving VEH after LPS        displayed deficits in associative recognition memory, temporal pattern        processing, and pattern separation. Such impairments were associated with an        increased incidence of activated microglia presenting NOD-, LRR-, and pyrin        domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasomes, elevated levels of NLRP3 inflammasome        mediators and end products, and decreased neurogenesis in the hippocampus. In        contrast, the various cognitive measures in mice receiving hiPSC-NSC-EVs after        LPS were closer to naive mice. Significantly, these mice displayed diminished        microglial activation, NLRP3 inflammasomes, proinflammatory cytokines, and a        level of neurogenesis matching age-matched naïve controls. Thus, IN        administrations of hiPSC-NSC-EVs are an efficacious approach to reducing chronic        neuroinflammation-induced cognitive impairments.",PMC10717852,Journal of neuroinflammation,101222974

Well-established biomarkers for AD come from the        histopathological hallmarks of the disease, which are Aβ and phosphorylated Tau        protein aggregates. Consistently, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Amyloid β (Aβ) and        phosphorylated Tau level measurements are currently used to detect AD presence.        However, two central biases affect these biomarkers. Firstly, incomplete        knowledge of the pathogenesis of diseases legitimates the search for novel        molecules that, reasonably, could be expressed by neurons and microglia and could        be detected in blood simpler and earlier than the classical markers and in a        higher amount. Further, studies have been performed to evaluate whether CSF        biomarkers can predict AD onset in Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) patients.        However, the MCI definition has changed over time. Hence, the studies on MCI        patients seem to be biased at the beginning due to the imprecise enrollment and        heterogeneous composition of the miscellaneous MCI subgroup. Plasma biomarkers        and novel candidate molecules, such as microglia biomarkers, have been        tentatively investigated and could represent valuable targets for diagnosing and        monitoring AD.

Neuroinflammation has been recently identified as one of the        main causes of AD progression, and microglia cells are considered to have a        central role in this process. Growing evidence suggests that cannabinoids may be        used as preventive treatment for AD.

The        pathological hallmarks of AD consist of amyloid‑β (Aβ) plaque accumulation and        abnormal neurofibrillary tangles. Amyloid fibrils are constructed from Aβ        peptides, which are recognized to assemble into toxic oligomers and exert        cytotoxicity. The fibrillar Aβ‑protein fragment 25‑35 (Aβ(25‑35)) induces local        inflammation, thereby exacerbating neuronal apoptosis. Notoginsenoside R1 (NGR1),        one of the primary bioactive ingredients isolated from Panax notoginseng,        exhibits effective anti‑inflammatory and anti‑oxidative activities. However, NGR1        pharmacotherapies targeting Aβ‑induced inflammation and cell injury cascade        remain to be elucidated. The present study investigated the effect and mechanism        of NGR1 in Aβ(25‑35)‑treated PC12 cells. NGR1 doses between 250 and 1,000 µg/ml        significantly increased cell viability suppressed by 20 µM Aβ(25‑35) peptide        treatment. Notably, the present study demonstrated that Aβ(25‑35) peptide‑induced        sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1) signaling activation was reduced after NGR1        treatment, further inhibiting the downstream NF‑κB inflammatory signaling        pathway.

YKL-40 is a secreted        astrocytic glycoprotein that serves as a diagnostic biomarker of Alzheimer's        disease. High levels of YKL-40 are associated with either advanced Alzheimer's        disease or the normal aging process. However, the functional role of YKL-40 in        Alzheimer's disease development has not been firmly established. In a 5xFAD mouse        model of Alzheimer's disease, we observed increased YKL-40 expression in the        cerebrospinal fluid of 7-month-old mice and was correlated with activated        astrocytes. In primary astrocytes, Aβ(1-42) upregulated YKL-40 in a        dose-dependent manner and was correlated with PI3-K signaling pathway activation.        Furthermore, primary neurons treated with YKL-40 and/or Aβ(1-42) resulted in        significant synaptic degeneration, reduced dendritic complexity, and impaired        electrical parameters. More importantly, astrocyte-specific knockout of YKL-40        over a period of 7 days in symptomatic 5xFAD mice could effectively reduce        amyloid plaque deposition in multiple brain regions. This was also associated        with attenuated glial activation, reduced neuronal attrition, and restored memory        function. These biological phenotypes could be explained by enhanced uptake of        Aβ(1-42) peptides, increased rate of Aβ(1-42) degradation and acidification of        lysosomal compartment in YKL-40 knockout astrocytes.

To understand the underlying mechanism, we utilized a        sensitive inflammation-monitoring mouse system that contains the human        interleukin-6 (hIL6) bacterial artificial chromosome transgene modified with        luciferase (Luc) reporter cassette.

Fine-tuned therapeutic modulation of immune dysfunction to        ameliorate disease cannot be achieved without the characterization of diverse        microglial states that initiate unique, and sometimes contradictory, immune        responses that evolve over time in chronic inflammatory environments. Because of        the functional differences between human and murine microglia, untangling        distinct, disease-relevant reactive states and their corresponding effects on        pathology or neuronal health may not be possible without the use of human cells.        In order to profile shifting microglial states in early AD and identify        microglia-specific drivers of disease, we differentiated human induced        pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) carrying a familial AD PSEN2 mutation or its        isogenic control into cerebral organoids and quantified the changes in cytokine        concentrations over time with Luminex XMAP technology. We used partial least        squares (PLS) modeling to build cytokine signatures predictive of disease and age        to identify key differential patterns of cytokine expression that inform the        overall organoid immune milieu and quantified the corresponding changes in        protein pathology. AD organoids exhibited an overall reduction in cytokine        secretion after an initial amplified immune response. We demonstrate that reduced        synapse density observed in the AD organoids is prevented with microglial        depletion. Crucially, these differential effects of dysregulated immune signaling        occurred without the accumulation of pathological proteins.

Microfold (M) cells, which play a crucial        role in the gut immune response against external antigens, are also exploited for        the entry of pathogenic bacteria and proteins into the body. However, whether        changes in M cells can affect the gut environments and consequently change brain        pathologies in AD remains unknown. METHODS: Five familial AD (5xFAD) and        5xFAD-derived fecal microbiota transplanted (5xFAD-FMT) naïve mice were used to        investigate the changes of M cells in the AD environment. Next, to establish the        effect of M cell depletion on AD environments, 5xFAD mice and Spib knockout mice        were bred, and behavioral and histological analyses were performed when M        cell-depleted 5xFAD mice were six or nine months of age. RESULTS: In this study,        we found that M cell numbers were increased in the colons of 5xFAD and 5xFAD-FMT        mice compared to those of wild-type (WT) and WT-FMT mice. Moreover, the level of        total bacteria infiltrating the colons increased in the AD-mimicked mice. The        levels of M cell-related genes and that of infiltrating bacteria showed a        significant correlation. The genetic inhibition of M cells (Spib knockout) in        5xFAD mice changed the composition of the gut microbiota, along with decreasing        proinflammatory cytokine levels in the colons. M cell depletion ameliorated AD        symptoms including amyloid-β accumulation, microglial dysfunction,        neuroinflammation, and memory impairment. Similarly, 5xFAD-FMT did not induce        AD-like pathologies, such as memory impairment and excessive neuroinflammation in        Spib(-/-) mice.

Understanding their        underpinnings has implications for identifying biomarkers and treatment for these        symptoms. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether glial markers are associated with        neuropsychiatric symptoms in individuals across the Alzheimer disease continuum.        DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study was conducted from        January to June 2023, leveraging data from the Translational Biomarkers in Aging        and Dementia cohort at McGill University, Canada. Recruitment was based on        referrals of individuals from the community or from outpatient clinics. Exclusion        criteria included active substance abuse, major surgery, recent head trauma,        safety contraindications for positron emission tomography (PET) or magnetic        resonance imaging, being currently enrolled in other studies, and having        inadequately treated systemic conditions. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: All        individuals underwent assessment for neuropsychiatric symptoms (Neuropsychiatry        Inventory Questionnaire [NPI-Q]), and imaging for microglial activation        ([11C]PBR28 PET), amyloid-β ([18F]AZD4694 PET), and tau tangles ([18F]MK6240        PET). RESULTS: Of the 109 participants, 72 (66%) were women and 37 (34%) were        men; the median age was 71.8 years (range, 38.0-86.5 years). Overall, 70 had no        cognitive impairment and 39 had cognitive impairment (25 mild; 14 Alzheimer        disease dementia). Amyloid-β PET positivity was present in 21 cognitively        unimpaired individuals (30%) and in 31 cognitively impaired individuals (79%).        The NPI-Q severity score was associated with microglial activation in the        frontal, temporal, and parietal cortices (β = 7.37; 95% CI, 1.34-13.41; P = .01).        A leave-one-out approach revealed that irritability was the NPI-Q domain most        closely associated with the presence of brain microglial activation (β = 6.86;        95% CI, 1.77-11.95; P = .008).

The two main pathological features of        Alzheimer's disease are the extracellular deposition of β-amyloid (Aβ) to form        senile plaques and the intracellular aggregation of hyperphosphorylated Tau        protein to form neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Researchers have proposed several        hypotheses to elucidate the pathogenesis of AD, but due to the complexity of the        pathophysiologic factors involved in the development of AD, no effective drugs        have been found to stop the progression of the disease. Currently, the mainstay        drugs used to treat AD can only alleviate the patient's symptoms and do not have        a therapeutic effect. As researchers explore interactions among diseases, much        evidence suggests that there is a close link between periodontitis and AD, and        that periodontal pathogenic bacteria can exacerbate Aβ deposition and Tau protein        hyperphosphorylation through neuroinflammatory mechanisms, thereby advancing the        pathogenesis of AD.

Neuroinflammation provides protection in acute situations but        results in significant damage to the nervous system if chronic. Overexpression of        chemokines within the brain results in the recruitment and activation of glial        and peripheral immune cells which can propagate a cascading inflammatory        response, resulting in neurodegeneration and the onset of neurodegenerative        disorders. Recent work has identified the role of atypical chemokine receptors        (ACKRs) in neurodegenerative conditions. ACKRs are seven-transmembrane domain        receptors that do not follow canonical G protein signaling, but regulate        inflammatory responses by modulating chemokine abundance, location, and        availability. This review summarizes what is known about the four ACKRs and three        putative ACKRs within the brain, highlighting their known expression and        discussing the current understanding of each ACKR in the context of        neurodegeneration. The ability of ACKRs to alter levels of chemokines makes them        an appealing therapeutic target for neurodegenerative conditions.

Combination        therapy has been gaining attention recently, aiming to produce more efficient        effects. Angiotensin II activates the angiotensin 1 receptor and regulates        neuroinflammation and cognition. Angiotensin receptor 1 blockers (ARBs) were        shown to be neuroprotective and prevent cognitive decline. The present study        aimed to elucidate the combined role of CBD and ARBs in the modulation of        lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced glial inflammation. While LPS significantly        enhanced nitric oxide synthesis vs. the control, telmisartan and CBD, when        administered alone, attenuated this effect by 60% and 36%, respectively. Exposure        of LPS-stimulated cells to both compounds resulted in the 95% inhibition of glial        nitric oxide release (additive effect). A synergistic inhibitory effect on nitric        oxide release was observed when cells were co-treated with losartan (5 μM) and        CBD (5 μM) (by 80%) compared to exposure to each compound alone (by 22% and 26%,        respectively). Telmisartan and CBD given alone increased TNFα levels by 60% and        40%, respectively. CBD and telmisartan, when given together, attenuated the        LPS-induced increase in TNFα levels without statistical significance. LPS-induced        IL-17 release was attenuated by CBD with or without telmisartan (by 75%) or        telmisartan alone (by 60%). LPS-induced Interferon-γ release was attenuated by        80% when telmisartan was administered in the absence or presence of CBD.        Anti-inflammatory effects were recorded when CBD was combined with the known        anti-inflammatory agent dimethyl fumarate (DMF)/monomethyl fumarate (MMF).

We investigated the prophylactic effects of        liraglutide, a GLP-1 analog, on delirium-like behaviors in aged mice undergoing        cardiac surgery and explored the underlying mechanisms focusing on        neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and synaptic plasticity. METHODS:        Using a cardiac ischemia-reperfusion animal model to mimic cardiac surgery, we        assessed delirium-like behaviors, microglial activation, NLRP3 inflammasome        activation, mitophagy, synaptic engulfment, and synaptic plasticity. RESULTS:        Cardiac surgery triggered delirium-like behaviors, concomitant with heightened        microglial and NLRP3 inflammasome activation and impaired mitochondrial function        and synaptic plasticity. Pretreatment with liraglutide ameliorated these adverse        outcomes. Mechanistically, liraglutide enhanced mitophagy, thereby inhibiting        NLRP3 inflammasome activation and subsequent microglial activation. Furthermore,        liraglutide counteracted surgery-induced synaptic loss and impairment of synaptic        plasticity. CONCLUSION: Liraglutide exerts protective effects against        delirium-like behaviors in aged mice post-cardiac surgery, potentially through        bolstering microglia mitophagy, curtailing neuroinflammation, and preserving        synaptic integrity.

This study aimed        to integrate bioinformatics techniques to explore biomarkers to support the        correlation between ferroptosis and AD. In addition, further investigation of        ferroptosis-related biomarkers was conducted on the transcriptome characteristics        in the asymptomatic AD (AsymAD). METHODS: The microarray datasets GSE118553,        GSE132903, GSE33000, and GSE157239 on AD were downloaded from the GEO database.        The list of ferroptosis-related genes was extracted from the FerrDb website.        Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified by R ""limma"" package and        used to screen ferroptosis-related hub genes. The random forest algorithm was        used to construct the diagnostic model through hub genes. The immune cell        infiltration was also analyzed by CIBERSORTx. The miRNet and DGIdb database were        used to identify microRNAs (miRNAs) and drugs which targeting hub genes. RESULTS:        We identified 18 ferroptosis-related hub genes anomalously expressed in AD, and        consistent expression trends had been observed in both AsymAD The random forest        diagnosis model had good prediction results in both training set (AUC = 0.824)        and validation set (AUC = 0.734). Immune cell infiltration was analyzed and the        results showed that CD4+ T cells resting memory, macrophages M2 and neutrophils        were significantly higher in AD. A significant correlation of hub genes with        immune infiltration was observed, such as DDIT4 showed strong positive        correlation with CD4+ T cells memory resting and AKR1C2 had positive correlation        with Macrophages M2.

However, under the pathological        circumstances of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the brain's microenvironment undergoes        detrimental changes that significantly impact OPCs and their functions. Starting        with OPC functions, we delve into the transformation of OPCs to myelin-producing        oligodendrocytes, the intricate signaling interactions with other cells in the        central nervous system (CNS), and the fascinating process of phagocytosis, which        influences the function of OPCs and affects CNS homeostasis. Moreover, we discuss        the essential role of OPCs in BBB formation and highlight the critical        contribution of OPCs in forming CNS-protective barriers. In the context of AD,        the deterioration of the local microenvironment in the brain is discussed, mainly        focusing on neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and the accumulation of toxic        proteins. The detrimental changes disturb the delicate balance in the brain,        impacting the regenerative capacity of OPCs and compromising myelin integrity.        Under pathological conditions, OPCs experience significant alterations in        migration and proliferation, leading to impaired differentiation and a reduced        ability to produce mature oligodendrocytes. Moreover, myelin degeneration and        formation become increasingly active in AD, contributing to progressive        neurodegeneration. Finally, we summarize the current therapeutic approaches        targeting OPCs in AD. Strategies to revitalize OPC senescence, modulate signaling        pathways to enhance OPC differentiation, and explore other potential therapeutic        avenues are promising in alleviating the impact of AD on OPCs and CNS function.        In conclusion, this review highlights the indispensable role of OPCs in CNS        function and their involvement in the pathogenesis of AD.

Hypoxia condition usually results from        living in a high-altitude habitat, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases,        and chronic obstructive sleep apnea. Chronic hypoxia has been identified as a        significant risk factor for AD, showing an aggravation of various pathological        components of AD, such as amyloid β-protein (Aβ) metabolism, tau phosphorylation,        mitochondrial dysfunction, and neuroinflammation. It is known that hypoxia and        excessive hyperoxia can both result in oxidative stress and mitochondrial        dysfunction. Oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction can increase Aβ and        tau phosphorylation, and Aβ and tau proteins can lead to redox imbalance, thus        forming a vicious cycle and exacerbating AD pathology. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy        (HBOT) is a non-invasive intervention known for its capacity to significantly        enhance cerebral oxygenation levels, which can significantly attenuate Aβ        aggregation, tau phosphorylation, and neuroinflammation. However, further        investigation is imperative to determine the optimal oxygen pressure, duration of        exposure, and frequency of HBOT sessions. In this review, we explore the        prospects of oxygen metabolism in AD, with the aim of enhancing our understanding        of the underlying molecular mechanisms in AD.

METHODS: Cross-sectional and longitudinal data (10,099 participants with        13,380 scans) from 12 independent datasets were used in the present study (this        study was performed between September 1, 2021 and February 15, 2023). The        Individual Brain-Related Abnormalities In Neurodegeneration (IBRAIN) score was        developed via integrated regional- and network-based measures under an ensemble        machine learning model based on structural MRI data. We systematically assessed        whether IBRAIN could be a neuroimaging biomarker for AD. FINDINGS: IBRAIN        accurately differentiated individuals with AD from NCs (AUC = 0.92) and other        neurodegenerative diseases, including Frontotemporal dementia (FTD), Parkinson's        disease (PD), Vascular dementia (VaD) and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)        (AUC = 0.92).

Autophagy is strongly associated with the        progression of Alzheimer disease (AD). Microglia are brain-resident macrophages,        and recent studies indicate that autophagy in microglia protects neurons from        neurodegeneration. Postnatal neurogenesis, the generation of new neurons from        adult neural stem cells (NSCs), is impaired in AD patients as well as in AD        animal models. However, the extent to which microglial autophagy influences adult        NSCs and neurogenesis in AD animal models has not been studied. Here, we showed        that conditional knock out (cKO) of Atg5 (autophagy related 5) in microglia        inhibited postnatal neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus,        but not in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of a 5×FAD mouse model. Interestingly,        the protection of neurogenesis by Atg5 in microglia was only observed in female        AD mice. To confirm the roles of autophagy in microglia for postnatal hippocampal        neurogenesis, we generated additional cKO mice to delete autophagy essential        genes Rb1cc1 or Atg14 in microglia. However, these rb1cc1 cKO and atg14 cKO mice        did not exhibit neurogenesis defects in the context of a female AD mouse model.        Last, we used the CSF1R antagonist to deplete ATG5-deficient microglia and this        intervention restored neurogenesis in the hippocampus of 5×FAD mice. These        results indicate that microglial ATG5 is essential to maintain postnatal        hippocampal neurogenesis in a mouse model of AD.

AIMS: In this study, we aimed to explore the mechanism of action        of LbGp in the treatment of spinal cord injury through metabolomics and molecular        experiments. METHODS: SD male rats were randomly assigned to three experimental        groups, and after establishing the spinal cord hemisection model, LbGp was        administered orally. Spinal cord tissue was sampled on the seventh day after        surgery for molecular and metabolomic experiments. In vitro, LbGp was        administered to mimic the inflammatory microenvironment by activating microglia,        and its mechanism of action in suppressing neuroinflammation was further        elaborated using metabolomics and molecular biology techniques such as western        blotting and q-PCR.

AIMS: The aim of the study was to unveil new molecular pathways        driving neuroprotection through sEH, we used an optimized, potent, and selective        sEH inhibitor (sEHi, UB-SCG-51). MATERIALS AND METHODS: UB-SCG-51 was tested in        neuroblastoma cell line, SH-SY5Y, in primary mouse and human astrocytes cultures        challenged with proinflammatory insults and in microglia cultures treated with        amyloid oligomers, as well as in mice AD model (5XFAD). RESULTS: UB-SCG-51 (10        and 30 μM) prevented neurotoxic reactive-astrocyte conversion in primary mouse        astrocytes challenged with TNF-α, IL-1α, and C1q (T/I/C) combination for 24 h.        Moreover, in microglial cultures, sEHi reduced inflammation and glial activity.        In addition, UB-SCG-51 rescued 5XFAD cognitive impairment, reducing the number of        Amyloid-β plaques and Tau hyperphosphorylation accompanied by a reduction in        neuroinflammation and apoptotic markers. Notably, a transcriptional profile        analysis revealed a new pathway modulated by sEHi treatment. Specifically, the        eIF2α/CHOP pathway, which promoted the endoplasmic reticulum response, was        increased in the 5XFAD-treated group. These findings were confirmed in human        primary astrocytes by combining sEHi and eIF2α inhibitor (eIF2αi) treatment.        Besides, combining both treatments resulted in increased in C3 gene expression        after T/I/C compared with the group treated with sEHi alone in cultures.        DISCUSSION: Therefore, sEHi rescued cognitive impairment and neurodegeneration in        AD mice model, based on the reduction of inflammation and eIF2α/CHOP signaling        pathway.

In this study, we aimed to investigate whether        TCMS could ameliorate complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA)-induced inflammatory pain        in mice and elucidate its underlying mechanisms. METHODS: Here, we established an        inflammatory pain model in mice by injecting CFA into the left hind paw. Three        days later, we administered intraperitoneal injections of TCMS (10 mg/kg) or        saline to the animals. We examined mechanical allodynia, thermal        hypersensitivity, and anxiety behavior. Furthermore, the activation of glial        cells and proinflammatory cytokines in the spinal cord were detected. RESULTS:        Our results showed that TCMS significantly reversed the mechanical allodynia and        thermal hypersensitivity in the CFA-injected mice. Furthermore, TCMS        administration effectively inhibited the activation of microglia and astrocytes        in the spinal cord induced by CFA. Additionally, TCMS suppressed the production        and release of spinal proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-1β, and        IL-6, in CFA-injected mice. CONCLUSION: Taken together, our findings demonstrate        that TCMS holds promise as an innovative analgesic due to its ability to        ameliorate inflammatory reactions.",PMC10659006,Neuroimmunomodulation,9422763

Many of the early attempts to        develop treatments for AD focused on Aβ, but a lack of efficacy of these        treatments in terms of slowing disease progression led to a change of strategy        towards targeting of tau pathology. Given that tau shows a stronger correlation        with symptom severity than does Aβ, targeting of tau is more likely to be        efficacious once cognitive decline begins. Anti-tau therapies initially focused        on post-translational modifications, inhibition of tau aggregation and        stabilization of microtubules.

Until now, the role of RNA structure in aging and neurodegeneration has        largely remained unexplored. METHODS: In this study, we examined human        hippocampal postmortem tissue for the formation of RNA G-quadruplexes (rG4s) in        aging and AD. RESULTS: We found that rG4 immunostaining strongly increased in the        hippocampus with both age and with AD severity. We further found that neurons        with accumulation of phospho-tau immunostaining contained rG4s, that rG4        structure can drive tau aggregation, and that rG4 staining density depended on        APOE genotype in the human tissue examined. DISCUSSION: Combined with previous        studies showing the dependence of rG4 structure on stress and the extreme power        of rG4s at oligomerizing proteins, we propose a model of neurodegeneration in        which chronic rG4 formation drives proteostasis collapse.

37858252,A small-molecule TLR4 antagonist reduced neuroinflammation in female E4FAD mice.,10.1186/s13195-023-01330-6,"BACKGROUND: APOE genotype is the greatest genetic risk factor for sporadic        Alzheimer's disease (AD). APOE4 increases AD risk up to 12-fold compared to        APOE3, an effect that is greater in females. Evidence suggests that one-way APOE        could modulate AD risk and progression through neuroinflammation. Indeed, APOE4        is associated with higher glial activation and cytokine levels in AD patients and        mice. Therefore, identifying pathways that contribute to APOE4-associated        neuroinflammation is an important approach for understanding and treating AD.        Human and in vivo evidence suggests that TLR4, one of the key receptors involved        in the innate immune system, could be involved in APOE-modulated        neuroinflammation. Consistent with that idea, we previously demonstrated that the        TLR4 antagonist IAXO-101 can reduce LPS- and Aβ-induced cytokine secretion in        APOE4 glial cultures. Therefore, the goal of this study was to advance these        findings and determine whether IAXO-101 can modulate neuroinflammation, Aβ        pathology, and behavior in mice that express APOE4. METHODS: We used mice that        express five familial AD mutations and human APOE3 (E3FAD) or APOE4 (E4FAD).        Female and male E4FAD mice and female E3FAD mice were treated with vehicle or        IAXO-101 in two treatment paradigms: prevention from 4 to 6 months of age or        reversal from 6 to 7 months of age. Learning and memory were assessed by modified        Morris water maze. Aβ deposition, fibrillar amyloid deposition, astrogliosis, and        microgliosis were assessed by immunohistochemistry. Soluble levels of Aβ and        apoE, insoluble levels of apoE and Aβ, and IL-1β were measured by ELISA. RESULTS:        IAXO-101 treatment resulted in lower Iba-1 coverage, lower number of reactive        microglia, and improved memory in female E4FAD mice in both prevention and        reversal paradigms. IAXO-101-treated male E4FAD mice also had lower Iba-1        coverage and reactivity in the RVS paradigm, but there was no effect on behavior.        There was also no effect of IAXO-101 treatment on neuroinflammation and behavior        in female E3FAD mice.

While apolipoprotein E (APOE) is known to        modify AD risk, it remains unclear how microglial apoE impacts brain cognition        and AD pathology. Here, using conditional mouse models expressing apoE isoforms        in microglia and central nervous system-associated macrophages (CAMs), we        demonstrate a cell-autonomous effect of apoE3-mediated microglial activation and        function, which are negated by apoE4. Expression of apoE3 in microglia/CAMs        improves cognitive function, increases microglia surrounding amyloid plaque and        reduces amyloid pathology and associated toxicity, whereas apoE4 expression        either compromises or has no effects on these outcomes by impairing lipid        metabolism. Single-cell transcriptomic profiling reveals increased antigen        presentation and interferon pathways upon apoE3 expression. In contrast, apoE4        expression downregulates complement and lysosomal pathways, and promotes        stress-related responses. Moreover, in the presence of mouse endogenous apoE,        microglial apoE4 exacerbates amyloid pathology. Finally, we observed a reduction        in Lgals3-positive responsive microglia surrounding amyloid plaque and an        increased accumulation of lipid droplets in APOE4 human brains and induced        pluripotent stem cell-derived microglia.

Data suggests that early        intervention at the first stages of mild cognitive impairment may have a greater        chance for success. The calcineurin (CN)-Pin1 signaling cascade can be        selectively targeted with tacrolimus (FK506), a highly specific, FDA-approved CN        inhibitor used safely for > 20 years in solid organ transplant recipients.

METHODS: Time release pellets were used to deliver constant FK506 dosage        to APP/PS1 mice without deleterious manipulation or handling. Immunofluorescence,        histology, molecular biology, and behavior were used to evaluate changes in AD        pathology. RESULTS: FK506 can be safely and consistently delivered into juvenile        APP/PS1 mice via time-release pellets to levels roughly seen in transplant        patients, leading to the normalization of CN activity and reduction or        elimination of AD pathologies including synapse loss, neuroinflammation, and        cognitive impairment.

Central auditory hyperactivity correlated        in time with small amounts of plaque deposition in the inferior colliculus and        medial geniculate body, which are the auditory midbrain and thalamus,        respectively. Neuroinflammation has been associated with excitation to inhibition        imbalance in the central nervous system, and therefore has been proposed as a        link between central auditory hyperactivity and AD in our previous report.        However, neuroinflammation in the auditory pathway has not been investigated in        mouse amyloidosis models. METHODS: Machine learning was used to classify the        previously obtained auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) from 5xFAD mice and their        wild type (WT) littermates. Neuroinflammation was assessed in six        auditory-related regions of the cortex, thalamus, and brainstem. Cochlear        pathology was assessed in cryosection and whole mount. Behavioral changes were        assessed with fear conditioning, open field testing and novel objection        recognition. RESULTS: Reliable machine learning classification of 5xFAD and WT        littermate ABRs were achieved for 6M and 12M, but not 3M. The top features for        accurate classification at 6 months of age were characteristics of Waves IV and        V. Microglial and astrocytic activation were pronounced in 5xFAD inferior        colliculus and medial geniculate body at 6 months, two neural centers that are        thought to contribute to these waves. Lower regions of the brainstem were        unaffected, and cortical auditory centers also displayed inflammation beginning        at 6 months. No losses were seen in numbers of spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs),        auditory synapses, or efferent synapses in the cochlea. 5xFAD mice had reduced        responses to tones in fear conditioning compared to WT littermates beginning at 6        months.

Oligomerization of these        peptides may be associated with their 42 amino acid residue arrangement. However,        the process of amyloid plaque formation is still not well known. The protein        folding-shape code (PFSC) method is a powerful tool to analyze protein        confirmation which could exhibit the local structural folding features in detail.        In our study, we utilized the PFSC to analyze Aβ peptide in humans and mice and        found that mouse Aβ42 is less likely to polymerize than human's. Subsequently, we        used the PFSC method to analyze the 42 amino acids of Aβ, transformed some        species in human Aβ42 and obtained 7 mutants. We showed that it was not easy to        aggregate Aβ in mutants. Herein, inflammatory responses were decreased, as        indicated by the expression of cytokines. We confirmed that the neurotoxicity of        mutant human Aβ was decreased by preventing peptide aggregation.

Considering unanswered questions regarding the effect        of H. pylori infection on brain activity, we sought to investigate the impact of        H. pylori infection on the expression of AD-associated risk factors. We used two        H. pylori clinical strains obtained from two patients with peptic ulcer and        evaluated their influence on the expression level of AD-associated genes (APP,        ApoE2, ApoE4, ABCA7, BIN1, Clu, CD33) and genes for inflammatory markers (TLR-4,        IL-8, TNF-α) by RT-qPCR in human glioblastoma (U87MG) and astrocyte (1321N1) cell        lines. The expression of inflammatory cytokines was further assessed by ELISA        assay. The exposure of U97MG and 1321N1 cells to H. pylori strains resulted in a        significant enhancement in the expression level of the risk allele ApoE4, while        reducing the expression of the protective allele ApoE2.

The cGAS-STING axis, a cytoplasmic pathway        responsible for detecting dsDNA, plays a significant role in mediating        neuroinflammation in neurological diseases. However, the effects of inhibiting        cGAS with the selective small molecule inhibitor RU.521 on brain injury and the        underlying mechanisms after SAH are still unclear. METHODS: The expression and        microglial localization of cGAS following SAH were investigated with western blot        analysis and immunofluorescent double-staining, respectively. RU.521 was        administered after SAH. 2'3'-cGAMP, a second messenger converted by activated        cGAS, was used to activate cGAS-STING. The assessments were carried out by        adopting various techniques including neurological function scores, brain water        content, blood-brain barrier permeability, western blot analysis, TUNEL staining,        Nissl staining, immunofluorescence, morphological analysis, Morris water        maze test, Golgi staining, CCK8, flow cytometry in the in vivo and in vitro        settings. RESULTS: Following SAH, there was an observed increase in the        expression levels of cGAS in rat brain tissue, with peak levels observed at 24 h        post-SAH. RU.521 resulted in a reduction of brain water content and blood-brain        barrier permeability, leading to an improvement in neurological deficits after        SAH. RU.521 had beneficial effects on neuronal apoptosis and microglia        activation, as well as improvements in microglial morphology. Additionally,        RU.521 prompted a shift in microglial phenotype from M1 to M2. We also noted a        decrease in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6,        and an increase in the level of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Finally,        RU.521 treatment was associated with improvements in cognitive function and an        increase in the number of dendritic spines in the hippocampus. The therapeutic        effects were mediated by the cGAS/STING/NF-κB pathway and were found to be        abolished by 2'3'-cGAMP. In vitro, RU.521 significantly reduced apoptosis and        neuroinflammation. CONCLUSION: The study showed that SAH leads to        neuroinflammation caused by microglial activation, which contributes to early        brain injury. RU.521 improved neurological outcomes and reduced neuroinflammation        by regulating microglial polarization through the cGAS/STING/NF-κB pathway in        early brain injury after SAH. RU.521 may be a promising candidate for the        treatment of neuroinflammatory pathology after SAH. Video Abstract.",PMC10537158,Cell communication and signaling : CCS,101170464

A        well-characterized biomarker of neurodegeneration is the accumulation of        proteinaceous aggregates in the brain. However, the gradually worsening symptoms        of neurodegenerative diseases are unlikely to be solely due to the result of a        mutation in a single gene, but rather a multi-step process involving epigenetic        changes. Recently, it has been suggested that a fraction of epigenetic        alternations may be correlated to neurodegeneration in the brain. Unlike DNA        mutations, epigenetic alterations are reversible, and therefore raise the        possibilities for therapeutic intervention, including dietary modifications.        Additionally, reactive oxygen species may contribute to the pathogenesis of        Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease through epigenetic alternation.

The molecular        mechanism underlying amyloid-β accumulation is largely unknown, but recent        evidence suggests that impaired amyloid-β clearance plays a critical role in its        accumulation. The review provides an overview of recent research and proposes        strategies for efficient amyloid-β clearance in both the brain and periphery. The        clearance of amyloid-β can occur through enzymatic or non-enzymatic pathways in        the brain, including neuronal and glial cells, blood-brain barrier, interstitial        fluid bulk flow, perivascular drainage, and cerebrospinal fluid        absorption-mediated pathways. In the periphery, various mechanisms, including        peripheral organs, immunomodulation/immune cells, enzymes, amyloid-β-binding        proteins, and amyloid-β-binding cells, are involved in amyloid-β clearance.        Although recent findings have shed light on amyloid-β clearance in both regions,        opportunities remain in areas where limited data is available. Therefore, future        strategies that enhance amyloid-β clearance in the brain and/or periphery, either        through central or peripheral clearance approaches or in combination, are highly        encouraged.

The aim of the present        study is to identify the association among inflammation, brain structure, and        neurodegenerative disorders at genetic and transcriptomic levels. Genetic        variants associated with inflammatory cytokines were selected from the latest and        largest genome-wide association studies of European ancestry. Neurodegenerative        disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD),        amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and        brain structure imaging measures were selected as the outcomes. Two-sample        Mendelian randomization analyses were conducted to identify the causal        associations. Single-nucleus transcriptome data of the occipitotemporal cortex        was further analyzed to identify the differential expressed genes in AD, which        were tested for biological processes and protein interaction network. MR analysis        indicated that genetically predicted TREM2 and sTREM2 were significantly        associated with AD (TREM2: z-score = -9.088, p-value = 1.02 × 10(-19); sTREM2:        z-score = -7.495, p-value = 6.61 × 10(-14)). The present study found no evidence        to support the causal associations between other inflammatory cytokines and the        risks of AD, PD, ALS, or DLB. Genetically predicted TREM2 was significantly        associated with the cortical thickness of inferior temporal (z-score = -4.238,        p-value = 2.26 × 10(-5)) and pole temporal (z-score = -4.549, p-value = 5.40 ×        10(-6)). In the occipitotemporal cortex samples, microglia were the main source        of TREM2 gene and showed increasing expression of genes associated with        inflammation and immunity. The present study has leveraged genetic and        transcriptomic data to identify the association among TREM2, temporal lobe, and        AD and the underlying cellular and molecular basis, thus providing a new        perspective on the role of TREM2 in AD and insights into the complex associations        among inflammation, brain structure, and neurodegenerative disorders,        particularly AD.",,Molecular neurobiology,8900963

Despite extensive research on the significant contribution of lipid        metabolism to AD progression, the precise mechanisms remain incompletely        understood. Hence, this study aimed to identify key differentially expressed        lipid metabolism-related genes (DELMRGs) in AD progression. METHODS:        Comprehensive analyses were performed to determine key DELMRGs in AD compared to        controls in GSE122063 dataset from Gene Expression Omnibus. Additionally, the        ssGSEA algorithm was utilized for estimating immune cell levels. Subsequently,        correlations between key DELMRGs and each immune cell were calculated        specifically in AD samples. The key DELMRGs expression levels were validated via        two external datasets. Furthermore, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was        utilized for deriving associated pathways of key DELMRGs. Additionally, miRNA-TF        regulatory networks of the key DELMRGs were constructed using the miRDB,        NetworkAnalyst 3.0, and Cytoscape software. Finally, based on key DELMRGs, AD        samples were further segmented into two subclusters via consensus clustering, and        immune cell patterns and pathway differences between the two subclusters were        examined. RESULTS: Seventy up-regulated and 100 down-regulated DELMRGs were        identified. Subsequently, three key DELMRGs (DLD, PLPP2, and PLAAT4) were        determined utilizing three algorithms [(i) LASSO, (ii) SVM-RFE, and (iii) random        forest]. Specifically, PLPP2 and PLAAT4 were up-regulated, while DLD exhibited        downregulation in AD cerebral cortex tissue. This was validated in two separate        external datasets (GSE132903 and GSE33000). The AD group exhibited significantly        altered immune cell composition compared to controls. In addition, GSEA        identified various pathways commonly associated with three key DELMRGs. Moreover,        the regulatory network of miRNA-TF for key DELMRGs was established. Finally,        significant differences in immune cell levels and several pathways were        identified between the two subclusters.

Recent        advances in single-cell technologies have revealed that these reactive microglia        were with high spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Some identified microglia in        specific states correlate with pathological hallmarks and are associated with        specific functions. Microglia both exert protective function by phagocytosing and        clearing pathological protein aggregates and play detrimental roles due to        excessive uptake of protein aggregates, which would lead to microglial phagocytic        ability impairment, neuroinflammation, and eventually neurodegeneration. In        addition, peripheral immune cells infiltration shapes microglia into a        pro-inflammatory phenotype and accelerates disease progression. Microglia also        act as a mobile vehicle to propagate protein aggregates. Extracellular vesicles        released from microglia and autophagy impairment in microglia all contribute to        pathological progression and neurodegeneration. Thus, enhancing microglial        phagocytosis, reducing microglial-mediated neuroinflammation, inhibiting        microglial exosome synthesis and secretion, and promoting microglial conversion        into a protective phenotype are considered to be promising strategies for the        therapy of neurodegenerative diseases.

In this disease, learning and memory        and the cellular mechanism associated with it, long-term potentiation (LTP), are        impaired. Considering the beneficial effects of carvacrol (CAR) and p-cymene        against AD, their effect was assessed on in vivo hippocampal LTP in the perforant        pathway (PP)-dentate gyrus (DG) pathway in an Aβ(1-42) -induced rat model of AD.        METHODS: Male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to five groups: sham:        intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of phosphate-buffered saline, Aβ: ICV        Aβ(1-42) injections, Aβ + CAR (50 mg/kg), Aβ + p-cymene (50 mg/kg), and        Aβ + CAR + p-cymene. Administration of CAR and p-cymene was done by gavage daily        4 weeks before and 4 weeks after the Aβ injection. The population spike (PS)        amplitude and field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSP) slope were        determined in DG against the applied stimulation to the PP. RESULTS: Aβ-treated        rats exhibited impaired LTP induction in the PP-DG synapses, resulting in        significant reduction in both fEPSP slope and PS amplitude compared to the sham        animals. Aβ-treated rats consumed either CAR or p-cymene separately (but not        their combination), and showed an enhancement in fEPSP slope and PS amplitude of        the DG granular cells. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that CAR or p-cymene can        ameliorate Aβ-associated changes in synaptic plasticity.

Cognitive impairment induced by SD involves        neuroinflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction, but the underlying mechanisms        are largely unknown. Urolithin A (UA) is a natural compound that can reduce        neuroinflammation and improve mitochondrial health, but its therapeutic effects        in a SD model have not yet been studied. Young (3-months old) and aged (12-months        old) mice were sleep deprived for 24 h, and UA (2.5 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg) was        injected intraperitoneally for 7 consecutive days before the SD period.        Immunofluorescent staining, western blotting, and RT-PCR were employed to        evaluate levels of proteins involved in neuroinflammation and mitochondrial        function. Transmission electron microscope and Golgi-Cox staining were used to        evaluate mitochondrial and neuronal morphology, respectively.

Recent studies have shown that neuronal        pyroptosis mediated by the NLRP3 inflammasome plays a crucial role in the        pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. OBJECTIVE AND METHOD: The NLRP3        inflammasome is a multiprotein complex that, when activated within cells,        triggers an inflammatory response, ultimately leading to pyroptotic cell death of        neurons. Pyroptosis is a typical pro-inflammatory programmed cell death process        occurring downstream of NLRP3 inflammasome activation, characterized by the        formation of pores on the cell membrane by the GSDMD protein, leading to cell        lysis and the release of inflammatory factors. It has been found that NLRP3        inflammasome-mediated neuronal pyroptosis is closely associated with the        development of various neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease,        traumatic brain injury, and Parkinson's disease. Therefore, inhibiting NLRP3        inflammasome activation and attenuating neuronal pyroptosis could potentially        serve as novel strategies for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.        RESULTS: The aim of this review is to explore the role of NLRP3        activation-mediated neuronal pyroptosis and neuroinflammation in        neurodegenerative diseases.

CSF samples from a        total of 90 participants were included in this study: 30 from patients with        subjective cognitive decline (age 62.4 ± 4.38, female 60%), 30 with mild        cognitive impairment (age 65.6 ± 7.48, female 50%) and 30 with Alzheimer's        disease (age 68.2 ± 7.86, female 50%). Angiotensinogen, thioredoxin-1 and        interleukin-15 had the most prominent associations with Alzheimer's disease        pathology, synaptic and axonal damage markers. Synaptosomal-associated protein        25 kDa and neurofilament light chain were increased in mild cognitive impairment        and Alzheimer's disease patients. Grouping biomarkers by biological function        showed that inflammatory and survival components were associated with Alzheimer's        disease pathology, synaptic dysfunction and axonal damage. Moreover, a        vascular/metabolic component was associated with synaptic dysfunction. In the        data-driven analysis, two patient clusters were identified: Cluster 1 had        increased CSF markers of oxidative stress, vascular pathology and        neuroinflammation and was characterized by elevated synaptic and axonal damage,        compared with Cluster 2. Clinical groups were evenly distributed between the        clusters. An analysis of post-mortem hippocampal tissue showed that compared with        non-demented controls, angiotensinogen staining was higher in Alzheimer's disease        and co-localized with phosphorylated-tau. The identification of biomarker-driven        endophenotypes in cognitive disorder patients further highlights the biological        heterogeneity of Alzheimer's disease and the importance of tailored prevention        and treatment strategies.",PMC10481253,Brain communications,101755125

Here we show that Bacteroides fragilis and their metabolites        12-hydroxy-heptadecatrienoic acid (12-HHTrE) and Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) activate        microglia and induce AD pathogenesis in neuronal C/EBPβ transgenic mice.        Recolonization of antibiotics cocktail-pretreated Thy1-C/EBPβ transgenic mice        with AD patient fecal samples elicits AD pathologies, associated with        C/EBPβ/Asparaginyl endopeptidase (AEP) pathway upregulation, microglia        activation, and cognitive disorders compared to mice receiving healthy donors'        fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). Microbial 16S rRNA sequencing analysis        shows higher abundance of proinflammatory Bacteroides fragilis in AD-FMT mice.        Active components characterization from the sera and brains of the transplanted        mice revealed that both 12-HHTrE and PGE2 activate primary microglia, fitting        with poly-unsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) metabolites enrichment identified by        metabolomics.

Emerging evidence indicated that interleukin-34 (IL-34)        contributes to AD and inflammatory osteolysis via the colony-stimulating factor-1        receptor (CSF-1r). In addition, CSF-1r is also activated by macrophage        colony-stimulating factor-1 (M-CSF). While the role of M-CSF in bone physiology        and pathology is well addressed, it remains controversial whether IL-34-mediated        signaling promotes osteolysis, neurodegeneration, and neuroinflammation in        relation to AD. In this study, we injected 3x-Tg mice with mouse recombinant        IL-34 protein over the calvaria bone every other day for 42 days. Then,        behavioral changes, brain pathology, and calvaria osteolysis were evaluated using        various behavioral maze and histological assays. We demonstrated that IL-34        administration dramatically elevated AD-like anxiety and memory loss, pathogenic        amyloidogenesis, p-Tau, and RAGE expression in female 3x-Tg mice. Furthermore,        IL-34 delivery promoted calvaria inflammatory osteolysis compared to the control        group.

In this study, AD was induced in male Wistar rats (n = 6) by the        administration of intracerebroventricular-streptozotocin (ICV-STZ-3 mg/kg/day),        and Voglibose (Vog) was administered at various doses (10, 25, and 50 mg/kg),        while Galantamine (3 mg/kg) acted as a reference standard drug. Behavioral        alterations in both spatial and non-spatial memory functions were evaluated in        the experimental rats. At the end of the study, all experimental rats were        sacrificed, and their brain parts, the cortex and hippocampus, were subjected to        biochemical, western blot, and histopathological analysis. In our study results,        the statistically significant dose-dependent results from the behavioral tests        show the Voglibose-treated groups significantly improved (p < 0.0001) spatial and        non-spatial memory functions when compared with ICV-STZ-treated group. Meanwhile,        when compared with ICV-STZ-treated rats, treatment with Voglibose (10, 25, and        50 mg/kg) showed the activities of both acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and        malondialdehyde (MDA) were significantly attenuated (p < 0.0001), while the        operation of antioxidant enzymes was considerably enhanced (p < 0.0001).

Recent work leveraging artificial        intelligence (AI) has offered promise to dissect this heterogeneity by        identifying complex intermediate phenotypes - herein called dimensional        neuroimaging endophenotypes (DNEs) - which subtype various neurologic and        neuropsychiatric diseases. We investigate the presence of nine such DNEs derived        from independent yet harmonized studies on Alzheimer's disease (AD1-2)(1), autism        spectrum disorder (ASD1-3)(2), late-life depression (LLD1-2)(3), and        schizophrenia (SCZ1-2)(4), in the general population of 39,178 participants in        the UK Biobank study. Phenome-wide associations revealed prominent associations        between the nine DNEs and phenotypes related to the brain and other human organ        systems. This phenotypic landscape aligns with the SNP-phenotype genome-wide        associations, revealing 31 genomic loci associated with the nine DNEs (Bonferroni        corrected P-value < 5×10(-8)/9). The DNEs exhibited significant genetic        correlations, colocalization, and causal relationships with multiple human organ        systems and chronic diseases.

Auditory function can be measured        by either subjective or objective tests. Objective tests are more useful in        identifying which auditory pathway (superior or inferior) is most affected by        disease. The inner ear's perilymphatic fluid communicates with the cerebrospinal        fluid (CSF) via the cochlear aqueduct representing a window from which        pathological changes in the contents of the CSF due to brain inflammation could,        therefore, spread to and cause inflammation in the inner ear, damaging inner hair        cells and leading to hearing impairment identifiable on tests of auditory        function. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was performed, searching        for papers with case-control studies that analyzed the hearing and migraine        function in patients with neuro-inflammatory, neurodegenerative disorders. With        data extracted from these papers, the risk of patients with neurological        distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) was then calculated. RESULTS:        Patients with neurological disorders (headache, Parkinson's disease, and multiple        sclerosis) had a higher risk of having peripheral auditory deficits when compared        to healthy individuals. CONCLUSION: Existing data lend credence to the hypothesis        that inflammatory mediators transmitted via fluid exchange across this        communication window, thereby represents a key pathobiological mechanism capable        of culminating in hearing disturbances associated with neuroimmunological and        neuroinflammatory disorders of the nervous system.",PMC10471191,Frontiers in neurology,101546899

Microglia are resident macrophages of the brain and spinal        cord which play an important role in maintaining brain homeostasis through a        variety of phenotypes, including the pro-inflammatory phenotype and        anti-inflammatory phenotypes.

Essential oil of Jasminum grandiflorum L. flowers is commonly used in        folk medicine for the relief of mental pressure and disorders, and analyzing the        volatile compound profiles and evaluating the inhibitory effects of J.        grandiflorum L. essential oil (JGEO) on the excessive activation of microglia are        valuable for its application. This study aims to explore the potential active        compounds in JGEO for treating AD by inhibiting microglia activation-integrated        network pharmacology, molecular docking, and the microglia model. A headspace        solid-phase microextraction combined with the gas chromatography-mass        spectrometry procedure was used to analyze the volatile characteristics of the        compounds in J. grandiflorum L. flowers at 50°C, 70°C, 90°C, and 100°C for        50 min, respectively. A network pharmacological analysis and molecular docking        were used to predict the key compounds, key targets, and binding energies based        on the detected compounds in JGEO. In the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced BV-2        cell model, the cells were treated with 100 ng/mL of LPS and JGEO at 7.5, 15.0,        and 30 μg/mL, and then, the morphological changes, the production of nitric oxide        (NO) and reactive oxygen species, and the expressions of tumor necrosis factor-α,        interleukin-1β, and ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 of BV-2 cells were        analyzed. A total of 34 compounds with significantly different volatilities were        identified. α-Hexylcinnamaldehyde, nerolidol, hexahydrofarnesyl acetone,        dodecanal, and decanal were predicted as the top five key compounds, and SRC,        EGFR, VEGFA, HSP90AA1, and ESR1 were the top five key targets. In addition, the        binding energies between them were less than -3.9 kcal/mol. BV-2 cells were        activated by LPS with morphological changes, and JGEO not only could clearly        reverse the changes but also significantly inhibited the production of NO and        reactive oxygen species and suppressed the expressions of tumor necrosis        factor-α, interleukin-1β, and ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1. The        findings indicate that JGEO could inhibit the overactivation of microglia        characterized by decreasing the neuroinflammatory and oxidative stress responses        through the multi-compound and multi-target action modes, which support the        traditional use of JGEO in treating neuroinflammation-related disorders.",PMC10436289,Frontiers in pharmacology,101548923

However,        the anti-neuroinflammatory activity of TMP has been less studied and its        potential molecular mechanisms in this field remain unclear. This study aimed to        investigate the effects of TMP and its underlying mechanisms in        neuroinflammation. METHODS: In vitro, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated BV2        microglia were used to assess the effects of TMP on inflammatory cytokines as        well as the components of the SIRT1/NF-κB signaling pathway, which were measured        by using ELISA, western blotting, qRT-qPCR and immunofluorescence. Moreover,        LPS-induced acute neuroinflammation model in mice was performed to detect whether        TMP could exert anti-neuroinflammatory effects in vivo, and the EX527, a SIRT1        inhibitor, were given intraperitoneally every two days prior to TMP treatment.        Serums and spinal trigeminal nucleus (Sp5) tissues were collected for ELISA        assay, and the Sp5 tissues were used for HE staining, Nissl staining,        immunofluorescence, qRT-PCR and western blotting. RESULTS: In vitro, TMP        treatment significantly reduced the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines,        including TNF-α and IL-6, promoted SIRT1 protein expression and inactivated NF-κB        signaling pathway in LPS-induced neuroinflammation. Interestingly, pretreatment        with EX527 blocked the therapeutic effects of TMP on neuroinflammation in vitro.        Furthermore, TMP reduced the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines,        and prevented microglia from polarizing towards a pro-inflammatory state through        activating SIRT1 and inhibiting NF-κB activation in LPS-induced neuroinflammation        in mice.

Causes of inflammation in the neuronal cells are believed to initiate        various neurodegenerative disorders, mainly Alzheimer's disease. Levetiracetam is        a second-generation antiepileptic drug. There is evidence supporting the        memory-enhancing effect of levetiracetam from numerous experimental and clinical        studies. Therefore, this research focused on finding its protective effects        against lipopolysaccharides prompted cognitive impairment and exploring possible        mechanisms underlining their neuroprotection. METHODOLOGY: Two doses (100 or        200 mg/kg) of levetiracetam were administrated orally for 30 days. Additionally,        four doses (250 µg/kg) of lipopolysaccharide were injected peripherally to induce        neurotoxicity. Behavioral tests were carried out using various maze models. At        the end of the tests, brain tissues were collected for biochemical evaluations.        Cholinergic, neuroinflammatory, apoptosis, and oxidative-related parameters were        analyzed in the brain homogenate to explore the possible mechanisms of action of        levetiracetam. RESULTS: In lipopolysaccharide-induced rats, levetiracetam        indicated a reduction (p < 0.01) in transfer latency using the elevated        plus-maze. An improvement (p < 0.01) in novel and familiar objects exploration        time using novel object recognition test.

Immune        regulation by microglia plays a major role in the progression of aging and AD,        according to the functions of 41 intersecting differentially expressed genes in        microglia. Signaling crosstalk between C-C motif chemokine ligand (CCL) and major        histocompatibility complex-1 bridges intercellular communication in the        hippocampus during aging and AD.

Currently, there is no effective dementia treatment; early diagnosis        and treatment are particularly crucial. Inflammation index fibrinogen-to-albumin        ratio (FAR) has been shown to predict complications of type 2 diabetes (diabetic        kidney disease and diabetes-related arteriosclerosis), but its relationship with        mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in type 2 diabetes (T2D) is undetermined. In this        study, we examined the association between the FAR and mild cognitive impairment        in type 2 diabetes. METHODS: This is a retrospective and cross-sectional study.        From January 2022 to December 2022, we have retrieved 328 inpatient medical        records for T2D patients hospitalized at the First Hospital of Harbin Medical        University from the hospital's electronic system. Subjects' cognitive function        was assessed and grouped by the MoCA scales. Subjects' demographic and various        laboratory indicators were collected. Using Spearman's bivariate correlation        analysis, the FAR and other clinical variables were analyzed for association        strength. A multiple linear regression analysis was conducted to determine the        independent relationship between FAR and MoCA scores. Multivariate logistic        regression was used to analyze the independent relationship between FAR and MCI.        The capacity of the FAR to detect MCI was carried using receiver operating        characteristic (ROC) analysis. RESULTS: The included participants' (n = 328;        61.9% male) mean age was 52.62 ± 10.92 years. MoCA scores and MCI prevalence        significantly differed (p < 0.05) between the four subgroups of FAR quartiles.        The FAR and the MoCA score were significantly negatively correlated in the entire        population (p < 0.05). Based on the multiple linear regression analysis, lnFAR        and lnMoCA are significantly correlated (β = -0.449, t = -8.21, p < 0.05, R2 =        0.469). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, FAR and MCI were        independently correlated after adjusting for covariates (OR 95% CI 34.70        [13.90-86.66]). Finally, the analysis of receptor working characteristics shows        that the optimal FAR cut-off value was 0.08 (sensitivity: 95.81%, specificity:        84.47%) for detecting MCI in type 2 diabetes. CONCLUSION: In type 2 diabetes, the        FAR was positive associations with MCI and negative associations with MoCA score.        The high FAR was associated with an increased risk of MCI.

METHODS: An inflammatory stimulation model of        Alzheimer's disease (AD) was set up by activating microglia and neuroblastoma        with fibrosis β-amyloid (fAβ) in a transwell insert system. SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma        cells and BV2 microglial cells were irradiated with the 808- and 1,064-nm lasers,        respectively (a power density of 50 mW/cm(2) and a dose of 10 J/cm(2)) to study        the PBM activity. The amount of labeled fAβ phagocytosed by microglia was        considered to assess the microglial phagocytosis. A PBM-induced neuroprotective        study was conducted with the AD model under different laser parameters to realize        the optimal condition. Microglial phenotype, microglial secretions of the        pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory factors, and the intracellular Ca(2+)        levels in microglia were studied in detail to understand the structural and        functional changes occurring in the microglial cells of AD model upon PBM        treatment. CONCLUSION: A synergistic PBM effect (with the 808- and 1,064-nm        lasers) effectively inhibited the fAβ-induced neurotoxicity of neuroblastoma by        promoting the viability of neuroblastoma and regulating the intracellular Ca(2+)        levels of microglia. Moreover, the downregulation of Ca(2+) led to microglial        polarization with an M2 phenotype, which promotes the fAβ phagocytosis, and        resulted in the upregulated expression of anti-inflammatory factors and        downregulated expression of inflammatory factors.",PMC10406259,Frontiers in neuroimaging,9918402387106676

Autophagy plays an essential role in        neuroinflammatory processes, and the underlaying physiological mechanisms are        closely correlated with neuroinflammation-related signals. Inhibition of mTOR and        activation of AMPK and FOXO1 enhance autophagy and thereby suppress NLRP3        inflammasome activity and apoptosis, leading to the relief of neuroinflammatory        response. And autophagy mitigates neuroinflammation mainly manifested by        promoting the polarization of microglia from a pro-inflammatory to an        anti-inflammatory state, reducing the production of pro-inflammatory mediators,        and up-regulating the levels of anti-inflammatory factors. Notably, epigenetic        modifications are intimately associated with autophagy and the onset and        progression of various brain diseases. Non-coding RNAs, including microRNAs,        circular RNAs and long noncoding RNAs, and histone acetylation have been reported        to adjust autophagy-related gene and protein expression to alleviate inflammation        in neurological diseases.

Gut metabolites, a group of small molecules produced or        consumed by biochemical processes in the gut, are involved in central nervous        system regulation via the highly interconnected gut-brain axis affecting        microglia indirectly by influencing the structure of the gut-brain axis or        directly affecting microglia function and activity.

Astaxanthin (AST) is a natural        potent antioxidant with neuroprotective, anti-amyloidogenic, anti-apoptotic, and        anti-inflammatory effects. This study aimed to prepare nanostructured lipid        carriers (NLCs) co-loaded with donepezil and astaxanthin (DPL/AST-NLCs) and        evaluate their in vivo efficacy in an AD-like rat model 30 days after daily        intranasal administration. METHODS: DPL/AST-NLCs were prepared using a hot        high-shear homogenization technique, in vitro examined for their physicochemical        parameters and in vivo evaluated. AD induction in rats was performed by aluminum        chloride. The cortex and hippocampus were isolated from the brain of rats for        biochemical testing and histopathological examination. RESULTS: DPL/AST-NLCs        showed z-average diameter 149.9 ± 3.21 nm, polydispersity index 0.224 ± 0.017,        zeta potential -33.7 ± 4.71 mV, entrapment efficiency 81.25 ±1.98% (donepezil)        and 93.85 ±1.75% (astaxanthin), in vitro sustained release of both donepezil and        astaxanthin for 24 h, spherical morphology by transmission electron microscopy,        and they were stable at 4-8 ± 2°C for six months. Differential scanning        calorimetry revealed that donepezil and astaxanthin were molecularly dispersed in        the NLC matrix in an amorphous state. The DPL/AST-NLC-treated rats showed        significantly lower levels of nuclear factor-kappa B, malondialdehyde, β-site        amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme-1, caspase-3, amyloid beta (Aβ(1‑42)),        and acetylcholinesterase, and significantly higher levels of glutathione and        acetylcholine in the cortex and hippocampus than the AD-like untreated rats and        that treated with donepezil-NLCs.

In        neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, astrocytes can take on a        hypertrophic appearance. These reactive astrocytes are canonically associated        with increases in cytoskeletal proteins, such as glial fibrillary acidic protein        and vimentin. However, the molecular alterations that characterize astrocytes in        human disease tissues have not been extensively studied with single cell        resolution. Using single nucleus RNA sequencing data from normal, pathologic        aging, and Alzheimer's disease brains, we identified the transcriptomic changes        associated with reactive astrocytes. Deep learning-based clustering algorithms        denoised expression data for 17,012 genes and clustered 15,529 astrocyte nuclei,        identifying protoplasmic, gray matter and fibrous, white matter astrocyte        clusters. RNA trajectory analyses revealed a spectrum of reactivity within        protoplasmic astrocytes characterized by a modest increase of reactive genes and        a marked decrease in homeostatic genes. Amyloid but not tau pathology correlated        with astrocyte reactivity. To identify reactivity-associated genes, linear        regressions of gene expression versus reactivity were used to identify the top 52        upregulated and 144 downregulated genes.

Much evidence has accumulated        over the past decade to suggest that after the first large-scale genome-wide        association studies (GWAS) were conducted, the problem of ""missing heritability""        in AD is still a great challenge. Epistasis has been considered as one of the        main causes of ""missing heritability"" in AD, which has been largely ignored in        human genetics. The focus of current genome-wide epistasis studies is usually on        single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that have significant individual effects,        and the amount of heritability explained by which was very low. Moreover, AD is        characterized by progressive cognitive decline and neuronal damage, and some        studies have suggested that hyperphosphorylated tau (P-tau) mediates neuronal        death by inducing necroptosis and inflammation in AD. Therefore, this study        focused on identifying epistasis between two-marker interactions at marginal main        effects across the whole genome using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) P-tau as        quantitative trait (QT). We sought to detect interactions between SNPs in a        multi-GPU based linear regression method by using age, gender, and clinical        diagnostic status (cds) as covariates. We then used the STRING online tool to        perform the PPI network and identify two-marker epistasis at the level of        gene-gene interaction. A total of 758 SNP pairs were found to be statistically        significant. Particularly, between the marginal main effect SNP pairs, highly        significant SNP-SNP interactions were identified, which explained a relatively        high variance at the P-tau level. In addition, 331 AD-related genes were        identified, 10 gene-gene interaction pairs were replicated in the PPI network.        The identified gene-gene interactions and genes showed associations with AD in        terms of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, neuronal cells activation and        brain development, thereby leading to cognitive decline in AD, which is        indirectly associated with the P-tau pathological feature of AD and in turn        supports the results of this study. Thus, the results of our study might be        beneficial for explaining part of the ""missing heritability"" of AD.",PMC10379656,Genes,101551097

It was first described        by the two physicians from whom it took its name. Nowadays, we have extensively        expanded our knowledge about this disease. Starting from a merely clinical and        histopathologic description, we have now reached better molecular comprehension.        For instance, we passed from an old conceptualization of the disease based on        plaques and tangles to a more modern vision of mixed proteinopathy in a        one-to-one relationship with an alteration of specific glial and neuronal        phenotypes. However, no disease-modifying therapies are yet available. It is        likely that the only way to find a few ""magic bullets"" is to deepen this aspect        more and more until we are able to draw up specific molecular profiles for single        AD cases. This review reports the most recent classifications of AD atypical        variants in order to summarize all the clinical evidence using several discrimina        (for example, post mortem neurofibrillary tangle density, cerebral atrophy, or        FDG-PET studies). The better defined four atypical forms are posterior cortical        atrophy (PCA), logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia (LvPPA),        behavioral/dysexecutive variant and AD with corticobasal degeneration (CBS).        Moreover, we discuss the usefulness of such classifications before outlining the        molecular-genetic aspects focusing on microglial activity or, more generally,        immune system control of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration.",PMC10377159,Biomedicines,101691304

Notably, a        balanced gut microbiota contributes to the epithelial intestinal barrier        maintenance, modulates the host immune system, and releases neurotransmitters        and/or neuroprotective short-chain fatty acids. However, dysbiosis may provoke        immune dysregulation, impacting neuroinflammation through peripheral-central        immune communication. Moreover, lipopolysaccharide or detrimental microbial        end-products can cross the blood-brain barrier and induce or at least potentiate        the neuropathological progression of AD. Thus, after repeated failure to find a        cure for this dementia, a necessary paradigmatic shift towards considering AD as        a systemic disorder has occurred. Here, we present an overview of the use of        germ-free and/or transgenic animal models as valid tools to unravel the        connection between dysbiosis, metabolic diseases, and AD, and to investigate        novel therapeutical targets.

Most cases        of AD are considered idiopathic and likely due to a combination of genetic,        environmental, and lifestyle-related risk factors. Despite occurring decades        before the typical age of an AD diagnosis, early-life stress (ELS) has been        suggested to have long-lasting effects that may contribute to AD risk and        pathogenesis. Still, the mechanisms that underlie the role of ELS on AD risk        remain largely unknown. Here, we used 5xFAD transgenic mice to study relatively        short-term alterations related to ELS in an AD-like susceptible mouse model at 6        weeks of age. To model ELS, we separated pups from their dams for 3 h per day        from postnatal day 2-14. Around 6 weeks of age, we found that maternally        separated (MS) 5xFAD mice, particularly female mice, displayed increased        amyloid-β-immunoreactivity in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and basolateral        amygdala (BLA).

NDDs are multifactorial diseases with complex        pathogeneses, and there has been a rapid increase in the prevalence of NDDs.        However, none of these diseases can be cured, making the development of novel        treatment strategies an urgent necessity.

The bBI largely occurs due to pressure        waves, generation of heat together with release of shrapnel and gun powders        explosion with penetrating and/or impact head trauma causing multiple brain        damage. As a result, bBI-induced secondary injury causes breakdown of the        blood-brain barrier (BBB) and edema formation that further results in neuronal,        glial and axonal injuries. Previously, we reported endocrine imbalance and        influence of diabetes on bBI-induced brain pathology that was significantly        attenuated by nanowired delivery of cerebrolysin in model experiments.        Cerebrolysin is a balanced composition of several neurotrophic factors, and        active peptide fragment is capable of neuroprotection in several neurological        insults. Exposure to heat stress alone causes BBB damage, edema formation and        brain pathology. Thus, it is quite likely that hot environment further        exacerbates the consequences of bBI.

Nuclear acetyl-CoA pools are generated partially from        local acetate that is metabolized by acetyl-CoA synthetase 2 (ACSS2). However,        the underlying mechanism of histone acetylation dysregulation in AD remains        poorly understood. METHODS: We detected ACSS2 expression and histone acetylation        levels in the brains of AD patients and 5 × FAD mice. When we altered ACSS2        expression by injecting adeno-associated virus into the dorsal hippocampus of        5 × FAD mice and replenished ACSS2 substrate (acetate), we observed changes in        cognitive function by Morris water maze. We next performed RNA-seq, ChIP-qPCR,        and electrophysiology to study molecular mechanism underlying ACSS2-mediated        spatial learning and memory in 5 × FAD mice. RESULTS: We reported that ACSS2        expression and histone acetylation (H3K9, H4K12) were reduced in the hippocampus        and prefrontal cortex of 5 × FAD mice. Reduced ACSS2 levels were also observed in        the temporal cortex of AD patients. 5 × FAD mice exhibited a low enrichment of        acetylated histones on the promoters of NMDARs and AMPARs, together with impaired        basal and activity-dependent synaptic plasticity, all of which were rescued by        ACSS2 upregulation. Moreover, acetate replenishment enhanced ac-H3K9 and ac-H4K12        in 5 × FAD mice, leading to an increase of NMDARs and AMPARs and a restoration of        synaptic plasticity and cognitive function in an ACSS2-dependent manner.        CONCLUSION: ACSS2 is a key molecular switch of cognitive impairment and that        targeting ACSS2 or acetate administration may serve as a novel therapeutic        strategy for the treatment of intermediate or advanced AD. Nuclear acetyl-CoA        pools are generated partly from local acetate that is metabolized by acetyl-CoA        synthetase 2 (ACSS2).

In contrast, the influence of gut microbiota on the        blood-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) barrier has not yet been studied. Here, we report        that mice lacking gut microbiota display increased blood-CSF barrier permeability        associated with disorganized tight junctions (TJs), which can be rescued by        recolonization with gut microbiota or supplementation with short-chain fatty        acids (SCFAs). Our data reveal that gut microbiota is important not only for the        establishment but also for the maintenance of a tight barrier. Also, we report        that the vagus nerve plays an important role in this process and that SCFAs can        independently tighten the barrier. Administration of SCFAs in App(NL-G-F) mice        improved the subcellular localization of TJs at the blood-CSF barrier, reduced        the β-amyloid (Aβ) burden, and affected microglial phenotype.

However, recent        studies demonstrated a key role of neuroinflammation in the development of        neurological complications in this setting. Neuroinflammation is characterized by        activation of microglial cells and brain secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines,        such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-6, which alter        neurotransmission, leading to cognitive and motor dysfunction. Changes in the gut        microbiota resulting from liver disease play a crucial role in the pathogenesis        of neuroinflammation. Dysbiosis and altered intestinal permeability, resulting in        bacterial translocation and endotoxemia, are responsible for systemic        inflammation, which can spread to brain tissue and trigger neuroinflammation.

RESULTS: The p-tau 181 was elevated above cut-off values in both        possible pAE and AD. However, in definitive pAE, p-tau181 levels were not        elevated. When elevated p-tau181 levels in possible AE were compared with those        in AD, we found relevant differences, such as a relative increase in p-tau181 in        AD patients. Elevated p-tau181 levels were detected in possible psychiatric AEs        with IgLON5, glycine, recoverin, titin, and nonspecific neuropil antibodies in        serum and IgLON5, titin, Yo, and nonspecific neuropil autoantibodies in CSF.

The intricate pathogenesis        causes severe impairment of neurons, which, in turn, exacerbates Aβ aggregation        and facilitates AD progression. Herein, multifunctional melanin-like metal ion        chelators and neuroinflammation regulators (named PDA@K) were constructed for        targeted treatment of AD. In this platform, intrinsically bioactive material        polydopamine nanoparticles (PDA) with potent metal ion chelating and ROS        scavenging effects were decorated with the KLVFF peptide, endowing the system        with the capacity of enhanced pathological blood-brain barrier (BBB) crossing and        lesion site accumulation via Aβ hitchhiking.

The engineered PDA@K        effectively mitigated Aβ aggregate and alleviated neuroinflammation. The        modulated inflammatory microenvironment by PDA@K promoted microglial polarization        toward the M2-like phenotype, which restored their critical functions for neuron        care and plaque removal.

The most relevant mechanistic hypothesis to explain AD        symptoms is neurotoxicity induced by aggregated amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) and        misfolded tau protein. These molecular entities are seemingly insufficient to        explain AD as a multifactorial disease characterized by synaptic dysfunction,        cognitive decline, psychotic symptoms, chronic inflammatory environment within        the central nervous system (CNS), activated microglial cells, and dysfunctional        gut microbiota. The discovery that AD is a neuroinflammatory disease linked to        innate immunity phenomena started in the early nineties by several authors,        including the ICC´s group that described, in 2004, the role IL-6 in AD-type        phosphorylation of tau protein in deregulating the cdk5/p35 pathway. The ""Theory        of Neuroimmunomodulation"", published in 2008, proposed the onset and progression        of degenerative diseases as a multi-component ""damage signals"" phenomena,        suggesting the feasibility of ""multitarget"" therapies in AD. This theory explains        in detail the cascade of molecular events stemming from microglial disorder        through the overactivation of the Cdk5/p35 pathway. All these knowledge have led        to the rational search for inflammatory druggable targets against AD.

We examined whether plasma levels of        ALA and other PUFAs contributed to predicting survival time and functional        decline in patients with ALS. METHODS: We conducted a study among participants in        the EMPOWER clinical trial who had plasma samples collected at the time of        randomization that were available for fatty acid analyses.

In a transgenic RNAi screen using Drosophila as a model, we uncovered        that knockdown (KD) of Dsor1 (the Drosophila MAPK kinase dMEK) suppressed TDP-43        toxicity without altering TDP-43 phosphorylation or protein levels. Further        investigation revealed that the Dsor1 downstream gene rl (dERK) was abnormally        upregulated in TDP-43 flies, and neuronal overexpression of dERK induced profound        upregulation of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). We also detected a robust immune        overactivation in TDP-43 flies, which could be suppressed by downregulation of        the MEK/ERK pathway in TDP-43 fly neurons. Furthermore, neuronal KD of abnormally        increased AMPs improved the motor function of TDP-43 flies. On the other hand,        neuronal KD of Dnr1, a negative regulator of the Drosophila immune deficiency        (IMD) pathway, activated the innate immunity and boosted AMP expression        independent of the regulation by the MEK/ERK pathway, which diminished the        mitigating effect of RNAi-dMEK on TDP-43 toxicity.

METHODS: Three publicly available datasets from the Gene        Expression Omnibus (GEO) database containing peripheral blood gene expression        data for LOAD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and controls (CN) were        downloaded. Differential expression analysis, the least absolute shrinkage and        selection operator (LASSO), and support vector machine recursive feature        elimination (SVM-RFE) were used to identify LOAD diagnostic candidate genes.        These candidate genes were then validated in the validation group and clinical        samples, and a LOAD prediction model was established. RESULTS: LASSO and SVM-RFE        analyses identified 3 mitochondria-related genes (MRGs) as candidate genes,        including NDUFA1, NDUFS5, and NDUFB3. In the verification of 3 MRGs, the AUC        values showed that NDUFA1, NDUFS5 had better predictability. We also verified the        candidate MRGs in MCI groups, the AUC values showed good performance. We then        used NDUFA1, NDUFS5 and age to build a LOAD diagnostic model and AUC was 0.723.        Results of qRT-PCR experiments with clinical blood samples showed that the three        candidate genes were expressed significantly lower in the LOAD and MCI groups        when compared to CN. CONCLUSION: Two mitochondrial-related candidate genes,        NDUFA1 and NDUFS5, were identified as diagnostic markers for LOAD and MCI.        Combining these two candidate genes with age, a LOAD diagnostic prediction model        was successfully constructed.",PMC11091583,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863

OBJECTIVE: Our study focused on determining the        effect of betaine against amyloid-β42 oligomer (AβO)-induced inflammation in        microglial BV2 cells and investigating the underlying mechanism. METHODS: AβO was        used to establish an in vitro AD model using BV2 cells. A        3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide assay was used        to measure BV2 cell viability with different concentrations of AβO and betaine.        Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent        assays were used to determine the expression levels of inflammatory factors, such        as interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-18 (IL-18), and tumor necrosis factor α        (TNF-α). Western blotting was used to evaluate the activation of the NOD-like        receptor pyrin domain containing-3 (NLRP3) inflammasome and nuclear transcription        factor-κB p65 (NF-κB p65). Moreover, we used phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate        (PMA) to activate NF-κB in order to validate that betaine exerted        anti-neuroinflammatory effects through regulation of the NF-κB/NLRP3 signaling        pathway. RESULTS: We used 2 mM betaine to treat 5μM AβO-induced microglial        inflammation.

Amyloid-β (Aβ) is thought to        have an association with microglia activation and trigger neuroinflammation in        AD. However, inflammation response in brain disorders is heterogenous, and thus,        it is necessary to unveil the specific gene module of neuroinflammation caused by        Aβ in AD, which might provide novel biomarkers for AD diagnosis and help        understand the mechanism of the disease. METHODS: Transcriptomic datasets of        brain region tissues from AD patients and the corresponding normal tissues were        first used to identify gene modules through the weighted gene co-expression        network analysis (WGCNA) method. Then, key modules highly associated with Aβ        accumulation and neuroinflammatory response were pinpointed by combining module        expression score and functional information. Meanwhile, the relationship of the        Aβ-associated module to the neuron and microglia was explored based on snRNA-seq        data. Afterward, transcription factor (TF) enrichment and the SCENIC analysis        were performed on the Aβ-associated module to discover the related upstream        regulators, and then a PPI network proximity method was employed to repurpose the        potential approved drugs for AD. RESULTS: A total of 16 co-expression modules        were primarily obtained by the WGCNA method. Among them, the green module was        significantly correlated with Aβ accumulation, and its function was mainly        involved in neuroinflammation response and neuron death. Thus, the module was        termed the amyloid-β induced neuroinflammation module (AIM). Moreover, the module        was negatively correlated with neuron percentage and showed a close association        with inflammatory microglia. Finally, based on the module, several important TFs        were recognized as potential diagnostic biomarkers for AD, and then 20 possible        drugs including ibrutinib and ponatinib were picked out for the disease.        CONCLUSION: In this study, a specific gene module, termed AIM, was identified as        a key sub-network of Aβ accumulation and neuroinflammation in AD. Moreover, the        module was verified as having an association with neuron degeneration and        inflammatory microglia transformation. Moreover, some promising TFs and potential        repurposing drugs were presented for AD based on the module.

ABCG4 is a member of the ATP-binding cassette        transporters predominantly expressed in the CNS, and has been suggested to play a        role in cholesterol and Aß efflux from the brain. In this study, we bred Abcg4        knockout (KO) with the APP(Swe,Ind) (J9) mouse model of AD to test the hypothesis        that loss of Abcg4 would exacerbate the AD phenotype.

Using a knockin mouse line in which a Td-tomato reporter is        incorporated into the endogenous C3ar1 locus, we identified 2 major        subpopulations of microglia with differential C3aR expression. Expressing the        Td-tomato reporter on the APPNL-G-F-knockin (APP-KI) background revealed a        significant shift of microglia to a high-C3aR-expressing subpopulation and they        were enriched around amyloid β (Aβ) plaques. Transcriptomic analysis of        C3aR-positive microglia documented dysfunctional metabolic signatures, including        upregulation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) signaling and abnormal lipid        metabolism in APP-KI mice compared with wild-type controls.

Microglia are involved in forming        barriers around extracellular neuritic plaques and the phagocytosis of β-amyloid        peptide (Aβ). In this study, we tested the hypothesis that periodontal disease        (PD) as a source of infection alters inflammatory activation and Aβ phagocytosis        by the microglial cells. METHODS: Experimental PD was induced using ligatures in        C57BL/6 mice for 1, 10, 20, and 30 days to assess the progression of PD. Animals        without ligatures were used as controls. Maxillary bone loss and local        periodontal tissue inflammation associated with the development of PD were        confirmed by morphometric bone analysis and cytokine expression, respectively.        The frequency and the total number of activated microglia (CD45(+) CD11b(+)        MHCII(+)) in the brain were analyzed by flow cytometry. Mouse microglial cells        (1 × 10(5)) were incubated with heat-inactivated bacterial biofilm isolated from        the ligatures retrieved from the teeth or with Klebsiella variicola, a relevant        PD-associated bacteria in mice. Expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines,        toll-like receptors (TLR), and receptors for phagocytosis was measured by        quantitative PCR. The phagocytic capacity of microglia to uptake β-amyloid was        analyzed by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Ligature placement caused progressive        periodontal disease and bone resorption that was already significant on day 1        post-ligation (p < 0.05) and continued to increase until day 30 (p < 0.0001). The        severity of periodontal disease increased the frequency of activated microglia in        the brains on day 30 by 36%. In parallel, heat-inactivated PD-associated total        bacteria and Klebsiella variicola increased the expression of TNFα, IL-1β, IL-6,        TLR2, and TLR9 in microglial cells (1.6-, 83-, 3.2-, 1.5-, 1.5-fold, respectively        p < 0.01).

However, no PET radiotracers for GFAP        are currently available. Therefore, neuroimaging with antibody-like affinity        proteins could be a viable strategy for visualizing imaging targets that small        molecules rarely recognize, such as GFAP, while we need to overcome the        challenges of slow clearance and low brain permeability.

In mouse models of Alzheimer's disease,        ethanol intoxication and fear stress, the phlorotannin monomer phloroglucinol and        the compounds eckol, dieckol and phlorofucofuroeckol A have been shown to improve        cognitive function.

All        current therapies require an accurate diagnosis and staging of AD to ensure        appropriate care. Central auditory processing disorders (CAPDs) and hearing loss        have been associated with AD, and may precede the onset of Alzheimer's dementia.        Therefore, CAPD is a possible biomarker candidate for AD diagnosis. However,        little is known about how CAPD and AD pathological changes are correlated. In the        present study, we investigated auditory changes in AD using transgenic        amyloidosis mouse models. AD mouse models were bred to a mouse strain commonly        used for auditory experiments, to compensate for the recessive accelerated        hearing loss on the parent background. Auditory brainstem response (ABR)        recordings revealed significant hearing loss, a reduced ABR wave I amplitude, and        increased central gain in 5xFAD mice. In comparison, these effects were milder or        reversed in APP/PS1 mice. Longitudinal analyses revealed that in 5xFAD mice,        central gain increase preceded ABR wave I amplitude reduction and hearing loss,        suggesting that it may originate from lesions in the central nervous system        rather than the peripheral loss. Pharmacologically facilitating cholinergic        signaling with donepezil reversed the central gain in 5xFAD mice. After the        central gain increased, aging 5xFAD mice developed deficits for hearing sound        pips in the presence of noise, consistent with CAPD-like symptoms of AD patients.        Histological analysis revealed that amyloid plaques were deposited in the        auditory cortex of both mouse strains. However, in 5xFAD but not APP/PS1 mice,        plaque was observed in the upper auditory brainstem, specifically the inferior        colliculus (IC) and the medial geniculate body (MGB). This plaque distribution        parallels histological findings from human subjects with AD and correlates in age        with central gain increase. Overall, we conclude that auditory alterations in        amyloidosis mouse models correlate with amyloid deposits in the auditory        brainstem and may be reversed initially through enhanced cholinergic signaling.        The alteration of ABR recording related to the increase in central gain prior to        AD-related hearing disorders suggests that it could potentially be used as an        early biomarker of AD diagnosis.",PMC10250613,Frontiers in neuroscience,101478481

Epidemiological evidence suggests that        heavy alcohol consumption aggravates AD pathology, whereas low alcohol intake may        be protective. However, these observations have been inconsistent, and because of        methodological discrepancies, the findings remain controversial. Alcohol-feeding        studies in AD mice support the notion that high alcohol intake promotes AD, while        also hinting that low alcohol doses may be protective against AD. Chronic alcohol        feeding to AD mice that delivers alcohol doses sufficient to cause liver injury        largely promotes and accelerates AD pathology. The mechanisms by which alcohol        can modulate cerebral AD pathology include Toll-like receptors, protein kinase-B        (Akt)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, cyclic adenosine        monophosphate (cAMP) response element-binding protein phosphorylation pathway,        glycogen synthase kinase 3-β, cyclin-dependent kinase-5, insulin-like growth        factor type-1 receptor, modulation of β-amyloid (Aβ) synthesis and clearance,        microglial mediated, and brain endothelial alterations. Besides these        brain-centric pathways, alcohol-mediated liver injury may significantly affect        brain Aβ levels through alterations in the peripheral-to-central Aβ homeostasis.        This article reviews published experimental studies (cell culture and AD rodent        models) to summarize the scientific evidence and probable mechanisms (both        cerebral and hepatic) by which alcohol promotes or protects against AD        progression.",PMC10253673,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791

Increasing evidence has demonstrated that physical therapy and        electroacupuncture (EA) effectively improve spatial learning and memory        abilities. Nevertheless, the mechanism underlying the effects of EA on AD        pathology is largely unexplored. Acupuncture at Zusanli (ST 36) has previously        been shown to improve cognitive impairment in AD, but the mechanism is unclear.        According to recent studies, EA drives the vagal-adrenal axis from the hindlimb        ST 36 acupoint but not from the abdominal Tianshu (ST 25) to curb severe        inflammation in mice. This study examined whether ST 36 acupuncture improves        cognitive dysfunction in AD model mice by improving neuroinflammation and its        underlying mechanism. METHODS: Male 5xFAD mice (aged 3, 6, and 9 months) were        used as the AD animal model and were randomly divided into three groups: the AD        model group (AD group), the electroacupuncture at ST 36 acupoint group (EA-ST 36        group), and the electroacupuncture at ST 25 acupoint group (EA-ST 25 group).        Age-matched wild-type mice were used as the normal control (WT) group. EA (10 Hz,        0.5 mA) was applied to the acupoints on both sides for 15 min, 5 times per week        for 4 weeks. Motor ability and cognitive ability were assessed by the open field        test, the novel object recognition task, and the Morris water maze test.        Thioflavin S staining and immunofluorescence were used to mark Aβ plaques and        microglia. The levels of NLRP3, caspase-1, ASC, interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-18 in        the hippocampus were assayed by Western blotting or qRT-PCR. RESULTS: EA at ST        36, but not ST 25, significantly improved motor function and cognitive ability        and reduced both Aβ deposition and microglia and NLRP3 inflammasome activation in        5×FAD mice. CONCLUSION: EA stimulation at ST 36 effectively improved memory        impairment in 5×FAD mice by a mechanism that regulated microglia activation and        alleviated neuroinflammation by inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammatory response in the        hippocampus.

We aim to determine        the chemokines which are significantly altered in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and        mild cognitive impairment (MCI), as well as the respective effect sizes, by        performing a meta-analysis of chemokines in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood        (plasma or serum). METHODS: We searched three databases (Pubmed, EMBASE and        Cochrane library) for studies regarding chemokines. The three pairwise        comparisons were as follows: AD vs HC, MCI vs healthy controls (HC), and AD vs        MCI. The fold-change was calculated using the ratio of mean (RoM) chemokine        concentration for every study. Subgroup analyses were performed for exploring the        source of heterogeneity. RESULTS: Of 2338 records identified from the databases,        61 articles comprising a total of 3937 patients with AD, 1459 with MCI, and 4434        healthy controls were included. The following chemokines were strongly associated        with AD compared with HC: blood CXCL10 (RoM, 1.92, p = 0.039), blood CXCL9 (RoM,        1.78, p < 0.001), blood CCL27 (RoM, 1.34, p < 0.001), blood CCL15 (RoM, 1.29,        p = 0.003), as well as CSF CCL2 (RoM, 1.19, p < 0.001). In the comparison of AD        with MCI, there was significance for blood CXCL9 (RoM, 2.29, p < 0.001), blood        CX3CL1 (RoM, 0.77, p = 0.017), and blood CCL1 (RoM, 1.37, p < 0.001).

METHODS: In this study, we used an        APP/PS1 AD mouse model to explore the function and mechanisms underlying        savatiside A (SA) and torenoside B (TB) in the treatment of AD. SA or TB (100        mg·kg-1·d-1) was orally administered to 7-month-old APP/PS1 mice for 4 weeks.        Cognitive and memory functions were measured using behavioral experiments        (including the Morris water maze test and the Y-maze spontaneous alternation        test). Molecular biology experiments (including Western blotting,        immunofluorescence, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays) were used to detect        any corresponding changes in signaling pathways. RESULTS: The results showed that        SA or TB treatment could significantly reduce cognitive impairment in APP/PS1        mice. We also showed that chronic treatment with SA/TB could prevent spine loss,        synaptophysin immunoreactivity, and neuronal loss in mice, thereby improving        synaptic plasticity and moderating learning and memory deficits. SA/TB        administration also promoted the expression of synaptic proteins in APP/PS1 mouse        brains and upregulated phosphorylation of proteins in the cyclic adenosine        monophosphate (cAMP)/CREB/brain-derived neurotrophic growth factor (BDNF) pathway        that are responsible for synaptic plasticity. Additionally, chronic SA/TB        treatment increased the levels of BDNF and nerve growth factor (NGF) in the        brains of APP/PS1 mice. Both astrocyte and microglia volumes, as well as the        generation of amyloid β, were also decreased in SA/TB-treated APP/PS1 mice        compared to control APP/PS1 mice. CONCLUSION: In summary, SA/TB treatment was        associated with activation of the cAMP/CREB/BDNF pathway and increased BDNF and        NGF expression, indicating that SA/TB improves cognitive functioning via nerve        regeneration.

Besides the personal, social, and economical        costs, late stages of AD are vivid experiences for the family, relatives,        friends, and general observers of the progressive ruin of an individual who turns        into a being with lower mental and physical capacities than less evolved species.        A human brain with healthy cognition, conscience, and emotions can succeed in        dealing with most difficulties that life may pose. Without these capacities, the        same person probably cannot. Due, in part, to this emotional impact, the        absorbing study of AD has generated, over the years, a fascinating and complex        story of theories, hypotheses, controversies, fashion swings, and passionate        clashes, together with tremendous efforts and achievements geared to improve        understanding of the pathogenesis and treatment of the disorder. Familal AD is        rare and linked to altered genetic information associated with three genes.        Sporadic AD (sAD) is much more common and multifactorial. A major point of        clinical discussion has been, and still is, establishing the differences between        brain aging and sAD. This is not a trivial question, as the neuropathological and        molecular characteristics of normal brain aging and the first appearance of early        stages of sAD-related pathology are not easily distinguishable in most        individuals. Another important point is confidence in assigning responsibility        for the beginning of sAD to a few triggering molecules, without considering the        wide number of alterations that converge in the pathogenesis of aging and sAD.        Genetic risk factors covering multiple molecular signals are increasing in        number. In the same line, molecular pathways are altered at early stages of sAD        pathology, currently grouped under the aegis of normal brain aging, only to        increase massively at advanced stages of the process. Sporadic AD is here        considered an inherent, natural part of human brain aging, which is prevalent in        all humans, and variably present or not in a few individuals in other species.        The progression of the process has devastating effects in a relatively low        percentage of human beings eventually evolving to dementia.

Xiaoxuming decoction (XXMD) is the first        prescription for the treatment of ""zhongfeng"" (a broad concept referring to        stroke) in the Tang and Song Dynasties of China and has a significant position in        the history of stroke treatment. Through the study of ancient medical records and        modern clinical evidence, it is evident that XXMD has significant efficacy in the        treatment of stroke and its sequelae, and its pharmacological mechanism may be        related to post-stroke inflammation. However, XXMD contains 12 medicinal herbs        with complex composition, and therefore, a simplified version of XXMD, called        Xiaoxuming decoction cutting (XXMD-C), was derived based on the anti-inflammatory        effects of the individual herbs. Therefore, it is necessary to explore and        confirm the anti-inflammatory mechanism of XXMD-C. Aim of the study: Based on the        previous experiments of our research group, it was found that both XXMD and        XXMD-C have anti-inflammatory effects on LPS-induced microglia, and XXMD-C has a        better anti-inflammatory effect. Since miRNAs in exosomes also participate in the        occurrence and development of cardiovascular diseases, and traditional Chinese        medicine can regulate exosomal miRNAs through intervention, this study aims to        explore the anti-inflammatory mechanism of XXMD-C in the treatment of post-stroke        inflammation through transcriptome sequencing, providing a basis for the        application of XXMD-C. Materials and methods: XXMD-C was extracted using water        and filtered through a 0.22 μm membrane filter. The main chemical components of        the medicinal herbs in XXMD-C were rapidly qualitatively analyzed using        ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass        spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS). Cell viability was determined using the CCK-8        assay, and an LPS-induced BV-2 cell inflammation model was established. The        expression of inflammatory cytokines was detected using ELISA and Western blot        (WB). Extracellular vesicles were extracted using ultracentrifugation, and        identified using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), nanoparticle tracking        analysis, and WB. Differential miRNAs were screened using smallRNA-seq        sequencing, and validated using RT-PCR and Western blot. Results: The        UPLC-Q-TOF-MS analysis revealed that representative components including        ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, cinnamaldehyde, baicalin, baicalein, wogonin, and        ginsenoside Rg1 were detected in XXMD-C. The results of ELISA and WB assays        showed that XXMD-C had a therapeutic effect on LPS-induced inflammation in BV-2        cells. TEM, nanoparticle tracking analysis, and WB results demonstrated the        successful extraction of extracellular vesicles using high-speed centrifugation.        Differential miRNA analysis by smallRNA-seq identified miR-9-5p, which was        validated by RT-PCR and WB.

However, despite their expected potential to prevent, delay, or treat        neurodegenerative diseases, antioxidant compounds may have difficulty reaching        the brain due to the need to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB).

Herein, we apply extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted by        M2 microglia to improve the differentiation of neural stem cells (NSCs) at the        injured site, and simultaneously modify them with the injured vascular targeting        peptide (DA7R) and the stem cell recruiting factor (SDF-1) on their surface via        copper-free click chemistry to recruit NSCs, inducing their neuronal        differentiation, and serving as the nanocarriers at the injured site (Dual-EV).        Results prove that the Dual-EV could target human umbilical vascular endothelial        cells (HUVECs), recruit NSCs, and promote the neuronal differentiation of NSCs        in vitro. Furthermore, 10 miRNAs are found to be upregulated in Dual-M2-EVs        compared to Dual-M0-EVs via bioinformatic analysis, and further NSC        differentiation experiment by flow cytometry reveals that among these miRNAs,        miR30b-3p, miR-222-3p, miR-129-5p, and miR-155-5p may exert effect of inducing        NSC to differentiate into neurons. In vivo experiments show that Dual-EV        nanocarriers achieve improved accumulation in the ischemic area of stroke model        mice, potentiate NSCs recruitment, and increase neurogenesis.

This creates a significant social and economic burden.        Although the exact cause and treatment methods for these diseases are not yet        known, research suggests that Alzheimer's disease is caused by amyloid precursor        protein, while α-synuclein acts as a causative agent in Parkinson's disease. The        accumulation of abnormal proteins such as these can lead to symptoms such as loss        of protein homeostasis, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neuroinflammation, which        ultimately result in the death of nerve cells and the progression of        neurodegenerative diseases. The medications currently available for these        diseases only delay their progression and have many adverse effects, which has        led to increased interest in developing natural products with fewer adverse        effects. In this study, we selected specific keywords and thesis content to        investigate natural products that are effective in treating Alzheimer's and        Parkinson's diseases. We reviewed 16 papers on natural products and found that        they showed promising mechanisms of action such as antioxidant,        anti-inflammatory, and mitochondrial function improvement.

In this        context, components of the endocannabinoid (eCB) system have been shown to shift        microglia towards an anti-inflammatory activation state. Instead, much less is        known about the functional role of the sphingosine kinase        (SphK)/sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) system in microglia biology. In the present        study, we addressed potential crosstalk of the eCB and the S1P systems in BV2        mouse microglia cells challenged with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We show that        URB597, the selective inhibitor of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH)-the main        degradative enzyme of the eCB anandamide-prevented LPS-induced production of        tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and caused the        accumulation of anandamide itself and eCB-like molecules such as oleic acid and        cis-vaccenic acid ethanolamide, palmitoylethanolamide, and docosahexaenoyl        ethanolamide. Furthermore, treatment with JWH133, a selective agonist of the        eCB-binding cannabinoid 2 (CB(2)) receptor, mimicked the anti-inflammatory        effects of URB597. Interestingly, LPS induced transcription of both SphK1 and        SphK2, and the selective inhibitors of SphK1 (SLP7111228) and SphK2 (SLM6031434)        strongly reduced LPS-induced TNFα and IL-1β production. Thus, the two SphKs were        pro-inflammatory in BV2 cells in a non-redundant manner. Most importantly, the        inhibition of FAAH by URB597, as well as the activation of CB(2) by JWH133,        prevented LPS-stimulated transcription of SphK1 and SphK2. These results present        SphK1 and SphK2 at the intersection of pro-inflammatory LPS and anti-inflammatory        eCB signaling, and suggest the further development of inhibitors of FAAH or SphKs        for the treatment of neuroinflammatory diseases.",PMC10217805,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791

These actions, in large part, are mediated by IMiD binding to the human        protein cereblon that forms a critical component of the E3 ubiquitin ligase        complex. This complex ubiquitinates and thereby regulates the levels of multiple        endogenous proteins. However, IMiD-cereblon binding modifies cereblon's normal        targeted protein degradation towards a new set of neosubstrates that underlies        the favorable pharmacological action of classical IMiDs, but also their adverse        actions-in particular, their teratogenicity. The ability of classical IMiDs to        reduce the synthesis of key proinflammatory cytokines, especially TNF-α levels,        makes them potentially valuable to reposition as drugs to mitigate        inflammatory-associated conditions and, particularly, neurological disorders        driven by an excessive neuroinflammatory element, as occurs in traumatic brain        injury, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, and ischemic stroke. The        teratogenic and anticancer actions of classical IMiDs are substantial liabilities        for effective drugs in these disorders and can theoretically be dialed out of the        drug class. We review a select series of novel IMiDs designed to avoid binding        with human cereblon and/or evade degradation of downstream neosubstrates        considered to underpin the adverse actions of thalidomide-like drugs.

According to the current understanding of molecular        pathogenesis, the main hallmarks of this disease are the abnormal accumulation of        amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Therefore, biomarkers reflecting        these underlying biological mechanisms are recognized as valid tools for an early        diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. Inflammatory mechanisms, such as microglial        activation, are known to be involved in Alzheimer's disease onset and        progression. This activated state of the microglia is associated with increased        expression of the translocator protein 18 kDa. On that account, PET tracers        capable of measuring this signature, such as (R)-[(11)C]PK11195, might be        instrumental in assessing the state and evolution of Alzheimer's disease. This        study aims to investigate the potential of Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix-based        textural parameters as an alternative to conventional quantification using        kinetic models in (R)-[(11)C]PK11195 PET images. To achieve this goal, kinetic        and textural parameters were computed on (R)-[(11)C]PK11195 PET images of 19        patients with an early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and 21 healthy controls        and submitted separately to classification using a linear support vector machine.        The classifier built using the textural parameters showed no inferior performance        compared to the classical kinetic approach, yielding a slightly larger        classification accuracy (accuracy of 0.7000, sensitivity of 0.6957, specificity        of 0.7059 and balanced accuracy of 0.6967). In conclusion, our results support        the notion that textural parameters may be an alternative to conventional        quantification using kinetic models in (R)-[(11)C]PK11195 PET images. The        proposed quantification method makes it possible to use simpler scanning        procedures, which increase patient comfort and convenience.

BBB, mainly composed of glial and endothelial        cells (ECs), is the protective structure that orchestrates the transport of        substances, including ions, molecules, and cells from brain vessels into or out        of the CNS. Then, we display the multiple communication between glial and        vascular function based on angiogenesis, vascular wrapping, and blood perfusion        in the brain. Glial can support microvascular ECs to form a blood network        connecting to neurons. Astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes are the common        types of glial surrounding the brain vessel. Glial-vessel interaction is required        for the permeability and integrity of BBB. Glial cells surrounding the cerebral        blood vessels can transmit communication signals to ECs and regulate the activity        of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or Wnt-dependent endothelial        angiogenesis mechanism. In addition, these glial cells monitor the blood flow in        the brain via Ca(2+)/K(+)-dependent pathways. Finally, we provide a potential        research direction for the glial-vessel axis in CNS disorders. Microglial        activation can trigger astrocyte activation, which suggests that        microglia-astrocyte interaction may play a key role in monitoring cerebral blood        flow.

AD is under        substantial genetic influence, thus identifying systematic variation in genetic        risk may provide insights into disease origins. OBJECTIVE: We investigated        genetic heterogeneity in AD risk through a multi-step analysis. METHODS: We        performed principal component analysis (PCA) on AD-associated variants in the UK        Biobank (AD cases=2,739, controls=5,478) to assess structured genetic        heterogeneity. Subsequently, a biclustering algorithm searched for distinct        disease-specific genetic signatures among subsets of cases. Replication tests        were conducted using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)        dataset (AD cases=500, controls=470). We categorized a separate set of ADNI        individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI; n=399) into genetic subtypes and        examined cognitive, amyloid, and tau trajectories. RESULTS: PCA revealed three        distinct clusters (""constellations"") driven primarily by different correlation        patterns in a region of strong LD surrounding the MAPT locus. Constellations        contained a mixture of cases and controls, reflecting disease-relevant but not        disease-specific structure.

CONCLUSIONS: This study unveils a hierarchical structure of AD        genetic risk. Disease-relevant constellations may represent haplotype structure        that does not increase risk directly but may alter the relative importance of        other genetic risk factors. Biclusters may represent distinct AD genetic        subtypes.

Moreover, pharmacological blockade of TREM1 with LP17 in db/db mice        and HFD/STZ mice inhibited accumulation of LDs and TREM1, reduced hippocampal        neuronal inflammatory damage, and consequently improved cognitive functions.        Taken together, these findings uncover a previously unappreciated mechanism of        impaired lipophagy-induced TREM1 accumulation in microglia and neuroinflammation        in DACI, suggesting its translational potential as an attractive therapeutic        target for delaying diabetes-associated cognitive decline.Abbreviations: ACTB:        beta actin; AIF1/IBA1: allograft inflammatory factor 1; ALB: albumin; ARG1:        arginase 1; ATG3: autophagy related 3; Baf: bafilomycin A(1); BECN1: beclin 1,        autophagy related; BW: body weight; CNS: central nervous system; Co-IP:        co-immunoprecipitation; DACI: diabetes-associated cognitive impairment; DAPI:        4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; DGs: dentate gyrus; DLG4/PSD95: discs large MAGUK        scaffold protein 4; DMEM: Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; DSST: digit symbol        substitution test; EDTA: ethylenedinitrilotetraacetic acid; ELISA: enzyme linked        immunosorbent assay; GFAP: glial fibrillary acidic protein; HFD: high-fat diet;        HG: high glucose; IFNG/IFN-γ: interferon gamma; IL1B/IL-1β: interleukin 1 beta;        IL4: interleukin 4; IL6: interleukin 6; IL10: interleukin 10; LDs: lipid        droplets; LPS: lipopolysaccharide; MAP2: microtubule associated protein 2;        MAP1LC3B/LC3B: microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta; MWM: morris        water maze; NFKB/NF-κB: nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer        in B cells; NLRP3: NLR family pyrin domain containing 3; NOS2/iNOS: nitric oxide        synthase 2, inducible; NOR: novel object recognition; OA: oleic acid; PA:        palmitic acid; PBS: phosphate-buffered saline; PFA: paraformaldehyde; PLIN2:        perilipin 2; PLIN3: perilipin 3; PS: penicillin-streptomycin solution; RAPA:        rapamycin; RBFOX3/NeuN: RNA binding protein, fox-1 homolog (C. elegans) 3;        RELA/p65: RELA proto-oncogene, NF-kB subunit; ROS: reactive oxygen species; RT:        room temperature; RT-qPCR: Reverse transcription quantitative real-time        polymerase chain reaction; STZ: streptozotocin; SQSTM1/p62: sequestosome 1; SYK:        spleen asociated tyrosine kinase; SYP: synaptophysin; T2DM: type 2 diabetes        mellitus; TNF/TNF-α: tumor necrosis factor; TREM1: triggering receptor expressed        on myeloid cells 1; TUNEL: terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated        dUTP-biotin nick end labeling.",PMC10472854,Autophagy,101265188

The mechanisms by which TBI increases the risk of developing        aging-related neurodegenerative disease, however, are not completely understood.        As a result, there are no protective treatments for patients. Here, we review the        current literature surrounding the epidemiology and potential mechanistic        relationships between brain injury and aging-related neurodegenerative disease.        In addition to increasing the risk for developing all forms of dementia, the most        prominent aging-related neurodegenerative conditions that are accelerated by TBI        are amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal dementia (FTD),        Parkinson's disease (PD), and Alzheimer's disease (AD), with ALS and FTD being        the least well-established. Mechanistic links between TBI and all forms of        dementia that are reviewed include oxidative stress, dysregulated proteostasis,        and neuroinflammation. Disease-specific mechanistic links with TBI that are        reviewed include TAR DNA binding protein 43 and motor cortex lesions in ALS and        FTD; alpha-synuclein, dopaminergic cell death, and synergistic toxin exposure in        PD; and brain insulin resistance, amyloid beta pathology, and tau pathology in        AD.

Inhibiting the        inflammatory activation of microglia is a therapeutic approach to        neuroinflammation. In this study, we report that activation of the Wnt/β-catenin        signaling pathway in a model of neuroinflammation in Lipopolysaccharide        (LPS)/IFN-γ-stimulated BV-2 cells can result in inhibition of production of        nitric oxide (NO), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α).        Activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway also results in inhibition of        the phosphorylation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and extracellular        signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in the LPS/IFN-γ-stimulated BV-2 cells. These        findings indicate that activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway can        inhibit neuroinflammation through downregulating the pro-inflammatory cytokines        including iNOS, TNF-α, and IL-6, and suppress NF-κB/ERK-related signaling        pathways.

To understand the reasoning behind this, we        investigated how OA and APOE-ε4 influence the accumulation of β-amyloid (Aβ) and        tau accumulation in primary motor and somatosensory regions in Aβ-positive (Aβ+)        older individuals. METHODS: We selected Aβ+ Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging        Initiative participants, defined by baseline (18)F-florbetapir (FBP) Aβ PET        standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) of AD summary cortical regions, who had        longitudinal Aβ PET, the records of OA medical history, and APOE-ε4 genotyping.        We examined how OA and APOE-ε4 relate to baseline and longitudinal Aβ        accumulation and tau deposition measured at follow-up in precentral and        postcentral cortical areas and how they modulate Aβ-associated future higher tau        levels, adjusting for age, sex, and diagnosis and using multiple comparison        corrections. RESULTS: A total of 374 individuals (mean age 75 years, 49.2%        female, 62.8% APOE-ε4 carriers) who underwent longitudinal FBP PET with a median        follow-up of 3.3 years (interquartile range [IQR] 3.4, range 1.6-9.4) were        analyzed, and 96 people had (18)F-flortaucipir (FTP) tau PET measured at a median        of 5.4 (IQR 1.9, range 4.0-9.3) years postbaseline FBP PET. Neither OA nor        APOE-ε4 was related to baseline FBP SUVR in precentral and postcentral regions.        At follow-up, OA rather than APOE-ε4 was associated with faster Aβ accumulation        in postcentral region (β = 0.005, 95% CI 0.001-0.008) over time. In addition, OA        but not the APOE-ε4 allele was strongly linked to higher follow-up FTP tau levels        in precentral (β = 0.098, 95% CI 0.034-0.162) and postcentral (β = 0.105, 95% CI        0.040-0.169) cortices.

All primary factors responsible for pathological tau        hyperphosphorylation are inherent to adult neurogenesis and migration. However,        when amyloid pathology is present, it strongly amplifies tau pathogenesis.        Indeed, the progressive accumulation of extracellular amyloid-β deposits in the        brain triggers a state of chronic inflammation by microglia. Microglial        activation has a significant pro-neurogenic effect that fosters the process of        adult neurogenesis and supports neuronal migration. Unfortunately, this        ""reactive"" pro-neurogenic activity ultimately perturbs homeostatic equilibrium in        the niches of adult neurogenesis by amplifying tau pathogenesis in AD. This        scenario involves NSCs in the subgranular zone of the hippocampal dentate gyrus        in late-onset AD (LOAD) and NSCs in the ventricular-subventricular zone along the        lateral ventricles in early-onset AD (EOAD), including familial AD (FAD).        Neuroblasts carrying the initial seed of tau pathology travel throughout the        brain via neuronal migration driven by complex signals and convey the disease        from the niches of adult neurogenesis to near (LOAD) or distant (EOAD) brain        regions.

METHODS: The complete data of 2,226 participants aged 60-80 years        were extracted from the 2011-2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination        Survey database. Cognitive abilities were assessed using a composite cognitive        functioning score (Z-score) calculated using a correlation test among the        Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease Word Learning and        Delayed Recall tests, Animal Fluency Test, and the Digit Symbol Substitution        Test. Thirteen demographic characteristics and risk factors associated with        cognitive impairment were considered: age, sex, race, body mass index (BMI),        drink, smoke, direct HDL-cholesterol level, stroke history, dietary inflammatory        index (DII), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9)        score, sleep duration, and albumin level. Feature selection is performed using        the Boruta algorithm. Model building is performed using ten-fold        cross-validation, machine learning (ML) algorithms such as generalized linear        model (GLM), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural        network (ANN), and stochastic gradient boosting (SGB).

Despite several hypotheses, such as        neuroinflammation, tau hyperphosphorylation, amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary        tangles, and oxidative stress, being proposed to explain the origin and        progression of AD, the pathogenesis remains incompletely understood.

AD is considered a proteinopathy, which means that        aetiological and clinical features of AD have been linked to the deposition of        amyloid β (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylated tau protein aggregates throughout the        brain, with Aβ and hyperphosphorylated tau representing classical AD hallmarks.        However, some other putative mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of the        disease have been proposed, including inflammation in the brain, microglia        activation, impaired hippocampus neurogenesis and alterations in the production        and release of neurotrophic factors. Among all, microglia activation and chronic        inflammation in the brain gained some attention, with researchers worldwide        wondering whether it is possible to prevent and stop, respectively, the onset and        progression of the disease by modulating microglia phenotypes. The following key        points have been established so far: (i) Aβ deposition in brain parenchyma        represents repeated stimulus determining chronic activation of microglia; (ii)        chronic activation and priming of microglia make these cells lose neuroprotective        functions and favour damage and loss of neurons; (iii) quiescent status of        microglia at baseline prevents chronic activation and priming, meaning that the        more microglia are quiescent, the less they become neurotoxic. Many molecules are        known to modulate the quiescent baseline state of microglia, attracting huge        interest among scientists as to whether these molecules could be used as valuable        targets in AD treatment. The downside of the coin came early with the observation        that quiescent microglia do not display phagocytic ability, being unable to clear        Aβ deposits since phagocytosis is crucial for Aβ clearance efficacy. A possible        solution for this issue could be found in the modulation of microglia status at        baseline, which could help maintain both neuroprotective features and phagocytic        ability at the same time. Among the molecules known to influence the baseline        status of microglia, C-X3-chemokine Ligand 1 (CX3CL1), also known as Fractalkine        (FKN), is one of the most investigated. FKN and its microglial receptor CX3CR1        are crucial players in the interplay between neurons and microglia, modulating        the operation of some neural circuits and the efficacy and persistence of immune        response against injury. In addition, CX3CL1 regulates synaptic pruning and        plasticity in the developmental age and in adulthood, when it strongly impacts        the hippocampus neurogenesis of the adult. CX3CL1 has an effect on Aβ clearance        and tau phosphorylation, as well as in microglia activation and priming. For all        the above, CX3CL1/CX3CR1 signalling has been widely studied in relation to AD        pathogenesis, and its biochemical pathway could hide molecular targets for novel        treatment strategies in AD.

A critical challenge is the transplantation        microenvironment, which impacts the therapeutic effect of stem cells. In AD        brains, amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides and inflammatory cytokines continuously poison        the tissue microenvironment, leading to low survival of grafted cells and        restricted efficacy. It is necessary to create a growth-supporting        microenvironment for transplanted cells. Recent advances in AD studies suggest        that the asparaginyl endopeptidase (AEP) is a potential intervention target for        modifying pathological changes. We here chose APP/PS1 mice as an AD model and        employed pharmacological inhibition of the AEP for one month to improve the brain        microenvironment. Thereafter, we transplanted neural stem cells (NSCs) into the        hippocampus and maintained therapy for one more month. We found that inhibition        of AEPs resulted in a significant decrease of Aβ, TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β in their        brains. In AD mice receiving NSC transplantation alone, the survival of NSCs was        at a low level, while in combination with AEP inhibition pre-treatment the        survival rate of engrafted cells was doubled. Within the 2-month treatment        period, implantation of NSCs plus pre-inhibition of the AEP significantly        enhanced neural plasticity of the hippocampus and rescued cognitive impairment.        Neither NSC transplantation alone nor AEP inhibition alone achieved significant        efficacy.

Finally, the relationship        between glycolysis and pro-inflammatory phenotype transition of microglia was        evaluated. CCI led to the upregulation of Lyn expression and glycolysis        enhancement in microglia of spinal dorsal horn. Bafetinib or siRNA-lyn knockdown        intrathecally alleviated pain hyperalgesia, suppressed glycolysis enhancement and        inhibited nuclear translocation of IRF5 in CCI mice. Also, IRF5 promoted the        binding of transcription factors SP1, PU.1 to glycolytic gene promoters, and then        the enhanced glycolysis facilitated the proliferation and pro-inflammatory        phenotype transition of microglia and contributed to neuropathic pain.        Lyn-mediated glycolysis enhancement of microglia contributes to neuropathic pain        through facilitating IRF5 nuclear translocation in spinal dorsal horn.",PMC10273059,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,101083777

Familial AD is associated with the presence of APP(swe) and PS1(dE9)        mutations. However, it is still unknown whether these mutations cause deficits in        CNS development of carriers. We studied genome-wide gene expression profiles of        differentiated neural progenitor cells (NPCs) from wild-type and        APP(swe/)PS1(dE9) mouse embryo telencephalon. The occurrence of strong innate        immune and glial cell responses in APP(swe/)PS1(dE9) neurospheres mainly involves        microglial activation, inflammatory mediators and chemokines.

This study found        that the autophagy-associated protein p62 interacts with NLRP3, which is the        rate-limiting protein of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Thus, we aimed to prove that the        degradation of NLRP3 occurs through the autophagy-lysosome pathway (ALP) and also        demonstrate its effects on the function of microglia and pathological changes in        AD. METHODS: The 5XFAD/NLRP3-KO mouse model was established to study the effect        of NLRP3 reduction on AD. Behavioral experiments were conducted to assess the        cognitive function of the mice. In addition, immunohistochemistry was used to        evaluate the deposition of Aβ plaques and morphological changes in microglia. BV2        cells treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) followed by Aβ1-42 oligomers were        used as in vitro AD inflammation models and transfected with lentivirus to        regulate the expression of the target protein.

Co-immunoprecipitation, mass spectrometry, IF, Western blot (WB),        quantitative real-time PCR, and RNA-seq analysis were used to elucidate the        mechanisms of molecular regulation. RESULTS: Cognitive function was improved in        the 5XFAD/NLRP3-KO mouse model by reducing the pro-inflammatory response of        microglia and maintaining the phagocytic and clearance function of microglia to        the deposited Aβ plaque. The pro-inflammatory function and pyroptosis of        microglia were regulated by NLRP3 expression. Ubiquitinated NLRP3 can be        recognized by p62 and degraded by ALP, slowing down the proinflammatory function        and pyroptosis of microglia. The expression of autophagy pathway-related proteins        such as LC3B/A, p62 was increased in the AD model in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: P62        recognizes and binds to ubiquitin-modified NLRP3. It plays a vital role in        regulating the inflammatory response by participating in ALP-associated NLRP3        protein degradation, which improves cognitive function in AD by reducing the        pro-inflammatory status and pyroptosis of microglia, thus maintaining its        phagocytic function.",PMC10493665,CNS neuroscience & therapeutics,101473265

Patients suffering from CP/CPPS often        develop mental health-related disorders such as anxiety, depression, or cognitive        impairment. The aim of this study was to investigate depression-like behavior,        learning, and memory processes in a rat model of CP/CPPS and to determine the        alterations in hippocampal structure and function. Adult male Wistar albino rats        (n = 6 in each group) from CP/CPPS (single intraprostatic injection of 3%        λ-carrageenan, day 0) and Sham (0.9% NaCl) groups were subjected to pain        threshold test (days 2, 3, and 7), depression-like behavior, and learning-memory        tests (both on day 7). Decreased pain threshold in the scrotal region and        histopathological presence of necrosis and inflammatory infiltrate in prostatic        tissue confirmed the development of CP/CPPS. The forced swimming test revealed        the depression-like behavior evident through increased floating time, while the        modified elevated plus maze test revealed learning and memory impairment through        prolonged transfer latency in the CP/CPPS group in comparison with Sham (p <        0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively). Biochemical analysis showed decreased serum        levels of testosterone in CP/CPPS group vs. the Sham (p < 0.001). The CP/CPPS        induced a significant upregulation of ICAM-1 in rat cortex (p < 0.05) and        thalamus (p < 0.01) and increased GFAP expression in the hippocampal astrocytes        (p < 0.01) vs. Sham, suggesting subsequent neuroinflammation and astrocytosis.        Moreover, a significantly decreased number of DCX+ and Ki67+ neurons in the        hippocampus was observed in the CP/CPPS group (p < 0.05) vs. Sham, indicating        decreased neurogenesis and neuronal proliferation. Taken together, our data        indicates that CP/CPPS induces depression-like behavior and cognitive declines        that are at least partly mediated by neuroinflammation and decreased neurogenesis        accompanied by astrocyte activation.",PMC10101744,Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity,101479826

An enduring goal in this field is        to explore high-performance fluorogenic scaffolds that show tunability and        capability for in vivo analysis, especially for small-molecular near-infrared        (NIR) fluorophores. We present a unique bent-to-planar rehybridization design        strategy for NIR fluorogenic scaffolds, thus yielding a palette of switchable        bent/planar Si-rhodamines that span from visible to NIR-II wavelengths. We        demonstrate that the rehybridization of meso-nitrogen in this innovative NIR        scaffold Cl-SiRhd results in flipping between the disruption and recovery of the        polymethine π-electron system, thereby significantly altering the spectral        wavelength with crosstalk-free responses.

It is of main importance to find new therapeutic        strategies because AD prevalence is increasing worldwide. Cannabinoids are        arising as promising neuroprotective phytocompounds. In this study, we evaluated        the neuroprotective potential of Δ(8)-THC pretreatment in an in vitro model of AD        through transcriptomic analysis. We found that Δ(8)-THC pretreatment restored the        loss of cell viability in retinoic acid-differentiated neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y        cells treated with Aβ(1-42). Moreover, the transcriptomic analysis provided        evidence that the enriched biological processes of gene ontology were related to        ER functions and proteostasis. In particular, Aβ(1-42) upregulated genes involved        in ER stress and unfolded protein response, leading to apoptosis as demonstrated        by the increase in Bax and the decrease in Bcl-2 both at gene and protein        expression levels. Moreover, genes involved in protein folding and degradation        were also deregulated. On the contrary, Δ(8)-THC pretreatment reduced ER stress        and, as a consequence, neuronal apoptosis.

However, its presence and relationship with        amyloid pathology in cognitively normal at-risk individuals is less clear. Here,        we used positron emission tomography (PET) and blood biomarker measurements to        examine differences in neuroinflammation and beta-amyloid (Aβ) and their        association in cognitively unimpaired homozygotes, heterozygotes, or non-carriers        of the APOE ε4 allele, the strongest genetic risk for sporadic AD. METHODS: Sixty        60-75-year-old APOE ε4 homozygotes (n = 19), heterozygotes (n = 21), and        non-carriers (n = 20) were recruited in collaboration with the local Auria        biobank. The participants underwent (11)C-PK11195 PET (targeting 18-kDa        translocator protein, TSPO), (11)C-PiB PET (targeting Aβ), brain MRI, and        neuropsychological testing including a preclinical cognitive composite (APCC).        (11)C-PK11195 distribution volume ratios and (11)C-PiB standardized uptake value        ratios (SUVRs) were calculated for regions typical for early Aβ accumulation in        AD.

RESULTS: In our cognitively unimpaired sample,        cortical (11)C-PiB-binding increased according to APOE ε4 gene dose (median        composite SUVR 1.47 (range 1.38-1.66) in non-carriers, 1.55 (1.43-2.02) in        heterozygotes, and 2.13 (1.61-2.83) in homozygotes, P = 0.002). In contrast,        cortical composite (11)C-PK11195-binding did not differ between the APOE ε4 gene        doses (P = 0.27) or between Aβ-positive and Aβ-negative individuals (P = 0.81)        and associated with higher Aβ burden only in APOE ε4 homozygotes (Rho = 0.47,        P = 0.043).

Uncovering        the genetic basis of microbial abundance and its effect on AD could suggest        lifestyle changes that may reduce an individual's risk for the disease.

Finally, we conducted a        linear regression analysis to assess the correlation between the PRSs for the        significant genera and the APOE genotypes. In the discovery sample, 20 gut        microbiota genera were initially identified as genetically associated with AD        case/control status. Of these 20, three genera (Eubacterium fissicatena as a        protective factor, Collinsella, and Veillonella as a risk factor) were        independently significant in the replication sample. Meta-analysis with discovery        and replication samples confirmed that ten genera had a significant correlation        with AD, four of which were significantly associated with the APOE rs429358 risk        allele in a direction consistent with their protective/risk designation in AD        association. Notably, the proinflammatory genus Collinsella, identified as a risk        factor for AD, was positively correlated with the APOE rs429358 risk allele in        both samples. Overall, the host genetic factors influencing the abundance of ten        genera are significantly associated with AD, suggesting that these genera may        serve as biomarkers and targets for AD treatment and intervention.

Nevertheless, the        pathological mechanisms underlying the initiation and spread of inflammation in        the brain are still poorly described. Recently, a new mechanism of intercellular        signalling mediated by small extracellular vesicles (EVs) has been identified.        EVs are nanosized particles (30-150 nm) with a bilipid membrane that carries        cell-specific bioactive cargos that participate in physiological or pathological        processes. Damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) are cellular components        recognised by the immune receptors of microglia, inducing or aggravating        neuroinflammation in neurodegenerative disorders. Diverse evidence links        mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammation mediated by mitochondrial-DAMPs        (mtDAMPs) such as mitochondrial DNA, mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM)        and cardiolipin, among others. Mitochondrial-derived vesicles (MDVs) are a        subtype of EVs produced after mild damage to mitochondria and, upon fusion with        multivesicular bodies are released as EVs to the extracellular space. MDVs are        particularly enriched in mtDAMPs which can induce an immune response and the        release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Importantly, growing evidence supports the        association between mitochondrial dysfunction, EV release and inflammation.

Thus, the existing        approach has limitations when applied to personalized medicine, especially for        many understudied diseases whose molecular profiles are dramatically different        from those characterized in the training data. Besides the gene expression,        dose-dependent cell viability is another important phenotype readout and is more        informative than conventional summary statistics (e.g., IC50) for characterizing        clinical drug efficacy and toxicity. However, few computational methods can        reliably predict the dose-dependent cell viability. To address the challenges        mentioned above, we designed a new deep learning model, MultiDCP, to predict        cellular context-dependent gene expressions and cell viability on a specific        dosage. The novelties of MultiDCP include a knowledge-driven gene expression        profile transformer that enables context-specific phenotypic response predictions        of novel cells or tissues, integration of multiple diverse labeled and unlabeled        omics data, the joint training of the multiple prediction tasks, and a        teacher-student training procedure that allows us to utilize unreliable data        effectively.

Aging is associated with        changes in the immune system culminating in detrimental effects such as immune        dysfunction, immunosenescence, and chronic inflammation. Age-related decline of        immune functions is associated with various pathologies including cardiovascular,        autoimmune, neurodegenerative, and infectious diseases to name a few.        Conventional treatment addresses the onset of age-related diseases by early        detection of risk factors, administration of vaccines as preventive care,        immunomodulatory treatment, and other dietary supplements. However, these        approaches often come with systemic side-effects, low bioavailability of        therapeutic agents, and poor outcomes seen in the elderly. Recent innovations in        nanotechnology have led to the development of novel biomaterials/nanomaterials,        which explore targeted drug delivery and immunomodulatory interactions in vivo.        Current nanotechnology-based immunomodulatory approaches that have the potential        to be used as therapeutic interventions for some prominent age-related diseases        are discussed here.

Nuclear        factor 2 (Nrf2) is a transcription factor that primarily exists in the cytosol of        hippocampal neurons, and it is considered as an important regulator of autophagy,        oxidative stress, and inflammation. Total saikosaponins (TS) is the main        bioactive component of Radix bupleuri (Chaihu). In this study, it was found that        TS could ameliorate cognitive dysfunction in APP/PS1 transgenic mice and reduce        Aβ generation and senile plaque deposition via activating Nrf2 and downregulating        the expression of β-secretase 1 (BACE1). In addition, TS can enhance autophagy by        promoting the expression of Beclin-1 and LC3-II, increasing the degradation of        p62 and NDP52 and the clearance of phosphorylated tau (p-tau), and reducing the        expression of p-tau. It can also downregulate the expression of nuclear factor-κB        (NF-κB) to inhibit the activation of glial cells and reduce the release of        inflammatory factors. In vitro experiments using PC12 cells induced by Aβ, TS        could significantly inhibit the aggregation of Aβ and reduce cytotoxicity. It was        found that Nrf2 knock-out weakened the inhibitory effect of TS on BACE1 and NF-κB        transcription in PC12 cells. Moreover, the inhibitory effect of TS on BACE1        transcription was achieved by promoting the binding of Nrf2 and the promoter of        BACE1 ARE1. Results showed that TS downregulated the expression of BACE1 and        NF-κB through Nrf2, thereby reducing the generation of Aβ and inhibiting        neuroinflammation. Furthermore, TS can ameliorate synaptic loss and alleviate        oxidative stress. In gut microbiota analysis, dysbiosis was demonstrated in        APP/PS1 transgenic mice, indicating a potential link between gut microbiota and        AD. Furthermore, TS treatment reverses the gut microbiota disorder in APP/PS1        mice, suggesting a therapeutic strategy by remodeling the gut microbe.        Collectively, these data shows that TS may serve as a potential approach for AD        treatment.

CTE can only        be diagnosed postmortem and the cellular mechanisms of disease causation remain        to be elucidated. Understanding the full scope of the pathological changes        currently identified in CTE is necessary to identify areas requiring further        research. This systematic review summarises the current literature on CTE        pathology from postmortem human tissue histology studies published until 31        December 2021. Publications were included if they quantitively or qualitatively        compared postmortem human tissue pathology in CTE to neuropathologically normal        cases or other neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD).        Pathological entities investigated included p-tau, beta-amyloid, TDP-43, Lewy        bodies, astrogliosis, microgliosis, axonopathy, vascular dysfunction, and cell        stress. Of these pathologies, p-tau was the most frequently investigated, with        limited reports on other pathological features such as vascular dysfunction,        astrogliosis, and microgliosis. Consistent increases in p-tau, TDP-43,        microgliosis, axonopathy, and cell stress were reported in CTE cases compared to        neuropathologically normal cases. However, there was no clear consensus on how        these pathologies compared to AD. The CTE cases used for these studies were        predominantly from the VA-BU-CLF brain bank, with American football and boxing as        the most frequent sources of repetitive head injury exposure. Overall, this        systematic review highlights gaps in the literature and proposes three priorities        for future research including: 1. The need for studies of CTE cases with more        diverse head injury exposure profiles to understand the consistency of pathology        changes between different populations. 2. The need for more studies that compare        CTE with normal ageing and AD to further clarify the pathological signature of        CTE for diagnostic purposes and to understand the disease process. 3. Further        research on non-aggregate pathologies in CTE, such as vascular dysfunction and        neuroinflammation. These are some of the least investigated features of CTE        pathology despite being implicated in the acute phase response following        traumatic head injury.",PMC9356428,Acta neuropathologica communications,101610673

Although several monoclonal        antibodies against Aβ have been shown to substantially reduce Aβ burden in        patients with AD, their effects on improving cognitive function remain marginal.        In addition, a significant portion of patients treated with Aβ-targeting        antibodies experience brain edema and microhemorrhage associated with        antibody-mediated Fc receptor activation in the brain. Here, we develop a        phagocytosis inducer for Aβ consisting of a single-chain variable fragment of an        Aβ-targeting monoclonal antibody fused with a truncated receptor binding domain        of growth arrest-specific 6 (Gas6), a bridging molecule for the clearance of dead        cells via TAM (TYRO3, AXL, and MERTK) receptors. This chimeric fusion protein        (αAβ-Gas6) selectively eliminates Aβ plaques through TAM receptor-dependent        phagocytosis without inducing NF-kB-mediated inflammatory responses or reactive        gliosis. Furthermore, αAβ-Gas6 can induce synergistic clearance of Aβ by        activating both microglial and astrocytic phagocytosis, resulting in better        behavioral outcomes with substantially reduced synapse elimination and        microhemorrhage in AD and cerebral amyloid angiopathy model mice compared with Aβ        antibody treatment.

In this        study, we performed an eQTL analysis using single-nuclei RNA sequencing from 192        individuals in eight brain cell types derived from the prefrontal cortex,        temporal cortex and white matter. We identified 7,607 eGenes, a substantial        fraction (46%, 3,537/7,607) of which show cell-type-specific effects, with        strongest effects in microglia. Cell-type-level eQTLs affected more constrained        genes and had larger effect sizes than tissue-level eQTLs. Integration of brain        cell type eQTLs with genome-wide association studies (GWAS) revealed novel        relationships between expression and disease risk for neuropsychiatric and        neurodegenerative diseases.

Together with recent        progress in vector development for efficiently targeting the central nervous        system, gene therapy has been suggested as a potential therapeutic modality to        overcome the limited delivery of conventional types of drugs to and within the        damaged brain. In addition, given increasing evidence of the strong link between        glia and AD pathophysiology, therapeutic targets have been moving toward those        addressing glial cell pathology. Nurr1 and Foxa2 are transcription/epigenetic        regulators that have been reported to cooperatively regulate inflammatory and        neurotrophic response in glial cells. In this study, we tested the therapeutic        potential of Nurr1 and Foxa2 gene delivery to treat AD symptoms and pathologies.        A series of functional, histologic, and transcriptome analyses revealed that the        combined expression of Nurr1 and Foxa2 substantially ameliorated AD-associated        amyloid β and Tau proteinopathy, cell senescence, synaptic loss, and        neuro-inflammation in multiple in vitro and in vivo AD models. Intra-cranial        delivery of Nurr1 and Foxa2 genes using adeno-associated virus (AAV) serotype 9        improved the memory and cognitive function of AD model mice. The therapeutic        benefits of gene delivery were attained mainly by correcting pathologic glial        function.

It encodes a        microglial inflammation-associated receptor. To date, the potential role of        microglial TREML2 in neuroinflammation in the context of AD remains unclear. In        this study, APP/PS1 mice were used to investigate the dynamic changes of TREML2        levels in brain during AD progression. In addition, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)        stimulation of primary microglia as well as a lentivirus-mediated TREML2        overexpression and knockdown were employed to explore the role of TREML2 in        neuroinflammation in the context of AD. Our results show that TREML2 levels        gradually increased in the brains of APP/PS1 mice during disease progression. LPS        stimulation of primary microglia led to the release of inflammatory cytokines        including interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α in the        culture medium. The LPS-induced microglial release of inflammatory cytokines was        enhanced by TREML2 overexpression and was attenuated by TREML2 knockdown. LPS        increased the levels of microglial M1-type polarization marker inducible nitric        oxide synthase. This effect was enhanced by TREML2 overexpression and ameliorated        by TREML2 knockdown. Furthermore, the levels of microglial M2-type polarization        markers CD206 and ARG1 in the primary microglia were reduced by TREML2        overexpression and elevated by TREML2 knockdown.

Under AD conditions, Gal-3 is primarily expressed by microglial cells        clustered around Aβ plaques in both human and mouse brain, and knocking out Gal-3        reduces AD pathology in AD-model mice. To further unravel the importance of        Gal-3-associated inflammation in AD, we aimed to investigate the Gal-3        inflammatory response in the AD continuum. First, we measured Gal-3 levels in        neocortical and hippocampal tissue from early-onset AD patients, including        genetic and sporadic cases. We found that Gal-3 levels were significantly higher        in both cortex and hippocampus in AD subjects. Immunohistochemistry revealed that        Gal-3+ microglial cells were associated with amyloid plaques of a larger size and        more irregular shape and with neurons containing tau-inclusions. We then analyzed        the levels of Gal-3 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from AD patients (n = 119)        compared to control individuals (n = 36).

Therefore, this study sought to find hub genes        based on iron metabolism that can influence the diagnosis and treatment of AD.        First, gene expression profiles were downloaded from the GEO database, including        non-demented (ND) controls and AD samples. Fourteen iron metabolism-related gene        sets were downloaded from the MSigDB database, yielding 520 iron        metabolism-related genes. The final nine hub genes associated with iron        metabolism and AD were obtained by differential analysis and WGCNA in brain        tissue samples from GSE132903. GO analysis revealed that these genes were mainly        involved in two major biological processes, autophagy and iron metabolism.        Through stepwise regression and logistic regression analyses, we selected four of        these genes to construct a diagnostic model of AD. The model was validated in        blood samples from GSE63061 and GSE85426, and the AUC values showed that the        model had a relatively good diagnostic performance. In addition, the immune cell        infiltration of the samples and the correlation of different immune factors with        these hub genes were further explored.

AD, like many neurological disorders, demonstrates a sex bias and        recent evidence indicates that the sexual dimorphism in microglial function,        which has been recognized for many years in early development, persists into        adulthood and aging. Here, we demonstrate sex-related differences in microglia        from post mortem tissue of male and female AD patients and a marked increase in        the number of dystrophic and rod-shaped microglia in tissue from female AD        patients compared with males.

The treatment of AD through multiple pathological targets may generate        therapeutic efficacy better. The multifunctional molecules that simultaneously        hit several pathological targets have been of great interest in the intervention        of AD. METHODS: Here, we combined the chalcone scaffold with carbamate moiety and        5,6-dimethoxy-indanone moiety to generate a novel multi-target-directed ligand        (MTDL) molecule        (E)-3-((5,6-dimethoxy-1-oxo-1,3-dihydro-2H-inden-2-ylidene)-methyl)phenylethyl(methyl)        carbamate (named AP5). In silico approaches were used to virtually predict the        binding interaction of AP5 with AChE, the drug-likeness, and BBB penetrance, and        later validated by evaluation of pharmacokinetics (PK) in vivo by LC-MS/MS.        Moreover, studies were conducted to examine the potential of AP5 for inhibiting        AChE and AChE-induced amyloid-β (Aβ) aggregation, attenuating neuroinflammation,        and providing neuroprotection in the APP/PS1 model of AD. RESULTS: We found that        AP5 can simultaneously bind to the peripheral and catalytic sites of AChE by        molecular docking. AP5 exhibited desirable pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristics        including oral bioavailability (67.2%), >10% brain penetrance, and favorable        drug-likeness. AP5 inhibited AChE activity and AChE-induced Aβ aggregation in        vivo and in vitro. Further, AP5 lowered Aβ plaque deposition and insoluble Aβ        levels in APP/PS1 mice. Moreover, AP5 exerted anti-inflammatory responses by        switching microglia to a disease-associated microglia (DAM) phenotype and        preventing A1 astrocytes formation. The phagocytic activity of microglial cells        to Aβ was recovered upon AP5 treatment. Importantly, chronic AP5 treatment        significantly prevented neuronal and synaptic damage and memory deficits in AD        mice. CONCLUSION: Together, our work demonstrated that AP5 inhibited the AChE        activity, decreased Aβ plaque deposition by interfering Aβ aggregation and        promoting microglial Aβ phagocytosis, and suppressed inflammation, thereby        rescuing neuronal and synaptic damage and relieving cognitive decline. Thus, AP5        can be a new promising candidate for the treatment of AD.",PMC9289467,Frontiers in aging neuroscience,101525824
35855338,Effects of Ketogenic Diet on Neuroinflammation in Neurodegenerative Diseases.,10.14336/AD.2021.1217,"The ketogenic diet (KD) is a low-carbohydrate, high-fat and adequate-protein        diet. As a diet mimicking fasting, it triggers the production of ketone bodies        (KBs) and brings the body into a state of ketosis. Recent and accumulating        studies on humans and animal models have shown that KD is beneficial to        neurodegenerative diseases through modulating central and peripheral metabolism,        mitochondrial function, inflammation, oxidative stress, autophagy, and the gut        microbiome. Complicated interplay of metabolism, gut microbiome, and other        mechanisms can regulate neuroinflammation in neurodegenerative diseases by        activating multiple molecular and cellular pathways. In this review, we detail        the physiological basis of the KD, its functions in regulating neuroinflammation,        and its protective role in normal brain aging and neurodegenerative diseases,        such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral        sclerosis (ALS), and Huntington's disease (HD).

35855329,"Brain Mitochondrial Dysfunction: A Possible Mechanism Links Early Life Anxiety to        Alzheimer's Disease in Later Life.",10.14336/AD.2022.0221,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is usually manifested in patients with dementia,        accompanied by anxiety and other mental symptoms. Emerging evidence from humans        indicates that people who suffer from anxiety in their early life are more likely        to develop AD in later life. Mitochondria, the prominent organelles of energy        production in the brain, have crucial physiological significance for the brain,        requiring considerable energy to maintain its normal physiological activities.        Net reactive oxygen species (ROS) was produced by mitochondrial impairment, in        which oxidative stress is also included, and the production of ROS is mostly more        than that of removal. In this paper, we propose that as a critical process in        brain pathology, mitochondrial dysfunction caused by anxiety triggering oxidative        stress might be a possible mechanism that links early life anxiety to AD in later        life. Several pivotal physiological roles of mitochondria are reviewed, including        functions regulating glucose homeostasis, which may disrupt in oxidative stress.        Increased levels of oxidative stress are constantly shown in anxiety disorder        patients, and antioxidant drugs have promise in treating anxiety. In the early        stages of AD, mitochondrial dysfunction is concentrated around senile plaques, a        landmark lesion composed of aggregated Aβ and Tau protein. In turn, the        accumulated Aβ and Tau disrupts mitochondrial activity, and the tricky        physiological processes of mitochondria might be significant to the course of AD.        In the end, we conclude that mitochondria might present as one of the novel        therapeutic targets to block oxidative stress in patients with anxiety disorders        to prevent AD in the early stage.",PMC9286915,Aging and disease,101540533
35849149,"Reactive astrogliosis is associated with higher cerebral glucose consumption in        the early Alzheimer's continuum.",10.1007/s00259-022-05897-4,"PURPOSE: Glial activation is one of the earliest mechanisms to be altered in        Alzheimer's disease (AD). Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) relates to        reactive astrogliosis and can be measured in both cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and        blood. Plasma GFAP has been suggested to become altered earlier in AD than its        CSF counterpart. Although astrocytes consume approximately half of the        glucose-derived energy in the brain, the relationship between reactive        astrogliosis and cerebral glucose metabolism is poorly understood. Here, we aimed        to investigate the association between fluorodeoxyglucose ([(18)F]FDG) uptake and        reactive astrogliosis, by means of GFAP quantified in both plasma and CSF for the        same participants. METHODS: We included 314 cognitively unimpaired participants        from the ALFA + cohort, 112 of whom were amyloid-β (Aβ) positive. Associations        between GFAP markers and [(18)F]FDG uptake were studied. We also investigated        whether these associations were modified by Aβ and tau status (AT stages).        RESULTS: Plasma GFAP was positively associated with glucose consumption in the        whole brain, while CSF GFAP associations with [(18)F]FDG uptake were only        observed in specific smaller areas like temporal pole and superior temporal lobe.        These associations persisted when accounting for biomarkers of Aβ pathology but        became negative in Aβ-positive and tau-positive participants (A + T +) in similar        areas of AD-related hypometabolism. CONCLUSIONS: Higher astrocytic reactivity,        probably in response to early AD pathological changes, is related to higher        glucose consumption. With the onset of tau pathology, the observed uncoupling        between astrocytic biomarkers and glucose consumption might be indicative of a        failure to sustain the higher energetic demands required by reactive astrocytes.",PMC9606048,European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging,101140988

Tau pathology,        neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration are the leading candidate predictors. We        aimed to determine these three aspects of biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)        and plasma to predict longitudinal cognition status using Alzheimer's Disease        Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 430        subjects including, 96 cognitive normal (CN) with amyloid β (Aβ)-negative, 54 CN        with Aβ-positive, 195 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) with Aβ-positive, and 85 AD        with amyloid-positive (Aβ-positive are identified by CSF Aβ42/Aβ40 < 0.138). Aβ        burden was evaluated by CSF and plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio; tau pathology was        evaluated by CSF and plasma phosphorylated-tau (p-tau181); microglial activation        was measured by CSF soluble TREM2 (sTREM2) and progranulin (PGRN);        neurodegeneration was measured by CSF and plasma t-tau and structural magnetic        resonance imaging (MRI); cognition was examined annually over the subsequent 8        years using the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale Cognition 13-item scale        (ADAS13) and Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE). Linear mixed-effects models (LME)        were applied to assess the correlation between biomarkers and longitudinal        cognition decline, as well as their effect size on the prediction of longitudinal        cognitive decline. RESULTS: Baseline CSF Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio was decreased in MCI and        AD compared to CN, while CSF p-tau181 and t-tau increased. Baseline CSF sTREM2        and PGRN did not show any differences in MCI and AD compared to CN. Baseline        brain volumes (including the hippocampal, entorhinal, middle temporal lobe, and        whole-brain) decreased in MCI and AD groups. For the longitudinal study, there        were significant interaction effects of CSF p-tau181 × time, plasma p-tau181 ×        time, CSF sTREM2 × time, and brain volumes × time, indicating CSF, and plasma        p-tau181, CSF sTREM2, and brain volumes could predict longitudinal cognition        deterioration rate. CSF sTREM2, CSF, and plasma p-tau181 had similar medium        prediction effects, while brain volumes showed stronger effects in predicting        cognition decline. CONCLUSION: Our study reported that baseline CSF sTREM2, CSF,        and plasma p-tau181, as well as structural MRI, could predict longitudinal        cognitive decline in subjects with positive AD pathology. Plasma p-tau181 can be        used as a relatively noninvasive reliable biomarker for AD longitudinal cognition        decline prediction.",PMC9280990,Frontiers in aging neuroscience,101525824

Meanwhile, these two drugs can be        specifically released in astrocytes of AD lesion in response to high levels of        ROS. As a result, the cognition of AD mice was significantly improved and the        quantity of Aβ plaques was decreased.

Brain-type fatty acid binding protein        (FABP7) is enriched in astrocytes and has been implicated in sleep/wake        regulation and neurodegenerative diseases; however, the precise mechanisms        underlying the role of FABP7 in these biological processes remain unclear. FABP7        binds to both arachidonic acid (AA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), resulting in        discrete physiological responses. Here, we propose a dichotomous role for FABP7        in which ligand type determines the subcellular translocation of fatty acids,        either promoting wakefulness aligned with Alzheimer's pathogenesis or promoting        sleep with concomitant activation of anti-inflammatory pathways and        neuroprotection. We hypothesize that FABP7-mediated translocation of AA to the        endoplasmic reticulum of astrocytes increases astrogliosis, impedes glutamatergic        uptake, and enhances wakefulness and inflammatory pathways via COX-2 dependent        generation of pro-inflammatory prostaglandins. Conversely, we propose that        FABP7-mediated translocation of DHA to the nucleus stabilizes astrocyte-neuron        lactate shuttle dynamics, preserves glutamatergic uptake, and promotes sleep by        activating anti-inflammatory pathways through the peroxisome        proliferator-activated receptor-γ transcriptional cascade.

In a widely used 5xFAD model        of AD, we aimed to assess if negative and positive allosteric modulators of α5        GABA(A) receptors (NAM and PAM, respectively) would affect social interaction,        social, object and spatial memory, and neuroinflammation. METHODS: After 10-day        treatment with PAM, NAM, or solvent, 6-month-old transgenic and non-transgenic        5xFAD mice underwent testing in a behavioral battery. Gene expressions of IL-1β,        IL-6, TNF-α, GFAP, and IBA-1 were determined in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex        by qPCR. RESULTS: PAM treatment impaired spatial learning in transgenic females        compared to solvent-treated transgenic females, and social recognition in        transgenic and non-transgenic males.

We firstly demonstrated that high        doses of glucose, which mimics hyperglycemia in DM, did induce the activation of        murine BV2 microglial cells, increasing inflammatory responses such as the        production of ROS or inflammatory mediators like IL-1β, TNF-⍺, and nitric oxide,        through activation of p38 and JNK signaling pathways.

Growing evidence in humans shows that obesity increases        the risk of developing AD by threefold. Hippocampal neuroinflammation in rodents        correlates with poor memory performance, suggesting that it contributes to        cognitive decline. Here we propose that reducing obesity/T2D-driven        neuroinflammation may prevent the progression of cognitive decline associated        with AD-like neurodegenerative states. Near-infrared light (NIR) has attracted        increasing attention as it was shown to improve learning and memory in both        humans and animal models. We previously reported that transcranial NIR delivery        reduced amyloid beta and Tau pathology and improved memory function in mouse        models of AD. Here, we report the effects of NIR in preventing obesity-induced        neuroinflammation in a diet-induced obese mouse model. Five-week-old wild-type        mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 13 weeks to induce obesity prior to        transcranial delivery of NIR for 4 weeks during 90-s sessions given 5 days a        week. After sacrifice, brain slices were subjected to free-floating        immunofluorescence for microglia and astrocyte markers to evaluate glial        activation and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to evaluate        expression levels of inflammatory cytokines and brain-derived neurotrophic factor        (BDNF). The hippocampal and cortical regions of the HFD group had increased        expression of the activated microglial marker CD68 and the astrocytic marker        glial fibrillary acidic protein. NIR-treated HFD groups showed decreased levels        of these markers. PCR revealed that hippocampal tissue from the HFD group had        increased levels of pro-inflammatory interleukin (IL)-1β and tumor necrosis        factor-α. Interestingly, the same samples showed increased levels of the        anti-inflammatory IL-10. All these changes were attenuated by NIR treatment.        Lastly, hippocampal levels of the neurotrophic factor BDNF were increased in        NIR-treated HFD mice, compared to untreated HFD mice. The marked reductions in        glial activation and pro-inflammatory cytokines along with elevated BDNF provide        insights into how NIR could reduce neuroinflammation.

Apart from lowered mood and        accompanying symptoms, it leads to cognitive impairment that altogether predicts        disadvantaged social functioning. Reduced cognitive function in depression        appears a bit neglected in the field of clinical and molecular psychiatry, while        it is estimated to occur in two-thirds of depressed patients and persist in at        least one third of remitted patients. This problem, therefore, requires        elucidation at the biomolecular and system levels and calls for improvement in        therapeutic approach. In this review study, we address the above-mentioned issues        by discussing putative mechanisms of cognitive decline in depression: (1)        increased oxidative stress and (2) inflammation, (3) disturbed        hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenals axis, and (4) reduced monoamines functionality.        Moreover, we acknowledge additional underpinnings of cognitive impairment in        depressed elderly: (5) vascular-originated brain ischemia and (6) amyloid-beta        plaque accumulation.

In        developed countries, the vast majority of these individuals will develop        Alzheimer's disease neuropathology characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-β        (Aβ) plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles within the brain, which leads to the        early onset of dementia (AD-DS) and reduced life-expectancy. The mean age of        onset of clinical dementia is ~55 years and by the age of 80, approaching 100% of        individuals with DS will have a dementia diagnosis. DS is caused by trisomy of        chromosome 21 (Hsa21) thus an additional copy of a gene(s) on the chromosome must        cause the development of AD neuropathology and dementia. Indeed, triplication of        the gene APP which encodes the amyloid precursor protein is sufficient and        necessary for early onset AD (EOAD), both in people who have and do not have DS.        However, triplication of other genes on Hsa21 leads to profound differences in        neurodevelopment resulting in intellectual disability, elevated incidence of        epilepsy and perturbations to the immune system. This different biology may        impact on how AD neuropathology and dementia develops in people who have DS.        Indeed, genes on Hsa21 other than APP when in three-copies can modulate        AD-pathogenesis in mouse preclinical models. Understanding this biology better is        critical to inform drug selection for AD prevention and therapy trials for people        who have DS.

Interestingly, these 5 × FAD        male mice had concomitantly increased mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines        such as interleukin 1 beta (Il1b) and tumor necrosis factor (Tnf) in the        olfactory bulb (OB) but not the frontal cortex (FC). Increased expression of Tnf        in the OB was significantly correlated with the anxious behavior in the FAD but        not WT mice. Furthermore, we found more prominent microglial activation and        morphological changes in the OB of 2 mo 5 × FAD mice, while only microglial        ramification was seen in the FC. To understand if neuroinflammatory changes in        the FC could occur at a later stage, we studied 5~6 mo male mice and found that        Il1b, interleukin 18 (Il18), and Tnf were upregulated in the FC at this older        age. Furthermore, we observed that numbers of microglia and macrophage as well as        microglial synaptic pruning, as indicated by phagocytosis of presynaptic        component of vesicular glutamate transporter-2, were increased in the OB but not        the FC of 5~6 mo 5 × FAD mice. Our findings demonstrated the OB as a more        sensitive brain region than the cerebral cortex for microglia-mediated        neuroinflammation in association with anxiety in FAD mice and supported the        notion that the OB can be an early-stage biomarker in AD.",PMC9219751,Biology,101587988

Behavioral phenotype was observed by        open field, rota rod, Morris water maze, and elevated plus maze test. Western        blot was performed to see the expression pattern of different proteins. Confocal        microscopy images were taken for neuronal and glial cells to see the effect of        remimazolam on CNS cells. RESULTS: We showed that remimazolam, a new anesthetic        drug, impaired cognitive behavior. Repetitive doses of remimazolam have been        found to induce neuronal loss with a significant change in morphology. Here, we        showed that a higher concentration of remimazolam had a significant effect on CNS        cell activation.

Microglial activation-mediated        neuroinflammation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of AD and the        expression levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) were increased in the brains of AD        patients. However, the mechanisms by which IL-6 expression is regulated in human        microglia are incompletely understood. Here, we show that Aβ(1-40) oligomers        (Aβ(40)) dose-dependently stimulate IL-6 expression in HMC3 human microglial        cells. Treatment with Aβ(40) promotes the transcription of IL-6 and tumor        necrosis factor α (TNFα) mRNAs in both HMC3 and THP-1 cells. Mechanistic studies        reveal that Aβ(40)-induced increase of IL-6 secretion is associated with the        activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK). Inhibition of p38        MAPK by BIRB 796 or SB202190 abrogates Aβ(40)-induced increase of IL-6        production.

Moreover, our        studies identified the co-localization of IL-6 with phosphorylated p38 MAPK in        microglia in the cortices of AD patients. Taken together, these results indicate        that p38 MAPK is a major regulator of Aβ-induced IL-6 production in human        microglia, which suggests that targeting p38 MAPK may represent a new approach to        ameliorate Aβ accumulation-induced neuroinflammation in AD.",PMC9398979,Molecular neurobiology,8900963

In AD,        the presence of pathogenic proteins such as extracellular Aβ plaques and        hyperphosphorylated tau, induce the transformation of ramified microglia into        amoeboid microglia. Ameboid microglia are highly phagocytic immune cells and        actively secrete a cascade of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. However,        the phagocytic ability of microglia gradually declines with age, and thus the        clearance of pathogenic proteins becomes highly ineffective, leading to the        accumulation of Aβ plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau in the aging brain. The        accumulation of pathogenic proteins further augments the neuroinflammatory        responses and sustains the activation of microglia.

Interestingly, in AD, microglia play a        double-edged role in disease progression; for instance, the detrimental        microglial effects increase in AD while microglial beneficiary mechanisms are        jeopardized. Depending on the disease stages, microglial cells are expressed        differently, which may open new avenues for AD therapy. However, the        disease-related role of microglial cells and their receptors in the AD brain        remain unclear. Therefore, this review represents the role of microglial cells        and their involvement in AD pathogenesis.",PMC9184163,Mediators of inflammation,9209001

Since gut microbiota can play a        critical role in the AD progression, we have studied if the neuroprotective        effects of SDP involve the microbiota−gut−brain axis. Experiments were performed        on two-month-old SAMP8 mice fed a standard diet and on six-month-old SAMP8 mice        fed a control diet or an 8% SDP supplemented diet for four months. Senescence        impaired short- and long-term memory, reduced cortical brain-derived neurotrophic        factor (BDNF) abundance, increased interleukin (Il)-1β, Il-6, and Toll-like        receptor 2 (Tlr2) expression, and reduced transforming growth factor β (Tgf-β)        expression and IL-10 concentration (all p < 0.05) and these effects were        mitigated by SDP (all p < 0.05). Aging also increased pro-inflammatory cytokines        in serum and colon (all p < 0.05). SDP attenuated both colonic and systemic        inflammation in aged mice (all p < 0.05). SDP induced the proliferation of        health-promoting bacteria, such as Lactobacillus and Pediococcus, while reducing        the abundance of inflammation-associated bacteria, such as Johnsonella and        Erysipelothrix (both q < 0.1). In conclusion, SDP has mucosal and systemic        anti-inflammatory effects as well as neuroprotective properties in senescent        mice; these effects are well correlated with SDP promotion of the abundance of        probiotic species, which indicates that the gut−brain axis could be involved in        the peripheral effects of SDP supplementation.",PMC9183112,Nutrients,101521595

Considerable time and resources are dedicated to the pursuit of a        better understanding of disease mechanisms; however, the ultimate goal of        obtaining a viable treatment option remains elusive.

We report that selective loss of Tsc1, a        negative regulator of mTOR, in microglia in mice of both sexes, caused mTOR        activation and upregulation of Trem2 with enhanced β-Amyloid (Aβ) clearance,        reduced spine loss, and improved cognitive function in the 5XFAD AD mouse model.        Combined loss of Tsc1 and Trem2 in microglia led to reduced Aβ clearance and        increased Aβ plaque burden revealing that Trem2 functions downstream of mTOR.        Tsc1 mutant microglia showed increased phagocytosis with upregulation of CD68 and        Lamp1 lysosomal proteins. In vitro studies using Tsc1-deficient microglia        revealed enhanced endocytosis of the lysosomal tracker indicator Green DND-26        suggesting increased lysosomal activity. Incubation of Tsc1-deficient microglia        with fluorescent-labeled Aβ revealed enhanced Aβ uptake and clearance, which was        blunted by rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor. In vivo treatment of mice of relevant        genotypes in the 5XFAD background with rapamycin, affected microglial activity,        decreased Trem2 expression and reduced Aβ clearance causing an increase in Aβ        plaque burden. Prolonged treatment with rapamycin caused even further reduction        of mTOR activity, reduction in Trem2 expression, and increase in Aβ levels.        Together, our findings reveal that mTOR signaling in microglia is critically        linked to Trem2 regulation and lysosomal biogenesis, and that the upregulation of        Trem2 in microglia through mTOR activation could be exploited toward better        therapeutic avenues to Aβ-related AD pathologies.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT        Mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway is a key regulator for        major cellular metabolic processes.

In this study, we provide        compelling in vivo evidence that mTOR activation in microglia would benefit        β-Amyloid (Aβ)-related AD pathologies, as it upregulates Trem2, a key receptor        for Aβ plaque uptake. Inhibition of mTOR pathway with rapamycin, a        well-established immunosuppressant, downregulated Trem2 in microglia and reduced        Aβ plaque clearance indicating that mTOR inactivation may be detrimental in        Aβ-associated AD patients.

Recent studies have demonstrated a link between age-associated        increase of senescent glial cells in the brain and the pathogenesis of        Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, there is a lack of in vitro cellular models of        senescent human microglia, which significantly limits our approaches to study AD        pathogenesis. Here, we show for the first time that ionizing radiation (IR)        dose-dependently induces premature senescence in HMC3 human microglial cells.        Senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity, a well-characterized marker of        cellular senescence, was substantially increased in irradiated HMC3 cells        compared with control cells. Furthermore, we found that phosphorylated p53 levels        and p21 expression levels were markedly higher in IR-induced senescent microglia        than in control cells. Senescent human microglia exhibited the        senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), as evidenced by the increased        secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6).

However, there have been no        reports on whether C3G can regulate the M1/M2 shift in an Alzheimer's disease        model. We attempted to investigate the effects of C3G on M1/M2 polarization and        the mechanism to regulate anti-inflammation and phagocytosis, both in vitro and        in vivo. HMC3 cells were treated with β-amyloid (Aβ42) in the presence or absence        of 50 μM C3G for different time intervals, and APPswe/PS1ΔE9 mice were orally        administered 30 mg/kg/day of C3G for 38 weeks. The in vitro data revealed that        C3G could shift the M1 phenotype of microglia to M2 by reducing the expression of        M1-specific markers (CD86 and CD80), inflammatory cytokines (IL-Iβ, IL-6, TNF-α),        reactive oxygen species, and enhancing the expression of M2-specific markers        (CD206 and CD163). The APPswe/PS1ΔE9 mice results were consistent with the in        vitro data, indicating a significant reduction in inflammatory cytokines and        higher expression of M2-specific markers such as CD206 and Arg1 in C3G-treated        Alzheimer's disease model mice.

After modulation        with miR-124 mimic/inhibitor, we identified common responsive mechanisms between        such models. We also reported miR-124 colocalization with microglia in AD patient        hippocampi. Herein, we determined how miR-124 modulation in SWE cells influences        microglia polarized subtypes in the context of inflammation. We used a coculture        system without cell-to-cell contact formed by miR-124 modulated SWE cells and        human CHME3 microglia stimulated with interferon-gamma (IFNγ-MG), in which we        assessed their adopted gene/miRNA profile and proteomic signature. The increase        of miR-124 in SWE cells/secretome (soluble and exosomal) was mimicked in IFNγ-MG.        Treatment of SWE cells with the miR-124 inhibitor led to RAGE overexpression and        loss of neuronal viability, while the mimic caused RAGE/HMGB1 downregulation and        prevented mitochondria membrane potential loss. When accessing the paracrine        effects on microglia, SWE miR-124 inhibitor favored their IFNγ-induced        inflammatory signature (upregulated RAGE/HMGB1/iNOS/IL-1β; downregulated        IL-10/ARG-1), while the mimic reduced microglia activation (downregulated        TNF-α/iNOS) and deactivated extracellular MMP-2/MMP-9 levels. Microglia        proteomics identified 113 responsive proteins to SWE miR-124 levels, including a        subgroup of 17 proteins involved in immune function/inflammation and/or miR-124        targets. A total of 72 proteins were downregulated (e.g., MAP2K6) and 21        upregulated (e.g., PAWR) by the mimic, while the inhibitor also upregulated 21        proteins and downregulated 17 (e.g., TGFB1, PAWR, and EFEMP1). Other targets were        associated with neurodevelopmental mechanisms, synaptic function, and vesicular        trafficking. To examine the source of miR-124 variations in microglia, we        silenced the RNase III endonuclease Dicer1 to block miRNA canonical biogenesis.        Despite this suppression, the coculture with SWE cells/exosomes still raised        microglial miR-124 levels, evidencing miR-124 transfer from neurons to microglia.        This study is pioneer in elucidating that neuronal miR-124 reshapes microglia        plasticity and in revealing the relevance of neuronal survival in mechanisms        underlying inflammation in AD-associated neurodegeneration. These novel insights        pave the way for the application of miRNA-based neuropharmacological strategies        in AD whenever miRNA dysregulated levels are identified during patient        stratification.",PMC9127204,Frontiers in pharmacology,101548923

Here, we firstly presented that        MG53 reinstated senescent hUC-MSCs via the activation of the Nrf2 signaling        pathway by increasing cell proliferation and migration, ameliorating senescence        and oxidative stress, and decreasing the release of senescence-associated        secretory phenotype. In vivo studies showed that MG53 treatment improved the        therapeutic effect of senescent hUC-MSCs in AD mice. Furthermore, MG53 combined        with young hUC-MSCs transplantation alleviated cognitive deficit and        depression-like behavior in AD mice, reduced Aβ deposition and Tau        phosphorylation, promoted neurogenesis, and inhibited glia cells activation and        oxidative stress by activating the Nrf2 signaling. Moreover, these        neuroprotective effects mediated by MG53 and hUC-MSCs were partly reversed by        Brusatol, a specific inhibitor of Nrf2 signaling.

METHODS: This        study included adults aged 60 years or older from the 2011-2014 National Health        and Nutrition Examination Survey. The DII scores were calculated based on 27        nutritional parameters. Cognitive performance was assessed with four cognitive        tests: the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST, n = 2,780), the Consortium to        Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease Word Learning (CERAD-WL, n = 2,859)        and Delayed Recall (CERAD-DR, n = 2,857), and the Animal Fluency (AF, n = 2,844)        tests.

Few studies have examined CSF lactate levels in dementia due to        Alzheimer's disease (AD) and found higher values in AD patients compared to        healthy controls (HC). However, these studies were mostly small in size, the        inclusion criteria were not always well defined, and the diagnostic value and        pathophysiological significance of CSF lactate in AD remain unclear.

The        development of modern analytical diagnostic tools has made it possible to        determine several biomarkers of AD with high specificity, including pathogenic        proteins, markers of synaptic dysfunction, and markers of inflammation in the        blood. There is a considerable potential in using microRNA (miRNA) as markers of        AD, and diagnostic studies based on miRNA panels suggest that AD could        potentially be determined with high accuracy for individual patients. Studies of        the retina with improved methods of visualization of the fundus are also showing        promising results for the potential diagnosis of the disease.

METHODS: The participants received        4 mg/kg/day of WME for 24 weeks (low dose, n = 33), 4 mg/kg/day for 12 weeks and        then 8 mg/kg/day for 12 weeks (high dose, n = 33); or a placebo (n = 42). The        outcomes were neuropsychiatric test scores, safety, tolerability, and the blood        4-hydroxynonenal level. RESULTS: The proportion of participants who achieved the        minimum clinically important difference for the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment        Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog; -2.6 points) at 24 weeks was significantly        higher in the low-dose group (and a trend in the high-dose group) than in the        placebo group. WME appeared safe and well tolerated. At 24 weeks, the        4-hydroxynonenal level declined in both intervention groups. The participants        with a 5% reduction in this level showed greater ADAS-Cog improvements.        CONCLUSION: WME is a safe and well-tolerated cognitive enhancer in AD with        varying benefits across individuals based on antioxidative response.",PMC8984095,"Alzheimer's & dementia (New York, N.

Age-related diseases presenting with high frequencies include        neurodegenerative, musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, metabolic diseases and        cancer. These diseases can be co-morbid and are usually managed using a        disease-specific approach that can eventually lead to polypharmacy, low        medication adherence rates and undesired drug-drug interactions. Novel studies        suggest targeting the shared biological basis of age-related diseases to retard        the onset and manage their manifestations. Harvesting the anti-inflammatory and        immunomodulatory capacity of probiotics to tackle the root cause of these        diseases, could pose a viable alternative. In this article, a comprehensive        review of the effects of probiotic supplementation on the molecular pathogenesis        of age-related diseases, and the potential of probiotic treatments as        preventative or alleviatory means is attempted.

Amyloid precursor protein (APP) and tau protein, both of which are related        to the AD pathogenesis, are associated with brain iron metabolism. A variety of        iron metabolism-related proteins have been found to be abnormally expressed in        the brains of AD patients and mouse models, resulting in iron deposition and        promoting AD progression. Amyloid β (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylated tau, two        pathological hallmarks of AD, can also promote iron deposition in the brain,        forming a vicious cycle of AD development-iron deposition. Iron deposition and        the subsequent ferroptosis has been found to be a potential mechanism underlying        neuronal loss in many neurodegenerative diseases.

Human genetics has implicated a wide        range of cell surface receptors as playing a role in the disease, many of which        are involved in the production or clearance of neurotoxins in the brain. Amyloid        precursor protein, a membrane-bound signaling molecule, is at the very heart of        the disease: hereditary mutations in its gene are associated with a greatly        increased risk of getting the disease. A proteolytic breakdown product of amyloid        precursor protein, the neurotoxic Aβ peptide, has been the target for many drug        discovery efforts.

A deeper understanding of        the synergism between microglial functional states and brain organ health could        help us discover newer interventions and therapies that enable us to address the        current paucity of disease-modifying therapies in Alzheimer's disease.",PMC9130399,Neurotherapeutics : the journal of the American Society for Experimental,101290381

The        ischemic injury in the brain starts a cascade of events that lead to neuronal        death, inducing neurodegeneration which could lead to Alzheimer's disease (AD).        Cerebrovascular diseases have been suggested to contribute to AD        neuropathological changes, including brain atrophy and accumulation of abnormal        proteins such as amyloid beta (Aβ). In patients older than 60 years, the        incidence of dementia a year after stroke was significantly increased.        Nevertheless, the molecular links between stroke and dementia are not clearly        understood but could be related to neuroinflammation. Considering that activated        microglia has a central role, there are brain-resident innate immune cells and        are about 10-15% of glial cells in the adult brain. Their phagocytic activity is        essential for synaptic homeostasis in different areas, such as the hippocampus.        These cells polarize into phenotypes or subtypes: the pro-inflammatory M1        phenotype, or the immunosuppressive M2 phenotype. Phenotype M1 is induced by        classical activation, where microglia secrete a high level of pro- inflammatory        factors which can cause damage to the surrounding neuronal cells. Otherwise, M2        phenotype is the major effector cell with the potential to counteract        pro-inflammatory reactions and promote repair genes expression. Moreover, after        the classical activation, an anti-inflammatory and a repair phase are initiated        to achieve tissue homeostasis. Recently it has been described the concepts of        homeostatic and reactive microglia and they had been related to major AD risk,        linking to a multifunctional microglial response to Aβ plaques and        pathophysiology markers related, such as intracellular increased calcium. The        upregulation and increased activity of purinergic receptors activated by ADP/ATP,        specially P2X4R, which has a high permeability to calcium and is mainly expressed        in microglial cells, is observed in diseases related to neuroinflammation, such        as neuropathic pain and stroke. Thus, P2X4R is associated with microglial        activation. P2X4R activation drives microglia motility via the        phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway. Also, these receptors are        involved in inflammatory-mediated prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production and induce a        secretion and increase the expression of BDNF and TNF-α which could be a link        between pathologies related to aging and neuroinflammation.",PMC8904919,Frontiers in physiology,101549006

It has been shown that TLR/MYD88        signaling is involved in the chronic low-grade sterile inflammation associated        with AD. Several studies have evidenced high levels of MYD88 in the brain of        patients and animal models of AD, but no study has assessed so far its levels in        blood. METHODS: In this study we evaluated the blood mRNA levels of MYD88 in a        mouse model of AD, and also the putative effect of Rivastigmine treatment on        MYD88 expression. Twenty-eight transgenic APP/TAU mice (AT) and twenty-two        control C57/BL6j mice (WT) were included in this study, out of which five        transgenic AT and five WT mice were treated with Rivastigmine. RESULTS: Increased        MYD88 transcript in the whole blood from AT mice as compared to WT controls was        found, which seems to increase in time due to disease progression and not to        aging. This finding suggests that blood leukocytes are primed to develop        TLR/MYD-mediated inflammatory processes. Moreover, results indicate that MYD88        blood levels were not modulated by the diseases-specific treatment with        Rivastigmine. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that MYD88 might be a promising        blood biomarker to monitor AD progression.",PMC8917693,BMC neuroscience,100966986

Microglial activation, a major component of neuroinflammation, is an        early pathologic hallmark that correlates with cognitive decline, while the        unfolded protein response (UPR) contributes to synaptic pathology. Sleep        disturbances are prevalent in tauopathies and may also contribute to disease        progression. Few studies have investigated whether manipulations of sleep        influence cellular pathologic and behavioral features of tauopathy. We        investigated whether trazodone, a licensed antidepressant with hypnotic efficacy        in dementia, can reduce disease-related cellular pathways and improve memory and        sleep in male rTg4510 mice with a tauopathy-like phenotype. In a 9 week dosing        regimen, trazodone decreased microglial NLRP3 inflammasome expression and        phosphorylated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase levels, which correlated with        the NLRP3 inflammasome, the UPR effector ATF4, and total tau levels. Trazodone        reduced theta oscillations during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and enhanced REM        sleep duration. Olfactory memory transiently improved, and memory performance        correlated with REM sleep duration and theta oscillations. These findings on the        effects of trazodone on the NLRP3 inflammasome, the unfolded protein response and        behavioral hallmarks of dementia warrant further studies on the therapeutic value        of sleep-modulating compounds for tauopathies.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Dementia and        associated behavioral symptoms such as memory loss and sleep disturbance are        debilitating. Identifying treatments that alleviate symptoms and concurrently        target cellular pathways contributing to disease progression is paramount for the        patients and their caregivers. Here we show that a chronic treatment with        trazodone, an antidepressant with positive effects on sleep, has beneficial        effects on several cellular pathways contributing to neuroinflammation and tau        pathology, in tauopathy-like rTg4510 mice. Trazodone also improved rapid eye        movement (REM) sleep, the slowing of brain oscillations, and olfactory memory        disturbances, which are all early symptoms observed in Alzheimer's disease.

Pharmacological interventions to slow the progression of        AD are intensively studied. A potential direction targets neuronal sigma-1        receptors (S1Rs). S1R ligands are recognized as promising therapeutic agents that        may alleviate symptom severity of AD, possibly via preventing amyloid-β-(Aβ-)        induced neurotoxicity on the endoplasmic reticulum stress-associated pathways.        Furthermore, S1Rs may also modulate adult neurogenesis, and the impairment of        this process is reported to be associated with AD. We aimed to investigate the        effects of two S1R agonists, dimethyltryptamine (DMT) and PRE084, in an        Aβ-induced in vivo mouse model characterizing neurogenic and        anti-neuroinflammatory symptoms of AD, and the modulatory effects of S1R agonists        were analyzed by immunohistochemical methods and western blotting. DMT, binding        moderately to S1R but with high affinity to 5-HT receptors, negatively influenced        neurogenesis, possibly as a result of activating both receptors differently. In        contrast, the highly selective S1R agonist PRE084 stimulated hippocampal cell        proliferation and differentiation. Regarding neuroinflammation, DMT and PRE084        significantly reduced Aβ(1-42)-induced astrogliosis, but neither had remarkable        effects on microglial activation. In summary, the highly selective S1R agonist        PRE084 may be a promising therapeutic agent for AD.

Though AD        is a major neurodegenerative disease with vast avenues of investigation, there is        no effective treatment to cure AD or slow disease progression. The present work        evaluated the therapeutic effect of long-term photobiomodulation (PBM) treatment        with continuous-wave low-level laser on AD and its underlying mechanism. Methods:        PBM was implemented for 2 min, 3 times per week for 16 months in 2-month-old        transgenic AD rats. A battery of behavioral tests was performed to measure the        effect of PBM treatment on cognitive dysfunction in AD rats. The effects of PBM        therapy on typical AD pathologies, including amyloid plaques, intracellular        neurofibrillary tangles, neuronal loss, neuronal injury, neuronal apoptosis, and        neurodegeneration, were then assessed. The underlying mechanisms were measured        using immunofluorescence staining, western blotting analysis, mass spectrometry,        primary cortical and hippocampal cell cultures, and related assay kits. Results:        PBM treatment significantly improved the typical AD pathologies of memory loss,        amyloid plaques, tau hyperphosphorylation, neuronal degeneration, spine damage,        and synaptic loss. PBM treatment had several mechanistic effects which may        explain these beneficial effects, including 1) regulation of glial cell        polarization and inhibition of neuroinflammation, 2) preservation of        mitochondrial dynamics by regulating fission and fusion proteins, and 3)        suppression of oxidative damage to DNA, proteins, and lipids. Furthermore, PBM        enhanced recruitment of microglia surrounding amyloid plaques by improving the        expression of microglial IL-3Rα and astrocytic IL-3, which implies a potential        role of PBM in improving Aβ clearance. Finally, our results implicate neuronal        hemoglobin in mediating the neuroprotective effect of PBM, as Hbα knockdown        abolished the neuroprotective effect of PBM treatment.

As incidence of these        conditions increases with age, there will undoubtedly be an increased prevalence        of cases in the near future. Neuroinflammation is a hallmark in the development        and progression of neurodegenerative diseases and prevention or resolution of        chronic neuroinflammation may represent a novel approach to treatment. The        present review highlights the potential of the anti-inflammatory and        pro-resolving effects of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)-derived mediators        (Specialized Pro-resolving Mediators-SPM) in neurodegenerative disorders.        PUFA-derived SPM are biosynthesized in response to chemicals produced from acute        inflammatory responses. Preclinical studies from both AD and PD models suggest a        dysregulation of SPM and their receptors in neurological disorders. Decreased SPM        may be due to inadequate substrate, an imbalance between SPM and pro-inflammatory        mediators or a disruption in SPM synthesis. SPMs hold great promise for        neuroprotection in AD by altering expression of pro-inflammatory genes,        modulating macrophage function, serving as a biomarker for AD status, and        promoting resolution of neuroinflammation. In PD, data suggest SPM are able to        cross the blood-brain barrier, inhibit microglial activation and decrease induced        markers of inflammation, possibly as a result of their ability to downregulate        NFκB signaling pathways. Several in vivo and in vitro studies suggest a benefit        from administration of SPMs in both neurodegenerative disorders. However,        extrapolation of these outcomes to humans is difficult as no models are able to        replicate all features of AD or PD. Minimal data evaluating these PUFA-derived        metabolites in humans with neurodegenerative disorders are available and a gap in        knowledge exists regarding behavior of SPM and their receptors in patients with        these conditions. There is also large gap in our knowledge regarding which lipid        mediator would be most effective in which model of AD or PD and how dietary        intake or supplementation can impact SPM levels.

Microglia, the primary innate immune        cells of the central nervous system (CNS), have a complex role in AD        neuropathology. In the initial stages of AD, microglia play a role in limiting        pathology by removing amyloid-β (Aβ) by phagocytosis. In contrast, microglia also        release pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines to promote neuroinflammation        and exacerbate AD neuropathology. Therefore, investigating microglial gene        networks could identify new targets for therapeutic strategies for AD.

Modulation of pro-inflammatory        enzymes, including cyclooxygenase-2, inducible nitric oxide synthase and        myeloperoxidase, might further contribute to the neuroprotective properties of        OEOO, as predicted by our in silico models.

However, the biological effect and mechanism of action        exerted by QTC-4-MeOBnE in AD cellular models have not been elucidated yet.        Hereby we investigate the acute effect of QTC-4-MeOBnE on neuronal cells        overexpressing Amyloid Protein Precursor (APP) or human tau protein, the two main        features of the AD pathophysiology. When compared to the control group,        QTC-4-MeOBnE treatment prevented amyloid beta (Aβ) formation through the        downregulation of APP and BACE levels in APPswe-expressing cells. Furthermore, in        N2a cells overexpressing human tau, QTC-4-MeOBnE reduced the levels of        phosphorylated forms of tau via the modulation of the GSK3β pathway.

The kynurenine pathway (KP) and several        of its metabolites, especially quinolinic acid (QA), are considered to be        involved in the neuropathogenesis of AD. The important metabolites and key        enzymes show significant importance in neuroinflammation and AD.

Linear and non-linear correlations between CSF biomarkers were        evaluated studying conditional independence relationships. RESULTS: CSF levels of        inflammatory cytokines and neuronal/glial markers were higher in ENC compared to        controls, whereas the levels of amyloid-related markers did not differ.        Inflammatory markers were not associated with amyloid markers but exhibited a        correlation with glial and neuronal markers in conditional independence analysis.        DISCUSSION: By an extensive CSF biomarkers analysis, this study showed that an        acute neuroinflammation state, which is associated with glial activation and        neuronal damage, does not influence amyloid homeostasis.",PMC9787884,Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association,101231978

The current study        assessed the exacerbating effect of age on multiwalled-carbon nanotube (MWCNT)        exposure in young and old C57BL/6 and ApoE(-/-) mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS:        Female C57BL/6 and apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE(-/-)) mice, aged 8 weeks and        15 months, were exposed to 0 or 40 µg MWCNT via oropharyngeal aspiration.        Pulmonary inflammation, inflammatory bioactivity of serum, and neurometabolic        changes were assessed at 24 h post-exposure. RESULTS: Pulmonary neutrophil        infiltration was induced by MWCNT in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in both C57BL/6        and ApoE(-/-). Macrophage counts decreased with MWCNT exposure in ApoE(-/-) mice        but were unaffected by exposure in C57BL/6 mice. Older mice appeared to have        greater MWCNT-induced total protein in lavage fluid.

However, the potential molecular mechanisms by which Ang-(1-7)        modulates neuroinflammation remain unclear. MATERIALS AND METHODS: APP/PS1 mice        were injected intraperitoneally with AVE0991 (a nonpeptide analogue of Ang-(1-7))        once a day for 30 consecutive days. Cognitive functions, neuronal and synaptic        integrity, and inflammation-related markers were assessed. Since astrocytes        played a crucial role in AD-related neuroinflammation whilst long noncoding RNAs        (lncRNAs) were reported to participate in modulating inflammatory responses,        astrocytes of APP/PS1 mice were isolated for high-throughput lncRNA sequencing to        identify the most differentially expressed lncRNA following AVE0991 treatment.        Afterward, the downstream pathways of this lncRNA in the anti-inflammatory action        of AVE0991 were investigated using primary astrocytes. RESULTS: AVE0991 rescued        spatial cognitive impairments and alleviated neuronal and synaptic damage in        APP/PS1 mice. The levels of Aβ(1-42) in the brain of APP/PS1 mice were not        affected by AVE0991. By employing high-throughput lncRNA sequencing, our in vitro        study demonstrated for the first time that AVE0991 suppressed astrocytic NLRP3        inflammasome-mediated neuroinflammation via a lncRNA SNHG14-dependent manner.        SNHG14 acted as a sponge of miR-223-3p while NLRP3 represented a direct target of        miR-223-3p in astrocytes. In addition, miR-223-3p participated in the        AVE0991-induced suppression of astrocytic NLRP3 inflammasome. CONCLUSION: Our        results suggest that Ang-(1-7) analogue AVE0991 inhibits astrocyte-mediated        neuroinflammation via SNHG14/miR-223-3p/NLRP3 pathway and offers neuroprotection        in APP/PS1 mice.

The response of microglia has emerged as an impactful        component of etiology in neurodegeneration. This study aimed to investigate the        effect of SIRT1-mTORC1 signaling pathway in microglia regulation after ONI.        METHODS: Cx3Cr1-Cre(ERT2)/Raptor (F/F) and Cx3Cr1-Cre(ERT2)/Sirt1 (F/F) mice were        used to delete Raptor and Sirt1 in microglia, respectively. Optic nerve crush        (ONC) model was established to mimic ONI. PLX5622, a highly specific inhibitor of        the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R), is used to eliminate microglia        in optic nerve. Ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1) immunostaining        was used to detect microglial activation. Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) were        quantified by Nissl staining and retinal whole-mount immunostaining with        RNA-binding protein with multiple splicing (RBPMS). Axonal damage was valued by        transmission electron microscopy (TEM). RESULTS: Microglial activation emerged on        day 3 post ONC and was earlier than RGCs loss which occurred at day 5 after        injury. Depleting microglia with PLX5622 could attenuate the loss of RGCs and        axon damage after ONC. Gain- and loss-of-function studies revealed that SIRT1        determined the activation of microglia in optic nerve. In addition,        microglia-specific deletion of Raptor resulted in decreased microglial        activation.

However, the role of        TREM2 in the inflammatory mechanism of PD is not clear. In our study, it was        found both in vivo and in vitro that the activation of microglia not only        promoted the secretion of inflammatory factors but also decreased the level of        TREM2 and inhibited the occurrence of autophagy. In contrast, an increase in the        level of TREM2 decreased the expression of inflammatory factors and enhanced the        level of autophagy through the p38 MAPK/mTOR pathway.

Pyroptosis induced by        inflammasome, and Gasdermin D (GSDMD) is involved in several neurodegenerative        disorders. However, it is not clear whether peripheral inflammasome and        pyroptosis are activated in aMCI and AD patients, influencing on        neuroinflammation. The aim of this study was to examine the association between        systemic inflammasome-induced pyroptosis and clinical features in aMCI and AD.        METHODS: A total of 86 participants, including 33 subjects with aMCI, 33 subjects        with AD, and 20 cognitively normal controls, in this study. The Mini Mental State        Examination (MMSE) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scale were used        for cognitive assessment. Levels of inflammasome-related genes/proteins in        peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were determined using quantitative        polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting. The levels of IL-1β, Aβ1-42,        Aβ1-40, p-tau, and t-tau in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), as well as the plasma        IL-1β level, were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Finally,        lipopolysaccharides (LPS) were used to investigate the effects of systemic        inflammasome-induced pyroptosis in an AD mice model. RESULTS: Several genes        involved in the inflammatory response were enriched in PBMCs of AD patients. The        mRNA and protein levels of NLRP3, caspase-1, GSDMD, and IL-1β were increased in        PBMCs of aMCI and AD patients. The IL-1β level in plasma and CSF of aMCI and AD        patients was significantly higher than that in controls and negatively correlated        with the CSF Aβ1-42 level, as well as MMSE and MoCA scores. Furthermore, there        was a positive correlation between the IL-1β level in plasma and CSF of aMCI or        AD patients. In vivo experiments showed that systemic inflammasome-induced        pyroptosis aggravated neuroinflammation in 5 × FAD mice. CONCLUSIONS: Our        findings showed that canonical inflammasome signaling and GSDMD-induced        pyroptosis were activated in PBMCs of aMCI and AD patients. In addition, the        proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β was strongly associated with the pathophysiology        of aMCI and AD. As such, targeting inflammasome-induced pyroptosis may be a new        approach to inhibit neuroinflammation in aMCI and AD patients.",PMC8638109,Journal of neuroinflammation,101222974

However, the specific mechanism by which VAD aggravates        cognitive impairment is still unknown. At the intersection of microbiology and        neuroscience, the gut-brain axis is undoubtedly contributing to the formation and        function of neurological systems, but most of the previous studies have ignored        the influence of gut microbiota on the cognitive function in VAD. Therefore, we        assessed the effect of VAD on AD pathology and the decline of cognitive function        in AD model mice and determined the role played by the intestinal microbiota in        the process. Twenty 8-week-old male C57BL/6J amyloid precursor protein/presenilin        1 (APP/PS1) transgenic mice were randomly assigned to either a vitamin A normal        (VAN) or VAD diet for 45 weeks. Our results show that VAD aggravated the        behavioral learning and memory deficits, reduced the retinol concentration in the        liver and the serum, decreased the transcription of vitamin A (VA)-related        receptors and VA-related enzymes in the cortex, increased amyloid-β peptides        (Aβ40 and Aβ42) in the brain and gut, upregulate the translation of beta-site        APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and phosphorylated Tau in the cortex, and        downregulate the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and        γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors in the cortex. In addition, VAD altered the        composition and functionality of the fecal microbiota as exemplified by a        decreased abundance of Lactobacillus and significantly different α- and        β-diversity. Of note, the functional metagenomic prediction (PICRUSt analysis)        indicated that GABAergic synapse and retinol metabolism decreased remarkably        after VAD intervention, which was in line with the decreased expression of GABA        receptors and the decreased liver and serum retinol. In summary, the present        study provided valuable facts that VAD exacerbated the morphological,        histopathological, molecular biological, microbiological, and behavioral        impairment in the APP/PS1 transgenic mice, and the intestinal microbiota may play        a key mediator role in this mechanism.",PMC8591312,Frontiers in aging neuroscience,101525824

A putative mechanism        underlying such a link can be explained by ferroptosis. Current studies have        shown that disturbances of iron homeostasis, glutamate excitatory toxicity, lipid        reactive oxygen species (ROS), and other manifestations related to ferroptosis        can be detected in several neurological disorders caused by neuroinflammation.

This study aimed to compare the chemical        constituents and anti-AD effect of the ethanol extracts of U. tomentosa (UTE) and        U. rhynchophylla (URE). METHODS: The high-performance liquid chromatography        (HPLC) was used to compare the chemical constituents of UTE and URE.        Streptozotocin (STZ) was intracerebroventricularly (ICV) injected into adult male        Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats to establish AD model. UTE (400 mg/kg) or URE        (400 mg/kg) was administrated intragastrically once daily to the rats for 6        consecutive weeks. Morris water maze (MWM) test was conducted to assess the        neurological functions in the STZ-induced AD rats. The brain tissues of the rats        were harvested for further biochemical assay. RESULTS: The MWM test results        showed both UTE and URE could significantly improve the learning and memory        impairments induced by STZ in rats. Both UTE and URE could significantly inhibit        the hyperphosphorylation of tau protein, reduce the elevated levels of        pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α), enhance activities of        antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT and GPx) and increase the protein expression of        HO-1. In addition, UTE could decrease the malondialdehyde (MDA) level.        Furthermore, both UTE and URE significantly enhanced Akt activation, down        regulated the activation of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β), and induced the        nuclear translocation of Nrf2 in the STZ-induced AD rats. CONCLUSIONS: UTE and        URE contained similar chemical constituents. We found for the first time that        both of them could ameliorate cognitive deficits in the STZ-induced AD rats. The        underlying molecular mechanism involve suppression of tau hyperphosphorylation,        anti-oxidant and anti-neuroinflammation via modulating Akt (Ser473)/GSK3β        (Ser9)-mediated Nrf2 activation.

Immunohistochemistry and        Congo red staining revealed an overall reduction in the size and number of        amyloid plaques in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Interestingly, isolated        primary astrocytes and microglia cells exhibit specific marker gene profiles        which, in the case of microglia, point to an enhanced plaque clearance capacity.        In contrast, direct IKK2/NF-κB activation in microglia results in a        pro-inflammatory polarization program.

However, chronic neuroinflammation has        been implicated in stimulating or exacerbating neuronal damage. The tumor        necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily of cytokines are involved in many systemic        chronic inflammatory and degenerative conditions and are amongst the key        mediators of neuroinflammation. TNF binds to the TNFR1 and TNFR2 receptors to        activate diverse cellular responses that can be either neuroprotective or        neurodegenerative. In particular, TNF can induce programmed necrosis or        necroptosis in an inflammatory environment. Although activation of necroptosis        has recently been demonstrated in the AD brain, its significance in AD neuron        loss and the role of TNF signaling is unclear. We demonstrate an increase in        expression of multiple proteins in the TNF/TNF receptor-1-mediated necroptosis        pathway in the AD post-mortem brain, as indicated by the phosphorylation of RIPK3        and MLKL, predominantly observed in the CA1 pyramidal neurons. The density of        phosphoRIPK3 + and phosphoMLKL + neurons correlated inversely with total neuron        density and showed significant sexual dimorphism within the AD cohort. In        addition, apoptotic signaling was not significantly activated in the AD brain        compared to the control brain. Exposure of human iPSC-derived glutamatergic        neurons to TNF increased necroptotic cell death when apoptosis was inhibited,        which was significantly reversed by small molecule inhibitors of RIPK1, RIPK3,        and MLKL. In the post-mortem AD brain and in human iPSC neurons, in response to        TNF, we show evidence of altered expression of proteins of the ESCRT III complex,        which has been recently suggested as an antagonist of necroptosis and a possible        mechanism by which cells can survive after necroptosis has been triggered.

34603320,The Impact of Ageing on the CNS Immune Response in Alzheimer's Disease.,10.3389/fimmu.2021.738511,"Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease strongly        associated with increasing age. Neuroinflammation and the accumulation of amyloid        protein are amongst the hallmarks of this disease and most translational research        to date has focused on targeting these two processes. However, the exact etiology        of AD remains to be fully elucidated. When compared alongside, the immune        response in AD closely resembles the central nervous system (CNS) immune changes        seen in elderly individuals. It is possible that AD is a pathological consequence        of an aged immune system secondary to chronic stimulation by a previous or        ongoing insult. Pathological changes like amyloid accumulation and neuronal cell        death may reflect this process of immunosenescence as the CNS immune system fails        to maintain homeostasis in the CNS. It is likely that future treatments designed        to modulate the aged immune system may prove beneficial in altering the disease        course. The development of new tests for appropriate biomarkers would also be        essential in screening for patients most likely to benefit from such treatments.",PMC8484764,Frontiers in immunology,101560960

The glutamate carbon skeleton originates from the        tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediate α-ketoglutarate, while the amino        group is derived from nitrogen donors such as the BCAAs. Disturbances in        neurotransmitter homeostasis, mainly of glutamate, are strongly implicated in the        pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The divergent BCAA metabolism in        different cell types of the human brain is poorly understood, and so is the        involvement of astrocytic and neuronal BCAA metabolism in AD. The goal of this        study is to provide the first functional characterization of BCAA metabolism in        human brain tissue and to investigate BCAA metabolism in AD pathophysiology using        astrocytes and neurons derived from human-induced pluripotent stem cells        (hiPSCs). Mapping of BCAA metabolism was performed using mass spectrometry and        enriched [(15)N] and [(13)C] isotopes of leucine, isoleucine, and valine in        acutely isolated slices of surgically resected cerebral cortical tissue from        human brain and in hiPSC-derived brain cells carrying mutations in either amyloid        precursor protein (APP) or presenilin-1 (PSEN-1). We revealed that both human        astrocytes of acutely isolated cerebral cortical slices and hiPSC-derived        astrocytes were capable of oxidatively metabolizing the carbon skeleton of BCAAs,        particularly to support glutamine synthesis. Interestingly, hiPSC-derived        astrocytes with APP and PSEN-1 mutations exhibited decreased amino acid synthesis        of glutamate, glutamine, and aspartate derived from leucine metabolism. These        results clearly demonstrate that there is an active BCAA metabolism in human        astrocytes, and that leucine metabolism is selectively impaired in astrocytes        derived from the hiPSC models of AD. This impairment in astrocytic BCAA        metabolism may contribute to neurotransmitter and energetic imbalances in the AD        brain.",PMC8484639,Frontiers in aging neuroscience,101525824

Attempts to prevent neurodegeneration in AD        have failed so far, highlighting the need for further clarification of the        underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms. Neuroinflammation seems to play a        crucial role in disease progression, although its specific contribution to AD        pathogenesis remains elusive. We have previously shown that the modulation of the        endocannabinoid system (ECS) renders beneficial effects in a context of        amyloidosis, which triggers neuroinflammation. In the 5xFAD model, the genetic        inactivation of the enzyme that degrades anandamide (AEA), the fatty acid amide        hydrolase (FAAH), was associated with a significant amelioration of the memory        deficit. METHODS: In this work, we use electrophysiology, flow cytometry and        molecular analysis to evaluate the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying        the improvement associated to the increased endocannabinoid tone in the 5xFAD        mouse(-) model. RESULTS: We demonstrate that the chronic enhancement of the        endocannabinoid tone rescues hippocampal synaptic plasticity in the 5xFAD mouse        model. At the CA3-CA1 synapse, both basal synaptic transmission and long-term        potentiation (LTP) of synaptic transmission are normalized upon FAAH genetic        inactivation, in a CB1 receptor (CB1R)- and TRPV1 receptor-independent manner.        Dendritic spine density in CA1 pyramidal neurons, which is notably decreased in        6-month-old 5xFAD animals, is also restored. Importantly, we reveal that the        expression of microglial factors linked to phagocytic activity, such as TREM2 and        CTSD, and other factors related to amyloid beta clearance and involved in        neuron-glia crosstalk, such as complement component C3 and complement receptor        C3AR, are specifically upregulated in 5xFAD/FAAH(-/-) animals. CONCLUSION: In        summary, our findings support the therapeutic potential of modulating, rather        than suppressing, neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease. In our model, the        long-term enhancement of the endocannabinoid tone triggered augmented microglial        activation and amyloid beta phagocytosis, and a consequent reversal in the        neuronal phenotype associated to the disease.",PMC8482614,Journal of neuroinflammation,101222974

The inequity in the amyloid β occurs due to a problem in its        clearance from the brain initiating the production of reactive oxygen species and        superoxide that activates a cascade wherein the release of inflammatory mediators        and various enzymes like endothelin-converting enzymes take place.

METHODS: The bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO) was        performed to establish CCH models in Sprague-Dawley rats. The rats were given        daily intraperitoneal injection of NAD(+) for 8 weeks. The behavioral test and        markers for neuronal death and neuroinflammation were analyzed. Mitochondrial        damage and ROS production in microglia were also assessed. RNA-seq was performed        to investigate the mechanistic pathway changes.

RESULTS: NAD(+) administration        rescued cognitive deficits and inhibited neuroinflammation by protecting        mitochondria and decreasing ROS production in CCH rats. Results of mechanistic        pathway analysis indicated that the detrimental effects of CCH might be        associated with decreased gene expression of PPAR-γ co-activator1α (PGC-1α) and        its upstream transcription factor Sirt1, while NAD(+) treatment markedly reversed        their decrease.

The        causal effects of GDF-15 on PD (p = 0.597) or ALS (p = 0.120) were not        identified, and the MR results likewise did not support the association of        genetic liability to PD or ALS with genetically predicted levels of GDF-15. No        evident heterogeneity or horizontal pleiotropy was revealed by multiple        sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSION: We highlighted the role of GDF-15 in AD as        altogether a promising diagnostic marker and a therapeutic target.",PMC8414585,Frontiers in genetics,101560621

In addition to pneumonia,        individuals affected by the disease have neurological symptoms. Indeed,        SARS-CoV-2 has a neuroinvasive capacity. It is known that the infection caused by        SARS-CoV-2 leads to a cytokine storm. An exacerbated inflammatory state can lead        to the blood-brain barrier (BBB) damage as well as to intestinal dysbiosis. These        changes, in turn, are associated with microglial activation and reactivity of        astrocytes that can promote the degeneration of neurons and be associated with        the development of psychiatric disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. Studies        also have been shown that SARS-CoV-2 alters the composition and functional        activity of the gut microbiota. The microbiota-gut-brain axis provides a        bidirectional homeostatic communication pathway.

Recently, pyroptosis, a proinflammatory cell death, has been identified        as a crucial pathological link of cerebral I/R injuries. However, whether        pyroptosis acts as a trigger of Aβ accumulation after cerebral I/R has not yet        been demonstrated. Blood-brain barrier (BBB) and glymphatic system mediated by        aquaporin-4 (AQP-4) on astrocytic endfeet are important pathways for the        clearance of Aβ in the brain, and pyroptosis especially occurring in astrocytes        after cerebral I/R potentially damages BBB integrity and glymphatic function and        thus influences Aβ clearance and brain homeostasis. In present study, the method        of middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) was used for building        models of focal cerebral I/R injuries in rats. Then, we used lipopolysaccharide        and glycine as the agonist and inhibitor of pyroptosis, respectively, Western        blotting for detections of pyroptosis, AQP-4, and Aβ (1-42) oligomers, laser        confocal microscopy for observations of pyroptosis and Aβ locations, and        immunohistochemical stainings of SMI 71 (a specific marker for BBB        integrity)/AQP-4 and Nissl staining for evaluating, respectively, BBB-glymphatic        system and neuronal damage. The results showed that pyroptosis obviously promoted        the loss of BBB integrity and AQP-4 polarization, brain edema, Aβ accumulation,        and the formation of Aβ (1-42) oligomers and thus increased neuronal damage after        cerebral I/R. However, glycine could inhibit cerebral I/R-induced pyroptosis by        alleviating cytomembrane damage and downregulating expression levels of cleaved        caspase-11/1, N-terminal gasdermin D, NLRP3 (nucleotide-binding domain,        leucine-rich repeat containing protein 3), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-1β and        markedly abate above pathological changes. Our study revealed that pyroptosis is        a considerable factor causing toxic Aβ accumulation, dysfunctional BBB-glymphatic        system, and neurological deficits after cerebral I/R, suggesting that targeting        pyroptosis is a potential strategy for the prevention of ischemic stroke sequelae        including dementia.",PMC8382555,Neural plasticity,100883417

34346520,Is cyclooxygenase-1 involved in neuroinflammation?,10.1002/jnr.24934,"PURPOSE: Reactive microglia are an important hallmark of neuroinflammation.        Reactive microglia release various inflammatory mediators, such as cytokines,        chemokines, and prostaglandins, which are produced by enzymes like        cyclooxygenases (COX). The inducible COX-2 subtype has been associated with        inflammation, whereas the constitutively expressed COX-1 subtype is generally        considered as a housekeeping enzyme. However, recent evidence suggests that COX-1        can also be upregulated and may play a prominent role in the brain during        neuroinflammation. In this review, we summarize the evidence that supports this        involvement of COX-1. METHODS: Five databases were used to retrieve relevant        studies that addressed COX-1 in the context of neuroinflammation. The search        resulted in 32 articles, describing in vitro, in vivo, post mortem, and in vivo        imaging studies that specifically investigated the COX-1 isoform under such        conditions. RESULTS: Reviewed literature generally indicated that the        overexpression of COX-1 was induced by an inflammatory stimulus, which resulted        in an increased production of prostaglandin E2. The pharmacological inhibition of        COX-1 was shown to suppress the induction of inflammatory mediators like        prostaglandin E2. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging studies in animal        models confirmed the overexpression of COX-1 during neuroinflammation. The same        imaging method, however, could not detect any upregulation of COX-1 in patients        with Alzheimer's disease. CONCLUSION: Taken together, studies in cultured cells        and living rodents suggest that COX-1 is involved in neuroinflammation. Most        postmortem studies on human brains indicate that the concentration of        COX-1-expressing microglial cells is increased near sites of inflammation.        However, evidence for the involvement of COX-1 in neuroinflammation in the living        human brain is still largely lacking.",PMC9542093,Journal of neuroscience research,7600111

This study is aimed to        identify key regulators of the cell cycle and their underlying pathways for        developing optimal treatment of AD. METHODS: RNA sequencing data were profiled to        screen for differentially expressed genes in the cell cycle. Correlation of        created modules with AD phenotype was computed by weight gene correlation network        analysis (WGCNA). Signature genes for trophic factor receptors were determined        using Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) analysis. RESULTS: Among the 13,679        background genes, 775 cell cycle genes and 77 trophic factor receptors were        differentially expressed in AD versus nondementia controls. Four coexpression        modules were constructed by WGCNA, among which the turquoise module had the        strongest correlation with AD. According to PCC analysis, 10 signature trophic        receptors most strongly interacting with cell cycle genes were filtered and        subsequently displayed in the global regulatory network.

Previously, we identified that protein kinase C        delta (PKCδ) is activated in post mortem PD brains and experimental Parkinsonism        and that it participates in reactive microgliosis; however, the relationship        between PKCδ activation, endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) and the reactive        microglial activation state in the context of α-synucleinopathy is largely        unknown. Herein, we show that oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, NLR        family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation, and PKCδ        activation increased concomitantly with ERS markers, including the activating        transcription factor 4 (ATF-4), serine/threonine-protein kinase/endoribonuclease        inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (p-IRE1α), p-eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2α)        as well as increased generation of neurotoxic cytokines, including IL-1β in        aggregated αSyn(agg)-stimulated primary microglia. Importantly, in mouse primary        microglia-treated with αSyn(agg) we observed increased expression of        Thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP), an endogenous inhibitor of the        thioredoxin (Trx) pathway, a major antioxidant protein system. Additionally,        αSyn(agg) promoted interaction between NLRP3 and TXNIP in these cells. In vitro        knockdown of PKCδ using siRNA reduced ERS and led to reduced expression of TXNIP        and the NLRP3 activation response in αSyn(agg)-stimulated mouse microglial cells        (MMCs). Additionally, attenuation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species        (mitoROS) via mito-apocynin and amelioration of ERS via the eIF2α inhibitor        salubrinal (SAL) reduced the induction of the ERS/TXNIP/NLRP3 signaling axis,        suggesting that mitochondrial dysfunction and ERS may act in concert to promote        the αSyn(agg)-induced microglial activation response. Likewise, knockdown of        TXNIP by siRNA attenuated the αSyn(agg)-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation        response. Finally, unilateral injection of αSyn preformed fibrils (αSyn(PFF))        into the striatum of wild-type mice induced a significant increase in the        expression of nigral p-PKCδ, ERS markers, and upregulation of the TXNIP/NLRP3        inflammasome signaling axis prior to delayed loss of TH(+) neurons. Together, our        results suggest that inhibition of ERS and its downstream signaling mediators        TXNIP and NLRP3 might represent novel therapeutic avenues for ameliorating        microglia-mediated neuroinflammation in PD and other synucleinopathies.",PMC8283807,Frontiers in aging neuroscience,101525824

We add novel findings concerning these relationships and investigate        which of our previously reported results from transgenic mice can be validated in        knock-in mice, in which overexpression and other artefacts of transgenic        technology are avoided. METHODS: App(NL-F) and App(NL-G-F) knock-in mice        expressing humanised amyloid beta with mutations in App that cause familial        Alzheimer's disease were compared to wild type mice throughout life. In vitro        approaches were used to understand microglial alterations at the genetic and        protein levels and synaptic function and plasticity in CA1 hippocampal neurones,        each in relationship to both age and stage of amyloid beta pathology. The        contribution of microglia to neuronal function was further investigated by        ablating microglia with CSF1R inhibitor PLX5622. RESULTS: Both App knock-in lines        showed increased glutamate release probability prior to detection of plaques.        Consistent with results in transgenic mice, this persisted throughout life in        App(NL-F) mice but was not evident in App(NL-G-F) with sparse plaques. Unlike        transgenic mice, loss of spontaneous excitatory activity only occurred at the        latest stages, while no change could be detected in spontaneous inhibitory        synaptic transmission or magnitude of long-term potentiation. Also, in contrast        to transgenic mice, the microglial response in both App knock-in lines was        delayed until a moderate plaque load developed. Surviving PLX5266-depleted        microglia tended to be CD68-positive. Partial microglial ablation led to aged but        not young wild type animals mimicking the increased glutamate release probability        in App knock-ins and exacerbated the App knock-in phenotype. Complete ablation        was less effective in altering synaptic function, while neither treatment altered        plaque load. CONCLUSIONS: Increased glutamate release probability is similar        across knock-in and transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer's disease, likely        reflecting acute physiological effects of soluble amyloid beta. Microglia respond        later to increased amyloid beta levels by proliferating and upregulating Cd68 and        Trem2. Partial depletion of microglia suggests that, in wild type mice,        alteration of surviving phagocytic microglia, rather than microglial loss, drives        age-dependent effects on glutamate release that become exacerbated in Alzheimer's        disease.",PMC8281661,Molecular neurodegeneration,101266600

One of the main mechanisms of Alzheimer's        disease is that microglia activated by amyloid beta (Aβ) transform from the        resting state to an M1 state and release pro-inflammatory cytokines to the        surrounding environment. In the present study, immortalized microglial cells were        pretreated with L. barbarum extract for 1 hour and then treated with oligomeric        Aβ for 23 hours. The results showed that LB extract significantly increased the        survival of oligomeric Aβ-induced microglial cells, downregulated the expression        of M1 pro-inflammatory markers (inducible nitric oxide synthase, tumor necrosis        factor α, interleukin-6, and interleukin-1β), and upregulated the expression of        M2 anti-inflammatory markers (arginase-1, chitinase-like protein 3, and        interleukin-4).

Unprotected ears are most often        damaged following exposure to blasts. Although there is an association between        tympanic membrane perforation and TBI in blast exposure victims, little is known        about how and to what extent blast energy is transmitted to the central nervous        system via the external ear canal. The present study investigated whether        exposure to blasts directed through the ear canal causes brain injury in        Long-Evans rats. Animals were exposed to a single blast (0-30 pounds per square        inch (psi)) through the ear canal, and brain injury was evaluated by histological        and behavioral outcomes at multiple time-points. Blast exposure not only caused        tympanic membrane perforation but also produced substantial neuropathological        changes in the brain, including increased expression of c-Fos, induction of a        profound chronic neuroinflammatory response, and apoptosis of neurons. The        blast-induced injury was not limited only to the brainstem most proximal to the        source of the blast, but also affected the forebrain including the hippocampus,        amygdala and the habenula, which are all involved in cognitive functions. Indeed,        the animals exhibited long-term neurological deficits, including signs of anxiety        in open field tests 2 months following blast exposure, and impaired learning and        memory in an 8-arm maze 12 months following blast exposure. These results suggest        that the unprotected ear canal provides a locus for blast waves to cause TBI.        This study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the        University of Mississippi Medical Center (Animal protocol# 0932E, approval date:        September 30, 2016 and 0932F, approval date: September 27, 2019).",PMC8451570,Neural regeneration research,101316351

Several histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors ameliorate cognitive        dysfunction in animal models of not only peripheral inflammation but also        Alzheimer's disease. However, it is not clear which HDAC expressed in the central        nervous system or peripheral tissues is involved in the therapeutic effect of        HDAC inhibition on cognitive dysfunction. Hence, the present study investigated        the effect of peripheral HDAC inhibition on peripheral inflammation-induced        cognitive dysfunction. Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), a pan-HDAC        inhibitor that is mainly distributed in peripheral tissues after intraperitoneal        administration, was found to prevent peripheral inflammation-induced cognitive        dysfunction. Moreover, pretreatment with SAHA dramatically increased mRNA        expression of interleukin-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine, in peripheral and        central tissues and attenuated peripheral inflammation-induced microglial        activation in the CA3 region of the hippocampus. Minocycline, a        macrophage/microglia inhibitor, also ameliorated cognitive dysfunction.        Furthermore, as a result of treatment with liposomal clodronate, depletion of        peripheral macrophages partially ameliorated the peripheral inflammation-evoked        cognitive dysfunction. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that inhibition        of peripheral HDAC plays a critical role in preventing cognitive dysfunction        induced by peripheral inflammation via the regulation of anti-inflammatory        cytokine production and the inhibition of microglial functions in the        hippocampus. Thus, these findings could provide support for inhibition of        peripheral HDAC as a novel therapeutic strategy for inflammation-induced        cognitive dysfunction.",,Neurochemical research,7613461

Here, we tested the hypothesis that rats        reared with intermittent binge access to sucrose in addition to normal chow would        develop an inflammatory response in brain. To test this hypothesis, we undertook        serial PET/MRI scans with the TSPO ligand [(18)F]DPA714 in a group of (n=9)        rats at baseline and again after voluntarily consuming 5% sucrose solution three        days a week for three months.

Accumulating evidence shows an increase of        brain-affecting disorders, still today characterized by poor therapeutic options.        There is a strong urgency to find new alternative strategies to prevent        progressive neuronal loss. Polyphenols, a wide family of plant compounds with an        equally wide range of biological activities, are suitable candidates to        counteract chronic degenerative disease in the central nervous system. Herein, we        will review their role in human healthcare and highlight their: antioxidant        activities in reactive oxygen species-producing neurodegenerative pathologies;        putative role as anti-acetylcholinesterase inhibitors; and protective activity in        Alzheimer's disease by preventing Aβ aggregation and tau hyperphosphorylation.        Moreover, the pathology of these multifactorial diseases is also characterized by        metal dyshomeostasis, specifically copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), and iron (Fe), most        important for cellular function. In this scenario, polyphenols' action as natural        chelators is also discussed. Furthermore, the critical importance of the role        exerted by polyphenols on microbiota is assumed, since there is a growing body of        evidence for the role of the intestinal microbiota in the gut-brain axis, giving        new opportunities to study molecular mechanisms and to find novel strategies in        neurological diseases.",PMC10044769,"Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",101668981

Therefore, we examined whether WV        administration can ameliorate major AD phenotypes in the 5xFAD transgenic mouse        model. Adult 5xFAD transgenic mice (6.5 months of age) were treated with WV by        intraperitoneal injection at 250 or 400 μg/kg body weight once weekly for 14        consecutive weeks. This administration regimen improved procedural, spatial, and        working memory deficits as assessed by the passive avoidance, Morris water maze,        and Y-maze tasks, respectively. It also attenuated histological damage and        amyloid-beta plaque formation in the hippocampal region and decreased expression        levels of pro-inflammatory factors in the hippocampus and cerebrum, while it        reduced oxidative stress markers (malondialdehyde in the brain and liver and        8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine in the plasma).

Herein, an engineered macrophage-biomimetic        versatile nanoantidote (OT-Lipo@M) is developed for inflammation-targeted therapy        against AD by neurotoxin neutralization and immune recognition suppression.        Coating macrophage membranes can not only endow OT-Lipo@M with anti-phagocytic        and inflammation-tropism capabilities to target inflammatory lesions in AD brain,        but also efficiently reduce neurotoxin levels to prevent them from activating        microglia.

PPARs are ligand-activated receptors that, following        stimulation, induce neuroprotective effects by decreasing neuroinflammatory        processes through inhibition of the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of        activated B cell (NF-κB) expression and consequent suppression of        pro-inflammatory cytokine production.

Recent studies suggest that microglia have        multifaceted roles in AD. Their immune response and phagocytosis functions can        have beneficial effects in the early stages of AD by clearing up amyloid-beta        (Aβ) plaques.

We previously showed that regulatory T        cells (Tregs) have a beneficial impact on disease progression in AD-like        pathology, notably by modulating the microglial response associated with Aβ        deposits in a mouse model of amyloid pathology. Besides microglia, reactive        astrocytes also play a critical role in neuroinflammatory processes associated        with AD. Different phenotypes of reactive astrocytes have previously been        characterized, including A1-like neurotoxic and A2-like neuroprotective subtypes.        However, the precise impact of Tregs on astrocyte reactivity and phenotypes in AD        still remains poorly defined. METHODS: We assessed the impact of Treg        immunomodulation on astrocyte reactivity in a mouse model of AD-like amyloid        pathology. Using 3D imaging, we carried out extensive morphological analyses of        astrocytes following either depletion or amplification of Tregs. We further        assessed the expression of several A1- and A2-like markers by immunofluorescence        and RT-qPCR. RESULTS: Modulation of Tregs did not significantly impact the        magnitude of global astrocyte reactivity in the brain nor in the close vicinity        of cortical amyloid deposits. We did not observe changes in the number,        morphology, or branching complexity of astrocytes according to immunomodulation        of Tregs. However, early transient depletion of Tregs modulated the balance of        reactive astrocyte subtypes, resulting in increased C3-positive A1-like        phenotypes associated with amyloid deposits. Conversely, early depletion of Tregs        decreased markers of A2-like phenotypes of reactive astrocytes associated with        larger amyloid deposits. Intriguingly, modulation of Tregs also impacted the        cerebral expression of several markers of A1-like subsets in healthy mice.        CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that Tregs contribute to modulate and fine-tune        the balance of reactive astrocyte subtypes in AD-like amyloid pathology, by        dampening C3-positive astrocytes in favor of A2-like phenotypes. This effect of        Tregs may partly relate to their capacity at modulating steady state astrocyte        reactivity and homeostasis. Our data further highlight the need for refined        markers of astrocytes subsets and strategy of analysis for better deciphering the        complexity of astrocyte reactivity in neurodegeneration.",PMC9996941,Journal of neuroinflammation,101222974

Microglia, the myeloid        cells resident in the CNS, use microRNAs to rapidly respond to inflammatory        signals. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) modulate inflammatory responses in microglia, and        miRNA profiles are altered in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Expression of        the pro-inflammatory miRNA, miR-155, is increased in the AD brain. However, the        role of miR-155 in AD pathogenesis is not well-understood. We hypothesized that        miR-155 participates in AD pathophysiology by regulating microglia        internalization and degradation of Aβ. We used CX3CR1(CreER/+) to        drive-inducible, microglia-specific deletion of floxed miR-155 alleles in two AD        mouse models. Microglia-specific inducible deletion of miR-155 in microglia        increased anti-inflammatory gene expression while reducing insoluble Aβ(1-42) and        plaque area. Yet, microglia-specific miR-155 deletion led to early-onset        hyperexcitability, recurring spontaneous seizures, and seizure-related mortality.        The mechanism behind hyperexcitability involved microglia-mediated synaptic        pruning as miR-155 deletion altered microglia internalization of synaptic        material.

Savinin is a natural lignan obtained from the roots of E. henryi. The        present study was undertaken to determine whether savinin can relieve LPS-induced        neuroinflammation and if so, what the mechanism is. Groups of male C57BL/6 mice        were administered savinin (5, 10, 20 mg/kg) and DEX (10 mg/kg) by gavage once        daily for a continuous 7 days. On the 5th day of continuous pre-administration,        LPS (2.5 mg/kg) was injected into the lateral ventricles of the mice for modeling        48 h.

Neuroimmunity,        inflammation, and oxidative stress play important roles in various complex        mechanisms of IS. In particular, the early proinflammatory response resulting        from the overactivation of resident microglia and the infiltration of circulating        monocytes and macrophages in the brain after cerebral ischemia leads to secondary        brain injury. Microglia are innate immune cells in the brain that constantly        monitor the brain microenvironment under normal conditions. Once ischemia occurs,        microglia are activated to produce dual effects of neurotoxicity and        neuroprotection, and the balance of the two effects determines the fate of        damaged neurons. The activation of microglia is defined as the classical        activation (M1 type) or alternative activation (M2 type). M1 type microglia        secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines and neurotoxic mediators to exacerbate        neuronal damage, while M2 type microglia promote a repairing anti-inflammatory        response. Fine regulation of M1/M2 microglial activation to minimize damage and        maximize protection has important therapeutic value.

AD cases (1081) and healthy control subjects        (870) were collected and genotyped, and the associations between candidate SNPs        and AD risk were analyzed. We explored the associations between target SNP and AD        biomarkers. Moreover, 842 individuals from ADNI were selected to verify these        results. Linear mixed models were used to estimate associations between the        target SNP and longitudinal cognitive changes. RESULTS: The rs2062323 was        identified to be associated with AD risk in the Han population, and rs2062323T        carriers had a lower AD risk (co-dominant model: OR, 0.67, 95% CI, 0.51-0.88,        p = 0.0037; additive model: OR, 0.82, 95% CI, 0.72-0.94, p = 0.0032).        Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sTREM2 levels were significantly increased in        middle-aged rs2062323T carriers (additive model: β = 0.18, p = 0.0348). We also        found significantly elevated levels of CSF sTREM2 in the ADNI. The rate of        cognitive decline slowed down in rs2062323T carriers. CONCLUSIONS: This study is        the first to identify significant associations between TREM1 rs2062323 and AD        risk. The rs2062323T may be involved in AD by regulating the expression of TREM1,        TREML1, TREM2, and sTREM2. The TREM family is expected to be a potential        therapeutic target for AD.",PMC10173721,CNS neuroscience & therapeutics,101473265

Unfortunately, many current Trem2 (R47H)        mouse models are associated with cryptic mRNA splicing of the mutant allele that        produces a confounding reduction in protein product. To overcome this issue, we        developed the Trem2(R47H NSS) (Normal Splice Site) mouse model in which the Trem2        allele is expressed at a similar level to the wild-type Trem2 allele without        evidence of cryptic splicing products. METHODS: Trem2(R47H NSS) mice were treated        with the demyelinating agent cuprizone, or crossed with the 5xFAD mouse model of        amyloidosis, to explore the impact of the TREM2 R47H variant on inflammatory        responses to demyelination, plaque development, and the brain's response to        plaques. RESULTS: Trem2(R47H NSS) mice display an appropriate inflammatory        response to cuprizone challenge, and do not recapitulate the null allele in terms        of impeded inflammatory responses to demyelination. Utilizing the 5xFAD mouse        model, we report age- and disease-dependent changes in Trem2(R47H NSS) mice in        response to development of AD-like pathology. At an early (4-month-old) disease        stage, hemizygous 5xFAD/homozygous Trem2(R47H NSS) (5xFAD/Trem2(R47H NSS)) mice        have reduced size and number of microglia that display impaired interaction with        plaques compared to microglia in age-matched 5xFAD hemizygous controls. This is        associated with a suppressed inflammatory response but increased dystrophic        neurites and axonal damage as measured by plasma neurofilament light chain (NfL)        level. Homozygosity for Trem2(R47H NSS) suppressed LTP deficits and loss of        presynaptic puncta caused by the 5xFAD transgene array in 4-month-old mice. At a        more advanced (12-month-old) disease stage 5xFAD/Trem2(R47H NSS) mice no longer        display impaired plaque-microglia interaction or suppressed inflammatory gene        expression, although NfL levels remain elevated, and a unique interferon-related        gene expression signature is seen. Twelve-month old Trem2(R47H NSS) mice also        display LTP deficits and postsynaptic loss. CONCLUSIONS: The Trem2(R47H NSS)        mouse is a valuable model that can be used to investigate age-dependent effects        of the AD-risk R47H mutation on TREM2 and microglial function including its        effects on plaque development, microglial-plaque interaction, production of a        unique interferon signature and associated tissue damage.",PMC9938579,Molecular neurodegeneration,101266600

Riboflavin (also known as        vitamin B2) ameliorates cognitive impairment via anti-oxidative stress and        anti-inflammation properties; however, the underlying mechanisms linking        riboflavin metabolism and microglial function in cognitive impairment remain        unclear. Here, it is demonstrated that riboflavin kinase (RFK), a critical enzyme        in riboflavin metabolism, is specifically expressed in microglia. An intermediate        product of riboflavin, flavin mononucleotide (FMN), inhibited RFK expression via        regulation of lysine-specific methyltransferase 2B (KMT2B). FMN supplementation        attenuated the pro-inflammatory TNFR1/NF-κB signaling pathway, and this effect is        abolished by KMT2B overexpression. To improve the limited anti-inflammatory        efficiency of free FMN, a biomimetic microglial nanoparticle strategy (designated        as MNPs@FMN) is established, which penetrated the blood brain barrier with        enhanced microglial-targeted delivery efficiency.

Deficits of AHN may lead to reduced cognitive abilities and        neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease. Extensive studies on        rodent AHN have clarified the developmental and maturation processes of adult        neural stem/progenitor cells. However, to what extent these findings apply to        primates remains controversial. Recent advances in next-generation sequencing        technologies have enabled in-depth investigation of the transcriptome of        AHN-related populations at single-cell resolution. Here, we summarize studies of        AHN in primates. Results suggest that neurogenesis is largely shared across        species, but substantial differences also exist.

Presently, we aimed to examine the anti-inflammatory effect of BT75 and        explore the possible mechanism using cultured cells and an AD mouse model.        Pretreatment with BT75 (1-25 µM) suppressed the release of nitric oxide (NO) and        IL-1β in the culture medium of mouse microglial SIM-A9 cells activated by LPS.        BMS195614, an RARα antagonist, partially blocked the inhibition of NO production        by BT75. Moreover, BT75 attenuated phospho-Akt and phospho-NF-κB p65 expression        augmented by LPS. In addition, BT75 elevated arginase 1, IL-10, and CD206, and        inhibited inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and IL-6 formation in        LPS-treated SIM-A9 cells, suggesting the promotion of M1-M2 microglial phenotypic        polarization.

To better understand the        pathological features of AD in the retina, we conducted an extensive        histopathological and biochemical investigation of postmortem retina and brain        tissues from 86 human donors. Quantitative examination of superior and inferior        temporal retinas from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD patients compared to        those with normal cognition (NC) revealed significant increases in amyloid        β-protein (Aβ(42)) forms and novel intraneuronal Aβ oligomers (AβOi), which were        closely associated with exacerbated retinal macrogliosis, microgliosis, and        tissue atrophy.

Several behavioral tests were applied to assess different        aspects of neurological functions. Then the brain and colon tissues were        harvested for in-depth mechanistic studies. To further verify whether PA exerts        anti-AD effects via modulating C/EBPβ/AEP signaling pathway in TgCRND8 mice,        adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors encoding CEBP/β were bilaterally injected        into the hippocampal CA1 region in TgCRND8 mice to overexpress C/EBPβ.        Additionally, the fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) experiment was performed        to verify the potential role of gut microbiota on the anti-AD effects of PA.        RESULTS: Our results showed that PA treatment significantly improved activities        of daily living (ADL), ameliorated the anxiety-related behavioral deficits and        cognitive impairments in TgCRND8 mice. PA modulated the amyloid precursor protein        (APP) processing. PA also markedly reduced the levels of beta-amyloid (Aβ) (40)        and Aβ(42), suppressed Aβ plaque burdens, inhibited tau protein        hyperphosphorylation at several sites and relieved neuroinflammation in the        brains of TgCRND8 mice. Moreover, PA restored gut dysbiosis and inhibited the        activation of the C/EBPβ/AEP signaling pathway in the brain and colon tissues of        TgCRND8 mice. Interestingly, PA strikingly alleviated the AD-like pathologies        induced by the overexpression of C/EBPβ in TgCRND8 mice. Additionally, the FMT of        fecal microbiota from the PA-treated TgCRND8 mice significantly alleviated the        cognitive impairments and AD-like pathologies in the germ-free TgCRND8 mice.        CONCLUSION: All these findings amply demonstrated that PA could ameliorate the        cognitive deficits in TgCRND8 mice via suppressing Aβ plaques deposition,        hyperphosphorylation of tau protein, neuroinflammation and gut dysbiosis through        inhibiting the activation of C/EBPβ/AEP pathway, suggesting that PA is a        promising naturally occurring chemical worthy of further development into the        pharmaceutical treatment of AD.",PMC9887791,Journal of neuroinflammation,101222974

To        identify molecular defects that take place in the dorsolateral frontal cortex of        patients with C9orf72 ALS/FTD, we compared healthy controls with C9orf72 ALS/FTD        donor samples staged based on the levels of cortical phosphorylated TAR DNA        binding protein (pTDP-43), a neuropathological hallmark of disease progression.        We identified distinct molecular changes in different cell types that take place        during disease progression. These alterations include downregulation of nuclear        and mitochondrial ribosomal protein genes in early disease stages that become        upregulated as the disease progresses. High ratios of premature oligodendrocytes        expressing low levels of genes encoding major myelin protein components are        characteristic of late disease stages and may represent a unique signature of        C9orf72 ALS/FTD.

The presence of amyloid-beta (Aβ) depositions and the        accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein remain the characteristic        hallmarks of AD. These hallmarks can be detected throughout the brain and other        regions, including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the spinal cord. Microglia        cells, the brain-resident macrophage type of the brain, are implicated in        maintaining healthy brain homeostasis. The localized administration of primary        healthy microglia (PHM) is suggested to play a role in mitigating AD hallmark        depositions and associated cognitive dysfunction. Carbenoxolone (CBX) is the most        common gap junction blocker. It cannot effectively cross the blood-brain barrier        (BBB) under systemic administration. Therefore, localized administration of CBX        may be a recommended intervention against AD by acting as an antioxidant and        anti-inflammatory agent. This study aims to determine whether the localized        intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of PHM and CBX may act as an        effective therapeutic intervention for AD neuroinflammatory type. In addition,        this study also aims to reveal whether detecting AD hallmarks in the spinal cord        and CSF can be considered functional and effective during AD early diagnosis.        Male albino rats were divided into four groups: control (group 1),        lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced AD neuroinflammatory type (group 2), ICV        injection of LPS + isolated PHM (group 3), and ICV injection of LPS + CBX (group        4). Morris water maze (MWM) was conducted to evaluate spatial working memory. The        brain and spinal cord were isolated from each rat with the collection of CSF. Our        findings demonstrate that the localized administration of PHM and CBX can act as        promising therapeutic approaches against AD. Additionally, Aβ and tau toxic        aggregates were detected in the spinal cord and the CSF of the induced AD model        concomitant with the brain tissues. Overall, it is suggested that the ICV        administration of PHM and CBX can restore normal brain functions and alleviate AD        hallmark depositions.

However, its role in neurodegenerative diseases,        including Alzheimer's disease (AD), is still debated. METHODS: We have        characterized the expression of GDF15 in brain samples from AD patients and        non-demented subjects (controls) of different ages. RESULTS: Although no        difference in CSF levels of GDF15 was found between AD patients and controls,        GDF15 was expressed in different brain areas and seems to be predominantly        localized in neurons. The ratio between its mature and precursor form was higher        in the frontal cortex of AD patients compared to age-matched controls (p < 0.05).        Moreover, this ratio was even higher for centenarians (p < 0.01), indicating that        aging also affects GDF15 expression and maturation. A lower expression of OXPHOS        complexes I, III, and V in AD patients compared to controls was also noticed, and        a positive correlation between GDF15 and IL-6 mRNA levels was observed. Finally,        when GDF15 was silenced in vitro in dermal fibroblasts, a decrease in OXPHOS        complexes transcript levels and an increase in IL-6 levels were observed.        DISCUSSION: Although GDF15 seems not to be a reliable CSF marker for AD, it is        highly expressed in aging and AD brains, likely as a part of stress response        aimed at counteracting mitochondrial dysfunction and neuroinflammation.",PMC9869280,Frontiers in aging neuroscience,101525824

Although the number of case reports on neuroinflammation in COVID-19        patients has increased, studies of SARS-CoV-2 neurotrophic pathology using brain        organoids have restricted recapitulation of those phenotypes due to insufficiency        of immune cells and absence of vasculature.

New BDNF protein activates TrkB receptors        that normally signal through PKCθ to elicit pLTF. Phrenic motor plasticity        elicited by spinal drug administration (e.g., BDNF) is referred to by a more        general term: phrenic motor facilitation (pMF). Although mild systemic        inflammation elicited by a low lipopolysaccharide (LPS) dose (100 µg/kg; 24 h        prior) undermines mAIH-induced pLTF upstream from BDNF protein synthesis, it        augments pMF induced by spinal BDNF administration through unknown mechanisms.        Here, we tested the hypothesis that mild inflammation shifts BDNF/TrkB signaling        from PKCθ to alternative pathways that enhance pMF. We examined the role of three        known signaling pathways associated with TrkB (MEK/ERK MAP kinase, PI3        kinase/Akt, and PKCθ) in BDNF-induced pMF in anesthetized, paralyzed, and        ventilated Sprague Dawley rats 24 h post-LPS. Spinal PKCθ inhibitor (TIP)        attenuated early BDNF-induced pMF (≤30 min), with minimal effect 60-90 min        post-BDNF injection. In contrast, MEK inhibition (U0126) abolished BDNF-induced        pMF at 60 and 90 min. PI3K/Akt inhibition (PI-828) had no effect on BDNF-induced        pMF at any time. Thus, whereas BDNF-induced pMF is exclusively PKCθ-dependent in        normal rats, MEK/ERK is recruited by neuroinflammation to sustain, and even        augment downstream plasticity. Because AIH is being developed as a therapeutic        modality to restore breathing in people living with multiple neurological        disorders, it is important to understand how inflammation, a common comorbidity        in many traumatic or degenerative central nervous system disorders, impacts        phrenic motor plasticity.NEW & NOTEWORTHY We demonstrate that even mild systemic        inflammation shifts signaling mechanisms giving rise to BDNF-induced phrenic        motor plasticity. This finding has important experimental, biological, and        translational implications, particularly since BDNF-dependent spinal plasticity        is being translated to restore breathing and nonrespiratory movements in diverse        clinical disorders, such as spinal cord injury (SCI) and amyotrophic lateral        sclerosis (ALS).",PMC9942899,Journal of neurophysiology,0375404

However, its role in        microglial activation is poorly understood. Here we used human induced        pluripotent stem cells-derived microglia (hiMG) as a model to study the role of        FUT8-catalyzed core fucosylation in amyloid-β oligomer (AβO)-induced microglial        activation, in view of its significant relevance to the pathogenesis of        Alzheimer's disease (AD). HiMG responded to AβO and lipopolysaccharides (LPS)        with a pattern of pro-inflammatory activation as well as enhanced core        fucosylation and FUT8 expression within 24 h. Furthermore, we found increased        FUT8 expression in both human AD brains and microglia isolated from 5xFAD mice, a        model of AD-like cerebral amyloidosis. Inhibition of fucosylation in        AβO-stimulated hiMG reduced the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines,        suppressed the activation of p38MAPK, and rectified phagocytic deficits. Specific        inhibition of FUT8 by siRNA-mediated knockdown also reduced AβO-induced        pro-inflammatory cytokines. We further showed that p53 binds to the two consensus        binding sites in the Fut8 promoter, and that p53 knockdown abolished FUT8        overexpression in AβO-activated hiMG. Taken together, our evidence supports that        FUT8-catalyzed core fucosylation is a signaling pathway required for AβO-induced        microglia activation and that FUT8 is a component of the p53 signaling cascade        regulating microglial behavior.

Immunofluorescent and fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis also        showed that calcein-AM was transferred into MGs after coincubation with ACs, PCs,        or ECs, confirming that intercellular interactions occurred between these cells.        However, while Gja1 inhibition reduced the number of MGs after coincubation with        ACs and PCs, this was increased after coincubation with ECs; this indicates that        ACs and PCs positively regulate microglial numbers via Gja1, while ECs decrease        it. Results show that ACs, PCs, or ECs exert both common and specific cell        type-dependent effects on MGs through intercellular interactions. These findings        also suggest that brain microglial phenotypes are different depending on their        surrounding cell types, such as ACs, PCs, or ECs.",PMC9861207,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791

Indeed, the deregulated function of the nAChR was        previously correlated with cognitive decline and neuropsychiatric symptoms in        Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). The evaluation in        peripheral immune cells of nAChR subtypes, which could reflect their expression        in brain regions, is a prominent investigation area. OBJECTIVES: This study aims        to evaluate the expression levels of both the nAChR subunits and the main known        inflammatory cytokines in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients        with DLB and AD to better characterize their involvement in these two diseases.        RESULTS: Higher gene expression levels of TNFα, IL6 and IL1β were observed in DLB        and AD patients in comparison with healthy controls (HC). In our cohort, a        reduction of nAChRα4, nAChRβ2 and nAChRβ4 was detected in both DLB and AD with        respect to HC. Considering nAChR gene expressions in DLB and AD, significant        differences were observed for nAChRα3, nAChRα4, nAChRβ2 and nAChRβ4 between the        two groups. Moreover, the acetylcholine esterase (AChE) gene expression was        significantly higher in DLB than in AD. Correlation analysis points out the        relation between different nAChR subtype expressions in DLB (nAChRβ2 vs nAChRα3;        nAChRα4 vs nAChRα3) and AD (nAChRα4 vs nAChRα3; nAChRα4 vs nAChRβ4; nAChRα7 vs        nAChRα3; nAChRα7 vs nAChRα4). CONCLUSIONS: Different gene expressions of both        pro-inflammatory cytokines and nAChR subtypes may represent a peripheral link        between inflammation and neurodegeneration. Inflammatory cytokines and different        nAChRs should be valid and accurate peripheral markers for the clinical diagnosis        of DLB and AD.

Expression of        circLPAR1 and indicated messenger RNA (mRNA) in mouse brain tissues or/and        SH-SY5Y cells were tested by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Protein        expression of indicated gene was examined by western blot. Production of        proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-α, TNF-α; interleukin-6, IL-6;        interleukin-1β, IL-1β; and interleukin-8, IL-8) and oxidative stress-related        factors (reactive oxygen species, ROS; malondialdehyde, MDA; superoxide        dismutase, SOD; and glutathione, GSH) were assessed by commercial kits.

CircLPAR1 was elevated, while GDF-15 was decreased in both APP/PS1 mice        and Aβ-treated SH-SY5Y cells. Knockdown of circLPAR1 and overexpression of GDF-15        protected cells against Aβ-caused inflammation, oxidative stress, and neuronal        apoptosis. CircLPAR1 knockdown was also proved to improve AD-related pathological        traits and ameliorate cognitive dysfunctions in vivo. In mechanism, we found that        circLPAR1 repressed GDF-15 expression by decreasing GDF-15 mRNA stability through        UPF1 recruitment.

Moreover, the protective effect of circLPAR1 knockdown against        Aβ-induced apoptosis was abolished by GDF-15 knockdown, and SIRT1 overexpression        could counteract this effect of GDF-15 knockdown.

However,        its underlying mechanism remains unknown. Through network pharmacology and        experimental validation, this study aimed to examine the potential mechanism of        HQGZWWD in regulating macrophage polarization and inflammation. METHODS: The        active components were obtained from the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems        Pharmacology database and Analysis Platform (TCMSP), whereas the corresponding        targets were obtained from the TCMSP and Swiss Target Prediction database. The        GeneCards database identified targets associated with macrophage polarization and        inflammation. Multiple networks were developed to identify the key compounds,        principal biological processes, and pathways of HQGZWWD that regulate macrophage        polarization and inflammation. Autodock Vina is utilized to assess the binding        ability between targets and active compounds. Finally, confirm the experiment's        central hypothesis. Human histiocytic lymphoma (U-937) cells were transformed        into M1 macrophages following stimulation with Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to        evaluate the effect of HQGZWWD drug-containing mouse serum (HQGZWWD serum) on        regulating macrophage polarization and inflammation. RESULTS: A total of 54        active components and 859 HQGZWWD targets were obtained. There were 9972 targets        associated with macrophage polarization and 11,109 targets associated with        inflammation. After screening, 34 overlapping targets were identified, of which 5        were identified as central targets confirmed by experiments, including the α7        nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7 nAchR), interleukin 6 (IL-6), Interleukin-1        beta (IL-1β), interleukin 10 (IL-10) and growth factor beta (TGF-β1). Pathway        enrichment analysis revealed that 34 overlapping targets were enriched in        multiple pathways associated with macrophage polarization and inflammation,        including the TGF beta signaling pathway, NF-kappa B signaling pathway, JAK-STAT        signaling pathway, and TNF signaling pathway. Molecular docking confirmed that        the majority of HQGZWWD's compounds can bind to the target. In vitro experiments,        HQGZWWD serum was shown to up-regulate the expression of α7 nAchR, reduce the        number of M1 macrophages, stimulate the production of M2 macrophages, inhibit the        expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL1-β, and increase the        expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and TGF-β1. CONCLUSION: HQGZWWD        can regulate the number of M1/M2 macrophages and the level of inflammatory        cytokines, and the underlying mechanism may be related to the up-regulation of α7        nAchR expression.",PMC9830836,BMC complementary medicine and therapies,101761232

Long-term infection of Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) can induce        cognitive impairment in hosts, which is closely implicated in the pathogenesis of        neurodegenerative diseases. Aconitate decarboxylase 1 (Acod1) and its produced        metabolite itaconate (termed Acod1/itaconate axis), have recently attracted        extensive interests due to its anti-inflammatory role in macrophages. However,        whether the axis can influence cognitive function remains unknown. METHODS: A        chronic T. gondii-infected mice (C57BL/6J) model was established via        administration of cysts by gavage. Novel location (NL), novel object recognition        (NOR), Y-maze spatial memory and nest building tests were used to evaluate the        behavior performance. Transmission electron microscopy, immunofluorescence,        RT-PCR, western-blotting and RNA sequencing were utilized to determine the        pathological changes, neuroinflammation and transcription profile in hippocampus        tissues post infection, respectively. Moreover, the protective effect of        Acod1/itaconate axis in T. gondii-induced cognitive deficits was evaluated.        RESULTS: We found that the latent infection of the parasite impaired the        cognitive function, which was assessed behaviorally by novel location (NL), novel        object recognition (NOR), Y-maze spatial memory and nest building tests. RNA        sequencing of hippocampus showed that the infection downregulated the expression        of genes related to synaptic plasticity, transmission and cognitive behavior. To        our attention, the infection robustly upregulated the expression of genes        associated with pro-inflammatory responses, which was characterized by microglia        activation and disorder of Acod1/itaconate axis. Interestingly, administration of        dimethyl itaconate (DI, an itaconate derivative with cell membrane permeability)        could significantly ameliorate the cognitive deficits induced by T. gondii, which        was proved by improvement of behavior performance and synaptic ultrastructure        impairment, and lower accumulation of pro-inflammatory microglia. Notably, DI        administration had a potential therapeutic effect on the cognitive deficits and        synaptic impairment induced by the parasitic infection.

Amyloid β (Aβ) and protein Tau        aggregates are disease hallmarks and key players in AD pathogenesis. However, it        has been hypothesized that microglia can contribute to AD pathophysiology, as        well. Microglia are CNS-resident immune cells belonging to the myeloid lineage of        the innate arm of immunity. Under physiological conditions, microglia are in        constant motion in order to carry on their housekeeping function, and they        maintain an anti-inflammatory, quiescent state, with low expression of cytokines        and no phagocytic activity. Upon various stimuli (debris, ATP, misfolded        proteins, aggregates and pathogens), microglia acquire a phagocytic function and        overexpress cytokine gene modules. This process is generally regarded as        microglia activation and implies that the production of pro-inflammatory        cytokines is counterbalanced by the synthesis and the release of        anti-inflammatory molecules. This mechanism avoids excessive inflammatory        response and inappropriate microglial activation, which causes tissue damage and        brain homeostasis impairment. Once the pathogenic stimulus has been cleared,        activated microglia return to the naïve, anti-inflammatory state. Upon repeated        stimuli (as in the case of Aβ deposition in the early stage of AD), activated        microglia shift toward a less protective, neurotoxic phenotype, known as ""primed""        microglia. The main characteristic of primed microglia is their lower capability        to turn back toward the naïve, anti-inflammatory state, which makes these cells        prone to chronic activation and favours chronic inflammation in the brain. Primed        microglia have impaired defence capacity against injury and detrimental effects        on the brain microenvironment. Additionally, priming has been associated with AD        onset and progression and can represent a promising target for AD treatment        strategies. Many factors (genetics, environmental factors, baseline inflammatory        status of microglia, ageing) generate an aberrantly activated phenotype that        undergoes priming easier and earlier than normally activated microglia do. Novel,        promising targets for therapeutic strategies for AD have been sought in the field        of microglia activation and, importantly, among those factors influencing the        baseline status of these cells. The CX3CL1 pathway could be a valuable target        treatment approach in AD, although preliminary findings from the studies in this        field are controversial. The current review aims to summarize state of the art on        the role of microglia dysfunction in AD pathogenesis and proposes biochemical        pathways with possible targets for AD treatment.",PMC9820926,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791

METHODS: Results        from a recently published longitudinal epigenomic screen were analyzed with        regard to the results of recent large epidemiological studies of the causal        impacts of cannabis. We also integrate theoretical syntheses with prior studies        into these combined epigenomic and epidemiological results. RESULTS: Cannabis        dependence not only recapitulates many of the key features of aging, but is        characterized by both age-defining and age-generating illnesses including        immunomodulation, hepatic inflammation, many psychiatric syndromes with a        neuroinflammatory basis, genotoxicity and epigenotoxicity. DNA breaks,        chromosomal breakage-fusion-bridge morphologies and likely cycles, and altered        intergenerational DNA methylation and disruption of both the histone and tubulin        codes in the context of increased clinical congenital anomalies, cancers and        heritable tumors imply widespread disruption of the genome and epigenome. Modern        epigenomic clocks indicate that, in cannabis-dependent patients, cannabis        advances cellular DNA methylation age by 25-30% at age 30 years. Data have        implications not only for somatic but also stem cell and germ line tissues        including post-fertilization zygotes.

Astrocytes, in collaboration with numerous microRNAs,        regulate brain cholesterol levels as well as glutamatergic and inflammatory        signaling, all of which contribute to general brain homeostasis. Neural        electrical activity, synaptic plasticity processes, learning, and memory are        dependent on the astrocyte-neuron crosstalk.

There is hardly any disease in which they        remain unaffected, though the quantum of effect may differ. Therefore, we propose        the existence of a strong correlation between sleep (quality or quantity) and        immune response. This may be supported by the fact that sleep loss modulates many        of the immunological molecules, which includes interferons; however, not much is        known about their mechanism of action. Sleep is divided into rapid eye movement        sleep (REMS) and non-REMS. For practical reasons, experimental studies have been        conducted mostly by inducing loss of REMS. It has been shown that withdrawal of        noradrenaline (NA) is a necessity for generation of REMS. Moreover, NA level        increases in the brain upon REMS loss and the elevated NA is responsible for many        of the sleep loss-associated symptoms. In this review, we describe how sleep (and        its disturbance/loss) modulates the immune system by modulating the NA level in        the brain or vice versa to maintain immune functions, physiological homeostasis,        and normal healthy living. The increased levels of NA during REMS loss may cause        neuroinflammation possibly by glial activation (as NA is a key modulator of        microglia).

Elevated blood C-reactive protein (CRP)        further increases the risk of AD for people carrying the APOE ε4 allele. We        hypothesized that CRP, as a key inflammatory element, could modulate the impact        of other genetic variants on AD risk. We selected ten single nucleotide        polymorphisms (SNPs) in reported AD risk loci encoding proteins related to        inflammation. We then tested the interaction effects between these SNPs and blood        CRP levels on AD incidence using the Cox proportional hazards model in UK Biobank        (n = 279,176 white participants with 803 incident AD cases). The five top SNPs        were tested for their interaction with different CRP cutoffs for AD incidence in        the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) Generation 2 cohort (n = 3009, incident        AD = 156). We found that for higher concentrations of serum CRP, the AD risk        increased for SNP genotypes in 3 AD-associated genes (SPI1, CD33, and CLU). Using        the Cox model in stratified genotype analysis, the hazard ratios (HRs) for the        association between a higher CRP level (≥10 vs. <10 mg/L) and the risk of        incident AD were 1.94 (95% CI: 1.33-2.84, p < 0.001) for the SPI1 rs1057233-AA        genotype, 1.75 (95% CI: 1.20-2.55, p = 0.004) for the CD33 rs3865444-CC genotype,        and 1.76 (95% CI: 1.25-2.48, p = 0.001) for the CLU rs9331896-C genotype. In        contrast, these associations were not observed in the other genotypes of these        genes. Finally, two SNPs were validated in 321 Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging        (ADNI) Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) patients. We observed that the SPI1 and        CD33 genotype effects were enhanced by elevated CRP levels for the risk of MCI to        AD conversion. Furthermore, the SPI1 genotype was associated with CSF AD        biomarkers, including t-Tau and p-Tau, in the ADNI cohort when the blood CRP        level was increased (p < 0.01). Our findings suggest that elevated blood CRP, as        a peripheral inflammatory biomarker, is an important moderator of the genetic        effects of SPI1 and CD33 in addition to APOE ε4 on AD risk.

METHODS: The impact of ZIKV        infection on mature neurons and microglia was analyzed at the molecular and        cellular levels, in vitro using immunocompetent primary cultured neurons and        microglia, and in vivo in the brain of adult immunocompetent mice following        intracranial ZIKV inoculation. We have used C57BL/6 and the genetically diverse        Collaborative Cross mouse strains, displaying a broad range of susceptibility to        ZIKV infection, to question the correlation between the effects induced by ZIKV        infection on neurons and microglia and the in vivo susceptibility to ZIKV.        RESULTS: As a result of a delayed induction of interferon beta (IFNB) expression        and response, infected neurons displayed an inability to stop ZIKV replication, a        trait that was further increased in neurons from susceptible mice. Alongside with        an enhanced expression of ZIKV RNA, we observed in vivo, in the brain of        susceptible mice, an increased level of active Iba1-expressing microglial cells        occasionally engulfing neurons and displaying a gene expression profile close to        the molecular signature of disease-associated microglia (DAM). In vivo as well as        in vitro, only neurons and not microglial cells were identified as infected,        raising the question of the mechanisms underlying microglia activation following        brain ZIKV infection. Treatment of primary cultured microglia with conditioned        media from ZIKV-infected neurons demonstrated that type-I interferons (IFNs-I)        secreted by neurons late after infection activate non-infected microglial cells.        In addition, ZIKV infection induced pathological phosphorylation of Tau (pTau)        protein, a hallmark of neurodegenerative tauopathies, in vitro and in vivo with        clusters of neurons displaying pTau surrounded by active microglial cells.        CONCLUSIONS: We show that ZIKV-infected mature neurons display an inability to        stop viral replication in link with a delayed IFNB expression and response, while        signaling microglia for activation through IFNs-I secreted at late times        post-infection.

METHODS: We use single-cell RNA-sequencing to profile        microglia subtypes from mice exhibiting both Aβ and tau pathologies across        disease progression. We identify novel microglia subtypes that are induced in        response to both Aβ and tau pathologies in a disease-stage-specific manner. To        validate the observation in AD mouse models, we also generated a snRNA-Seq        dataset from the human superior frontal gyrus (SFG) and entorhinal cortex (ERC)        at different Braak stages. RESULTS: We show that during early-stage disease,        interferon signaling induces a subtype of microglia termed Early-stage        AD-Associated Microglia (EADAM) in response to both Aβ and tau pathologies.        During late-stage disease, a second microglia subtype termed Late-stage        AD-Associated Microglia (LADAM) is detected. While similar microglia subtypes are        observed in other models of neurodegenerative disease, the magnitude and        composition of gene signatures found in EADAM and LADAM are distinct, suggesting        the necessity of both Aβ and tau pathologies to elicit their emergence.        Importantly, the pattern of EADAM- and LADAM-associated gene expression is        observed in microglia from AD brains, during the early (Braak II)- or late (Braak        VI/V)- stage of the disease, respectively. Furthermore, we show that several        Siglec genes are selectively expressed in either EADAM or LADAM.

However, it is still unclear which lipid metabolism        abnormalities play the most important role in neurodegenerative diseases. Plasma        lipid metabolomics (lipidomics) has been shown to be an unbiased method that can        be used to explore lipid metabolism abnormalities in neurodegenerative diseases.        Plasma lipidomics in neurodegenerative diseases has been performed only in        idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), and        comprehensive studies are needed to clarify the pathogenesis. METHODS: In this        study, we investigated plasma lipids using lipidomics in individuals with        neurodegenerative diseases and healthy controls (CNs). Plasma lipidomics was        evaluated by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in those        with IPD, dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), multiple system atrophy (MSA), AD, and        progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and CNs.

AD-related target proteins were obtained from MalaCards        database and DisGeNET databases. Key compounds and targets were identified from        the compound-target-disease network and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network        analysis. Functional enrichment analysis predicted the potential key signaling        pathways involved in the treatment of AD with KXS. The binding affinities between        key ingredients and targets were further verified using molecular docking.        Finally, the predicted key signaling pathway was validated experimentally.        Positioning navigation and space search experiments were conducted to evaluate        the cognitive improvement effect of KXS on AD rats. Western blot was used to        further examine and investigate the expression of the key target proteins related        to the predicted pathway. RESULTS: In total, 38 active compounds and 469        corresponding targets of KXS were screened, and 264 target proteins associated        with AD were identified. The compound-target-disease and PPI networks identified        key active ingredients and protein targets.

As        the second brain of human, the gut plays an important role in regulate emotion        and cognition functions. Recent studies have reported that the disturbance of gut        microbiota (GM) is closely related to accumulation of pathogenic proteins in NDs.        On the one hand, pathogenic proteins directly produced by GM are transmitted from        the gut to the central center via vagus nerve. On the other hand, The harmful        substances produced by GM enter the peripheral circulation through intestinal        barrier and cause inflammation, or cross the blood-brain barrier into the central        center to cause inflammation, and cytokines produced by the central center cause        the production of pathogenic proteins. These pathogenic proteins can produced by        the above two aspects can cause the activation of central microglia and further        lead to NDs development. In addition, certain GM and metabolites have been shown        to have neuroprotective effects. Therefore, modulating GM may be a potential        clinical therapeutic approach for NDs.

Thus, regulating microglial Aβ clearance is crucial for the        development of therapeutics for AD-related dementia.

These analyses further        highlighted that Aβ42 fibril treatment up-regulated cellular activation pathways        and immune response pathways in glial cells, including IL1β and TNFα in        astrocytes, and microglial activation and TGFβ1 in microglia. Further analysis        revealed that a number of disease-associated microglial (DAM) genes were        surprisingly suppressed in Aβ40 fibril treated microglia.

Aβ deposits        and NFT formation are the central pathological hallmarks in AD brains, and the        majority of AD cases have been shown to exhibit a complex combination of systemic        comorbidities. While AD is the foremost common cause of dementia in the elderly,        age-related hearing loss (ARHL) is the most predominant sensory deficit in the        elderly. During aging, chronic inflammation and resulting endothelial dysfunction        have been described and might be key contributors to AD; we discuss an intriguing        possible link between inner ear strial microvascular pathology and blood-brain        barrier pathology and present ARHL as a potentially modifiable and treatable risk        factor for AD development. We present compelling evidence that ARHL might well be        seen as an important risk factor in AD development: progressive hearing        impairment, leading to social isolation, and its comorbidities, such as frailty,        falls, and late-onset depression, link ARHL with cognitive decline and increased        risk of dementia, rendering it tempting to speculate that ARHL might be a        potential common molecular and pathological trigger for AD. Additionally, one        could speculate that amyloid-beta might damage the blood-labyrinth barrier as it        does to the blood-brain barrier, leading to ARHL pathology.

Therefore, we evaluated the risk of dementia and PD        in SS patients through a systematic review and meta-analysis approach. METHODS:        Two reviewers independently conducted a systematic search of PubMed, Embase, and        Web of Science databases (updated to February 14, 2022) to identify published        literature on the association between SS and dementia or PD. The risk estimates        of dementia or PD in patients with SS were pooled using fixed or random-effects        models. RESULTS: Of the 631 studies initially searched, 10 were eventually        included. Pooled results suggested that the risk of developing dementia        significantly increased in patients with SS (HR = 1.24, 95% CI: 1.15-1.33, P <        0.001), and such risk in females with SS was similar to that in males. The risk        of PD was 1.36 times higher in SS (HR = 1.36, 95% CI: 1.23-1.50, P < 0.001). The        association between SS and PD risk appeared to occur primarily in female patients        (female: HR = 1.28, 95% CI: 1.21-1.35; P < 0.001 vs. male: HR = 1.00, 95% CI:        0.87-1.16, P = 0.962, respectively). No significant effect of age was observed on        the risk of developing PD and dementia in SS patients. CONCLUSION: Our study        supports that people with SS are at higher risk of PD and dementia than the        general population.

A large number        of studies have also found that abnormally activated c-Abl plays an important        role in a variety of pathologies, including various inflammatory diseases and        neurodegenerative diseases. c-Abl also plays a crucial role in neurodevelopment        and neurodegenerative diseases, mainly through mechanisms such as        neuroinflammation, oxidative stress (OS), and Tau protein phosphorylation.        Inhibiting expression or activity of this kinase has certain neuroprotective and        anti-inflammatory effects and can also improve cognition and behavior. Blockers        of this kinase may have good preventive and treatment effects on        neurodegenerative diseases. Cognitive dysfunction after anesthesia is also        closely related to the abovementioned mechanisms. We infer that alterations in        the expression and activity of c-Abl may underlie postoperative cognitive        dysfunction (POCD). This article summarizes the current understanding and        research progress on the mechanisms by which c-Abl may be related to        postoperative neurodegeneration.",PMC9608039,International journal of medical sciences,101213954

TfRMAb-TNFR was protective in 6-month-old transgenic        APP/PS1 mice in our previous work. However, the effects and safety following        delayed chronic TfRMAb-TNFR treatment are unknown. Herein, we initiated the        treatment when the male APP/PS1 mice were 10.7 months old (delayed treatment).        Mice were injected intraperitoneally with saline, TfRMAb-TNFR, etanercept        (non-BBB-penetrating TNFI), or TfRMAb for ten weeks. Biologic TNFIs did not alter        hematology indices or tissue iron homeostasis; however, TfRMAb altered hematology        indices, increased splenic iron transporter expression, and increased spleen and        liver iron. TfRMAb-TNFR and etanercept reduced brain insoluble-amyloid beta (Aβ)        1-42, soluble-oligomeric Aβ, and microgliosis; however, only TfRMAb-TNFR reduced        Aβ peptides, Thioflavin-S-positive Aβ plaques, and insoluble-oligomeric Aβ and        increased plaque-associated phagocytic microglia. Accordingly, TfRMAb-TNFR        improved spatial reference memory and increased BBB-tight junction protein        expression, whereas etanercept did not.

Current evidence indicates that radiation        could be a promising treatment for neurodegenerative disorders involving protein        misfolding and amyloidogenesis, such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's diseases.        Low-dose RT can trigger antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and tissue regeneration        responses.

The current        study investigated the anti-neuroinflammatory effects of QA and its mechanism of        action in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated BV2 microglial cells. Pretreatment        with a methanol extract of dried QA stems (QAE) inhibited the production of        nitric oxide and proinflammatory cytokines and decreased the expression of        inducible nitric oxide synthase, cyclooxygenase-2 in LPS-stimulated BV2        microglial cells. Furthermore, it inhibited the phosphorylation and degradation        of inhibitory κBα and decreased the nuclear translocation and phosphorylation of        nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). Moreover, QAE inhibited the phosphorylation of        extracellular signal-regulated kinase, p38 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase, which is        known as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Additionally, QAE treatment        increased heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression by activating the nuclear factor        erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling, thereby ameliorating LPS-induced        intracellular hydrogen peroxide production.

Immunohistochemical        staining for amyloid-ß deposits (6E10), microgliosis (anti-Iba1 and anti-CD68        antibodies), astrocytes (GFAP) and the anti-CB(2)R antibody was performed on        brain slices from 17-month-old arcAß mice. Autoradiography using the CB(2)R        imaging probes [(18)F]RoSMA-18-d6, [(11)C]RSR-056, and [(11)C]RS-028 and mRNA        analysis were performed in brain tissue from arcAß and non-transgenic littermate        (NTL) mice at 6, 17, and 24 months of age. Specific increased CB(2)R        immunofluorescence intensities on the increased number of GFAP-positive        astrocytes and Iba1-positive microglia were detected in the hippocampus and        cortex of 17-month-old arcAß mice compared to NTL mice. CB(2)R immunofluorescence        was higher in glial cells inside 6E10-positive amyloid-ß deposits than        peri-plaque glial cells, which showed low background immunofluorescence in the        hippocampus and cortex of 17-month-old arcAß mice. Ex vivo autoradiography showed        that the specific binding of [(18)F]RoSMA-18-d6 and [(11)C]RSR-056 was comparable        in arcAß and NTL mice at 6, 17, and 24 months of age. The level of Cnr2 mRNA        expression in the brain was not significantly different between arcAß and NTL        mice at 6, 17, or 24 months of age. In conclusion, we demonstrated pronounced        specific increases in microglial and astroglial CB(2)R expression levels in a        mouse model of AD-related cerebral amyloidosis, emphasizing CB(2)R as a suitable        target for imaging neuroinflammation.",PMC9561934,Frontiers in aging neuroscience,101525824

However, the molecular mechanisms and biological        processes of neuroinflammation remain unclear and have not well delineated using        transcriptomics data available. Our objectives are to uncover the core        neuroinflammation signaling pathways in AD using integrative network analysis on        the transcriptomics data. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From a novel perspective, i.e.,        investigating weakly activated molecular signals (rather than the strongly        activated molecular signals), we developed integrative and systems biology        network analysis to uncover potential core neuroinflammation signaling targets        and pathways in AD using the two large-scale transcriptomics datasets, i.e., Mayo        Clinic (77 controls and 81 AD samples) and ROSMAP (97 controls and 260 AD        samples). RESULTS: Our analysis identified interesting core neuroinflammation        signaling pathways, which are not systematically reported in the previous studies        of AD. Specifically, we identified 7 categories of signaling pathways implicated        on AD and related to virus infection: immune response, x-core signaling,        apoptosis, lipid dysfunctional, biosynthesis and metabolism, and mineral        absorption signaling pathways. More interestingly, most of the genes in the virus        infection, immune response, and x-core signaling pathways are associated with        inflammation molecular functions. The x-core signaling pathways were defined as a        group of 9 signaling proteins: MAPK, Rap1, NF-kappa B, HIF-1, PI3K-Akt, Wnt,        TGF-beta, Hippo, and TNF, which indicated the core neuroinflammation signaling        pathways responding to the low-level and weakly activated inflammation and        hypoxia and leading to the chronic neurodegeneration. It is interesting to        investigate the detailed signaling cascades of these weakly activated        neuroinflammation signaling pathways causing neurodegeneration in a chronic        process, and consequently uncover novel therapeutic targets for effective AD        treatment and prevention. CONCLUSIONS: The potential core neuroinflammation and        associated signaling targets and pathways were identified using integrative        network analysis on two large-scale transcriptomics datasets of AD.",PMC9551568,Frontiers in aging neuroscience,101525824

The well-known hallmarks of        AD are extracellular aggregates of amyloid β (Aβ) and intracellular        neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) of tau protein. The evidence that Aβ        overproduction leads to AD has paved the way for the AD pathogenesis amyloid        cascade hypothesis, which proposes that the neuronal damage is sustained by Aβ        overproduction. Consistently, AD cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers used in        clinical practice, including Aβ 1-42, Aβ 1-40, Aβ 42/40 ratio, and pTau, are        related to the amyloid hypothesis. Recently, it was suggested that the Aβ        deposition cascade cannot fully disclose AD pathogenesis, with other putative        players being involved in the pathophysiology of the disease. Among all, one of        the most studied factors is inflammation in the brain. Hence, biomarkers of        inflammation and microglia activation have also been proposed to identify AD.        Among them, CX3 chemokine ligand 1 (CX3CL1) has taken center stage. This        transmembrane protein, also known as fractalkine (FKN), is normally expressed in        neurons, featuring an N-terminal chemokine domain and an extended mucin-like        stalk, following a short intra-cytoplasmatic domain. The molecule exists in both        membrane-bound and soluble forms. It is accepted that the soluble and        membrane-bound forms of FKN evoke differential signaling within the CNS. Given        the link between CX3XL1 and microglial activation, it has been suggested that        CX3CL1 signaling disruption could play a part in the pathogenesis of AD.        Furthermore, a role for chemokine as a biomarker has been proposed. However, the        findings collected are controversial.

Three databases [PubMed (2209        articles), Scopus (1154 articles), and Science Direct (1040 articles)] were        researched. After applying the eligibility criteria, articles were selected for        peer review, independently, as they were identified by September 2021. The        protocol for this systematic review was registered in the PROSPERO. Of the 4417        articles found, 16 were selected for this systematic review. In the brain, EE        promoted a reduction in proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines.

Ten adults consisting of 6 PD patients and 4        healthy controls (HC) underwent one hour of dynamic [(18)F]NOS positron emission        tomography (PET) brain imaging with arterial blood sampling.

In this context, animal models that progressively display AD        pathological hallmarks (e.g. TgF344-AD) become crucial. Translational        technologies, such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), enable the        longitudinal metabolic characterization of this disease. However, an integrative        approach is required to unravel the complex metabolic changes underlying AD        progression, from early to advanced stages. TgF344-AD and wild-type (WT) rats        were studied in vivo on a 7 Tesla MRI scanner, for longitudinal quantitative        assessment of brain metabolic profile changes using MRS. Disease progression was        investigated at 4 time points, from 9 to 18 months of age, and in 4 regions:        cortex, hippocampus, striatum, and thalamus. Compared to WT, TgF344-AD rats        replicated common findings in AD patients, including decreased N-acetylaspartate        in the cortex, hippocampus and thalamus, and decreased glutamate in the thalamus        and striatum. Different longitudinal evolution of metabolic concentration was        observed between TgF344-AD and WT groups. Namely, age-dependent trajectories        differed between groups for creatine in the cortex and thalamus and for taurine        in cortex, with significant decreases in Tg344-AD animals; whereas myo-inositol        in the thalamus and striatum showed greater increase along time in the WT group.        Additional analysis revealed divergent intra- and inter-regional metabolic        coupling in each group. Thus, in cortex, strong couplings of N-acetylaspartate        and creatine with myo-inositol in WT, but with taurine in TgF344-AD rats were        observed; whereas in the hippocampus, myo-inositol, taurine and choline compounds        levels were highly correlated in WT but not in TgF344-AD animals. Furthermore,        specific cortex-hippocampus-striatum metabolic crosstalks were found for taurine        levels in the WT group but for myo-inositol levels in the TgF344-AD rats. With a        systems biology perspective of metabolic changes in AD pathology, our results        shed light into the complex spatio-temporal metabolic rewiring in this disease,        reported here for the first time. Age- and tissue-dependent imbalances between        myo-inositol, taurine and other metabolites, such as creatine, unveil their role        in disease progression, while pointing to the inadequacy of the latter as an        internal reference for quantification.",PMC9550832,Scientific reports,101563288

In this work, we investigated        how intragastric alcohol feeding may alter the liver-to-brain axis to induce        and/or promote AD pathology. Four weeks of intragastric alcohol feeding to mice,        which causes significant fatty liver (steatosis) and liver injury, caused no        changes in AD pathology markers in the brain [amyloid precursor protein (APP),        presenilin], except for a decrease in microglial cell number in the cortex of the        brain. Interestingly, the decline in microglial numbers correlated with serum        alanine transaminase (ALT) levels, suggesting a potential link between liver        injury and microglial loss in the brain. Intragastric alcohol feeding        significantly affected two hepatic proteins important in amyloid-beta (Aβ)        processing by the liver: 1) alcohol feeding downregulated lipoprotein        receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1, ∼46%), the major receptor in the liver that        removes Aβ from blood and peripheral organs, and 2) alcohol significantly        upregulated APP (∼2-fold), a potentially important source of Aβ in the periphery        and brain. The decrease in hepatic LRP1 and increase in hepatic APP likely        switches the liver from being a remover or low producer of Aβ to an important        source of Aβ in the periphery, which can impact the brain. The downregulation of        LRP1 and upregulation of APP in the liver was observed in the first week of        intragastric alcohol feeding, and also occurred in other alcohol feeding models        (NIAAA binge alcohol model and intragastric alcohol feeding to rats). Modulation        of hepatic LRP1 and APP does not seem alcohol-specific, as ob/ob mice with        significant steatosis also had declines in LRP1 and increases in APP expression        in the liver.

Ex vivo expansion of Tregs restores and        amplifies their immunosuppressive functions in vitro. A key question is whether        adoptive transfer of ex vivo expanded human Tregs can suppress neuroinflammation        and amyloid pathology in a preclinical mouse model. METHODS: An immunodeficient        mouse model of AD was generated by backcrossing the 5xFAD onto Rag2 knockout mice        (5xFAD-Rag2KO). Human Tregs were expanded ex vivo for 24 days and administered to        5xFAD-Rag2KO. Changes in amyloid burden, microglia characteristics and reactive        astrocytes were evaluated using ELISA and confocal microscopy. NanoString Mouse        AD multiplex gene expression analysis was applied to explore the impact of ex        vivo expanded Tregs on the neuroinflammation transcriptome. RESULTS: Elimination        of mature B and T lymphocytes and natural killer cells in 5xFAD-Rag2KO mice was        associated with upregulation of 95 inflammation genes and amplified number of        reactive microglia within the dentate gyrus. Administration of ex vivo expanded        Tregs reduced amyloid burden and reactive glial cells in the dentate gyrus and        frontal cortex of 5xFAD-Rag2KO mice. Interrogation of inflammation gene        expression documented down-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL1A&B,        IL6), complement cascade (C1qa, C1qb, C1qc, C4a/b), toll-like receptors (Tlr3,        Tlr4 and Tlr7) and microglial activations markers (CD14, Tyrobp,Trem2) following        Treg administration. CONCLUSIONS: Ex vivo expanded Tregs with amplified        immunomodulatory function, suppressed neuroinflammation and alleviated AD        pathology in vivo. Our results provide preclinical evidences for Treg cell        therapy as a potential treatment strategy in AD.",PMC9524037,Acta neuropathologica communications,101610673

It has long been known that autoimmune        diseases and chronic inflammatory disorders are characterized by dysregulated        immune responses, leading to excessive and uncontrol tissue inflammation. The        dysregulation of epigenetic alterations including DNA methylation,        posttranslational modifications to histone proteins, and noncoding RNA expression        has been implicated in a host of inflammatory disorders and the immune system.        The inflammatory response is considered as a critical trigger of epigenetic        alterations that in turn intercede inflammatory actions. Thus, understanding the        molecular mechanism that dictates the outcome of targeting epigenetic regulators        for inflammatory disease is required for inflammation resolution. In this        article, we elucidate the critical role of the nuclear factor-κB signaling        pathway, JAK/STAT signaling pathway, and the NLRP3 inflammasome in chronic        inflammatory diseases. And we formulate the relationship between inflammation,        coronavirus disease 2019, and human cancers. Additionally, we review the        mechanism of epigenetic modifications involved in inflammation and innate immune        cells. All that matters is that we propose and discuss the rejuvenation potential        of interventions that target epigenetic regulators and regulatory mechanisms for        chronic inflammation-associated diseases to improve therapeutic outcomes.",PMC9477794,MedComm,101769925

Currants, a low glycemic index dried fruit,        and their components display pleiotropic neuroprotective effects in AD. We        examined how diet containing 5% Corinthian currant paste (CurD) administered in        1-month-old 5xFAD mice for 1, 3, and 6 months affects Aβ levels and        neuroinflammation in comparison to control diet (ConD) or sugar-matched diet        containing 3.5% glucose/fructose (GFD). No change in serum glucose or insulin        levels was observed among the three groups. CurD administered for 3 months        reduced brain Aβ42 levels in male mice as compared to ConD and GFD, but after        6 months, Aβ42 levels were increased in mice both on CurD and GFD compared to        ConD. CurD for 3 months also reduced TNFα and IL-1β levels in male and female        mouse cortex homogenates compared to ConD and GFD. However, after 6 months, TNFα        levels were increased in cortex homogenates of mice both on CurD and GFD as        compared to ConD. A similar pattern was observed for TNFα-expressing cells,        mostly co-expressing the microglial marker CD11b, in mouse hippocampus. IL-1β        levels were similarly increased in the brain of all groups after 6 months.        Furthermore, a time dependent decrease of secreted TNFα levels was found in BV2        microglial cells treated with currant phenolic extract as compared to        glucose/fructose solution. Overall, our findings suggest that a short-term        currant consumption reduces neuroinflammation in 5xFAD mice as compared to        sugar-matched or control diet, but longer-term intake of currant or sugar-matched        diet enhances neuroinflammation.",PMC9616770,Molecular neurobiology,8900963

Here, a Mendelian Randomization (MR) study was        conducted to explore whether genetically predicted concentrations of glycine,        glutamate and serotonin were associated with risks of Alzheimer's disease (AD),        Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). From three        genome-wide association studies of European ancestry, single nucleotide        polymorphisms strongly associated with glycine, glutamate and serotonin were        selected as genetic instrumental variables. Corresponding summary statistics were        also obtained from the latest genome-wide association meta-analyses of AD, PD and        ALS. The inverse-variance weighted MR and multiple sensitivity analyses were        performed to evaluate causal effects of genetically predicted levels of        neurotransmitters on risks of neurodegenerative diseases. The statistical        significance threshold was set at P < 0.0056 using the Bonferroni-correction,        while 0.0056 < P < 0.05 was considered suggestive evidence for a causal        association. There was a causal association of elevated blood glutamate levels        with higher AD risks. The odds ratio (OR) of AD was 1.311 [95% confidence        interval (CI), 1.087-1.580; P = 0.004] per one standard deviation increase in        genetically predicted glutamate concentrations. There was suggestive evidence in        support of a protective effect of blood serotonin on AD (OR = 0.607; 95% CI,        0.396-0.932; P = 0.022). Genetically predicted glycine levels were not associated        with the risk of AD (OR = 1.145; 95% CI, 0.939-1.396; P = 0.180). Besides, MR        analyses indicated no causal roles of three blood neurotransmitters in PD or ALS.        In conclusion, the MR study provided evidence supporting the association of        elevated blood glutamate levels with higher AD risks and the association of        increased blood serotonin levels with lower AD risks.

In this regard, accelerating the resolution process in chronic        neuroinflammation may be an effective strategy to deal with the cognitive        consequences of neuropathology and generalized inflammatory processes.        N-acylethanolamine (NAE) derivatives of fatty acids, being highly active lipid        mediators, possess pro-resolving activity in inflammatory processes and are        promising agents for the suppression of neuroinflammation and its consequences.        This paper is devoted to a study of the effects played by dietary supplement        (DS), containing a composition of fatty acid-derived NAEs, obtained from squid        Berryteuthis magister, on the hippocampal neuroinflammatory and memory processes.        By detecting the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and glial markers, a        pronounced anti-inflammatory activity of DS was demonstrated both in vitro and in        vivo.

Copper(II) complexes of        bis(thiosemicarbazones) (Cu(II)(gtsm) and Cu(II)(atsm)) have broad therapeutic        actions in preclinical models of neurodegeneration, with Cu(II)(atsm)        demonstrating beneficial outcomes on neuroinflammatory markers in vitro and in        vivo. These findings suggest that copper(II) complexes could be harnessed as a        new approach to modulate immune function in neurodegenerative diseases. In this        study, we examined the anti-neuroinflammatory action of several        low-molecular-weight, charge-neutral and lipophilic copper(II) complexes. Our        analysis revealed that one compound, a thiosemicarbazone-pyridylhydrazone        copper(II) complex (CuL(5)), delivered copper into cells in vitro and increased        the concentration of copper in the brain in vivo. In a primary murine microglia        culture, CuL(5) was shown to decrease secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokine        macrophage chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) and expression of tumor necrosis        factor alpha (Tnf), increase expression of metallothionein (Mt1), and modulate        expression of Alzheimer's disease-associated risk genes, Trem2 and Cd33.

This        study investigated the binding of sonidegib to JNK3 via (19)F NMR and its        inhibitory effect on JNK phosphorylation in BV2 cells. Pharmacological properties        of sonidegib to exert anti-inflammatory and anti-migratory effects were also        characterized. We found that sonidegib bound to the ATP binding site of JNK3 and        inhibited JNK phosphorylation in BV2 cells, confirming our virtual screening        results. Sonidegib also inhibited the phosphorylation of MKK4 and c-Jun, the        upstream and downstream signals of JNK, respectively. It reduced the        lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced production of pro-inflammatory factors,        including interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and        nitric oxide (NO), and the expression of inducible NO synthase and        cyclooxygenase-2. The LPS-induced cell migration was suppressed by sonidegib.        Sonidegib inhibited the LPS-induced IκBα phosphorylation, thereby blocking NF-κB        nuclear translocation. Consistent with these findings, orally administered        sonidegib attenuated IL-6 and TNF-α levels in the brains of LPS-treated mice.        Collectively, our results indicate that sonidegib suppresses inflammation and        cell migration in LPS-treated BV2 cells and mice by inhibiting JNK and NF-κB        signaling.

The asparaginyl        endopeptidase (AEP) or legumain is the only recognized cysteine protease that        specifically hydrolyzes peptide bonds after asparagine residues in mammals. The        expression level of AEPs in healthy brains is far lower than that of peripheral        organs. Recently, growing evidence has indicated that aging may upregulate and        overactivate brain AEPs. The overactivation of AEPs drives the onset of AD        through cleaving tau and amyloid precursor proteins (APP), and SET, an inhibitor        of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). The AEP-mediated cleavage of these peptides        enhances amyloidosis, promotes tau hyperphosphorylation, and ultimately induces        neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment. Upregulated AEPs and related        deleterious reactions constitute upstream events of amyloid/tau toxicity in the        brain, and represent early pathological changes in AD. Thus, upregulated AEPs are        an emerging drug target for disease modification and a potential biomarker for        predicting preclinical AD. However, the presence of the blood-brain barrier        greatly hinders establishing body-fluid-based methods to measure brain AEPs.        Research on AEP-activity-based imaging probes and our recent work suggest that        the live brain imaging of AEPs could be used to evaluate its predictive efficacy        as an AD biomarker.

Additionally,        we show that following TLR3 agonist treatment, microglia and astrocytes play        opposing roles in the neuroinflammatory response, and that the observed response        is dictated by the degree of TLR3 activation. Overall, we demonstrate that        microglia play a significant role in the neuroinflammatory response to TLR        activation in vitro and, hence, the tri-culture has the potential to serve as a        screening platform that better replicates the in vivo responses.",PMC9495748,Biomedicines,101691304

The results at        light and electron microscopy showed that LPS-activation induced morphological        modifications of HMC3 cells from elongated/branched to larger roundish shape,        cytoplasmic accumulation of lipid droplets, decreased electron density of the        cytoplasm and mitochondria, decreased amount of Nrf2 and increased migration        rate, while biomolecular data demonstrated that Heme oxygenase 1 gene expression        and the secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines, Interleukin-6, and tumor        necrosis factor-α augmented. O(3) treatment did not affect cell viability,        proliferation, and morphological features of both LPS-activated and LPS + DMF        cells, whereas the cell motility and the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines        were significantly decreased. This evidence suggests that modulation of microglia        activity may contribute to the beneficial effects of the O(2) -O(3) therapy in        patients with neurodegenerative disorders characterized by chronic inflammation.        HIGHLIGHTS: Low-dose ozone (O(3) ) does not damage activated microglial cells in        vitro Low-dose O(3) decreases cell motility and pro-inflammatory cytokine        secretion in activated microglial cells in vitro Low-dose O(3) potentiates the        effect of an anti-inflammatory drug on activated microglial cells.",PMC9826497,Microscopy research and technique,9203012

METHODS: We evaluated the cooperative function of APP/PS1        transgenic AD model mice at ages 2, 5, and 8 months by using a cooperative        drinking task. We examined neuropathologic changes in the medial prefrontal        cortex (mPFC). Another experiment was designed to observe whether miconazole,        which has a repairing effect on myelin sheath, could promote the cooperative        ability of APP/PS1 mice in the early AD-like stage. We also investigated the        protective effects of miconazole on cultured mouse cortical oligodendrocytes        exposed to human amyloid β peptide (Aβ1-42). RESULTS: We observed an        age-dependent impairment of cooperative water drinking behavior in APP/PS1 mice.        The AD mice with cooperative dysfunction showed decreases in myelin sheath        thickness, oligodendrocyte nuclear heterochromatin percentage, and myelin basic        protein expression levels in the mPFC. The cooperative ability was significantly        improved in APP/PS1 mice treated with miconazole. Miconazole treatment increased        oligodendrocyte maturation and myelin sheath thickness without reducing Aβ plaque        deposition, reactive gliosis, and inflammatory factor levels in the mPFC.        Miconazole also protected cultured oligodendrocytes from the toxicity of Aβ1-42.        CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that mPFC hypomyelination is involved in        the cooperative deficits of APP/PS1 mice. Improving myelination through        miconazole therapy may offer a potential therapeutic approach for early        intervention in AD.",PMC9670758,The international journal of neuropsychopharmacology,9815893

Exercise has been demonstrated to        relieve anxiety-like symptoms during METH withdrawal, but the underlying        mechanisms of this anti-anxiety effect are still unclear. Activated microglia and        abnormal neuroinflammation play an important role in the pathogenesis of        anxiety-like symptoms after METH withdrawal. Moreover, peripheral immune factors        were also significantly associated with anxiety symptoms. However, the effects of        treadmill exercise on microglial function and neuroinflammation in the striatum        and hippocampus during acute METH withdrawal have not been reported. In the        current study, we found severe peripheral immune dysfunction in METH users during        acute withdrawal, which may in part contribute to anxiety symptoms during METH        acute withdrawal. We also showed that 2 weeks of METH exposure induced        anxiety-like symptoms in the acute withdrawal period. Additionally, METH exposure        resulted in increased microglial activation and proinflammatory cytokines        released in the mouse striatum and hippocampus during acute withdrawal. We next        evaluated the effects of treadmill exercise in countering anxiety-like symptoms        induced by METH acute withdrawal. The results showed that anxiety-like symptoms        induced by acute METH withdrawal were attenuated by coadministration of treadmill        exercise. In addition, treadmill exercise counteracted METH-induced microglial        activation in the mouse striatum and various subregions of the hippocampus.        Furthermore, treadmill exercise also reversed the increase in proinflammatory        cytokines induced by acute METH withdrawal in the mouse striatum, hippocampus and        serum. Our findings suggest that the anti-anxiety effect of treadmill exercise        may be mediated by reducing microglial activation and regulating central and        peripheral inflammatory responses.",PMC9465459,Frontiers in molecular neuroscience,101477914

Based on their 5-year cognitive        progression, we stratified 117 cognitively normal participants (78.3 ± 4.0 years        of age, 52 women) into three age-matched groups, each with a different level of        risk for Alzheimer's disease. From their fluorodeoxyglucose PET we constructed        metabolic networks, evaluated their modular structures using the Louvain        algorithm, and compared them between risk groups. As the risk for Alzheimer's        disease increased, the metabolic connections among brain regions weakened and        became more modular, indicating network fragmentation and functional impairment        of the brain. We then set out to determine the correlation between regional brain        metabolism, particularly in the modules derived from the previous analysis, and        the regional expression of Alzheimer-risk genes in the brain, obtained from the        Allen Human Brain Atlas. In all risk groups of this elderly population, the        regional brain expression of most Alzheimer-risk genes showed a strong        correlation with brain metabolism, particularly in the module that corresponded        to regions of the brain that are affected earliest and most severely in        Alzheimer's disease. Among the genes, APOE and CD33 showed the strongest negative        correlation and SORL1 showed the strongest positive correlation with brain        metabolism. The Pearson correlation coefficients remained significant when        contrasted against a null-hypothesis distribution of correlation coefficients        across the whole transcriptome of 20 736 genes (SORL1: P = 0.0130; CD33,        P = 0.0136; APOE: P = 0.0093). The strong regional correlation between        Alzheimer-related gene expression in the brain and brain metabolism in older        adults highlights the role of brain metabolism in the genesis of dementia.",PMC9453434,Brain communications,101755125

The predominant clinical        manifestation of COVID-19 is respiratory dysfunction, while neurological        presentations are increasingly being recognized. SARS-CoV-2 invades host cells        primarily via attachment of the spike protein to the angiotensin-converting        enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor expressed on cell membranes.

Cerebral atrophy, amyloid-β (Aβ)        plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles represent the main pathological hallmarks of        the AD brain. Recently, neuroinflammation has been recognized as a prominent        feature of the AD brain and substantial evidence suggests that the inflammatory        response modulates disease progression. Additionally, dysregulation of calcium        (Ca(2+)) homeostasis represents another early factor involved in the AD        pathogenesis, as intracellular Ca(2+) concentration is essential to ensure proper        cellular and neuronal functions. Although growing evidence supports the        involvement of Ca(2+) in the mechanisms of neurodegeneration-related inflammatory        processes, scant data are available on its contribution in microglia and        astrocytes functioning, both in health and throughout the AD continuum.        Nevertheless, AD-related aberrant Ca(2+) signalling in astrocytes and microglia        is crucially involved in the mechanisms underpinning neuroinflammatory processes        that, in turn, impact neuronal Ca(2+) homeostasis and brain function.

This study explored AD-related diagnostic        and therapeutic biomarkers from the perspective of immune infiltration by        analyzing public data from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus database. METHOD: In        this study, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was conducted to        identify modules and hub genes contributing to AD development. A protein-protein        interaction network was constructed when the genes in the modules were enriched        and examined by Gene Ontology (GO)/Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)        analysis. Furthermore, a gene network was established using topological WGCNA,        from which five hub genes were selected. Logistic regression analysis and        receiver operating characteristic curve analysis were performed to explore the        clinical value of genes in AD diagnosis. The genes in the core module intersected        with the hub genes, and four intersection genes (ATP2A2, ATP6V1D, CAP2, and        SYNJ1) were selected. These four genes were enriched by gene set enrichment        analysis (GSEA). Finally, an immune infiltration analysis was performed. RESULTS:        The GO/KEGG analysis suggested that genes in the core module played a role in the        differentiation and growth of neural cells and in the transmission of        neurotransmitters. The GSEA of core genes showed that these four genes were        mainly enriched in immune/infection pathways (e.g., cholera infection and        Helicobacter pylori infection pathways) and other metabolic pathways. An        investigation of immune infiltration characteristics revealed that activated mast        cells, regulatory T cells, plasma cells, neutrophils, T follicular helper cells,        CD8 T cells, resting memory CD4 T cells, and M1 macrophages were the core immune        cells contributing to AD progression. qRT-PCR analysis showed that the ATP6V1D is        upregulated in AD. CONCLUSION: The results of enrichment and immuno-osmotic        analyses indicated that immune pathways and immune cells played an important role        in the occurrence and development of AD.

We investigated cross-sectional and        longitudinal associations between CBF, amyloid burden, and cognition, in        cognitively normal individuals with subjective cognitive decline (SCD). METHODS:        We included 187 cognitively normal individuals with SCD from the SCIENCe project        (65 ± 8 years, 39% F, MMSE 29 ± 1). Each underwent a dynamic (0-70 min)        [(18)F]florbetapir PET and T1-weighted MRI scan, enabling calculation of mean        binding potential (BP(ND); specific amyloid binding) and R(1) (measure of        relative (r)CBF). Eighty-three individuals underwent a second [(18)F]florbetapir        PET (2.6 ± 0.7 years). Participants annually underwent neuropsychological        assessment (follow-up time 3.8 ± 3.1 years; number of observations n = 774).        RESULTS: A low baseline R(1) was associated with steeper decline on tests        addressing memory, attention, and global cognition (range betas 0.01 to 0.27,        p < 0.05). High BP(ND) was associated with steeper decline on tests covering all        domains (range betas - 0.004 to - 0.70, p < 0.05).

The results        indicated that Pb exposure induced pathological damage in cerebral cortex,        accompanied by increased levels of inflammatory factors tumor necrosis        factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β). Moreover, Pb decreased the        expression of silencing information regulator 2 related enzyme 1 (SIRT1) and        brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and increased the levels of high mobile        group box 1 (HMGB1) expression and p65 nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) phosphorylation.        PAS-Na treatment ameliorated Pb-induced histopathological changes in rat cerebral        cortex. Moreover, PAS-Na reduced the Pb-induced increase of TNF-α and IL-1β        levels concomitant with a significant increase in SIRT1 and BDNF levels, and a        decrease in HMGB1 and the phosphorylation of p65 NF-κB expression. Thus, PAS-Na        may exert anti-inflammatory effects by mediating the SIRT1/HMGB1/NF-κB pathway        and BDNF expression.

All images were automatically processed with AccuBrain(®) to        calculate the AD-RAI. Its same-day repeatability and 2-week reproducibility were        first assessed. The discriminative performance of AD-RAI was evaluated using the        receiver operating characteristic curve, where DeLong's test was used to evaluate        its performance against quantitative medial temporal lobe atrophy (QMTA) and        hippocampal volume adjusted by intracranial volume (ICV)-proportions and        ICV-residuals methods, respectively (HVR and HRV). Linear mixed-effects modelling        was used to investigate longitudinal trajectories of AD-RAI and baseline AD-RAI        prediction of cognitive decline. Finally, the longitudinal associations between        AD-RAI and MMSE scores were assessed. RESULTS: AD-RAI had excellent same-day        repeatability and excellent 2-week reproducibility. AD-RAI's AUC (99.8%; 95%CI =        [99.3%, 100%]) was equivalent to that of QMTA (96.8%; 95%CI = [92.9%, 100%]), and        better than that of HVR (86.8%; 95%CI = [78.2%, 95.4%]) or HRV (90.3%; 95%CI =        [83.0%, 97.6%]). While baseline AD-RAI was significantly higher in the AD group,        it did not show detectable changes over 2 years. Baseline AD-RAI was negatively        associated with MMSE scores and the rate of the change in MMSE scores over time.        A negative longitudinal association was also found between AD-RAI values and the        MMSE scores among AD patients.

Currently, the standard symptomatic therapy,        based on acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, showed a limited therapeutic potential,        whereas disease-modifying treatment strategies are still under extensive        research. Previous studies have demonstrated that Oxotremorine-M (Oxo), a        non-selective muscarinic acetylcholine receptors agonist, exerts neurotrophic        functions in primary neurons, and modulates oxidative stress and        neuroinflammation phenomena in rat brain.

PURPOSE: This study aimed to design a nanocrystalline        suspension (NS)-based MTK prolonged delivery system and evaluate its        pharmacokinetics profile and local tolerability following subcutaneous        administration. METHODS: To decelerate the dissolution rate, the amorphous MTK        raw material was transformed into a crystalline state using a solvent-mediated        transformation method and subsequently formulated into NS using a bead-milling        technique. The MTK NSs were characterized by morphology, particle size,        crystallinity, and in vitro dissolution profiles. The pharmacokinetic profile and        local tolerability at the injection site following subcutaneous injection of MTK        suspension were evaluated in rats. RESULTS: Microscopic and physical        characterization revealed that the amorphous MTK powder was lucratively        transformed into a crystalline form in acidic media (pH 4). MTK crystalline        suspensions with different diameters (200 nm, 500 nm, and 3 μm) were uniformly        prepared using bead-milling technology, employing polysorbate 80 as suspending        agent. Prepared crystalline suspensions exhibited analogous crystallinity        (melting point, 150°C) and size-dependent in vitro dissolution profiles.

In this        study, we aimed to investigate the correlations among different types of Aβ        plaque and AD-related neuropathological and cognitive changes based on a        postmortem human brain bank in China. The results indicated that focal plaques,        but not diffuse plaques, significantly increased with age in the human        hippocampus.

Delirium is        an acute confusional state characterized by inattention, cognitive dysfunction        and an altered level of consciousness, whereas dementia is an insidious, chronic        and progressive loss of a previously acquired cognitive ability. People with        dementia have a higher risk of developing delirium than the general population,        and the occurrence of delirium is an independent risk factor for subsequent        development of dementia. Furthermore, delirium in individuals with dementia can        accelerate the trajectory of the underlying cognitive decline. Delirium        prevention strategies can reduce the incidence of delirium and associated adverse        outcomes, including falls and functional decline. Therefore, delirium might        represent a modifiable risk factor for dementia, and interventions that prevent        or minimize delirium might also reduce or prevent long-term cognitive impairment.        Additionally, understanding the pathophysiology of delirium and the connection        between delirium and dementia might ultimately lead to additional treatments for        both conditions.

Activation of TMEM16F has been        studied in various central nervous system diseases. High TMEM16F level has been        also found to participate in microglial phagocytosis and transformation.        Microglia-mediated neuroinflammation is a key factor in promoting the progression        of Alzheimer's disease. However, few studies have examined the effects of TMEM16F        on neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease. In this study, we established        TMEM16F-knockdown AD model in vitro and in vivo to investigate the underlying        regulatory mechanism about TMEM16F-mediated neuroinflammation in AD. We performed        a Morris water maze test to evaluate the spatial memory ability of animals and        detected markers for the microglia M1/M2 phenotype and NLRP3 inflammasome. Our        results showed that TMEM16F was elevated in 9-month-old APP/PS1 mice. After        TMEM16F knockdown in mice, spatial memory ability was improved, microglia        polarization to the M2 phenotype was promoted, NLRP3 inflammasome activation was        inhibited, cell apoptosis and Aβ plaque deposition in brain tissue were reduced,        and brain injury was alleviated. We used amyloid-beta (Aβ(25-35)) to stimulate        human microglia to construct microglia models of Alzheimer's disease. The levels        of TMEM16F, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), proinflammatory cytokines and        NLRP3 inflammasome-associated biomarkers were higher in Aβ(25-35) treated group        compared with that in the control group. TMEM16F knockdown enhanced the        expression of the M2 phenotype biomarkers Arg1 and Socs3, reduced the release of        proinflammatory factors interleukin-1, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α,        and inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation through reducing downstream        proinflammatory factors interleukin-1β and interleukin-18. This inhibitory effect        of TMEM16F knockdown on M1 microglia was partially reversed by the NLRP3 agonist        Nigericin. Our findings suggest that TMEM16F participates in neuroinflammation in        Alzheimer's disease through participating in polarization of microglia and        activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. These results indicate that TMEM16F        inhibition may be a potential therapeutic approach for Alzheimer's disease        treatment.",PMC9727423,Neural regeneration research,101316351

However, there is a lack of effective        drugs to treat neuroinflammation. N-acetyldopamine dimer (NADD) is a natural        compound from the traditional Chinese medicine Isaria cicada. In our previous        study, we found that NADD can attenuate DSS-induced ulcerative colitis by        suppressing the NF-κB and MAPK pathways. Does NADD inhibit neuroinflammation, and        what is the target of NADD? To answer this question, lipopolysaccharide        (LPS)-stimulated BV-2 microglia was used as a cell model to investigate the        effect of NADD on neuroinflammation. Nitric oxide (NO) detection, reactive oxygen        species (ROS) detection and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) results        show that NADD attenuates inflammatory signals and proinflammatory cytokines in        LPS-stimulated BV-2 microglia, including NO, ROS, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α,        interleukin (IL)-1β and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Western blot analysis show that        NADD inhibits the protein levels of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), nuclear factor        kappa-B (NF-κB), NOD-like receptor thermal protein domain associated protein 3        (NLRP3), ASC and cysteinyl aspartate specific proteinase (Caspase)-1, indicating        that NADD may inhibit neuroinflammation through the TLR4/NF-κB and        NLRP3/Caspase-1 signaling pathways. In addition, surface plasmon resonance assays        and molecular docking demonstrate that NADD binds with TLR4 directly. Our study        reveals a new role of NADD in inhibiting the TLR4/NF-κB and NLRP3/Caspase-1        pathways, and shows that TLR4-MD2 is the direct target of NADD, which may provide        a potential therapeutic candidate for the treatment of neuroinflammation.",PMC10157536,Acta biochimica et biophysica Sinica,101206716

However, BDC is almost insoluble in water, poorly        absorbed by the organism, and degrades rapidly. We thus developed a new        nanoformulation of BDC based on H-Ferritin nanocages (BDC-HFn). METHODS: We        tested the BDC-HFn solubility, stability, and ability to cross a blood-brain        barrier (BBB) model. We tested the effect of BDC-HFn on AD and control (CTR)        PBMCs to evaluate the transcriptomic profile by RNA-seq. RESULTS: We developed a        nanoformulation with a diameter of 12 nm to improve the solubility and stability.        The comparison of the transcriptomics analyses between AD patients before and        after BDC-HFn treatment showed a major number of DEG (2517). The pathway analysis        showed that chemokines and macrophages activation differed between AD patients        and controls after BDC-HFn treatment. BDC-HFn binds endothelial cells from the        cerebral cortex and crosses through a BBB in vitro model. CONCLUSIONS: Our data        showed how BDC-Hfn could improve the stability of BDC. Significant differences in        genes associated with inflammation between the same patients before and after        BDC-Hfn treatment have been found.

In the        pathogenesis of AD, aggregates of amyloid β (Aβ) and neurofibrillary tangles        (NFTs) containing Tau-microtubule-associated protein (tau) are known to trigger a        neuroinflammatory response with subsequent formation of an inflammasome. In        particular, the NOD-like receptor pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome        is thought to play a crucial role in AD-related pathology. While the mechanisms        for NLRP3 activation are not fully understood, it has been demonstrated that,        after detection of protein aggregates, NLRP3 induces pro-inflammatory cytokines,        such as interleukin 18 (IL-18) or interleukin 1β (IL-1β), that further potentiate        AD progression. Specific inhibitors of NLRP3 that exhibit various mechanisms to        attenuate the activity of NLRP3 have been tested in in vivo studies and have        yielded promising results, as shown by the reduced level of tau and Aβ aggregates        and diminished cognitive impairment. Herein, we would like to summarize the        current state of knowledge on NLRP3 inflammasome priming, activation, and its        actual role in AD pathogenesis, and to characterize the NLRP3 inhibitors that        have been studied most and their impact on AD-related pathology.",PMC9409081,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791

A number        of preclinical studies suggested that CBD exhibited potent inhibitory effects of        neurotoxic molecules and inflammatory modulators, highlighting its remarkable        therapeutic potential for the treatment of numerous neurological disorders.        However, the molecular mechanisms of action underpinning CBD's effects on        neuroinflammation appear to be complex and are poorly understood. This review        summarises the anti-neuroinflammatory activities of CBD against various        neurological disorders with a particular focus on their main molecular mechanisms        of action, which were related to the downregulation of NADPH oxidase-mediated        ROS, TLR4-NFκB and IFN-β-JAK-STAT pathways. We also illustrate the        pharmacological action of CBD's derivatives focusing on their        anti-neuroinflammatory and neuroprotective effects for neurological disorders. We        included the studies that demonstrated synergistic enhanced        anti-neuroinflammatory activity using CBD and other biomolecules. The studies        that are summarised in the review shed light on the development of CBD, including        its derivatives and combination preparations as novel therapeutic options for the        prevention and/or treatment of neurological disorders where neuroinflammation        plays an important role in the pathological components.",PMC9370304,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",100964009

In our        preliminary study, the aerial part of Artemisia iwayomogi inhibits LPS-induced        microglial activation. The present study aims to identify chemical constituents        with anti-neuroinflammatory properties in the aerial parts of A. iwayomogi. Two        new guaianolide sesquiterpenes, iwayomogins A and B (1 and 2), along with        thirteen known sesquiterpene lactones (3-15), one diterpene glycoside (16), and        nine phenolic compounds (17-25) were isolated from the aerial parts of A.        iwayomogi by repeated chromatography. The structures of the isolates were        elucidated by their spectroscopic data. All isolates were evaluated for their        inhibitory activities on nitric oxide (NO) production in LPS-induced BV-2        microglial cells. 2,3-Dehydro-1-epi-asperilin (11) exhibited the strongest        inhibitory effect on NO production (IC(50) value of 1.78 μM). In the molecular        docking study, three compounds (1, 2, and 11) showed good binding affinities with        iNOS. Additionally, compounds 1, 2, and 11 inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokines        (TNF-α and IL-6) in dose-dependent manners. The present study demonstrates that        the chemical constituents from A. iwayomogi inhibit NO production and        pro-inflammatory cytokine release in BV-2 cells.

Recently, we        identified miR-483-5p as the most upregulated miRNA amongst a panel of miRNAs in        blood plasma specific to prodromal, early-stage Alzheimer's disease patients.        Here, we investigated the functional role of miR-483-5p in AD pathology. Using        TargetScan and miRTarBase, we identified the microtubule-associated protein MAPT,        often referred to as TAU, and the extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2        (ERK1 and ERK2), known to phosphorylate TAU, as predicted direct targets of        miR-483-5p. Employing several functional assays, we found that miR-483-5p        regulates ERK1 and ERK2 at both mRNA and protein levels, resulting in lower        levels of phosphorylated forms of both kinases. Moreover, miR-483-5p-mediated        repression of ERK1/2 resulted in reduced phosphorylation of TAU protein at        epitopes associated with TAU neurofibrillary pathology in AD. These results        indicate that upregulation of miR-483-5p can decrease phosphorylation of TAU via        ERK pathway, representing a compensatory neuroprotective mechanism in AD        pathology. This miR-483-5p/ERK1/TAU axis thus represents a novel target for        intervention in AD.",PMC8037306,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791

Unfortunately,        despite decades of studies being performed on these histological alterations,        there is no effective treatment or cure for AD. Identifying the molecular        characteristics of the disease is imperative to understanding the pathogenesis of        AD. Furthermore, uncovering the key causative alterations of AD can be valuable        in developing models for AD treatment. Several alterations have been implicated        in driving this disease, including blood-brain barrier dysfunction, hypoxia,        mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, glucose hypometabolism, and altered        heme homeostasis. Although these alterations have all been associated with the        progression of AD, the root cause of AD has not been identified. Intriguingly,        recent studies have pinpointed dysfunctional heme metabolism as a culprit of the        development of AD. Heme has been shown to be central in neuronal function,        mitochondrial respiration, and oxidative stress. Therefore, dysregulation of heme        homeostasis may play a pivotal role in the manifestation of AD and its various        alterations.

We carried out a neuropathological and biochemical analysis on a        series of AD brain samples, gathering evidence about the heterogeneous        involvement of microglia in AD. The neuropathological studies showed differences        concerning morphology, density and distribution of microglial cells among AD        brains. Biochemical investigations showed increased brain levels of IL-4, IL-6,        IL-13, CCL17, MMP-7 and CXCL13 in AD in comparison with control subjects. The        molecular profiling achieved by measuring the brain levels of 25 inflammatory        factors known to be involved in neuroinflammation allowed a stratification of the        AD patients in three distinct ""neuroinflammatory clusters"". These findings        strengthen the relevance of neuroinflammation in AD pathogenesis suggesting, in        particular, that the differential involvement of neuroinflammatory molecules        released by microglial cells during the development of the disease may contribute        to modulate the characteristics and the severity of the neuropathological        changes, driving-at least in part-the AD phenotypic diversity.",PMC7967159,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791

Their inter-individual variations, complex        interrelations, and relevance for clinical manifestation and disease progression        remain poorly understood. We hypothesize that specific molecular patterns        indicating both known and yet unidentified pathway alterations are associated        with distinct aspects of AD pathology. METHODS: We performed multi-level        cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) omics in a well-characterized cohort of older adults        with normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment, and mild dementia. Proteomics,        metabolomics, lipidomics, one-carbon metabolism, and neuroinflammation related        molecules were analyzed at single-omic level with correlation and regression        approaches. Multi-omics factor analysis was used to integrate all biological        levels. Identified analytes were used to construct best predictive models of the        presence of AD pathology and of cognitive decline with multifactorial regression        analysis. Pathway enrichment analysis identified pathway alterations in AD.        RESULTS: Multi-omics integration identified five major dimensions of        heterogeneity explaining the variance within the cohort and differentially        associated with AD. Further analysis exposed multiple interactions between single        'omics modalities and distinct multi-omics molecular signatures differentially        related to amyloid pathology, neuronal injury, and tau hyperphosphorylation.        Enrichment pathway analysis revealed overrepresentation of the hemostasis, immune        response, and extracellular matrix signaling pathways in association with AD.        Finally, combinations of four molecules improved prediction of both AD (protein        14-3-3 zeta/delta, clusterin, interleukin-15, and transgelin-2) and cognitive        decline (protein 14-3-3 zeta/delta, clusterin, cholesteryl ester 27:1 16:0 and        monocyte chemoattractant protein-1).
