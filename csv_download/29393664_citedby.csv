Providers of specimen resources should strive to        incorporate new technologies and state-of-the-science approaches and thus ensure        the availability of fit-for-purpose research specimens. Strategies to achieve        quality outcomes and performance improvements often include adherence to        established standards and implementation of best practices. Although standards        represent a rigid set of guidelines that define exactly how a task should be        completed, best practices are recommended actions and principles that demonstrate        an awareness of standards, solve problems, can be replicated, and work in a given        context. Adoption of best practice elements will vary based on the goals and        circumstances of a given initiative, and in some instances, may not be possible        to implement or may represent an aspirational achievement. In an effort to        harmonize the scientific, technical, legal, and ethical issues relevant to        repositories of biological and environmental specimens, the International Society        for Biological and Environmental Repositories (ISBER) has released the updated        ISBER Best Practices: Recommendations for Repositories (ISBER Best Practices).        The document provides a comprehensive tool to guide repository professionals in        both managerial and technical aspects such as practical details on repository        governance, development, and operation; regulatory compliance; and ethical,        legal, and social issues relevant to repositories. This summary describes the        process for revising the document and summarizes the new topics, updates, and        areas of expansion included in the fourth edition of ISBER Best Practices.",PMC5846567,Biopreservation and biobanking,101507284

One of the fastest growing areas is biobanking. However, even with        the best equipment and the best trained staff, a biobank will be useless without        donors. For this reason, we have decided to gauge Polish citizens' awareness and        attitudes towards biobanking and their willingness to donate biological samples.        For this purpose the survey was conducted among a nationwide group of 1052 Poles        aged 18 and over where the totals for gender, age and place of residence were        selected according to their representation in the total population of adult        Poles. The survey was conducted using the Computer Assisted Web Interview (CAWI)        technique. Approximately two thirds of respondents N = 701 (66.6%) indicated that        they had heard of scientific studies in which samples of biological material such        as blood, saliva or urine are collected. More than half of respondents (N = 613,        58.3%) had a positive opinion regarding scientific research in which samples of        biological material are taken. Only N = 220 (20.9%) of respondents had previously        encountered the term biobanking. More than a half N = 687 (65.3%) of respondents        would participate in a scientific study that biobanked biological material and        health information. Almost half of the respondents (48.0%) would like specific        consent to be used in biobanking. In our study we observed a negligible        correlation between socio-demographic factors and a willingness to donate        biological material to a biobank. Considering the results presented above, the        level of knowledge and awareness of biobanks, and their role in scientific        research and the health care system, among Polish citizens is low and requires        education and information activities.",PMC10606933,"Healthcare (Basel, Switzerland)",101666525

AMH levels were measured in        all the samples simultaneously using the chemiluminescent kit ACCESS AMH in a        UniCel(®) DxI 800 Immunoassay System (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA). The study        proved that AMH retains a relatively high degree of stability during repeated        freezing and thawing in serum. AMH was shown to be less stable in plasma samples.        Room temperature proved to be the least suitable condition for the storage of        samples before performing the biomarker analysis. During the testing of storage        stability at 5-7 °C, the values decreased over time for all the plasma samples        but remained stable in the serum samples.

However, the notion of ""specimen        quality"" is subject to change with technological advancements. In this        perspective, we propose that the notion of sample quality should shift from a        broad definition of ""high-quality"" to a ""fit-for-purpose"" concept more suitable        for precision medicine studies. Digital twins are a digital replica of real        entities. These are largely adopted in any digitalized domain and are currently        finding applications in biomedicine. The adoption of digital twins for        biosamples, proposed in this paper, can provide prompt information about the        whole lifecycle of the physical twin (i.e., the biosample) and substantially        extend the possible matching criteria between the available samples and the        researchers' and physicians' requests. This fine-tuning matching could greatly        contribute to improving the ""fit-for-purpose"" quality, not only for studies based        on current needs, but also to improve the identification of the best available        samples in future situations, determined by the evolution of technologies and        biosciences. Assuming and exploiting a data-science view in our biobank        perspective, the more (accurate) data there are available, the more information        can be extrapolated from them, the more opportunities there are for matching        future, currently unknown, needs.

The preservation        process must be carefully controlled to ensure maximum, post-thaw recovery using        cooling rates slow enough to allow time for cells to cryodehydrate sufficiently        to avoid lethal intracellular ice. This study focuses on determining the        temperature necessary at the end of controlled slow cooling before transfer to        cryogenic storage which ensures optimal recovery of the processed cell samples.        Using nucleated, mammalian cell lines derived from liver (HepG2), ovary (CHO) and        bone tissue (MG63) this study has shown that cooling must be controlled to -40°C        before transfer to long term storage to ensure optimal cell recovery. No further        advantage was seen by controlling cooling to lower temperatures. These results        are consistent with collected differential scanning calorimetry data, that        indicated the cells underwent an intracellular, colloidal glass transition        between -49 and -59°C (Tg'i) in the presence of the cryoprotective agent dimethyl        sulfoxide (DMSO). The glass forms at the point of maximum cryodehydration and no        further cellular dehydration is possible. At this point the risk of lethal        intracellular ice forming on transfer to ultra-low temperature storage is        eliminated. In practice it may not be necessary to continue slow cooling to below        this temperature as optimal recovery at -40°C indicates that the cells have        become sufficiently dehydrated to avoid further, significant damage when        transferred into ultra-low temperature storage.",PMC8594829,PloS one,101285081

This university was selected        because of its low proportion of women in senior academic positions.

Since 2013 the proportion of women at Associate        Professor in the Case Study University increased significantly (bringing them        close to the national average): this being associated with increased        transparency, with the cascade model in the background.

Sustainability is the capacity of a biobank to remain        operative, effective, and competitive over its expected lifetime. This remains a        challenge given a biobank's position at the interplay of ethical, societal,        scientific, and commercial values and the difficulties in finding continuous        funding. In the end, biobanks are responsible for their own sustainability.        Still, biobanks also depend on their surrounding environment, which contains        overarching legislative, policy, financial, and other factors that can either        impede or promote sustainability. The Biobanking and Biomolecular Research        Infrastructure for The Netherlands (BBMRI.nl) has worked on improving the        national environment for sustainable biobanking. In this article, we present the        final outcomes of this BBMRI.nl project. First, we summarize the current        overarching challenges of the Dutch biobanking landscape. These challenges were        gathered during workshops and focus groups with Dutch biobanks and their users,        for which the full results are described in separate reports. The main        overarching challenges relate to sample and data quality, funding, use and reuse,        findability and accessibility, and the general image of biobanks.

Furthermore, access to collections can be limited by        inadequate systems, infrastructure, and networks. With negotiations underway for        a new implementing agreement on biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction, marine        genetic resources (MGR), including questions on the sharing of benefits, remains        the most debated and contentious element.

In this context, we launched, in November 2015, the first biobank in        Morocco (BRO Biobank) in order to promote biomedical research and provide        opportunities to include Moroccan and North African ethnic groups in        international biomedical studies. Here, we present the setup and the sample        characteristics of BRO Biobank. METHODS: Patients were recruited at several        departments of two major health-care centers in the city of Oujda. Healthy donors        were enrolled during blood donation campaigns all over Eastern Morocco. From each        participant, personal, clinical, and biomedical data were collected, and several        biospecimens were stored. Standard operating procedures have been established in        accordance with international guidelines on human biobanks. RESULTS: Between        November 2015 and July 2020, 2446 participants were recruited into the BRO        Biobank, of whom 2013 were healthy donors, and 433 were patients. For healthy        donors, the median age was 35 years with a range between 18 and 65 years and the        consanguinity rate was 28.96%. For patients, the median age was 11 years with a        range between 1 day and 83 years. Among these patients, 55% had rare diseases        (hemoglobinopathies, intellectual disabilities, disorders of sex differentiation,        myopathies, etc.), 13% had lung cancer, 4% suffered from hematological neoplasms,        3% were from the kidney transplantation project, and 25% had unknown diagnoses.        The BRO Biobank has collected 5092 biospecimens, including blood, white blood        cells, plasma, serum, urine, frozen tissue, FFPE tissue, and nucleic acids. A        sample quality control has been implemented and suggested that samples of the BRO        Biobank are of high quality and therefore suitable for high-throughput nucleic        acid analysis.

The PRECISE Network is        recruiting ~ 10,000 pregnant women in three countries (The Gambia, Kenya, and        Mozambique) representing sub-Saharan Africa. The principal aim is to improve our        understanding of pre-eclampsia, fetal growth restriction and stillbirth. This        involves the creation of a highly curated biorepository for state of the art        discovery science and a rich database of antenatal variables and maternal and        neonatal outcomes. Our overarching aim is to provide large sample numbers with        adequate power to address key scientific questions. Here we describe our        experience of establishing a biorepository in the PRECISE Network and review the        issues and challenges surrounding set-up, management and scientific use. METHODS:        The feasibility of collecting and processing each sample type was assessed in        each setting and plans made for establishing the necessary infrastructure.        Quality control (QC) protocols were established to ensure that biological samples        are 'fit-for-purpose'. The management structures required for standardised sample        collection and processing were developed. This included the need for transport of        samples between participating countries and to external academic/commercial        institutions. RESULTS: Numerous practical challenges were encountered in setting        up the infrastructure including facilities, staffing, training, cultural        barriers, procurement, shipping and sample storage. Whilst delaying the project,        these were overcome by establishing good communication with the sites, training        workshops and constant engagement with the necessary commercial suppliers. A        Project Executive Committee and Biology Working Group together defined the        biospecimens required to answer the research questions paying particular        attention to harmonisation of protocols with other cohorts so as to enable        cross-biorepository collaboration. Governance structures implemented include a        Data and Sample Committee to ensure biospecimens and data will be used according        to consent, and prioritisation by scientific excellence. A coordinated sample and        data transfer agreement will prevent delay in sample sharing. DISCUSSION: With        adequate training and infrastructure, it is possible to establish high quality        sample collections to facilitate research programmes such as the PRECISE Network        in sub-Saharan Africa.

In this compendium we summarize the        available methods for collection of primary human samples and incorporate expert        discussion of the pros, cons, and applications associated with each technique.        METHODS: An expert panel containing members of the American Rhinologic Society's        Research and Grants Committee compiled this educational reference. Rationale for        use and the potential advantages and disadvantages are discussed. Research        protocols and key references are enumerated. RESULTS: Sampling of the nasal        cavity and paranasal sinuses can be achieved through a number of methods.        Nonspecific sinonasal secretions may be collected via forced exhalation, nasal        lavage, and nasal spray aspiration. Targeted collection of sinonasal secretions        may be achieved via endoscopic placement of absorbent matrices.

In        precision medicine, specific molecular characteristics of an untreatable cancer        can be targeted by specific molecular-based therapy. Access to high-quality human        tissues is necessary to determine many characteristics of patients and their        diseases (such as targetable molecules). There are ethical issues in using human        tissues in precision medicine, including informed consent and confidentiality,        optimal utilization, quality of tissues, and minimization of bias. When human        tissues are obtained for patient therapy, the bioresource should be a component        certified by Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments. For precision medicine        to benefit medically underserved populations requires extensive focused research,        planning, and resources, some of which are currently unavailable at rural and        other sites where care is provided to underserved populations.",PMC7985924,Journal of health care for the poor and underserved,9103800

Endometrial cancer        associated mortality is also rising, depicting the need for translatable research        to improve our understanding of the disease. Rapid translation of scientific        discoveries will facilitate the development of new diagnostic, prognostic and        therapeutic strategies. Biobanks play a vital role in providing biospecimens with        accompanying clinical data for personalized translational research. Wide        variation in collection, and pre-analytic variations in processing and storage of        bio-specimens result in divergent and irreproducible data from multiple studies        that are unsuitable for collation to formulate robust conclusions. Harmonization        of biobanking standards is thus vital, in facilitating international multi-center        collaborative studies with valuable outcomes to improve personalized treatments.        This review will detail the pitfalls in the biobanking of biosamples from women        with cancer in general, and describe the recent international harmonization        project that developed standardized research tools to overcome these challenges        and to enhance endometrial cancer research, which will facilitate future        development of personalized novel diagnostic strategies and treatments.",PMC6896027,Cancers,101526829

Ten years on, the BBMRI.be        Quality working group wanted to gauge the current situation of these aspects in        the biobanks of the BBMRI.be network. To this end, two online surveys were        launched (fall 2017 and fall 2018) to the biobank quality managers in the        BBMRI.be network to determine the status and setup of their current quality        management system (QMS) and how their QMS and related practices have evolved over        a 14 month time period. All biobanks addressed by the two surveys provided a        complete response (12 and 13, respectively). A QMS was implemented in 85% of        biobanks, with 4 standards emerging as primary basis. Supplementary guidelines        were used, with a strong preference for the ISBER best practices for biobanks.        The Standard Preanalytical Code-an indicator of the preanalytical lifecycle of a        biospecimen impacting the downstream analysis results-was already implemented in        50% of the biobanks while the other half intends future implementation. To assess        and maintain the quality of their QMS, 62% of biobanks used self-assessment tools        and 71% participated in proficiency testing schemes. The majority of biobanks had        implemented procedures for general and biobank specific activities. However,        policies regarding the business and sustainability aspect of biobank were only        implemented in a limited number of biobanks. A clear desire for a peer-review        audit was expressed by 69% of biobanks, with over half of them intending to        implement the recently published biobank standard ISO20387. Overall, the biobanks        of the BBMRI.be network have actively implemented a solid quality approach in        their practices. The implementation of ISO 20387 may bring further        professionalization of activities. Based on the needs expressed in this survey,        the Quality working group will be setting up an audit program for the BBMRI.be        biobanks, to enhance, harmonize and streamline their activities. On the whole,        the biobanks in the BBMRI.be network are able to substantially contribute to        translational research, as a primary facilitator guaranteeing high quality        standards and reproducibility.",PMC6606712,Frontiers in medicine,101648047
31188627,The Utilization of Biospecimens: Impact of the Choice of Biobanking Model.,10.1089/bio.2019.0008,"The term research ""biobank"" is one of multiple names (e.g., bioresource,        biorepository,) used to designate an entity that receives, collects, processes,        stores, and/or distributes biospecimens or other biospecimen-related products        (e.g., data) to support research. There are multiple organizational models of        biobanking used by bioresources, but the primary goal of all bioresources should        not be simply to collect biospecimens, but ultimately to distribute almost all        collected biospecimens and/or data to support scientific research; bioresources        should serve as ""biodistributors"" rather than ""biovaults."" The appropriate choice        of model is the first step in ensuring optimal biospecimen utilization by a        bioresource. This article discusses some of the different models that may be used        alone or in combination by a bioresource providing biospecimens for research; it        describes the factors affecting the choice of the most appropriate model or        models, the advantages and disadvantages of the various models, and a discussion        of the impact of the choice of the model on biospecimen utilization. Frequently,        problems with biospecimen utilization are not caused by any single model, but        rather a mismatch between the choice of model and goals of the bioresource,        and/or problems with the subsequent design, goals, operations, and management of        the bioresource after a model is selected.",PMC7061300,Biopreservation and biobanking,101507284

For such tumor        tissues with RNA instability, RNAlater containing a high concentration of        quaternary ammonium sulfates that denature RNA-hydrolyzing enzymes is often used        to protect RNAs from hydrolysis. Although a few studies have been carried out to        determine the effect of RNAlater on DNA and RNA, whether RNAlater influences the        proteome and phosphoproteome is largely unknown. In this study we carried out a        systematic and comprehensive analysis of the effect of RNAlater on the proteome        and phosphoproteome using high-resolution mass spectrometry. PDAC tissues from        three patients were individually pulverized and the tissue powders of each        patient were divided into two portions, one of which was incubated in RNAlater at        4 °C for 24 h (RNAlater tissue) while the other was kept at - 80 °C (frozen        tissue). Comprehensive quantitative profiling experiments on the RNAlater tissues        and the frozen tissues resulted in the identification of 99,136 distinct peptides        of 8803 protein groups and 17,345 phosphopeptides of 16,436 phosphosites. The        data exhibited no significant quantitative changes in both proteins and        phosphorylation between the RNAlater tissues and the frozen tissue. In addition,        the phosphoproteome data showed heterogeneously activated pathways among the        three patients that were not altered by RNAlater. These results indicate that the        tissue preservation method using RNAlater can be effectively used on PDAC tissues        for proteogenomic studies where preservation of intact DNA, RNA and proteins is        prerequisite.

Consented human tissues are procured        according to researcher specifications for weight (size) and preservation type;        weights of samples in significant demand and limited supply are negotiated.        Weights of procured tissues are entered into a dedicated biospecimen database.        This study seeks to provide guidance for acceptable tissue weights for        researchers. Methods: Tissue weights by year and anatomic site were retrieved        from the database for primary malignant tissues. The total number of tissues        included was 5141. Statistical evaluation of data included the number of tissues        for each year, anatomic site as well as minimum, maximum, average weights,        standard deviation, and standard error. Anatomic sites with few tissues were        excluded. Results: ""Stock price"" type graphs were constructed to show an average        as ""volume"" with both full weight ranges and range that accommodated 80% of        tissues. Average weight and number of sample trends varied by anatomic site.        Tissues fell into four weight groups; 10 and 90 percentile boundaries were        calculated for each. Smallest average research tissue weights for middle 80% were        recorded for prostate and oropharynx (140 mg). Second weight group included        tonsil, thyroid, breast, oral cavity, larynx, pancreas, salivary gland, skin,        tongue, lung, and parotid (265 mg). The third group included stomach, cervix,        colon, esophagus, endometrium, bone, brain, bladder, small bowel, uterus, liver,        kidney lymph node, adrenal, and ovary (513 mg). The fourth and heaviest weight        group included soft tissue tumors and spleen (1201 mg). Conclusions: Since tissue        weights are not usually included in recommendations for research tissue        procurement or for frozen tissues stored in biorepositories, we offer this data        as a practical guide to researcher acceptable tissue weights for selected sites        based on a 3-year researcher request and acceptance history.",PMC6308276,Biopreservation and biobanking,101507284

Through a collaborative effort between the        University of Tennessee Health Science Center (UTHSC) and Le Bonheur Children's        Hospital (LBCH), the Biorepository and Integrative Genomics (BIG) Initiative was        established to set up a pediatric-based DNA biorepository that can serve as a        foundation for successful development of delivery platforms for predictive,        preventive, and personalized medical services in Memphis, Tennessee, a        historically disadvantaged community in the USA. In this paper, we describe the        steps that were followed to establish the biorepository. We focused on domains        that are essential for implementation of a biorepository for genomic research as        an initial goal and identified patient consent, DNA extraction, storage and        dissemination, and governance as essential components. Specific needs in each of        these domains were addressed by respective solutions developed by        multidisciplinary teams under the guidance of a governance model that involved        experts from multiple hospital arenas and community members. The end result was        the successful launch of a large-scale DNA biorepository, with patient consent        greater than 75% in the first year. Our experience highlights the importance of        performing pre-design research, needs assessment, and designing an ethically        vetted plan that is cost-effective, easy to implement, and inclusive of the        community that is served.
