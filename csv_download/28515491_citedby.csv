28515491,The emerging field of epigenetics in neurodegeneration and neuroprotection.,10.1038/nrn.2017.46,"Epigenetic mechanisms - including DNA methylation, histone post-translational        modifications and changes in nucleosome positioning - regulate gene expression,        cellular differentiation and development in almost all tissues, including the        brain. In adulthood, changes in the epigenome are crucial for higher cognitive        functions such as learning and memory. Striking new evidence implicates the        dysregulation of epigenetic mechanisms in neurodegenerative disorders and        diseases. Although these disorders differ in their underlying causes and        pathophysiologies, many involve the dysregulation of restrictive element        1-silencing transcription factor (REST), which acts via epigenetic mechanisms to        regulate gene expression. Although not somatically heritable, epigenetic        modifications in neurons are dynamic and reversible, which makes them good        targets for therapeutic intervention.",PMC6380351,Nature reviews.

Vitamin D3's active        metabolic form, 1,25-dihydroxy Vitamin D3 (1,25(OH)(2)D3 or calcitriol), is a        known regulator of several genes involved in neuroplasticity, neuroprotection,        neurotropism, and neuroinflammation. Multiple studies suggest that VD deficiency        can be proposed as a risk factor for the development of several age-related        neurological disorders. The evidence for low serum levels of 25-hydroxy Vitamin        D3 (25(OH)D3 or calcidiol), the major circulating form of VD, is associated with        an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD),        Huntington's disease (HD), dementia, and cognitive impairment. Despite decades of        evidence on low VD association with neurological disorders, the precise molecular        mechanism behind its beneficial effect remains controversial. Here, we will be        delving into the neurobiological importance of VD and discuss its benefits in        different neuropsychiatric disorders. The focus will be on AD, PD, and HD as they        share some common clinical, pathological, and epidemiological features. The        central focus will be on the different attributes of VD in the aspect of its        anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, anti-cholinesterase activity,        and psychotropic effect in different neurodegenerative diseases.",,Molecular neurobiology,8900963

To investigate if and how gene expression is        modulated by social experience at the central level, we analyzed the effects of        5 weeks of social isolation in rats focusing on endocannabinoid system genes        transcription in key brain regions involved in emotional control. We observed        selective reduction in mRNA levels for fatty acid amide hydrolase (Faah) and        cannabinoid receptor type 1 (Cnr1) genes in the amygdala complex and of Cnr1 in        the prefrontal cortex of socially isolated rats when compared to controls, and        these changes appear to be partially driven by trimethylation of Lysine 27 and        acetylation of Lysine 9 at Histone 3. The alterations of Cnr1 transcriptional        regulation result also directly correlated with those of oxytocin receptor gene.        We here suggest that to counteract the effects of SI, it is of relevance to        restore the endocannabinoid system homeostasis via the use of environmental        triggers able to revert those epigenetic mechanisms accounting for the        alterations observed.",,Neurochemical research,7613461

In the current study, we observed that the permissive histone mark        trimethyl histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me3) and its methyltransferase KMT2B were        significantly elevated in hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) rats, with impairment of        synaptic plasticity and cognitive function. Further research found that histone        methylation inhibited synapse-associated protein expression, by suppressing        histone acetylation. Inhibiting H3K4me3 by downregulating KMT2B could effectively        restore Hcy-inhibited H3K14ace in N2a cells. Moreover, chromatin        immunoprecipitation revealed that Hcy-induced H3K4me3 resulted in ANP32A mRNA and        protein overexpression in the hippocampus, which was regulated by increased        transcription Factor c-fos and inhibited histone acetylation and        synapse-associated protein expression, and downregulating ANP32A could reverse        these changes in Hcy-treated N2a cells. Additionally, the knockdown of KMT2B        restored histone acetylation and synapse-associated proteins in Hcy-treated        primary hippocampal neurons. These data have revealed a novel crosstalk mechanism        between KMT2B-H3K4me3-ANP32A-H3K14ace, shedding light on its role in Hcy-related        neurogenerative disorders.",,Molecular neurobiology,8900963

Nutritional excess through high-fat diet (HFD) feeding can        dysregulate hypothalamic signaling at multiple levels. Yet, it remains largely        unknown in what magnitude HFD feeding may impact epigenetics in this brain        region. Here, it is shown that HFD feeding can significantly alter hypothalamic        epigenetic events, including posttranslational histone modifications, DNA        methylation, and chromatin accessibility. The authors comprehensively analyze the        chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq), methylated DNA        immunoprecipitation-sequencing (MeDIP-seq), single nucleus assay for        transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (snATAC-seq), and RNA-seq data        of the hypothalamus of C57 BL/6 mice fed with a chow or HFD for 1 to 6 months.        The chromatins are categorized into 6 states using the obtained ChIP-seq data for        H3K4me3, H3K27ac, H3K9me3, H3K27me3, and H3K36me3. A 1-month HFD feeding        dysregulates histone modifications and DNA methylation more pronouncedly than        that of 3- or 6-month.

However,        this AD-specific epigenetic information remains brain-locked and unreachable        during patients' lifetimes. In a previous methylome performed in the hippocampus        of 26 AD patients and 12 controls, we found higher methylation levels in AD        patients in the promoter region of PRLHR, a gene involved in energy balance        regulation. Our aim was to further characterize PRLHR's role in AD and to        evaluate if the liquid biopsy technique would provide life access to this brain        information in a non-invasive way. First, we extended the methylation mapping of        PRLHR and validated previous methylome results via bisulfite cloning sequencing.        Next, we observed a positive correlation between PRLHR methylation levels and        AD-related neuropathological changes and a decreased expression of PRLHR in AD        hippocampus. Then, we managed to replicate the hippocampal methylation        differences in plasma cfDNA from an additional cohort of 35 AD patients and 35        controls.

Soluble amyloid-beta oligomers (AβOs), the main        synaptotoxins engaged in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, generate        aberrant Ca(2+) signals in primary hippocampal neurons, increase their oxidative        tone and disrupt structural plasticity. Here, we explored the effects of        sub-lethal AβOs concentrations on activity-generated nuclear Ca(2+) signals and        on the Ca(2+)-dependent expression of neuroprotective genes. To induce neuronal        activity, neuron-enriched primary hippocampal cultures were treated with the        GABA(A) receptor blocker gabazine (GBZ), and nuclear Ca(2+) signals were measured        in AβOs-treated or control neurons transfected with a genetically encoded nuclear        Ca(2+) sensor. Incubation (6 h) with AβOs significantly reduced the nuclear        Ca(2+) signals and the enhanced phosphorylation of cyclic AMP response        element-binding protein (CREB) induced by GBZ. Likewise, incubation (6 h) with        AβOs significantly reduced the GBZ-induced increases in the mRNA levels of        neuronal Per-Arnt-Sim domain protein 4 (Npas4), brain-derived neurotrophic factor        (BDNF), ryanodine receptor type-2 (RyR2), and the antioxidant enzyme        NADPH-quinone oxidoreductase (Nqo1).

Epigenome-wide DNA methylation        profiles were generated from 186 samples using the Illumina MethylationEpic array        and association with disease status was tested using linear regression models. We        identified six differentially methylated CpGs in CD14(+) monocytes and one in        CD8 + T cells.

OBJECTIVE: This scoping review seeks to understand the state of        the science in epigenetics and secondary complications following SCI. METHODS: A        literature search was conducted, yielding 277 articles. The inclusion criteria        were articles (1) investigating SCI and (2) examining epigenetic regulation as        part of the study methodology. A total of 23 articles were selected for final        inclusion. RESULTS: Of the 23 articles 52% focused on histone modification, while        26% focused on DNA methylation.

Trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 27        (H3K27me3) is essential for this process. Perturbation of H3K36 is thought to        interfere with H3K27me3. We show that mutants of Drosophila replication-dependent        (H3.2(K36R)) or replication-independent (H3.3(K36R)) histone H3 genes generally        maintain Polycomb silencing and reach later stages of development. In contrast,        combined (H3.3(K36R)H3.2(K36R)) mutants display widespread Hox gene misexpression        and fail to develop past the first larval stage. Chromatin profiling revealed        that the H3.2(K36R) mutation disrupts H3K27me3 levels broadly throughout silenced        domains, whereas these regions are mostly unaffected in H3.3(K36R) animals.        Analysis of H3.3 distributions showed that this histone is enriched at        presumptive Polycomb response elements located outside of silenced domains but        relatively depleted from those inside.

We hypothesized that the link between lipid metabolism and        inflammation indicates a role for FABP4 in regulating high fat diet (HFD)-induced        cognitive decline. We have previously shown that obese FABP4 knockout mice        exhibit decreased neuroinflammation and cognitive decline. FABP4 knockout and        wild type mice were fed 60% HFD for 12 weeks starting at 15 weeks old.        Hippocampal tissue was dissected and RNA-seq was performed to measure        differentially expressed transcripts. Reactome molecular pathway analysis was        utilized to examine differentially expressed pathways. Results showed that        HFD-fed FABP4 knockout mice have a hippocampal transcriptome consistent with        neuroprotection, including associations with decreased proinflammatory signaling,        ER stress, apoptosis, and cognitive decline. This is accompanied by an increase        in transcripts upregulating neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity, long-term        potentiation, and spatial working memory. Pathway analysis revealed that mice        lacking FABP4 had changes in metabolic function that support reduction in        oxidative stress and inflammation, and improved energy homeostasis and cognitive        function. Analysis suggested a role for WNT/β-Catenin signaling in the protection        against insulin resistance, alleviating neuroinflammation and cognitive decline.        Collectively, our work shows that FABP4 represents a potential target in        alleviating HFD-induced neuroinflammation and cognitive decline and suggests a        role for WNT/β-Catenin in this protection.",PMC9961923,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791

Although aberrant genomic        5hmC has been implicated in many age-related diseases, the functional role of the        modification in aging remains largely unknown. Here, we report that 5hmC is        stably enriched in multiple aged organs. Using the liver and cerebellum as model        organs, we show that 5hmC accumulates in gene bodies associated with        tissue-specific function and thereby restricts the magnitude of gene expression        changes during aging. Mechanistically, we found that 5hmC decreases binding        affinity of splicing factors compared to unmodified cytosine and 5mC, and is        correlated with age-related alternative splicing events, suggesting RNA splicing        as a potential mediator of 5hmC's transcriptionally restrictive function.        Furthermore, we show that various age-related contexts, such as prolonged        quiescence and senescence, are partially responsible for driving the accumulation        of 5hmC with age. We provide evidence that this age-related function is conserved        in mouse and human tissues, and further show that the modification is altered by        regimens known to modulate lifespan.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is more prevalent in        psoriasis than in the general population. Immune-mediated pathophysiologic        processes may link these two diseases, but the mechanism is still unclear. This        article aimed to explore potential molecular mechanisms in psoriasis and AD.        METHODS: Gene expression profiling data of psoriasis and AD were acquired in the        Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and        single-sample GSEA (ssGSEA) were first applied in two datasets. Differentially        expressed genes (DEGs) of two diseases were identified, and common DEGs were        selected. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment        analysis was performed to explore common biological pathways. Signature        transcription factors (STFs) were identified and their diagnostic values was        calculated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis in the        exploration cohort and verified in the validation cohort. The expression levels        of STFs were further investigated in the validation cohort and the GTEx Portal        Database. Additionally, four kinds of interaction analysis were performed:        correlation analysis among STFs, gene-gene, chemical-protein, and protein-ligand        interaction analyses. In the end, we predicted the transcription factor that        potentially regulates STFs. RESULTS: Biosynthesis and metabolic pathways were        enriched in GSEA analysis. In ssGSEA analysis, most immunoreaction gene lists        exhibited differential enrichment in psoriasis cases, whereas three        receptor-related gene lists did in AD. The KEGG analysis of common DEGs        redetermined inflammatory and metabolic pathways essential in both diseases. 5        STFs (PPARG, ZFPM2, ZNF415, HLX, and ANHX) were screened from common DEGs. The        ROC analysis indicated that all STFs have diagnostic values in two diseases,        especially ZFPM2. The correlation analysis, gene-gene, chemical-protein, and        protein-ligand interaction analyses suggested that STFs interplay and involve        inflammation and aberrant metabolism. Eventually, ZNF384 was the predicted        transcription factor regulating PPARG, ZNF415, HLX, and ANHX.

Hippocampal volume is        considered to be the most sensitive brain imaging phenotype for cognition, but        the effect of Sirt1 on hippocampal morphology during aging has not been reported.        RESULTS: Herein, we investigated the effect of conditional Sirt1 knockdown on        hippocampal volume in middle-aged mice, as well as its cognitive function and the        underlying molecular mechanisms. Brain structural magnetic resonance imaging        (MRI) showed that adeno-associated virus (AAV) mediated hippocampal Sirt1        knockdown caused hippocampal atrophy in 8-month-old mice. Open field test (OFT)        and Morris Water Maze (MWM) test revealed that hippocampal Sirt1 knockdown        significantly weakened spatial learning and memory of mice without effect on        anxiety and exploratory behavior. Western blotting analysis showed that P-tau        levels at serine 396 epitope were significantly increased with slightly decreased        T-tau levels, while PSD95 and NMDAR2B levels were obviously reduced, indicating        that hippocampal Sirt1 knockdown could activate tau hyperphosphorylation and        synaptic damage.

Tau-mediated heterochromatin        loss and subsequent global transcriptional upsurge have been demonstrated as one        of the key factors that promotes tau toxicity. We have reported earlier that        expression of human tau-transgene in Drosophila induces the expression of glob1,        and its restored level restricts tau etiology by regulating tau        hyperphosphorylation and ROS generation via GSK-3β/p-Akt and Nrf2-keap1-ARE        pathways, respectively. In view of this noted capability of glob1 in regulation        of oxidative stress, and involvement of ROS in chromatin remodeling; we        investigate if downregulation of glob1 restores tau-mediated heterochromatin loss        in order to alleviate neurotoxicity. METHODS AND RESULTS: The tau(V337M)        transgene was expressed in Drosophila eye by utilizing GAL4/UAS system.        Expression of glob1 was depleted in tau(V337M) expressing tissues by        co-expressing an UAS-glob1RNAi transgene by GMR-Gal4 driver. Immunostaining and        wstern blot analysis suggested that tissue-specific downregulation of glob1        restores the cellular level of CBP and minimizes tau-mediated heterochromatin        loss. It also assists in mounting an improved protective autophagic response to        alleviate the human tau-induced neurotoxicity in Drosophila tauopathy models.        CONCLUSIONS: Our study unfolds a novel aspect of the multitasking globin protein        in restricting the pathogenesis of neuronal tauopathies. Interestingly, due to        notable similarities between Drosophila glob1 and human globin gene(s), our        findings may be helpful in developing novel therapeutic approaches against        tauopathies.",,Molecular biology reports,0403234

Pathogenesis of neurological disorders is found to be associated with        dysregulation of gut-brain axis. Some gut bacteria metabolites are found to be        directly associated with the increase in reactive oxygen species levels, one of        the most important risk factors of neurodegeneration. Besides their morbid        association, gut bacteria metabolites are also found to play a significant role        in reducing the onset of these life-threatening brain disorders. AIM OF REVIEW:        Studies done in the recent past raises two most important link between gut        microbiota and the brain: ""gut microbiota-oxidative stress-neurodegeneration"" and        gut microbiota-antioxidant-neuroprotection. This review aims to gives a deep        insight to our readers, of the collective studies done, focusing on the gut        microbiota mediated oxidative stress involved in neurodegeneration along with a        focus on those studies showing the involvement of gut microbiota and their        metabolites in neuroprotection. KEY SCIENTIFIC CONCEPTS OF REVIEW: This review is        focused on three main key concepts. Firstly, the mounting evidences from clinical        and preclinical arenas shows the influence of gut microbiota mediated oxidative        stress resulting in dysfunctional neurological processes. Therefore, we describe        the potential role of gut microbiota influencing the vulnerability of brain to        oxidative stress, and a budding causative in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.        Secondly, contributing roles of gut microbiota has been observed in attenuating        oxidative stress and inflammation via its own metabolites or by producing        secondary metabolites and, also modulation in gut microbiota population with        antioxidative and anti-inflammatory probiotics have shown promising neuro        resilience.

Two        major epigenetic modifications of DNA, 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and        5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), target CpG sites. Importantly, CpG concentrated        regions, known as CpG islands, contain GC-rich sequences, which have the        potential to fold into non-canonical DNA structures such as i-motifs and        G-quadruplexes. In this study, we investigated the effect of 5mC and 5hmC        modifications on the transition between a duplex, and i-motif and G-quadruplexes.        To examine the transition, we firstly investigated the stability and structure of        the i-motif and G-quadruplexes, considering the molecular environment in        senescent cells. Analyses of their stability showed that the modifications did        not drastically affect the stability. However, noteworthily, the modification can        weaken the (de)stabilisation effect on G-quadruplexes caused by cosolute(s) and        cations. Circular dichroism analyses indicated that the surrounding environments,        including the molecular crowding and the type of cations such as K(+) and Na(+),        regulate the topology of G-quadruplexes, while neither 5mC nor 5hmC had a drastic        effect. On the other hand, the modifications changed the transition between        duplexes and quadruplexes. Unmodified DNA preferred to fold into quadruplexes,        whereas DNA with 5mC and 5hmC preferred to fold into duplexes in the absence of        PEG200; on the other hand, DNA with or without modifications tended to fold into        i-motifs under crowded conditions. Furthermore, an investigation of quadruplexes        forming sequences in CpG islands, which are hyper- or hypomethylated during        senescence, followed by gene ontology enrichment analysis for each gene group        classified by the presence of quadruplexes, showed a difference in function        between genes with and without quadruplexes in the CpG region. These results        indicate that it is important to consider the effects of patterns and levels of        DNA modifications on the transition between canonical and non-canonical DNA        structures to understand gene regulation by epigenetic modification during        senescence.",PMC9043837,RSC advances,101581657

METHODS:        Morpholino oligonucleotide was used to induce Dnmt1 deficiency. RNA sequencing,        in situ hybridization (ISH), whole genomic bisulfide sequencing (WGBS) and        immunostaining were used to investigate the morphologic alterations and        mechanisms. RESULTS: We found that downregulation of Dnmt1 induced decreased        number of neuromasts and repressed cell proliferation of primordium in the        developing posterior lateral line system of zebrafish. The ISH data uncovered        that Fgf signalling pathway was inhibited and the expression of chemokine members        cxcr4b, cxcr7b and cxcl12a were interfered, while lef1 expression was increased        after inhibiting Dnmt1. Additionally, Dnmt1 downregulation led to malformed        otoliths and deformed semicircular canals, and hair cell differentiation in        utricle and saccule was inhibited severely. The in situ staining of otic placode        markers pax2/5 and fgf 3/8/10 was decreased when Dnmt1 downregulated. The WGBS        analysis demonstrated that the global methylation status was markedly        downregulated, and cell cycle genes were among those most differently expressed        between Dnmt1 morphants and the controls. Further ISH analysis confirmed the        findings by RNA-seq and WGBS assay that cdkn1a and tp53 were both upregulated        after knockdown of Dnmt1.

There is currently no approved        treatment that can prevent onset of spontaneous seizures associated with brain        injury, and many cases of PTE are refractory to antiseizure medications.        Post-traumatic epileptogenesis is an enduring process by which a normal brain        exhibits hypersynchronous excitability after a head injury incident.        Understanding the neural networks and molecular pathologies involved in        epileptogenesis are key to preventing its development or modifying disease        progression. In this article, we describe a critical appraisal of the current        state of PTE research with an emphasis on experimental models, molecular        mechanisms of post-traumatic epileptogenesis, potential biomarkers, and the        burden of PTE-associated comorbidities. The goal of epilepsy research is to        identify new therapeutic strategies that can prevent PTE development or interrupt        the epileptogenic process and relieve associated neuropsychiatric comorbidities.        Therefore, we also describe current preclinical and clinical data on the        treatment of PTE sequelae.

Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), considered multifactorial        disorders, have been associated with changes in the gut microbiome. NDDs display        pathologies that alter brain functions with a tendency to worsen over time. NDDs        are a worldwide health problem; in the US alone, 12 million Americans will suffer        from NDDs by 2030. While etiology may vary, the gut microbiome serves as a key        element underlying NDD development and prognosis. In particular, an        inflammation-associated microbiome plagues NDDs. Conversely, sequestration of        this inflammatory microbiome by a correction in the dysbiotic state of the gut        may render therapeutic effects on NDDs. To this end, treatment with short-chain        fatty acid-producing bacteria, the main metabolites responsible for maintaining        gut homeostasis, ameliorates the inflammatory microbiome. This intimate        pathological link between the gut and NDDs suggests that the gut-brain axis (GBA)        acts as an underexplored area for developing therapies for NDDs. Traditionally,        the classification of NDDs depends on their clinical presentation, mostly        manifesting as extrapyramidal and pyramidal movement disorders, with        neuropathological evaluation at autopsy as the gold standard for diagnosis.

Such injury to the        arteries induces proliferation of Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells (VSMCs), resulting        in cellular hyperplasia and restenosis. We and others have previously reported        de-novo production of different cytokines and growth factors such as Tumor        Necrosis Factor Alpha (TNF-α) and Insulin like Growth Factor 1 (IGF-1), after        vascular injury. As complex as it is, the profuse proliferation of VSMCs appears        to be occurring due to several induced factors which initiate molecular        mechanisms and exacerbate disease conditions. In many pathological events, the        deleterious effects of TNF-α and IGF-1 in initiating disease mechanisms was        reported. In the present work, we explored whether TNF-α and IGF-1 can regulate        epigenetic mechanisms that promote proliferation of VSMCs. We investigated the        mechanistic roles of proteins which can structurally interact with DNMT1 and        initiate cellular pathways that promote proliferation of VSMCs. Our findings        here, identify a novel molecular mechanism that is initiated by TNF-α and IGF-1.        It was previously reported that DNMT1 expression is directly induced by TNF-α and        IGF-1 treatment and increased/induced expression of DNMT1 causes silencing of        genes that are essential to maintaining cellular homeostasis such as the tumor        suppressor genes. We have earlier reported that TNF-α and IGF-1 treatment        elevates DNMT1 expression in VSMCs and causes increased VSMC proliferation.        However, the molecular mechanisms involved were not fully deciphered.        Interestingly, in the present study we found that TNF-α and IGF-1 treatment        failed to elevate DNMT1 expression levels in absence of HDAC2 and HDAC10. Also,        while HDAC2 expression was not affected by HDAC10 knockdown, HDAC2 is essentially        required for HDAC10 expression. Further, in TNF-α and IGF-1 induced epigenetic        signaling mechanism, the expression of two important proteins EZH2 and PCNA seem        to be regulated in an HDAC2-HDAC10 dependent manner. Our results show an        inter-dependence of epigenetic mediators in inducing proliferation in VSMCs. To        our knowledge, this is the first report that shows HDAC2 dependent expression of        HDAC10, and suggests a novel mechanistic link between DNMT1, HDAC10 and HDAC2        that regulates EZH2 and PCNA to enhance cell proliferation of VSMCs which is the        underlying cause for neointimal hyperplasia and restenosis.",PMC8830685,PloS one,101285081

MAM induces specific patterns of DNA damage and repair that        associate with increased tau expression in primary rat neuronal cultures and with        brain transcriptional changes that parallel those associated with human ALS and        Alzheimer's disease. We examine MAM in relation to neurodevelopment, epigenetic        modification, DNA damage/replicative stress, genomic instability, somatic        mutation, cell-cycle reentry and cellular senescence. Since the majority of        neurodegenerative disease lacks a solely inherited genetic basis, research is        needed to explore the hypothesis that early-life exposure to genotoxic agents may        trigger or promote molecular events that culminate in neurodegeneration.",PMC8675606,Frontiers in neuroscience,101478481

In the        brain, many of these epigenetic modifications have been widely implicated in        synaptic plasticity and memory formation.

However, it is unclear whether HDACs play roles in        complex cognitive function. To address this issue, we examined the role of dorsal        striatal HDAC5, a class II HDAC, in reward-guided decision-making and associated        neural encoding in rats. We first injected adeno-associated virus to overexpress        a nuclear-localized HDAC5 in dorsal striatum (DS). We then recorded neural        correlates from dorsolateral striatum (DLS) as rats performed two reward-guided        choice tasks, in which we manipulated either the size of or delay to reward.        During these tasks, rats first learned which of two options led to the better        reward and then reversed those contingencies in a second block of trials. We        found that rats with HDAC5 overexpression in DS responded faster and chose higher        value reward more often during the first block of trials but were less able to        reverse those contingencies in the second block of trials. At the neural level,        HDAC5 overexpression in DS elevated and reduced the number of cells in DLS that        increased firing to stimuli and reward, respectively, and shifted encoding toward        cues that predicted more immediate reward. These results suggest that the HDAC5        overexpression in DS contributes to inflexible decision-making, demonstrating a        role of histone-modifying enzymes in complex cognitive function.SIGNIFICANCE        STATEMENT HDACs are important for learning and habit formation.

This study aims to        investigate the mechanism of sevoflurane (SF) post-treatment in alleviating HIE        in rats. The HIE rat model and oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) cell model were        established, and adeno-associated virus (AAV)-histone-lysine N-methyltransferase        EHMT2 (G9a) was transfected after SF treatment. The learning and memory ability        and the levels of nerve growth factor (NGF)/brain-derived neurotrophic factor        (BDNF) were evaluated and determined. The levels of G9a/histone H3 lysine 9        dimethylation (H3K9me2) and the enrichment level of H3K9me2 in the promoter        region of BDNF gene were analyzed.

Most        animal models that investigate this effect are based on prolonged isolation,        which does not mimic the milder conditions experienced by people in the real        world. We show that in adult male rats, acute social isolation causes social        memory loss. This memory loss is accompanied by significant changes in the        expression of specific mRNAs and proteins in the medial amygdala, a brain        structure that is crucial for social memory.

Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms underlying these        morphological alterations remain largely unknown. Here, we found that miR-9-5p        levels were selectively reduced in the hippocampus of rats vulnerable to Chronic        Mild Stress (CMS), while acute subanesthetic ketamine restored its levels to        basal condition in just 24h; miR-9-5p expression inversely correlated with the        anhedonic phenotype. A decrease of miR-9-5p was reproduced in an in vitro model        of stress, based on primary hippocampal neurons incubated with the stress hormone        corticosterone. In both CMS animals and primary neurons, decreased miR-9-5p        levels were associated with dendritic simplification, while treatment with        ketamine completely rescued the changes. In vitro modulation of miR-9-5p        expression showed a direct role of miR-9-5p in regulating dendritic length and        spine density in mature primary hippocampal neurons. Among the putative target        genes tested, Rest and Sirt1 were validated as biological targets in primary        neuronal cultures.

The mechanisms involved in this        process have not been fully characterized. The hypothesis discussed here proposed        that epigenetic regulation participates in the installation of persistent        adaptations and long-lasting synaptic plasticity generated by nicotine action on        the mesolimbic dopamine neurons of zebrafish. The epigenetic mechanisms induced        by nicotine entail histone and DNA chemical modifications, which have been        described to lead to changes in gene expression. Among the enzymes that catalyze        epigenetic chemical modifications, histone deacetylases (HDACs) remove acetyl        groups from histones, thereby facilitating DNA relaxation and making DNA more        accessible to gene transcription. DNA methylation, which is dependent on DNA        methyltransferase (DNMTs) activity, inhibits gene expression by recruiting        several methyl binding proteins that prevent RNA polymerase binding to DNA. In        zebrafish, phenylbutyrate (PhB), an HDAC inhibitor, abolishes nicotine rewarding        properties together with a series of typical reward-associated behaviors.        Furthermore, PhB and nicotine alter long- and short-term object recognition        memory in zebrafish, respectively. Regarding DNA methylation effects, a methyl        group donor L-methionine (L-met) was found to dramatically reduce        nicotine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) in zebrafish. Simultaneous        treatment with DNMT inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (AZA) was found to reverse        the L-met effect on nicotine-induced CPP as well as nicotine reward-specific        effects on genetic expression in zebrafish.

Then, we performed a differential        analysis of lncRNA expression and methylated regions between low-grade glioma        (LGG) and glioblastoma multiform (GBM) subjects, respectively.

Based on our previous observations        of the potent antioxidant and neuroprotective activity of SELENOT, a vital        thioredoxin-like selenoprotein, we designed the small peptide PSELT from its        redox active site to evaluate its antioxidant properties in vivo, and its        potential polyfunctional activity in PD models. PSELT protects neurotoxin-treated        dopaminergic neurons against oxidative stress and cell death, and their fibers        against neurotoxic degeneration. PSELT is cell-permeable and acts in multiple        subcellular compartments of dopaminergic neurons that are vulnerable to oxidative        stress.

Here, we systematically        investigated the effects of methylated cytosine on the thermodynamics of DNA        duplexes under molecular crowding conditions, which is a critical difference        between the molecular environment in cells and test tubes. Thermodynamic        parameters quantitatively demonstrated that the methylation effect and molecular        crowding effect on DNA duplexes are independent and additive, in which the degree        of the stabilization is the sum of the methylation effect and molecular crowding        effect. Furthermore, the effects of methylation and molecular crowding correlate        with the hydration states of DNA duplexes. The stabilization effect of        methylation was due to the favorable enthalpic contribution, suggesting that        direct interactions of the methyl group with adjacent bases and adjacent methyl        groups play a role in determining the flexibility and thermodynamics of DNA        duplexes.

We identified 88 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 24        differentially alternatively spliced transcripts between the high- and        low-MWM-performance mice. Although the sets of DEGs and differentially        alternatively spliced transcripts did not overlap, both were found to be enriched        with genes related to the same type of biological processes: trans-synaptic        signaling, cognition, and glutamatergic transmission.

Relatively more hypoxic states, either chronic or        acute, are pathologic and can lead to significant long-term neurodevelopmental        sequelae. In utero hypoxic injury is associated with neonatal mortality and        millions of lives lived with varying degrees of disability. MAIN BODY: Genetic        studies of children with neurodevelopmental disease indicate that epigenetic        modifiers regulating DNA methylation and histone remodeling are critical for        normal brain development. Epigenetic modifiers are also regulated by        environmental stimuli, such as hypoxia. Indeed, epigenetic modifiers that are        mutated in children with genetic neurodevelopmental diseases are regulated by        hypoxia in a number of preclinical models and may be part of the mechanism for        the long-term neurodevelopmental sequelae seem in children with hypoxic brain        injury. Thus, a comprehensive understanding the role of DNA methylation and        histone modifications in hypoxic injury is critical for developing novel        strategies to treat children with hypoxic injury. CONCLUSIONS: This review        focuses on our current understanding of the intersection between epigenetics,        brain development, and hypoxia. Opportunities for the use of epigenetics as        biomarkers of neurodevelopmental disease after hypoxic injury and potential        clinical epigenetics targets to improve outcomes after injury are also discussed.        While there have been many published studies on the epigenetics of hypoxia, more        are needed in the developing brain in order to determine which epigenetic        pathways may be most important for mitigating the long-term consequences of        hypoxic brain injury.",PMC7745506,Journal of neurodevelopmental disorders,101483832

Here, we studied the effects of sevoflurane anesthesia        on the transcription of memory genes in the aged rat hippocampus. Then, we        investigated changes in DNA methylation of involved genes and verified whether        dysregulated DNA methylation would contribute to anesthesia induced cognitive        impairment. The results indicated that sevoflurane anesthesia down-regulated the        mRNA and protein levels of three memory genes, Arc, Bdnf, and Reln, which were        accompanied with promoter hypermethylation and increased Dnmt1, Dnmt3a, and Mecp2        expression, and finally impaired hippocampus dependent memory.

While both resident and infiltrating        cardiac cells are implicated in these pathophysiological processes, recent        evidence has suggested that endothelial cells (ECs) may be the principal cell        type responsible for orchestrating pathological changes in the failing heart.        Epigenetic modification of nucleic acids, including DNA, and more recently RNA,        by methylation is essential for physiological development due to their critical        regulation of cellular gene expression. As accumulating evidence has highlighted        altered patterns of DNA and RNA methylation in HF at both the global and        individual gene levels, much effort has been directed towards defining the        precise role of such cell-specific epigenetic changes in the context of HF.        Considering the increasingly apparent crucial role that ECs play in cardiac        homeostasis and disease, this article will specifically focus on nucleic acid        methylation (both DNA and RNA) in the failing heart, emphasising the key        influence of these epigenetic mechanisms in governing EC function.

It is unknown whether        epigenetic regulatory pathways play a role in chronic stress-induced intestinal        barrier dysfunction and visceral hyperalgesia. METHODS: Young adult male rats        were subjected to water avoidance stress ± H3K9 methylation inhibitors or siRNAs.        Visceral pain response was assessed. Differentiated Caco-2/BBE cells and human        colonoids were treated with cortisol or IL-6 ± antagonists. Expression of TJ,        IL-6, and H3K9 methylation status at gene promoters was measured. Transepithelial        electrical resistance and FITC-dextran permeability were evaluated. KEY RESULTS:        Chronic stress induced IL-6 up-regulation prior to a decrease in TJ proteins in        the rat colon. The IL-6 level inversely correlated with occludin expression.        Treatment with IL-6 decreased occludin and induced visceral hyperalgesia. Chronic        stress and IL-6 increased H3K9 methylation and decreased transcriptional GR        binding to the occludin gene promoter, leading to down-regulation of protein        expression and increase in paracellular permeability. Intrarectal administration        of a H3K9 methylation antagonist prevented chronic stress-induced visceral        hyperalgesia in the rat. In a human colonoid model, cortisol decreased occludin        expression, which was prevented by the GR antagonist RU486, and IL-6 increased        H3K9 methylation and decreased TJ protein levels, which were prevented by        inhibitors of H3K9 methylation.

DNA methylation is fine-mapped at enhancers and promoters,        genome-wide, by targeted bisulfite sequencing in two independent sample cohorts.        RESULTS: We find that neurons of the human prefrontal cortex exhibit hemispheric        differences in DNA methylation. Hemispheric asymmetry in neuronal DNA methylation        patterns is largely mediated by differential CpH methylation, and chromatin        conformation analysis finds that it targets thousands of genes. With aging, there        is a loss of hemispheric asymmetry in neuronal epigenomes, such that hemispheres        epigenetically converge in late life. In neurons of PD patients, hemispheric        asymmetry in DNA methylation is greater than in controls and involves many PD        risk genes. Epigenetic, transcriptomic, and proteomic differences between PD        hemispheres correspond to the lateralization of PD symptoms, with abnormalities        being most prevalent in the hemisphere matched to side of symptom predominance.        Hemispheric asymmetry and symptom lateralization in PD is linked to genes        affecting neurodevelopment, immune activation, and synaptic transmission.

The effects of REST, including cell aggression or        protection, are variable in neurodegenerative diseases in view of the distinct        mechanisms of their pathology. Moreover, cooperations are among the mechanisms        that govern the severity of brain cancers, glioblastomas, and medulloblastomas.        Interestingly, the role in cancers is relevant also for therapeutic perspectives        affecting the REST cooperations.

Research has continued to uncover an ever-increasing number of        processes in which melatonin is known to play crucial roles in mammals. Amongst        these functions is its contribution to cell multiplication, differentiation and        survival in the brain. Experimental studies show that melatonin can achieve these        functions by influencing transcription factors which control neuronal and glial        gene expression. Since neuronal survival and differentiation are processes that        are important determinants of the pathogenesis, course and outcome of        neurodegenerative disorders; the known and potential influences of melatonin on        neuronal and glial transcription factors are worthy of constant examination. In        this review, relevant scientific literature on the role of melatonin in        preventing or altering the course and outcome of neurodegenerative disorders, by        focusing on melatonin's influence on transcription factors is examined. A number        of transcription factors whose functions can be influenced by melatonin in        neurodegenerative disease models have also been highlighted.

N,N-Dimethyltryptamine (DMT, one of the alkaloids in        Ayahuasca) activates sigma 1 receptor (SIGMAR1) and others. SIGMAR1 is a        multi-faceted stress-responsive receptor which promotes cell survival,        neuroprotection, neuroplasticity, and neuroimmunomodulation. Simultaneously,        monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) also present in Ayahuasca prevent the        degradation of DMT. One peculiarity of SIGMAR1 activation and MAOI activity is        the reversal of mnemonic deficits in pre-clinical models. Since traumatic        memories in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are often characterised by        ""repression"" and PTSD patients ingesting Ayahuasca report the retrieval of such        memories, it cannot be excluded that DMT-mediated SIGMAR1 activation and the        concomitant MAOIs effects during Ayahuasca ingestion might mediate such        ""anti-amnesic"" process. Here I hypothesise that Ayahuasca, via hyperactivation of        trauma and emotional memory-related centres, and via its concomitant SIGMAR1- and        MAOIs- induced anti-amnesic effects, facilitates the retrieval of traumatic        memories, in turn making them labile (destabilised). As Ayahuasca alkaloids        enhance synaptic plasticity, increase neurogenesis and boost dopaminergic        neurotransmission, and those processes are involved in memory reconsolidation and        fear extinction, the fear response triggered by the memory can be reprogramed        and/or extinguished. Subsequently, the memory is stored with this updated        significance. To date, it is unclear if new memories replace, co-exist with or        bypass old ones. Although the mechanisms involved in memory are still debated,        they seem to require the involvement of cellular and molecular events, such as        reorganisation of homo and heteroreceptor complexes at the synapse, synaptic        plasticity, and epigenetic re-modulation of gene expression. Since SIGMAR1        mobilises synaptic receptor, boosts synaptic plasticity and modulates epigenetic        processes, such effects might be involved in the reported healing of traumatic        memories in PTSD patients. If this theory proves to be true, Ayahuasca could come        to represent the only standing pharmacological treatment which targets traumatic        memories in PTSD. Lastly, since SIGMAR1 activation triggers both epigenetic and        immunomodulatory programmes, the mechanism here presented could help        understanding and treating other conditions in which the cellular memory is        dysregulated, such as cancer, diabetes, autoimmune and neurodegenerative        pathologies and substance addiction.",PMC5895707,Frontiers in pharmacology,101548923

However, the fixation process and the long        storage duration lead to DNA fragmentation and hinder epigenome analysis. The use        of droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) to detect DNA methylation has recently emerged. In        this study, we compare an optimized ddPCR assay with a conventional qPCR assay by        targeting a dilution series of control DNA. In addition, we compare the ddPCR        technology with results from Infinium arrays targeting two separate CpG sites on        a set of colon adenoma FFPE samples. Our data demonstrate that qPCR and ddPCR        assess methylation status equally well on dilution controls with a high DNA        input. However, the methylation detection on low-input samples is more accurate        using ddPCR. The proposed primer design (methylation-independent primers with        amplification of solely the converted DNA target) will allow for methylation        detection, independent of bisulfite conversion efficiency. Those data show that        ddPCR can be used for methylation analysis on FFPE samples with a wide range of        DNA input and that the precision of the assay depends largely on the total amount        of amplifiable DNA fragments. Due to accessibility of the ddPCR technology and        its accuracy on high- as well as low-DNA input samples, we propose the use of        this approach for studies involving degraded FFPE samples.",PMC5997148,Epigenetics,101265293

Many mechanisms are involved solely or in combination in this disorder        including excitotoxicity, mitochondrial death pathways, and the release of free        radicals, protein misfolding, apoptosis, necrosis, autophagy and inflammation.        Besides neuronal cell loss, damage to and loss of astrocytes as well as injury to        white matter contributes also to cerebral injury. The core problem in stroke is        the loss of neuronal cells which makes recovery difficult or even not possible in        the late states. Acute treatment options that can be applied for stroke are        mainly targeting re-establishment of blood flow and hence, their use is limited        due to the effective time window of thrombolytic agents. However, if the acute        time window is exceeded, neuronal loss starts due to the activation of cell death        pathways. This review will explore the most updated cellular death mechanisms        leading to neuronal loss in stroke.

First,        only humans are known to develop MS spontaneously. Second, humans have evolved        large brains, with characteristically large amounts of metabolically costly        myelin. This myelin is generated over long periods of neurologic development-and        peak MS onset coincides with the end of myelination. Third, over the past century        there has been a disproportionate increase in the rate of MS in young women of        childbearing age, paralleling increasing westernization and urbanization,        indicating sexually specific susceptibility in response to changing exposures.        From these three observations about MS, a life history approach leads us to        hypothesize that MS arises in humans from disruption of the normal homeostatic        mechanisms of myelin production and maintenance, during our uniquely long        myelination period. This review will highlight under-explored areas of        homeostasis in brain development, that are likely to shed new light on the        origins of MS and to raise further questions about the interactions between our        ancestral genes and modern environments.",PMC5824939,"Evolution, medicine, and public health",101616698

Numerous gene mutations are        identified to be related with RP, but epigenetic modifications may also be        involved in the pathogenesis. Previous studies suggested that both DNA        methylation and histone acetylation regulate photoreceptor cell death in RP mouse        models. However, the role of histone methylation in RP has never been        investigated. In this study, we found that trimethylation of several lysine sites        of histone H3, including lysine 27 (H3K27me3), increased in the retinas of rd1        mice. Histone methylation inhibitor DZNep significantly reduced the calpain        activity, delayed the photoreceptor loss, and improved ERG response of rd1        retina. RNA-sequencing indicated that DZNep synergistically acts on several        molecular pathways that regulate photoreceptor survival in rd1 retina, including        PI3K-Akt and photoreceptor differentiation pathways, revealing the therapeutic        potential of DZNep for RP treatment. PI3K-Akt pathway and H3K27me3 form a        feedback loop in rd1 retina, thus PI3K inhibitor LY294002 reduces phosphorylation        of Ezh2 at serine 21 and enhances H3K27me3 deposition, and inhibiting H3K27me3 by        DZNep can activate PI3K-Akt pathway by de-repressing gene expression of PI3K        subunits Pik3r1 and Pik3r3. These findings suggest that histone methylation,        especially H3K27me3 deposition is a novel mechanism and therapeutic target for        retinal degenerative diseases, similar to H3K27me3-mediated ataxia-telangiectasia        in Atm (-/-) mouse.",PMC5833420,Cell death & disease,101524092
29413961,13 reasons why the brain is susceptible to oxidative stress.,10.1016/j.redox.2018.01.008,"The human brain consumes 20% of the total basal oxygen (O(2)) budget to support        ATP intensive neuronal activity. Without sufficient O(2) to support ATP demands,        neuronal activity fails, such that, even transient ischemia is neurodegenerative.        While the essentiality of O(2) to brain function is clear, how oxidative stress        causes neurodegeneration is ambiguous. Ambiguity exists because many of the        reasons why the brain is susceptible to oxidative stress remain obscure. Many are        erroneously understood as the deleterious result of adventitious O(2) derived        free radical and non-radical species generation. To understand how many reasons        underpin oxidative stress, one must first re-cast free radical and non-radical        species in a positive light because their deliberate generation enables the brain        to achieve critical functions (e.g. synaptic plasticity) through redox signalling        (i.e. positive functionality). Using free radicals and non-radical derivatives to        signal sensitises the brain to oxidative stress when redox signalling goes awry        (i.e. negative functionality). To advance mechanistic understanding, we        rationalise 13 reasons why the brain is susceptible to oxidative stress. Key        reasons include inter alia unsaturated lipid enrichment, mitochondria, calcium,        glutamate, modest antioxidant defence, redox active transition metals and        neurotransmitter auto-oxidation. We review RNA oxidation as an underappreciated        cause of oxidative stress. The complex interplay between each reason dictates        neuronal susceptibility to oxidative stress in a dynamic context and neural        identity dependent manner. Our discourse sets the stage for investigators to        interrogate the biochemical basis of oxidative stress in the brain in health and        disease.",PMC5881419,Redox biology,101605639

AAV-mediated H2A.Z depletion enhanced fear        memory and resulted in gene-specific alterations of learning-induced        transcription, reinforcing the role of H2A.Z as a memory suppressor. H2A.Z        accumulated with age, although it remained sensitive to learning-induced        eviction. Learning-related H2A.Z removal occurred at largely distinct genes in        young versus aged mice, suggesting that H2A.Z is subject to regulatory shifts in        the aged brain despite similar memory performance.

28967098,Epigenetic regulation of melatonin receptors in neuropsychiatric disorders.,10.1111/bph.14058,"Melatonin, the primary indoleamine hormone of the mammalian pineal gland, is        known to have a plethora of neuroregulatory, neuroprotective and other        properties. Melatonergic signalling is mediated by its two GPCRs, MT(1) and MT(2)        , which are widely expressed in the mammalian CNS. Melatonin levels and receptor        expression often show a decrease during normal ageing, and this reduction may be        accelerated in some disease states. Depleted melatonergic signalling has been        associated with neuropsychiatric dysfunction and impairments in cognition,        memory, neurogenesis and neurorestorative processes. The anticonvulsant and mood        stabilizer, valproic acid (VPA), up-regulates melatonin MT(1) and/or MT(2)        receptor expression in cultured cells and in the rat brain. VPA is known to        affect gene expression through several mechanisms, including the modulation of        intracellular kinase pathways and transcription factors, as well as the        inhibition of histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity. Interestingly, other HDAC        inhibitors, such as trichostatin A, which are structurally distinct from VPA, can        also up-regulate melatonin receptor expression, unlike a VPA analogue,        valpromide, which lacks HDAC inhibitory activity. Moreover, VPA increases histone        H3 acetylation along the length of the MT(1) gene promoter in rat C6 cells. These        findings indicate that an epigenetic mechanism, linked to histone        hyperacetylation/chromatin remodelling and associated changes in gene        transcription, is involved in the up-regulation of melatonin receptors by VPA.        Epigenetic induction of MT(1) and/or MT(2) receptor expression, in areas where        these receptors are lost because of ageing, injury or disease, may be a promising        therapeutic avenue for the management of CNS dysfunction and other disorders.        LINKED ARTICLES: This article is part of a themed section on Recent Developments        in Research of Melatonin and its Potential Therapeutic Applications.
