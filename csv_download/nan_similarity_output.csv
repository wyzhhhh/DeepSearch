10.3390/cells13010079,Epigenetic Regulation of Neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's Disease.,2023.0,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic and progressive neurodegenerative disease        and clinically manifests with cognitive decline and behavioral disabilities. Over        the past years, mounting studies have demonstrated that the inflammatory response        plays a key role in the onset and development of AD, and neuroinflammation has        been proposed as the third major pathological driving factor of AD, ranking after        the two well-known core pathologies, amyloid β (Aβ) deposits and neurofibrillary        tangles (NFTs). Epigenetic mechanisms, referring to heritable changes in gene        expression independent of DNA sequence alterations, are crucial regulators of        neuroinflammation which have emerged as potential therapeutic targets for AD.        Upon regulation of transcriptional repression or activation, epigenetic        modification profiles are closely involved in inflammatory gene expression and        signaling pathways of neuronal differentiation and cognitive function in central        nervous system disorders. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge        about epigenetic control mechanisms with a focus on DNA and histone modifications        involved in the regulation of inflammatory genes and signaling pathways in AD,        and the inhibitors under clinical assessment are also discussed.",fe26a1f72ae08793a0759b1e28c8d93a9acf70d6,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/fe26a1f72ae08793a0759b1e28c8d93a9acf70d6,38201283,PMC10778497,background,False,Cells,101600052,0.7950222492218018,0.02040816326530612,0,7.666,0.0,0.6733668341708543,0.3476749651982911

Neuroepigenetics bridges neuroscience and epigenetics by regulating        gene expression in the nervous system and its impact on brain function. With the        increase in research in recent years, it was observed that alterations in the        gene expression did not always originate from changes in the genetic sequence,        which has led to understanding the role of epigenetics in neurodegenerative        diseases (NDDs) including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD).        Epigenetic alterations contribute to the aberrant expression of genes involved in        neuroinflammation, protein aggregation, and neuronal death. Natural        phytochemicals have shown promise as potential therapeutic agents against NDDs        because of their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective effects in        cellular and animal models. For instance, resveratrol (grapes), curcumin        (turmeric), and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG; green tea) exhibit        neuroprotective effects through their influence on DNA methylation patterns,        histone acetylation, and non-coding RNA expression profiles. Phytochemicals also        aid in slowing disease progression, preserving neuronal function, and enhancing        cognitive and motor abilities. The present review focuses on various epigenetic        modifications involved in the pathology of NDDs, including AD and PD, gene        expression regulation related to epigenetic alterations, and the role of specific        polyphenols in influencing epigenetic modifications in AD and PD.",09ba9876e12dd054b154eb3934e649d90b904c56,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/09ba9876e12dd054b154eb3934e649d90b904c56,38790711,PMC11118909,background,False,"Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",101668981,0.7718434929847717,0.0,0,7.675,0.005025125628140704,0.7336683417085427,0.342357067995934

Within this context, neuroinflammation        comes up as one of the main factors linked to neurodegeneration progression. In        fact, neuroinflammation has been recognized as an outstanding factor for        Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson's        disease (PD), and multiple sclerosis (MS). Interestingly, neuroinflammatory        diseases are characterized by dramatic changes in the epigenetic profile, which        might provide novel prognostic and therapeutic factors towards neuroinflammatory        treatment. Deep changes in DNA and histone methylation, along with histone        acetylation and altered non-coding RNA expression, have been reported at the        onset of inflammatory diseases.

10.3390/epigenomes7030020,Integrated Multimodal Omics and Dietary Approaches for the Management of        Neurodegeneration.,2023.0,"Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease,        are caused by a combination of multiple events that damage neuronal function. A        well-characterized biomarker of neurodegeneration is the accumulation of        proteinaceous aggregates in the brain. However, the gradually worsening symptoms        of neurodegenerative diseases are unlikely to be solely due to the result of a        mutation in a single gene, but rather a multi-step process involving epigenetic        changes. Recently, it has been suggested that a fraction of epigenetic        alternations may be correlated to neurodegeneration in the brain. Unlike DNA        mutations, epigenetic alterations are reversible, and therefore raise the        possibilities for therapeutic intervention, including dietary modifications.        Additionally, reactive oxygen species may contribute to the pathogenesis of        Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease through epigenetic alternation. Given        that the antioxidant properties of plant-derived phytochemicals are likely to        exhibit pleiotropic effects against ROS-mediated epigenetic alternation, dietary        intervention may be promising for the management of neurodegeneration in these        diseases. In this review, the state-of-the-art applications using single-cell        multimodal omics approaches, including epigenetics, and dietary approaches for        the identification of novel biomarkers and therapeutic approaches for the        treatment of neurodegenerative diseases are discussed.",36243fab94ffe699e924912d354673042fc35a42,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/36243fab94ffe699e924912d354673042fc35a42,37754272,PMC10529483,,False,Epigenomes,101736595,0.49991366267204285,0.0,0,0.0,0.010050251256281407,0.0,0.15148163649005508

10.14336/AD.2023.0718-1,Autophagy in Neuroinflammation: A Focus on Epigenetic Regulation.,2023.0,"Neuroinflammation, characterized by the secretion of abundant inflammatory        mediators, pro-inflammatory polarization of microglia, and the recruitment of        infiltrating myeloid cells to foci of inflammation, drives or exacerbates the        pathological processes of central nervous system disorders, especially in        neurodegenerative diseases. Autophagy plays an essential role in        neuroinflammatory processes, and the underlaying physiological mechanisms are        closely correlated with neuroinflammation-related signals. Inhibition of mTOR and        activation of AMPK and FOXO1 enhance autophagy and thereby suppress NLRP3        inflammasome activity and apoptosis, leading to the relief of neuroinflammatory        response. And autophagy mitigates neuroinflammation mainly manifested by        promoting the polarization of microglia from a pro-inflammatory to an        anti-inflammatory state, reducing the production of pro-inflammatory mediators,        and up-regulating the levels of anti-inflammatory factors. Notably, epigenetic        modifications are intimately associated with autophagy and the onset and        progression of various brain diseases. Non-coding RNAs, including microRNAs,        circular RNAs and long noncoding RNAs, and histone acetylation have been reported        to adjust autophagy-related gene and protein expression to alleviate inflammation        in neurological diseases.

Unfortunately,        despite decades of studies being performed on these histological alterations,        there is no effective treatment or cure for AD. Identifying the molecular        characteristics of the disease is imperative to understanding the pathogenesis of        AD. Furthermore, uncovering the key causative alterations of AD can be valuable        in developing models for AD treatment. Several alterations have been implicated        in driving this disease, including blood-brain barrier dysfunction, hypoxia,        mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, glucose hypometabolism, and altered        heme homeostasis. Although these alterations have all been associated with the        progression of AD, the root cause of AD has not been identified. Intriguingly,        recent studies have pinpointed dysfunctional heme metabolism as a culprit of the        development of AD. Heme has been shown to be central in neuronal function,        mitochondrial respiration, and oxidative stress. Therefore, dysregulation of heme        homeostasis may play a pivotal role in the manifestation of AD and its various        alterations. This review will discuss the most common neurological and molecular        alterations associated with AD and point out the critical role heme plays in the        development of this disease.",4f8a5bbd910c8187e46da6045682d197499db9a8,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4f8a5bbd910c8187e46da6045682d197499db9a8,33806317,PMC7998384,,False,Cells,101600052,0.40239211916923523,0.017793594306049824,10,7.666,0.6834170854271356,0.678391959798995,0.33210643025711006

In fact, although a growing number of studies show crosstalk between these        two processes, there remain numerous gaps in our knowledge of the mechanisms        involved, which requires further clarification. On the one hand, mitochondrial        dysfunction may lead to the release of mitochondrial damage-associated molecular        patterns (mtDAMPs) which are recognized by microglial immune receptors and        contribute to neuroinflammation progression. On the other hand, inflammatory        molecules released by glial cells can influence and regulate mitochondrial        function. A deeper understanding of these mechanisms may help identify biomarkers        and molecular targets useful for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.

Although increasing        evidence suggests that senescent microglia play a role in the pathogenesis of AD,        their exact role remains unclear. In this study, we quantified the levels of        lactic acid in senescent microglia, and hippocampus tissues of naturally aged        mice and AD mice models (FAD(4T) and APP/PS1). We found lactic acid levels were        significantly elevated in these cells and tissues compared to their corresponding        counterparts, which increased the level of pan histone lysine lactylation (Kla).        We aslo identified all histone Kla sites in senescent microglia, and found that        both the H3K18 lactylation (H3K18la) and Pan-Kla were significantly up-regulated        in senescent microglia and hippocampus tissues of naturally aged mice and AD        modeling mice. We demonstrated that enhanced H3K18la directly stimulates the NFκB        signaling pathway by increasing binding to the promoter of Rela (p65) and        NFκB1(p50), thereby upregulating senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP)        components IL-6 and IL-8. Our study provides novel insights into the        physiological function of Kla and the epigenetic regulatory mechanism that        regulates brain aging and AD. Specifically, we have identified the H3K18la/NFκB        axis as a critical player in this process by modulating IL-6 and IL-8.

Mutations in GRN are        one of the most common genetic causes of FTD, near ubiquitously resulting in        progranulin (PGRN) haploinsufficiency. Small molecules that can restore PGRN        protein to healthy levels in individuals bearing a heterozygous GRN mutation may        thus have therapeutic value. Here, we show that epigenetic modulation through        bromodomain and extra-terminal domain (BET) inhibitors (BETi) potently enhance        PGRN protein levels, both intracellularly and secreted forms, in human central        nervous system (CNS)-relevant cell types, including in microglia-like cells. In        terms of potential for disease modification, we show BETi treatment effectively        restores PGRN levels in neural cells with a GRN mutation known to cause PGRN        haploinsufficiency and FTD. We demonstrate that BETi can rapidly and durably        enhance PGRN in neural progenitor cells (NPCs) in a manner dependent upon BET        protein expression, suggesting a gain-of-function mechanism. We further describe        a CNS-optimized BETi chemotype that potently engages endogenous BRD4 and enhances        PGRN expression in neuronal cells.

This        indicates that the immune microenvironment has a pivotal role in the pathogenesis        of the disease. Multiple peripheral stimuli, conditioned by complex and varied        interactions between signals that stem at the intestinal level and neuroimmune        processes, are involved in the progression and severity of AD.

Considerable progress has        been made, modulating many different metabolic and immune alterations that can        drive AD development. However, non-pharmacological strategies targeting        immunometabolic processes affecting neuroinflammation in AD treatment remain        general and, at this point, are applied to all patients regardless of disease        features. Despite these possibilities, improved knowledge of the relative        contribution of the different innate immune cells and molecules comprising the        chronically inflamed brain network to AD pathogenesis, and elucidation of the        network hierarchy, are needed for planning potent preventive and/or therapeutic        interventions. Moreover, an integrative perspective addressing transdisciplinary        fields can significantly contribute to molecular pathological epidemiology,        improving the health and quality of life of AD patients.

Mitochondrial dysfunction is thought to be an early event in the onset and        progression of AD; however, the precise underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In        this study, we investigated mitochondrial proteins involved in organelle        dynamics, morphology and energy production in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)        and hippocampus (HIPP) of young (1∼2 months), adult (4∼5 months) and aged (9∼10,        12∼18 months) APP/PS1 mice. We observed increased levels of mitochondrial fission        protein, Drp1, and decreased levels of ATP synthase subunit, ATP5A, leading to        abnormal mitochondrial morphology, increased oxidative stress, glial activation,        apoptosis, and altered neuronal morphology as early as 4∼5 months of age in        APP/PS1 mice. Electrophysiological recordings revealed abnormal miniature        excitatory postsynaptic current in the mPFC together with a minor connectivity        change between the mPFC and HIPP, correlating with social deficits. These results        suggest that abnormal mitochondrial dynamics, which worsen with disease        progression, could be a biomarker of early-stage AD.

To understand the reasoning behind this, we        investigated how OA and APOE-ε4 influence the accumulation of β-amyloid (Aβ) and        tau accumulation in primary motor and somatosensory regions in Aβ-positive (Aβ+)        older individuals. METHODS: We selected Aβ+ Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging        Initiative participants, defined by baseline (18)F-florbetapir (FBP) Aβ PET        standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) of AD summary cortical regions, who had        longitudinal Aβ PET, the records of OA medical history, and APOE-ε4 genotyping.        We examined how OA and APOE-ε4 relate to baseline and longitudinal Aβ        accumulation and tau deposition measured at follow-up in precentral and        postcentral cortical areas and how they modulate Aβ-associated future higher tau        levels, adjusting for age, sex, and diagnosis and using multiple comparison        corrections. RESULTS: A total of 374 individuals (mean age 75 years, 49.2%        female, 62.8% APOE-ε4 carriers) who underwent longitudinal FBP PET with a median        follow-up of 3.3 years (interquartile range [IQR] 3.4, range 1.6-9.4) were        analyzed, and 96 people had (18)F-flortaucipir (FTP) tau PET measured at a median        of 5.4 (IQR 1.9, range 4.0-9.3) years postbaseline FBP PET. Neither OA nor        APOE-ε4 was related to baseline FBP SUVR in precentral and postcentral regions.        At follow-up, OA rather than APOE-ε4 was associated with faster Aβ accumulation        in postcentral region (β = 0.005, 95% CI 0.001-0.008) over time. In addition, OA        but not the APOE-ε4 allele was strongly linked to higher follow-up FTP tau levels        in precentral (β = 0.098, 95% CI 0.034-0.162) and postcentral (β = 0.105, 95% CI        0.040-0.169) cortices. OA and APOE-ε4 were also interactively associated with        higher follow-up FTP tau deposition in precentral (β = 0.128, 95% CI 0.030-0.226)        and postcentral (β = 0.124, 95% CI 0.027-0.223) regions. DISCUSSION: This study        suggests that OA was associated with faster Aβ accumulation and higher        Aβ-dependent future tau deposition in primary motor and somatosensory regions,        providing novel insights into how OA increases the risk of AD.",e3c8838037a047cf2c09ba19aebb16007de580f6,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e3c8838037a047cf2c09ba19aebb16007de580f6,37188537,PMC10351313,background,False,Neurology,0401060,0.3087110221385956,0.0,5,0.0,0.49246231155778897,0.005025125628140704,0.1672364222194681

Here, we analyzed if the deletion of Gadd45a activates        pathways involved in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's Disease        (AD). This study used wild-type (WT) and Gadd45a knockout (Gadd45a(-/-)) mice to        evaluate AD progression. Behavioral tests showed that Gadd45a(-/-) mice presented        lower working and spatial memory, pointing out an apparent cognitive impairment        compared with WT animals, accompanied by an increase in Tau hyperphosphorylation        and the levels of kinases involved in its phosphorylation in the hippocampus.        Moreover, Gadd45a(-/-) animals significantly increased the brain's        pro-inflammatory cytokines and modified autophagy markers. Notably, neurotrophins        and the dendritic spine length of the neurons were reduced in Gadd45a(-/-) mice,        which could contribute to the cognitive alterations observed in these animals.        Overall, these findings demonstrate that the lack of the Gadd45a gene activates        several pathways that exacerbate AD pathology, suggesting that promoting this        protein's expression or function might be a promising therapeutic strategy to        slow down AD progression.",3a8d09ea3cceb32ed1ae285d4b43a7cc4904797c,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3a8d09ea3cceb32ed1ae285d4b43a7cc4904797c,38473843,PMC10931605,,False,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,0.3078780174255371,0.03389830508474576,0,6.208,0.02512562814070352,0.5376884422110553,0.19034483781432326

Evolving from the long-held viewpoint that immune        activation triggers the pathological trajectory in Alzheimer's disease, there is        accumulating evidence now that microglial activation is neither pro-amyloidogenic        nor just a simple reactive process to the proteinopathy. Preclinical studies        highlight an interesting aspect of immunity, i.e., spurring immune system        activity may be beneficial under certain circumstances. Indeed, a dynamic        evolving relationship between different activation states of the immune system        and its neuronal neighbors is thought to regulate overall brain organ health in        both healthy aging and progression of Alzheimer's dementia. A new premise        evolving from genome, transcriptome, and proteome data is that there might be at        least two major phases of immune activation that accompany the pathological        trajectory in Alzheimer's disease. Though activation on a chronic scale will        certainly lead to neurodegeneration, this emerging knowledge of a potential        beneficial aspect of immune activation allows us to form holistic insights into        when, where, and how much immune system activity would need to be tuned to impact        the Alzheimer's neurodegenerative cascade. Even with the trove of recently        emerging -omics data from patients and preclinical models, how microglial        phenotypes are functionally related to the transition of a healthy aging brain        towards progressive degenerative state remains unknown.

It has long been known that autoimmune        diseases and chronic inflammatory disorders are characterized by dysregulated        immune responses, leading to excessive and uncontrol tissue inflammation. The        dysregulation of epigenetic alterations including DNA methylation,        posttranslational modifications to histone proteins, and noncoding RNA expression        has been implicated in a host of inflammatory disorders and the immune system.

From their fluorodeoxyglucose PET we constructed        metabolic networks, evaluated their modular structures using the Louvain        algorithm, and compared them between risk groups. As the risk for Alzheimer's        disease increased, the metabolic connections among brain regions weakened and        became more modular, indicating network fragmentation and functional impairment        of the brain.

Given        the unmet medical need, it is necessary to reevaluate the existing paradigms of        how to target these diseases. When considering neurodegenerative diseases from a        systemic neurometabolic perspective, it becomes possible to explain the shared        pathological features. This innovative approach presented in this paper draws        upon extensive research conducted by the authors and researchers worldwide. In        this review, we highlight the importance of metabolic mitochondrial dysfunction        in the context of neurodegenerative diseases. We provide an overview of the risk        factors associated with developing neurodegenerative disorders, including        genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors. Additionally, we examine        pathological mechanisms implicated in these diseases such as oxidative stress,        accumulation of misfolded proteins, inflammation, demyelination, death of        neurons, insulin resistance, dysbiosis, and neurotransmitter disturbances.

Emerging evidence has demonstrated microglia-driven        neuroinflammation as a key contributor to the onset and progression of AD,        however, the mechanisms that mediate neuroinflammation remain largely unknown.        Recent studies have suggested mitochondrial dysfunction including mitochondrial        DNA (mtDNA) damage, metabolic defects, and quality control (QC) disorders        precedes microglial activation and subsequent neuroinflammation. Therefore, an        in-depth understanding of the relationship between mitochondrial dysfunction and        microglial activation in AD is important to unveil the pathogenesis of AD and        develop effective approaches for early AD diagnosis and treatment. In this        review, we summarized current progress in the roles of mtDNA, mitochondrial        metabolism, mitochondrial QC changes in microglial activation in AD, and provide        comprehensive thoughts for targeting microglial mitochondria as potential        therapeutic strategies of AD.",eb4880172a68c9091ae4139d049f20d04c0029af,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/eb4880172a68c9091ae4139d049f20d04c0029af,36203194,PMC9535890,background,False,Journal of neuroinflammation,101222974,0.26020142436027527,0.028985507246376812,32,9.587,0.949748743718593,0.8140703517587939,0.3542274945282413

Though        efforts continue towards broadening and deepening our knowledge and understanding        of the mechanistic and neuropathological underpinnings of AD, our previous        failures motivate a re-examination of how we conceptualize AD pathology and        progression. In addition to not yielding effective treatments, the phenotypically        heterogeneous biological processes that have been the primary area of focus to        date have not been adequately shown to be necessary or sufficient to explain the        risk and progression of AD. On the other hand, a growing body of evidence        indicates that lifestyle and environment represent the ultimate level of        causation for AD and age-related cognitive decline. Specifically, the decline in        cognitive demands over the lifespan plays a central role in driving the        structural and functional deteriorations of the brain. In the absence of adequate        cognitive stimulus, physiological demand-function coupling leads to        downregulation of growth, repair, and homeostatic processes, resulting in        deteriorating brain tissue health, function, and capacity. In this setting, the        heterogeneity of associated neuropathological tissue hallmarks then occurs as a        consequence of an individual's genetic and environmental background and are best        considered downstream markers of the disease process rather than specific targets        for direct intervention.

The disease is marked by        severe cognitive and psychiatric decline and has dramatic personal and social        consequences. Considerable time and resources are dedicated to the pursuit of a        better understanding of disease mechanisms; however, the ultimate goal of        obtaining a viable treatment option remains elusive. Neurodegenerative disease as        an outcome of gene-environment interaction is a notion widely accepted today; a        clear understanding of how external factors are involved in disease pathogenesis        is missing, however. In the case of AD, significant effort has been invested in        the study of viral pathogens and their role in disease mechanisms. The current        scoping review focuses on the purported role HHV-6 plays in AD pathogenesis.        First, early studies demonstrating evidence of HHV-6 cantonment in either        post-mortem AD brain specimens or in peripheral blood samples of living AD        patients are reviewed. Next, selected examples of possible mechanisms whereby        viral infection can directly or indirectly contribute to AD pathogenesis are        presented, such as autophagy dysregulation, the interaction between miR155 and        HHV-6, and amyloid-beta as an antimicrobial peptide.

Their inter-individual variations, complex        interrelations, and relevance for clinical manifestation and disease progression        remain poorly understood. We hypothesize that specific molecular patterns        indicating both known and yet unidentified pathway alterations are associated        with distinct aspects of AD pathology. METHODS: We performed multi-level        cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) omics in a well-characterized cohort of older adults        with normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment, and mild dementia. Proteomics,        metabolomics, lipidomics, one-carbon metabolism, and neuroinflammation related        molecules were analyzed at single-omic level with correlation and regression        approaches. Multi-omics factor analysis was used to integrate all biological        levels. Identified analytes were used to construct best predictive models of the        presence of AD pathology and of cognitive decline with multifactorial regression        analysis. Pathway enrichment analysis identified pathway alterations in AD.        RESULTS: Multi-omics integration identified five major dimensions of        heterogeneity explaining the variance within the cohort and differentially        associated with AD. Further analysis exposed multiple interactions between single        'omics modalities and distinct multi-omics molecular signatures differentially        related to amyloid pathology, neuronal injury, and tau hyperphosphorylation.        Enrichment pathway analysis revealed overrepresentation of the hemostasis, immune        response, and extracellular matrix signaling pathways in association with AD.        Finally, combinations of four molecules improved prediction of both AD (protein        14-3-3 zeta/delta, clusterin, interleukin-15, and transgelin-2) and cognitive        decline (protein 14-3-3 zeta/delta, clusterin, cholesteryl ester 27:1 16:0 and        monocyte chemoattractant protein-1).

AD is also associated with other pathologies such as        neuroinflammation, dysfunction of synaptic connections and circuits, disorders in        mitochondrial function and energy production, epigenetic changes, and        abnormalities in the vascular system. Despite extensive research conducted over        the last hundred years, little is established about what causes AD or how to        effectively treat it. Given the severity of the disease and the increasing number        of affected individuals, there is a critical need to discover effective        medications for AD. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved        several new drug molecules for AD management since 2003, but these drugs only        provide temporary relief of symptoms and do not address the underlying causes of        the disease. Currently, available medications focus on correcting the        neurotransmitter disruption observed in AD, including cholinesterase inhibitors        and an antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, which temporarily        alleviates the signs of dementia but does not prevent or reverse the course of        AD. Research towards disease-modifying AD treatments is currently underway,        including gene therapy, lipid nanoparticles, and dendrimer-based therapy. These        innovative approaches aim to target the underlying pathological processes of AD        rather than just managing the symptoms.

We suppressed        epileptiform activity by treatment with the antiepileptic drug levetiracetam or        by genetic ablation of tau and found that these interventions reversed or        prevented aberrant microglial gene expression in brain tissues of aged human        amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice, which simulate several key aspects of        AD. The most robustly modulated genes included multiple factors previously        implicated in AD pathogenesis, including TREM2, the hypofunction of which        increases disease risk. Genetic reduction of TREM2 exacerbated epileptiform        activity after mice were injected with kainate. We conclude that AD-related        epileptiform activity markedly changes the molecular profile of microglia,        inducing both maladaptive and adaptive alterations in their activities.

Immune        regulation by microglia plays a major role in the progression of aging and AD,        according to the functions of 41 intersecting differentially expressed genes in        microglia. Signaling crosstalk between C-C motif chemokine ligand (CCL) and major        histocompatibility complex-1 bridges intercellular communication in the        hippocampus during aging and AD. The amyloid precursor protein (APP) and colony        stimulating factor (CSF) signals drive 5× FAD to deviate from aging track to AD        occurrence among intercellular communication in hippocampus. Microglia are        involved in the progression of aging and AD can be divided into 10 functional        types.

YKL-40 is a secreted        astrocytic glycoprotein that serves as a diagnostic biomarker of Alzheimer's        disease. High levels of YKL-40 are associated with either advanced Alzheimer's        disease or the normal aging process. However, the functional role of YKL-40 in        Alzheimer's disease development has not been firmly established. In a 5xFAD mouse        model of Alzheimer's disease, we observed increased YKL-40 expression in the        cerebrospinal fluid of 7-month-old mice and was correlated with activated        astrocytes. In primary astrocytes, Aβ(1-42) upregulated YKL-40 in a        dose-dependent manner and was correlated with PI3-K signaling pathway activation.        Furthermore, primary neurons treated with YKL-40 and/or Aβ(1-42) resulted in        significant synaptic degeneration, reduced dendritic complexity, and impaired        electrical parameters. More importantly, astrocyte-specific knockout of YKL-40        over a period of 7 days in symptomatic 5xFAD mice could effectively reduce        amyloid plaque deposition in multiple brain regions. This was also associated        with attenuated glial activation, reduced neuronal attrition, and restored memory        function.

In this context, animal models that progressively display AD        pathological hallmarks (e.g. TgF344-AD) become crucial. Translational        technologies, such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), enable the        longitudinal metabolic characterization of this disease. However, an integrative        approach is required to unravel the complex metabolic changes underlying AD        progression, from early to advanced stages. TgF344-AD and wild-type (WT) rats        were studied in vivo on a 7 Tesla MRI scanner, for longitudinal quantitative        assessment of brain metabolic profile changes using MRS. Disease progression was        investigated at 4 time points, from 9 to 18 months of age, and in 4 regions:        cortex, hippocampus, striatum, and thalamus. Compared to WT, TgF344-AD rats        replicated common findings in AD patients, including decreased N-acetylaspartate        in the cortex, hippocampus and thalamus, and decreased glutamate in the thalamus        and striatum. Different longitudinal evolution of metabolic concentration was        observed between TgF344-AD and WT groups. Namely, age-dependent trajectories        differed between groups for creatine in the cortex and thalamus and for taurine        in cortex, with significant decreases in Tg344-AD animals; whereas myo-inositol        in the thalamus and striatum showed greater increase along time in the WT group.        Additional analysis revealed divergent intra- and inter-regional metabolic        coupling in each group. Thus, in cortex, strong couplings of N-acetylaspartate        and creatine with myo-inositol in WT, but with taurine in TgF344-AD rats were        observed; whereas in the hippocampus, myo-inositol, taurine and choline compounds        levels were highly correlated in WT but not in TgF344-AD animals. Furthermore,        specific cortex-hippocampus-striatum metabolic crosstalks were found for taurine        levels in the WT group but for myo-inositol levels in the TgF344-AD rats. With a        systems biology perspective of metabolic changes in AD pathology, our results        shed light into the complex spatio-temporal metabolic rewiring in this disease,        reported here for the first time. Age- and tissue-dependent imbalances between        myo-inositol, taurine and other metabolites, such as creatine, unveil their role        in disease progression, while pointing to the inadequacy of the latter as an        internal reference for quantification.",6b463f3367185d49f65132dfb710456ebc88bd0b,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6b463f3367185d49f65132dfb710456ebc88bd0b,36216838,PMC9550832,,False,Scientific reports,101563288,0.24490438401699066,0.0,0,4.996,0.06532663316582915,0.271356783919598,0.12397382776791127

METHODS: Florbetaben,        PBR28, and MK-6240 PET, T1 magnetic resonance imaging, and cognitive measures        were performed in 19 cognitively unimpaired older adults and 22 patients with        mild cognitive impairment or mild AD to examine associations among microglia        activation, Aβ, tau, and cognition, adjusting for neurodegeneration. Mediation        analyses evaluated the possible role of microglial activation along the AD        progression model. RESULTS: Higher PBR28 uptake was associated with higher Aβ,        higher tau, and lower MMSE score, independent of neurodegeneration. PBR28        mediated associations between tau in early and middle Braak stages, between tau        and neurodegeneration, and between neurodegeneration and cognition.

In a transgenic RNAi screen using Drosophila as a model, we uncovered        that knockdown (KD) of Dsor1 (the Drosophila MAPK kinase dMEK) suppressed TDP-43        toxicity without altering TDP-43 phosphorylation or protein levels. Further        investigation revealed that the Dsor1 downstream gene rl (dERK) was abnormally        upregulated in TDP-43 flies, and neuronal overexpression of dERK induced profound        upregulation of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). We also detected a robust immune        overactivation in TDP-43 flies, which could be suppressed by downregulation of        the MEK/ERK pathway in TDP-43 fly neurons. Furthermore, neuronal KD of abnormally        increased AMPs improved the motor function of TDP-43 flies. On the other hand,        neuronal KD of Dnr1, a negative regulator of the Drosophila immune deficiency        (IMD) pathway, activated the innate immunity and boosted AMP expression        independent of the regulation by the MEK/ERK pathway, which diminished the        mitigating effect of RNAi-dMEK on TDP-43 toxicity. Finally, we showed that an        FDA-approved MEK inhibitor trametinib markedly suppressed immune overactivation,        alleviated motor deficits and prolonged the lifespan of TDP-43 flies, but did not        exhibit a lifespan-extending effect in Alzheimer disease (AD) or spinocerebellar        ataxia type 3 (SCA3) fly models. Together, our findings suggest an important role        of abnormal elevation of the MEK/ERK signaling and innate immunity in TDP-43        pathogenesis and propose trametinib as a potential therapeutic agent for ALS and        other TDP-43-related diseases.",e0c9692b1845cb78bab0411a69a0bf8f4f226c53,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e0c9692b1845cb78bab0411a69a0bf8f4f226c53,37340309,PMC10280928,background,False,Immunity & ageing : I & A,101235427,0.23318208754062653,0.0,1,9.701,0.23115577889447236,0.8542713567839196,0.23276869661394675

This study is aimed to        identify key regulators of the cell cycle and their underlying pathways for        developing optimal treatment of AD. METHODS: RNA sequencing data were profiled to        screen for differentially expressed genes in the cell cycle. Correlation of        created modules with AD phenotype was computed by weight gene correlation network        analysis (WGCNA). Signature genes for trophic factor receptors were determined        using Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) analysis. RESULTS: Among the 13,679        background genes, 775 cell cycle genes and 77 trophic factor receptors were        differentially expressed in AD versus nondementia controls. Four coexpression        modules were constructed by WGCNA, among which the turquoise module had the        strongest correlation with AD. According to PCC analysis, 10 signature trophic        receptors most strongly interacting with cell cycle genes were filtered and        subsequently displayed in the global regulatory network. Further cross-talking        pathways of signature receptors, such as glutamatergic synapse, long-term        potentiation, PI3K-Akt, and MAPK signaling pathways, were identified.

Together with recent        progress in vector development for efficiently targeting the central nervous        system, gene therapy has been suggested as a potential therapeutic modality to        overcome the limited delivery of conventional types of drugs to and within the        damaged brain. In addition, given increasing evidence of the strong link between        glia and AD pathophysiology, therapeutic targets have been moving toward those        addressing glial cell pathology. Nurr1 and Foxa2 are transcription/epigenetic        regulators that have been reported to cooperatively regulate inflammatory and        neurotrophic response in glial cells. In this study, we tested the therapeutic        potential of Nurr1 and Foxa2 gene delivery to treat AD symptoms and pathologies.

Accumulation of β-amyloid peptide (Aβ) and mitochondrial dysfunction results        in chronic microglial activation, which enhances neuroinflammation and promotes        neurodegeneration. Microglia are resident macrophages of the brain and spinal        cord which play an important role in maintaining brain homeostasis through a        variety of phenotypes, including the pro-inflammatory phenotype and        anti-inflammatory phenotypes. However, persistently activated microglial cells        generate reactive species and neurotoxic mediators. Therefore, inhibitors of        microglial activation are seen to have promise in AD control. The modified        TPP/MoS(2) QD blend is a mitochondrion-targeted nanomaterial that exhibits        cytoprotective activities and antioxidant properties through scavenging free        radicals. In the present study, the cell viability and cytotoxicity of the        DSPE-PEG-TPP/MoS(2) QD blend on microglial cells stimulated by Aβ were        investigated. The levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial        membrane potential (MMP) were also assessed. In addition, pro-inflammatory and        anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α),        interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), transforming growth factor beta        (TGF-β), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and arginase-1 (Arg-I) were        measured in the presence or absence of the DSPE-PEG-TPP/MoS(2) QD blend on an        immortalized microglia cells activated by accumulation of Aβ. We found that the        DSPE-PEG-TPP/MoS(2) QD blend was biocompatible and nontoxic at specific        concentrations. Furthermore, the modified TPP/MoS(2) QD blend significantly        reduced the release of free radicals and improved the mitochondrial function        through the upregulation of MMP in a dose-dependent manner on microglial cells        treated with Aβ. In addition, pre-treatment of microglia with the        DSPE-PEG-TPP/MoS(2) QD blend at concentrations of 25 and 50 μg/mL prior to Aβ        stimulation significantly inhibited the release and expression of        pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and iNOS. Nevertheless,        the anti-inflammatory cytokines TGF-β and Arg-I were activated.

In healthy central nervous system, microglia adopt ramified,        ""surveying"" phenotype with compact cell bodies and elongated processes. In AD,        the presence of pathogenic proteins such as extracellular Aβ plaques and        hyperphosphorylated tau, induce the transformation of ramified microglia into        amoeboid microglia. Ameboid microglia are highly phagocytic immune cells and        actively secrete a cascade of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. However,        the phagocytic ability of microglia gradually declines with age, and thus the        clearance of pathogenic proteins becomes highly ineffective, leading to the        accumulation of Aβ plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau in the aging brain. The        accumulation of pathogenic proteins further augments the neuroinflammatory        responses and sustains the activation of microglia. The excessive production of        pro-inflammatory cytokines induces a massive loss of functional synapses and        neurons, further worsening the disease condition of AD. More recently, the        identification of a subset of microglia by transcriptomic studies, namely        disease-associated microglia (DAM), the progressive transition from homeostatic        microglia to DAM is TREM2-dependent and the homeostatic microglia gradually        acquire the state of DAM during the disease progression of AD. Recent in-depth        transcriptomic analysis identifies ApoE and Trem2 from microglia as the major        risk factors for AD pathogenesis. In this review, we summarize current        understandings of the functional roles of age-dependent microglial activation and        neuroinflammation in the pathogenesis of AD. To this end, the exponential growth        in transcriptomic data provides a solid foundation for in silico drug screening        and gains further insight into the development of microglia-based therapeutic        interventions for AD.",95815bec6dd7af7ef36672dd250af83dca30e514,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/95815bec6dd7af7ef36672dd250af83dca30e514,35693341,PMC9178186,"background,result",True,Frontiers in aging neuroscience,101525824,0.22541658580303192,0.10655737704918032,16,5.702,0.8291457286432161,0.35678391959798994,0.28813737379676263
10.3390/ijms24098230,CX3CL1 Pathway as a Molecular Target for Treatment Strategies in Alzheimer's        Disease.,2023.0,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a scourge for patients, caregivers and healthcare        professionals due to the progressive character of the disease and the lack of        effective treatments. AD is considered a proteinopathy, which means that        aetiological and clinical features of AD have been linked to the deposition of        amyloid β (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylated tau protein aggregates throughout the        brain, with Aβ and hyperphosphorylated tau representing classical AD hallmarks.        However, some other putative mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of the        disease have been proposed, including inflammation in the brain, microglia        activation, impaired hippocampus neurogenesis and alterations in the production        and release of neurotrophic factors. Among all, microglia activation and chronic        inflammation in the brain gained some attention, with researchers worldwide        wondering whether it is possible to prevent and stop, respectively, the onset and        progression of the disease by modulating microglia phenotypes. The following key        points have been established so far: (i) Aβ deposition in brain parenchyma        represents repeated stimulus determining chronic activation of microglia; (ii)        chronic activation and priming of microglia make these cells lose neuroprotective        functions and favour damage and loss of neurons; (iii) quiescent status of        microglia at baseline prevents chronic activation and priming, meaning that the        more microglia are quiescent, the less they become neurotoxic. Many molecules are        known to modulate the quiescent baseline state of microglia, attracting huge        interest among scientists as to whether these molecules could be used as valuable        targets in AD treatment. The downside of the coin came early with the observation        that quiescent microglia do not display phagocytic ability, being unable to clear        Aβ deposits since phagocytosis is crucial for Aβ clearance efficacy. A possible        solution for this issue could be found in the modulation of microglia status at        baseline, which could help maintain both neuroprotective features and phagocytic        ability at the same time. Among the molecules known to influence the baseline        status of microglia, C-X3-chemokine Ligand 1 (CX3CL1), also known as Fractalkine        (FKN), is one of the most investigated. FKN and its microglial receptor CX3CR1        are crucial players in the interplay between neurons and microglia, modulating        the operation of some neural circuits and the efficacy and persistence of immune        response against injury. In addition, CX3CL1 regulates synaptic pruning and        plasticity in the developmental age and in adulthood, when it strongly impacts        the hippocampus neurogenesis of the adult. CX3CL1 has an effect on Aβ clearance        and tau phosphorylation, as well as in microglia activation and priming. For all        the above, CX3CL1/CX3CR1 signalling has been widely studied in relation to AD        pathogenesis, and its biochemical pathway could hide molecular targets for novel        treatment strategies in AD. This review summarizes the possible role of CX3CL1 in        AD pathogenesis and its use as a potential target for AD treatment.",8183608dfe6bdbd8c3279b108da61206af035165,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8183608dfe6bdbd8c3279b108da61206af035165,37175935,PMC10179163,background,True,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,0.224735289812088,0.14925373134328357,6,6.208,0.5326633165829145,0.5477386934673367,0.28918238098847754

However, so far, a global        view of AD-associated metabolic changes in the brain has been missing. METHODS:        We metabolically profiled 500 samples from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.        Metabolite levels were correlated with eight clinical parameters, covering both        late-life cognitive performance and AD neuropathology measures. RESULTS: We        observed widespread metabolic dysregulation associated with AD, spanning 298        metabolites from various AD-relevant pathways. These included alterations to        bioenergetics, cholesterol metabolism, neuroinflammation, and metabolic        consequences of neurotransmitter ratio imbalances. Our findings further suggest        impaired osmoregulation as a potential pathomechanism in AD. Finally, inspecting        the interplay of proteinopathies provided evidence that metabolic associations        were largely driven by tau pathology rather than amyloid beta pathology.

10.3389/fphar.2023.1161850,Revisiting the neuroinflammation hypothesis in Alzheimer's disease: a focus on        the druggability of current targets.,2023.0,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of neurodegenerative disease and        disability in the elderly; it is estimated to account for 60%-70% of all cases of        dementia worldwide. The most relevant mechanistic hypothesis to explain AD        symptoms is neurotoxicity induced by aggregated amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) and        misfolded tau protein. These molecular entities are seemingly insufficient to        explain AD as a multifactorial disease characterized by synaptic dysfunction,        cognitive decline, psychotic symptoms, chronic inflammatory environment within        the central nervous system (CNS), activated microglial cells, and dysfunctional        gut microbiota. The discovery that AD is a neuroinflammatory disease linked to        innate immunity phenomena started in the early nineties by several authors,        including the ICC´s group that described, in 2004, the role IL-6 in AD-type        phosphorylation of tau protein in deregulating the cdk5/p35 pathway. The ""Theory        of Neuroimmunomodulation"", published in 2008, proposed the onset and progression        of degenerative diseases as a multi-component ""damage signals"" phenomena,        suggesting the feasibility of ""multitarget"" therapies in AD. This theory explains        in detail the cascade of molecular events stemming from microglial disorder        through the overactivation of the Cdk5/p35 pathway. All these knowledge have led        to the rational search for inflammatory druggable targets against AD. The        accumulated evidence on increased levels of inflammatory markers in the        cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of AD patients, along with reports describing CNS        alterations caused by senescent immune cells in neuro-degenerative diseases, set        out a conceptual framework in which the neuroinflammation hypothesis is being        challenged from different angles towards developing new therapies against AD. The        current evidence points to controversial findings in the search for therapeutic        candidates to treat neuroinflammation in AD. In this article, we discuss a        neuroimmune-modulatory perspective for pharmacological exploration of molecular        targets against AD, as well as potential deleterious effects of modifying        neuroinflammation in the brain parenchyma. We specifically focus on the role of B        and T cells, immuno-senescence, the brain lymphatic system (BLS), gut-brain axis        alterations, and dysfunctional interactions between neurons, microglia and        astrocytes.

10.1038/s41598-023-31730-5,Genetic correlations between Alzheimer's disease and gut microbiome genera.,2023.0,"A growing body of evidence suggests that dysbiosis of the human gut microbiota is        associated with neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD) via        neuroinflammatory processes across the microbiota-gut-brain axis. The gut        microbiota affects brain health through the secretion of toxins and short-chain        fatty acids, which modulates gut permeability and numerous immune functions.        Observational studies indicate that AD patients have reduced microbiome        diversity, which could contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease. Uncovering        the genetic basis of microbial abundance and its effect on AD could suggest        lifestyle changes that may reduce an individual's risk for the disease. Using the        largest genome-wide association study of gut microbiota genera from the MiBioGen        consortium, we used polygenic risk score (PRS) analyses with the ""best-fit"" model        implemented in PRSice-2 and determined the genetic correlation between 119 genera        and AD in a discovery sample (ADc12 case/control: 1278/1293). To confirm the        results from the discovery sample, we next repeated the PRS analysis in a        replication sample (GenADA case/control: 799/778) and then performed a        meta-analysis with the PRS results from both samples. Finally, we conducted a        linear regression analysis to assess the correlation between the PRSs for the        significant genera and the APOE genotypes. In the discovery sample, 20 gut        microbiota genera were initially identified as genetically associated with AD        case/control status. Of these 20, three genera (Eubacterium fissicatena as a        protective factor, Collinsella, and Veillonella as a risk factor) were        independently significant in the replication sample. Meta-analysis with discovery        and replication samples confirmed that ten genera had a significant correlation        with AD, four of which were significantly associated with the APOE rs429358 risk        allele in a direction consistent with their protective/risk designation in AD        association. Notably, the proinflammatory genus Collinsella, identified as a risk        factor for AD, was positively correlated with the APOE rs429358 risk allele in        both samples. Overall, the host genetic factors influencing the abundance of ten        genera are significantly associated with AD, suggesting that these genera may        serve as biomarkers and targets for AD treatment and intervention. Our results        highlight that proinflammatory gut microbiota might promote AD development        through interaction with APOE.

However, it remains open as to how        different aspects of astrocytic and microglial activation affect disease        progression. Previously, we found that microglia expansion in the spinal cord,        initiated by IKK2/NF-κB activation in astrocytes, exhibits stage-dependent        beneficial effects on the progression of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Here, we        investigated the impact of NF-κB-initiated neuroinflammation on AD pathogenesis        using the APP23 mouse model of AD in combination with conditional activation of        IKK2/NF-κB signaling in astrocytes. We show that NF-κB activation in astrocytes        triggers a distinct neuroinflammatory response characterized by striking        astrogliosis as well as prominent microglial reactivity. Immunohistochemistry and        Congo red staining revealed an overall reduction in the size and number of        amyloid plaques in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Interestingly, isolated        primary astrocytes and microglia cells exhibit specific marker gene profiles        which, in the case of microglia, point to an enhanced plaque clearance capacity.        In contrast, direct IKK2/NF-κB activation in microglia results in a        pro-inflammatory polarization program.

Yet, how canonical amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau        pathologies regulate microglia subtypes during the progression of AD remains        poorly understood. METHODS: We use single-cell RNA-sequencing to profile        microglia subtypes from mice exhibiting both Aβ and tau pathologies across        disease progression. We identify novel microglia subtypes that are induced in        response to both Aβ and tau pathologies in a disease-stage-specific manner. To        validate the observation in AD mouse models, we also generated a snRNA-Seq        dataset from the human superior frontal gyrus (SFG) and entorhinal cortex (ERC)        at different Braak stages. RESULTS: We show that during early-stage disease,        interferon signaling induces a subtype of microglia termed Early-stage        AD-Associated Microglia (EADAM) in response to both Aβ and tau pathologies.        During late-stage disease, a second microglia subtype termed Late-stage        AD-Associated Microglia (LADAM) is detected. While similar microglia subtypes are        observed in other models of neurodegenerative disease, the magnitude and        composition of gene signatures found in EADAM and LADAM are distinct, suggesting        the necessity of both Aβ and tau pathologies to elicit their emergence.        Importantly, the pattern of EADAM- and LADAM-associated gene expression is        observed in microglia from AD brains, during the early (Braak II)- or late (Braak        VI/V)- stage of the disease, respectively. Furthermore, we show that several        Siglec genes are selectively expressed in either EADAM or LADAM. Siglecg is        expressed in white-matter-associated LADAM, and expression of Siglec-10, the        human orthologue of Siglecg, is progressively elevated in an AD-stage-dependent        manner but not shown in non-AD tauopathy.

A recent study revealed that manipulating gut microbiota        (GM) significantly reduced tau pathology and neurodegeneration in an        apolipoprotein E isoform-dependent manner. The resilience of a healthy microbiota        protects it from a variety of dysbiosis-related pathologies. Convincing evidence        has demonstrated the roles of GM in the pathogenesis of AD, which are partly        mediated by modified microglial activity in the brain. Therefore, modulation of        GM may be a promising therapeutic option for AD prevention. In addition to        providing the cells with energy and affecting microglial maturation, these        microbial metabolites appear to influence neuronal function. One of the potential        therapeutic approaches targeting GM may involve using probiotics. Additionally,        human GM and its metabolites have also become potential therapeutic targets for        developing interventions for the prevention of disorders. Synbiotics and        postbiotics can also be used to treat AD by modulating GM. In addition, physical        activity, exercise, and physical fitness are being considered as potential        nonpharmacological therapies to reduce signaling pathways related to        neuroinflammation.

Autophagy is strongly associated with the        progression of Alzheimer disease (AD). Microglia are brain-resident macrophages,        and recent studies indicate that autophagy in microglia protects neurons from        neurodegeneration. Postnatal neurogenesis, the generation of new neurons from        adult neural stem cells (NSCs), is impaired in AD patients as well as in AD        animal models. However, the extent to which microglial autophagy influences adult        NSCs and neurogenesis in AD animal models has not been studied. Here, we showed        that conditional knock out (cKO) of Atg5 (autophagy related 5) in microglia        inhibited postnatal neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus,        but not in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of a 5×FAD mouse model. Interestingly,        the protection of neurogenesis by Atg5 in microglia was only observed in female        AD mice. To confirm the roles of autophagy in microglia for postnatal hippocampal        neurogenesis, we generated additional cKO mice to delete autophagy essential        genes Rb1cc1 or Atg14 in microglia. However, these rb1cc1 cKO and atg14 cKO mice        did not exhibit neurogenesis defects in the context of a female AD mouse model.        Last, we used the CSF1R antagonist to deplete ATG5-deficient microglia and this        intervention restored neurogenesis in the hippocampus of 5×FAD mice. These        results indicate that microglial ATG5 is essential to maintain postnatal        hippocampal neurogenesis in a mouse model of AD. Our findings further support the        notion that ATG5 in microglia supports NSC health and may prevent        neurodegeneration.Abbreviations: 5×FAD: familial Alzheimer disease; Aβ:        β-amyloid; AD: Alzheimer disease; AIF1: allograft inflammatory factor 1; ATG:        autophagy related; BrdU: 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine; CA: Cornu Ammonis; cKO:        conditional knock out; CSF1R: colony stimulating factor 1 receptor; Ctrl:        control; DCX: doublecortin; DG: dentate gyrus; GFAP: glial fibrillary acidic        protein; GZ: granular zone; H&E: hematoxylin and eosin; IF: immunofluorescence;        LD: lipid droplet; LDAM: lipid droplets accumulated microglia; LPS:        lipopolysaccharides; MAP1LC3B/LC3: microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3        beta; NSCs: neural stem cells; RB1CC1: RB1-inducible coiled-coil 1; SOX2: SRY        (sex determining region Y)-box 2; SGZ: subgranular zone; SVZ: subventricular        zone; WT: wild type.",76eec6fddd8d3f3d20729b4e4baf0051f0f24b3d,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/76eec6fddd8d3f3d20729b4e4baf0051f0f24b3d,37915255,PMC11062374,,False,Autophagy,101265188,0.21983955800533295,0.027777777777777776,0,13.391,0.08542713567839195,0.9045226130653267,0.2255554408242688

Neuroinflammation and the accumulation of amyloid        protein are amongst the hallmarks of this disease and most translational research        to date has focused on targeting these two processes. However, the exact etiology        of AD remains to be fully elucidated. When compared alongside, the immune        response in AD closely resembles the central nervous system (CNS) immune changes        seen in elderly individuals. It is possible that AD is a pathological consequence        of an aged immune system secondary to chronic stimulation by a previous or        ongoing insult. Pathological changes like amyloid accumulation and neuronal cell        death may reflect this process of immunosenescence as the CNS immune system fails        to maintain homeostasis in the CNS. It is likely that future treatments designed        to modulate the aged immune system may prove beneficial in altering the disease        course. The development of new tests for appropriate biomarkers would also be        essential in screening for patients most likely to benefit from such treatments.",6070a470e30de03c1d6c76f48b1a095e999f48f9,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6070a470e30de03c1d6c76f48b1a095e999f48f9,34603320,PMC8484764,background,True,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,0.21900326013565063,0.13095238095238096,15,8.786,0.8241206030150754,0.7537688442211056,0.3547653475070747
10.3389/fphys.2022.814999,Microglial Activation Modulated by P2X4R in Ischemia and Repercussions in        Alzheimer's Disease.,2022.0,"There are over 80 million people currently living who have had a stroke. The        ischemic injury in the brain starts a cascade of events that lead to neuronal        death, inducing neurodegeneration which could lead to Alzheimer's disease (AD).        Cerebrovascular diseases have been suggested to contribute to AD        neuropathological changes, including brain atrophy and accumulation of abnormal        proteins such as amyloid beta (Aβ). In patients older than 60 years, the        incidence of dementia a year after stroke was significantly increased.        Nevertheless, the molecular links between stroke and dementia are not clearly        understood but could be related to neuroinflammation. Considering that activated        microglia has a central role, there are brain-resident innate immune cells and        are about 10-15% of glial cells in the adult brain. Their phagocytic activity is        essential for synaptic homeostasis in different areas, such as the hippocampus.        These cells polarize into phenotypes or subtypes: the pro-inflammatory M1        phenotype, or the immunosuppressive M2 phenotype. Phenotype M1 is induced by        classical activation, where microglia secrete a high level of pro- inflammatory        factors which can cause damage to the surrounding neuronal cells. Otherwise, M2        phenotype is the major effector cell with the potential to counteract        pro-inflammatory reactions and promote repair genes expression. Moreover, after        the classical activation, an anti-inflammatory and a repair phase are initiated        to achieve tissue homeostasis. Recently it has been described the concepts of        homeostatic and reactive microglia and they had been related to major AD risk,        linking to a multifunctional microglial response to Aβ plaques and        pathophysiology markers related, such as intracellular increased calcium. The        upregulation and increased activity of purinergic receptors activated by ADP/ATP,        specially P2X4R, which has a high permeability to calcium and is mainly expressed        in microglial cells, is observed in diseases related to neuroinflammation, such        as neuropathic pain and stroke. Thus, P2X4R is associated with microglial        activation. P2X4R activation drives microglia motility via the        phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway. Also, these receptors are        involved in inflammatory-mediated prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production and induce a        secretion and increase the expression of BDNF and TNF-α which could be a link        between pathologies related to aging and neuroinflammation.",20110563b392792df2f7da3390ef166bdb507f07,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/20110563b392792df2f7da3390ef166bdb507f07,35283778,PMC8904919,background,False,Frontiers in physiology,101549006,0.21683959662914276,0.0,11,4.755,0.7537688442211056,0.22110552763819097,0.21128303476763732

In the context of neurodegenerative disorders such as        Alzheimer's disease (AD), inflammation plays a crucial role, often appearing as a        common manifestation despite the variability in the occurrence of other        pathophysiological hallmarks. Thus, combating neuroinflammation holds promise in        treating complex pathophysiological diseases like AD. Growing evidence suggests        the gut microbiome's crucial role in shaping the pathogenesis of AD by        influencing inflammatory mediators. Gut dysbiosis can potentially activate        neuroinflammatory pathways through bidirectional signaling of the gut-brain axis;        however, the precise mechanisms of this complex interweaved network remain        largely unclear. In these milieus, this review attempts to summarize the        contributing role of gut microbiome-mediated neuroinflammatory signals in AD        pathophysiology, while also pondering potential mechanisms through which        commensal and pathogenic gut microbes affect neuroinflammation. While certain        taxa such as Roseburia and Escherichia have been strongly correlated with AD,        other clades such as Bacteroides and Faecalibacterium exhibit variations at the        species and strain levels. In order to disentangle the inflammatory aspects of        neurodegeneration attributed to the gut microbiome, it is imperative that future        mechanistic studies investigate the species/strain-level dependency of        commensals, opportunistic, and pathogenic gut microbes that consistently show        correlations with AD patients across multiple associative studies.",647c9d9fdf3589184b7a90569c7f553e2476c35f,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/647c9d9fdf3589184b7a90569c7f553e2476c35f,38455083,PMC10917618,,False,Microbiome research reports,9918681186206676,0.2163424789905548,0.016,1,0.0,0.24120603015075376,0.035175879396984924,0.11276003012932724

Which Comes First: The        Chicken or the Egg?,2021.0,"The pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease involves β amyloid (Aβ) accumulation        known to induce synaptic dysfunction and neurodegeneration. The brain's        vulnerability to oxidative stress (OS) is considered a crucial detrimental factor        in Alzheimer's disease. OS and Aβ are linked to each other because Aβ induces OS,        and OS increases the Aβ deposition. Thus, the answer to the question ""which comes        first: the chicken or the egg?"" remains extremely difficult. In any case, the        evidence for the primary occurrence of oxidative stress in AD is attractive.        Thus, evidence indicates that a long period of gradual oxidative damage        accumulation precedes and results in the appearance of clinical and pathological        AD symptoms, including Aβ deposition, neurofibrillary tangle formation, metabolic        dysfunction, and cognitive decline. Moreover, oxidative stress plays a crucial        role in the pathogenesis of many risk factors for AD.

Attempts to prevent neurodegeneration in AD        have failed so far, highlighting the need for further clarification of the        underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms. Neuroinflammation seems to play a        crucial role in disease progression, although its specific contribution to AD        pathogenesis remains elusive. We have previously shown that the modulation of the        endocannabinoid system (ECS) renders beneficial effects in a context of        amyloidosis, which triggers neuroinflammation. In the 5xFAD model, the genetic        inactivation of the enzyme that degrades anandamide (AEA), the fatty acid amide        hydrolase (FAAH), was associated with a significant amelioration of the memory        deficit. METHODS: In this work, we use electrophysiology, flow cytometry and        molecular analysis to evaluate the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying        the improvement associated to the increased endocannabinoid tone in the 5xFAD        mouse(-) model. RESULTS: We demonstrate that the chronic enhancement of the        endocannabinoid tone rescues hippocampal synaptic plasticity in the 5xFAD mouse        model. At the CA3-CA1 synapse, both basal synaptic transmission and long-term        potentiation (LTP) of synaptic transmission are normalized upon FAAH genetic        inactivation, in a CB1 receptor (CB1R)- and TRPV1 receptor-independent manner.        Dendritic spine density in CA1 pyramidal neurons, which is notably decreased in        6-month-old 5xFAD animals, is also restored. Importantly, we reveal that the        expression of microglial factors linked to phagocytic activity, such as TREM2 and        CTSD, and other factors related to amyloid beta clearance and involved in        neuron-glia crosstalk, such as complement component C3 and complement receptor        C3AR, are specifically upregulated in 5xFAD/FAAH(-/-) animals. CONCLUSION: In        summary, our findings support the therapeutic potential of modulating, rather        than suppressing, neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease.

It has been shown that TLR/MYD88        signaling is involved in the chronic low-grade sterile inflammation associated        with AD. Several studies have evidenced high levels of MYD88 in the brain of        patients and animal models of AD, but no study has assessed so far its levels in        blood. METHODS: In this study we evaluated the blood mRNA levels of MYD88 in a        mouse model of AD, and also the putative effect of Rivastigmine treatment on        MYD88 expression. Twenty-eight transgenic APP/TAU mice (AT) and twenty-two        control C57/BL6j mice (WT) were included in this study, out of which five        transgenic AT and five WT mice were treated with Rivastigmine. RESULTS: Increased        MYD88 transcript in the whole blood from AT mice as compared to WT controls was        found, which seems to increase in time due to disease progression and not to        aging. This finding suggests that blood leukocytes are primed to develop        TLR/MYD-mediated inflammatory processes.

Knee OA was induced by destabilizing the medial meniscus (DMM)        in control (WT) and AD (5xFAD) mice before pathological symptoms. Mouse knee        joints were scanned with a micro-CT scanner. A sham operation was used as        control. Motor and cognitive abilities were tested after OA induction.        Neurodegeneration, β-amyloid plaque formation, and neuroinflammation were        analyzed by immunostaining, Western blotting, and RT-PCR in brain tissues.        Compared with sham controls, OA in AD mice increased inflammatory cytokine levels        in brain tissues. Furthermore, OA significantly increased β-amyloid deposition        and neuronal loss in AD mice compared to sham controls. In conclusion, knee OA        accelerated amyloid plaque deposition and neurodegeneration in AD-OA mice,        suggesting that OA is a risk factor for AD.",5a0e87435e4693eff2c17d114c19989cafaa0375,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5a0e87435e4693eff2c17d114c19989cafaa0375,36593507,PMC9809050,background,False,Molecular brain,101468876,0.20898497104644775,0.030303030303030304,7,4.399,0.5778894472361809,0.19597989949748743,0.1908971054451967

Impaired neuronal bioenergetics and neuroinflammation are thought to play key        roles in the progression of AD, but their interplay is not clear. Nicotinamide        adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)) is an important metabolite in all human cells in        which it is pivotal for multiple processes including DNA repair and mitophagy,        both of which are impaired in AD neurons. Here, we report that levels of NAD(+)        are reduced and markers of inflammation increased in the brains of APP/PS1 mutant        transgenic mice with beta-amyloid pathology. Treatment of APP/PS1 mutant mice        with the NAD(+) precursor nicotinamide riboside (NR) for 5 mo increased brain        NAD(+) levels, reduced expression of proinflammatory cytokines, and decreased        activation of microglia and astrocytes. NR treatment also reduced NLRP3        inflammasome expression, DNA damage, apoptosis, and cellular senescence in the AD        mouse brains. Activation of cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) and stimulator of        interferon genes (STING) are associated with DNA damage and senescence.        cGAS-STING elevation was observed in the AD mice and normalized by NR treatment.        Cell culture experiments using microglia suggested that the beneficial effects of        NR are, in part, through a cGAS-STING-dependent pathway. Levels of ectopic        (cytoplasmic) DNA were increased in APP/PS1 mutant mice and human AD fibroblasts        and down-regulated by NR. NR treatment induced mitophagy and improved cognitive        and synaptic functions in APP/PS1 mutant mice. Our findings suggest a role for        NAD(+) depletion-mediated activation of cGAS-STING in neuroinflammation and        cellular senescence in AD.",cbb118f23f8420fd8c0f57c398c9f89f23b43693,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/cbb118f23f8420fd8c0f57c398c9f89f23b43693,34497121,PMC8449423,,False,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,0.2080180048942566,0.06153846153846154,196,12.779,1.0,0.8944723618090452,0.3711916403550184

Most cases        of AD are considered idiopathic and likely due to a combination of genetic,        environmental, and lifestyle-related risk factors. Despite occurring decades        before the typical age of an AD diagnosis, early-life stress (ELS) has been        suggested to have long-lasting effects that may contribute to AD risk and        pathogenesis. Still, the mechanisms that underlie the role of ELS on AD risk        remain largely unknown. Here, we used 5xFAD transgenic mice to study relatively        short-term alterations related to ELS in an AD-like susceptible mouse model at 6        weeks of age. To model ELS, we separated pups from their dams for 3 h per day        from postnatal day 2-14. Around 6 weeks of age, we found that maternally        separated (MS) 5xFAD mice, particularly female mice, displayed increased        amyloid-β-immunoreactivity in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and basolateral        amygdala (BLA). In anterior cingulate cortex, we also noted significantly        increased intraneuronal amyloid-β-immunoreactivity associated with MS but only in        female mice. Moreover, IBA1-positive DAPI density was significantly increased in        relation to MS in ACC and BLA, and microglia in BLA of MS mice had significantly        different morphology compared to microglia in non-MS 5xFAD mice. Cytokine        analysis showed that male MS mice, specifically, had increased levels of        neuroinflammatory markers CXCL1 and IL-10 in hippocampal extracts compared to        non-MS counterparts. Additionally, hippocampal extracts from both male and female        MS 5xFAD mice had decreased levels of synapse- and activity-related markers Bdnf,        5htr6, Cox2, and Syp in hippocampus. Lastly, we performed behavioral tests to        evaluate anxiety- and depressive-like behavior and working memory but could not        detect any significant differences between groups. Overall, we detected several        sex-specific molecular and cellular alterations in 6-week-old adolescent 5xFAD        mice associated with MS that may help explain the connection between ELS and AD        risk.",21a10c8f6c6b158cb3d09ba2890060b3ad03e207,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/21a10c8f6c6b158cb3d09ba2890060b3ad03e207,37503358,PMC10369403,,False,"Brain, behavior, & immunity - health",101759062,0.2062538117170334,0.015151515151515152,0,0.0,0.09045226130653267,0.04020100502512563,0.08753473952546481

However, its role in neurodegenerative diseases,        including Alzheimer's disease (AD), is still debated. METHODS: We have        characterized the expression of GDF15 in brain samples from AD patients and        non-demented subjects (controls) of different ages. RESULTS: Although no        difference in CSF levels of GDF15 was found between AD patients and controls,        GDF15 was expressed in different brain areas and seems to be predominantly        localized in neurons. The ratio between its mature and precursor form was higher        in the frontal cortex of AD patients compared to age-matched controls (p < 0.05).        Moreover, this ratio was even higher for centenarians (p < 0.01), indicating that        aging also affects GDF15 expression and maturation. A lower expression of OXPHOS        complexes I, III, and V in AD patients compared to controls was also noticed, and        a positive correlation between GDF15 and IL-6 mRNA levels was observed. Finally,        when GDF15 was silenced in vitro in dermal fibroblasts, a decrease in OXPHOS        complexes transcript levels and an increase in IL-6 levels were observed.        DISCUSSION: Although GDF15 seems not to be a reliable CSF marker for AD, it is        highly expressed in aging and AD brains, likely as a part of stress response        aimed at counteracting mitochondrial dysfunction and neuroinflammation.",33b529605375b0fe3de4e077094674e6b8cbff92,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/33b529605375b0fe3de4e077094674e6b8cbff92,36698863,PMC9869280,methodology,False,Frontiers in aging neuroscience,101525824,0.20465964078903198,0.0,5,5.702,0.5175879396984925,0.36683417085427134,0.1940612088196242

Notably, a        balanced gut microbiota contributes to the epithelial intestinal barrier        maintenance, modulates the host immune system, and releases neurotransmitters        and/or neuroprotective short-chain fatty acids. However, dysbiosis may provoke        immune dysregulation, impacting neuroinflammation through peripheral-central        immune communication. Moreover, lipopolysaccharide or detrimental microbial        end-products can cross the blood-brain barrier and induce or at least potentiate        the neuropathological progression of AD. Thus, after repeated failure to find a        cure for this dementia, a necessary paradigmatic shift towards considering AD as        a systemic disorder has occurred. Here, we present an overview of the use of        germ-free and/or transgenic animal models as valid tools to unravel the        connection between dysbiosis, metabolic diseases, and AD, and to investigate        novel therapeutical targets. Given the high impact of dietary habits, not only on        the microbiota but also on other well-established AD risk factors such as        diabetes or obesity, consistent changes of lifestyle along with microbiome-based        therapies should be considered as complementary approaches.",eabe538088dc0675e788ff270d40095ee60ca587,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/eabe538088dc0675e788ff270d40095ee60ca587,37509487,PMC10377071,,False,Biomedicines,101691304,0.2040245532989502,0.013745704467353952,1,4.757,0.24623115577889448,0.23115577889447236,0.13831368797763166

METHODS: Results        from a recently published longitudinal epigenomic screen were analyzed with        regard to the results of recent large epidemiological studies of the causal        impacts of cannabis. We also integrate theoretical syntheses with prior studies        into these combined epigenomic and epidemiological results. RESULTS: Cannabis        dependence not only recapitulates many of the key features of aging, but is        characterized by both age-defining and age-generating illnesses including        immunomodulation, hepatic inflammation, many psychiatric syndromes with a        neuroinflammatory basis, genotoxicity and epigenotoxicity. DNA breaks,        chromosomal breakage-fusion-bridge morphologies and likely cycles, and altered        intergenerational DNA methylation and disruption of both the histone and tubulin        codes in the context of increased clinical congenital anomalies, cancers and        heritable tumors imply widespread disruption of the genome and epigenome. Modern        epigenomic clocks indicate that, in cannabis-dependent patients, cannabis        advances cellular DNA methylation age by 25-30% at age 30 years. Data have        implications not only for somatic but also stem cell and germ line tissues        including post-fertilization zygotes. This effect is likely increases with the        square of chronological age. CONCLUSION: Recent epigenomic studies of cannabis        exposure provide many explanations for the broad spectrum of cannabis-related        teratogenicity and carcinogenicity and appear to account for many        epidemiologically observed findings.

10.3233/JAD-221279,The Adult Neurogenesis Theory of Alzheimer's Disease.,2023.0,"Alzheimer's disease starts in neural stem cells (NSCs) in the niches of adult        neurogenesis. All primary factors responsible for pathological tau        hyperphosphorylation are inherent to adult neurogenesis and migration. However,        when amyloid pathology is present, it strongly amplifies tau pathogenesis.        Indeed, the progressive accumulation of extracellular amyloid-β deposits in the        brain triggers a state of chronic inflammation by microglia. Microglial        activation has a significant pro-neurogenic effect that fosters the process of        adult neurogenesis and supports neuronal migration. Unfortunately, this        ""reactive"" pro-neurogenic activity ultimately perturbs homeostatic equilibrium in        the niches of adult neurogenesis by amplifying tau pathogenesis in AD. This        scenario involves NSCs in the subgranular zone of the hippocampal dentate gyrus        in late-onset AD (LOAD) and NSCs in the ventricular-subventricular zone along the        lateral ventricles in early-onset AD (EOAD), including familial AD (FAD).        Neuroblasts carrying the initial seed of tau pathology travel throughout the        brain via neuronal migration driven by complex signals and convey the disease        from the niches of adult neurogenesis to near (LOAD) or distant (EOAD) brain        regions. In these locations, or in close proximity, a focus of degeneration        begins to develop.

Microfold (M) cells, which play a crucial        role in the gut immune response against external antigens, are also exploited for        the entry of pathogenic bacteria and proteins into the body. However, whether        changes in M cells can affect the gut environments and consequently change brain        pathologies in AD remains unknown. METHODS: Five familial AD (5xFAD) and        5xFAD-derived fecal microbiota transplanted (5xFAD-FMT) naïve mice were used to        investigate the changes of M cells in the AD environment. Next, to establish the        effect of M cell depletion on AD environments, 5xFAD mice and Spib knockout mice        were bred, and behavioral and histological analyses were performed when M        cell-depleted 5xFAD mice were six or nine months of age. RESULTS: In this study,        we found that M cell numbers were increased in the colons of 5xFAD and 5xFAD-FMT        mice compared to those of wild-type (WT) and WT-FMT mice. Moreover, the level of        total bacteria infiltrating the colons increased in the AD-mimicked mice. The        levels of M cell-related genes and that of infiltrating bacteria showed a        significant correlation. The genetic inhibition of M cells (Spib knockout) in        5xFAD mice changed the composition of the gut microbiota, along with decreasing        proinflammatory cytokine levels in the colons. M cell depletion ameliorated AD        symptoms including amyloid-β accumulation, microglial dysfunction,        neuroinflammation, and memory impairment. Similarly, 5xFAD-FMT did not induce        AD-like pathologies, such as memory impairment and excessive neuroinflammation in        Spib(-/-) mice.

P2X4 receptors are ATP-gated channels with high calcium        permeability, which are de novo expressed in a subset of reactive microglia        associated with various pathological contexts, contributing to microglial        functions. P2X4 receptors are mainly localized in lysosomes and trafficking to        the plasma membrane is tightly regulated. Here, we investigated the role of P2X4        in the context of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Using proteomics, we identified        Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) as a specific P2X4 interacting protein. We found that        P2X4 regulates lysosomal cathepsin B (CatB) activity promoting ApoE degradation;        P2rX4 deletion results in higher amounts of intracellular and secreted ApoE in        both bone-marrow-derived macrophage (BMDM) and microglia from APP(swe)/PSEN1(dE9)        brain. In both human AD brain and APP/PS1 mice, P2X4 and ApoE are almost        exclusively expressed in plaque-associated microglia. In 12-month-old APP/PS1        mice, genetic deletion of P2rX4 reverses topographical and spatial memory        impairment and reduces amount of soluble small aggregates of Aß1-42 peptide,        while no obvious alteration of plaque-associated microglia characteristics is        observed. Our results support that microglial P2X4 promotes lysosomal ApoE        degradation, indirectly altering Aß peptide clearance, which in turn might        promotes synaptic dysfunctions and cognitive deficits.

Because ABI3 is highly expressed in microglia,        the brain's immune cells, it was suggested that ABI3 might impact AD pathogenesis        by regulating the immune response. Recent studies suggest that microglia have        multifaceted roles in AD. Their immune response and phagocytosis functions can        have beneficial effects in the early stages of AD by clearing up amyloid-beta        (Aβ) plaques. However, they can be harmful at later stages due to their        continuous inflammatory response. Therefore, it is important to understand the        role of genes in microglia functions and their impact on AD pathologies along the        progression of the disease. To determine the role of ABI3 at the early stage of        amyloid pathology, we crossed Abi3 knock-out mice with the 5XFAD Aβ-amyloidosis        mouse model and aged them until 4.5-month-old. Here, we demonstrate that deletion        of the Abi3 locus increased Aβ plaque deposition, while there was no significant        change in microgliosis and astrogliosis. Transcriptomic analysis indicates        alterations in the expression of immune genes, such as Tyrobp, Fcer1g, and C1qa.        In addition to the transcriptomic changes, we found elevated cytokine protein        levels in Abi3 knock-out mouse brains, strengthening the role of ABI3 in        neuroinflammation. These findings suggest that loss of ABI3 function may        exacerbate AD progression by increasing Aβ accumulation and inflammation starting        from earlier stages of the pathology.",6c8219aea01a6d7953c4e4d63264d56de53de608,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6c8219aea01a6d7953c4e4d63264d56de53de608,36895556,PMC9988916,"background,result",False,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,0.19899649918079376,0.1,2,8.786,0.33668341708542715,0.7587939698492462,0.2640205577944391

NDDs have many similarities and common pathways, e.g., formation of        misfolded amyloid proteins, intra- and extracellular amyloid deposits, and        chronic inflammation. Initially, the inflammation process has a cytoprotective        function; however, an elevated and prolonged immune response has damaging effects        and causes cell death. Neuroinflammation has been a target of drug development        for treating and curing NDDs.

Mitophagy is selective autophagy through the clearance of aberrant        mitochondria, specifically for degradation to maintain energy generation and        neuronal and synaptic function in the brain. Accumulating evidence shows that        defective mitophagy is believed to be as one of the early and prominent features        in AD pathogenesis and has drawn attention in the recent few years.

Neuroinflammation mediated by        microglia and brain-resident macrophages plays a crucial role in AD        pathogenesis(1-5), though the mechanisms by which age, genes, and other risk        factors interact remain largely unknown. Somatic mutations accumulate with age        and lead to clonal expansion of many cell types, contributing to cancer and many        non-cancer diseases(6,7). Here we studied somatic mutation in normal aged and AD        brains by three orthogonal methods and in three independent AD cohorts. Analysis        of bulk RNA sequencing data from 866 samples from different brain regions        revealed significantly higher (~two-fold) overall burdens of somatic        single-nucleotide variants (sSNVs) in AD brains compared to age-matched controls.        Molecular-barcoded deep (>1000X) gene panel sequencing of 311 prefrontal cortex        samples showed enrichment of sSNVs and somatic insertions and deletions (sIndels)        in cancer driver genes in AD brain compared to control, with recurrent, and often        multiple, mutations in genes implicated in clonal hematopoiesis (CH)(8,9).        Pathogenic sSNVs were enriched in CSF1R+ microglia of AD brains, and the high        proportion of microglia (up to 40%) carrying some sSNVs in cancer driver genes        suggests mutation-driven microglial clonal expansion (MiCE).

In addition to the        ""amyloid hypothesis,"" an increasing number of studies have demonstrated that        phosphorylated tau plays an important role in AD pathogenesis. Both soluble tau        oligomers and insoluble tau aggregates in the brain can induce structural and        functional neuronal damage through multiple pathways, eventually leading to        memory deficits and neurodegeneration. Autophagy is an important cellular        response to various stress stimuli and can generally be categorized into        non-selective and selective autophagy. Recent studies have indicated that both        types of autophagy are involved in AD pathology. Among the several subtypes of        selective autophagy, mitophagy, which mediates the selective removal of        mitochondria, has attracted increasing attention because dysfunctional        mitochondria have been suggested to contribute to tauopathies.

High ratios of premature oligodendrocytes        expressing low levels of genes encoding major myelin protein components are        characteristic of late disease stages and may represent a unique signature of        C9orf72 ALS/FTD. Microglia with increased reactivity and astrocyte specific        transcriptome changes in genes involved in glucose/glycogen metabolism are also        associated with disease progression. Late stages of C9orf72 ALS/FTD correlate        with sequential changes in the regulatory landscape of several genes in glial        cells, namely MBP/MAG/MOG in oligodendrocytes, CD83/IRF8 in microglia, and        GLUT1/GYS2/AGL in astrocytes. Only layer 2-3 cortical projection neurons with        high expression of CUX2/LAMP5 are significantly reduced in C9orf72 ALS/FTD        patients with respect to controls. Our findings reveal previously unknown        progressive functional changes in cortical cells of C9orf72 ALS/FTD patients that        shed light on the mechanisms underlying the pathology of this disease.",4122afb099241515a7388737cc767a86ba4d4372,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4122afb099241515a7388737cc767a86ba4d4372,36711601,PMC9882184,,False,bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology,101680187,0.18922126293182373,0.01,2,0.0,0.3417085427135678,0.06030150753768844,0.12106788641723555

Microglial activation, a major component of neuroinflammation, is an        early pathologic hallmark that correlates with cognitive decline, while the        unfolded protein response (UPR) contributes to synaptic pathology. Sleep        disturbances are prevalent in tauopathies and may also contribute to disease        progression. Few studies have investigated whether manipulations of sleep        influence cellular pathologic and behavioral features of tauopathy. We        investigated whether trazodone, a licensed antidepressant with hypnotic efficacy        in dementia, can reduce disease-related cellular pathways and improve memory and        sleep in male rTg4510 mice with a tauopathy-like phenotype. In a 9 week dosing        regimen, trazodone decreased microglial NLRP3 inflammasome expression and        phosphorylated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase levels, which correlated with        the NLRP3 inflammasome, the UPR effector ATF4, and total tau levels. Trazodone        reduced theta oscillations during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and enhanced REM        sleep duration. Olfactory memory transiently improved, and memory performance        correlated with REM sleep duration and theta oscillations. These findings on the        effects of trazodone on the NLRP3 inflammasome, the unfolded protein response and        behavioral hallmarks of dementia warrant further studies on the therapeutic value        of sleep-modulating compounds for tauopathies.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Dementia and        associated behavioral symptoms such as memory loss and sleep disturbance are        debilitating. Identifying treatments that alleviate symptoms and concurrently        target cellular pathways contributing to disease progression is paramount for the        patients and their caregivers. Here we show that a chronic treatment with        trazodone, an antidepressant with positive effects on sleep, has beneficial        effects on several cellular pathways contributing to neuroinflammation and tau        pathology, in tauopathy-like rTg4510 mice. Trazodone also improved rapid eye        movement (REM) sleep, the slowing of brain oscillations, and olfactory memory        disturbances, which are all early symptoms observed in Alzheimer's disease.

Despite the molecular determinants of such variability not being well defined        yet, microglial cells may play a key role in this process by releasing distinct        pro- and/or anti-inflammatory cytokines, potentially affecting the expression of        the disease. We carried out a neuropathological and biochemical analysis on a        series of AD brain samples, gathering evidence about the heterogeneous        involvement of microglia in AD. The neuropathological studies showed differences        concerning morphology, density and distribution of microglial cells among AD        brains. Biochemical investigations showed increased brain levels of IL-4, IL-6,        IL-13, CCL17, MMP-7 and CXCL13 in AD in comparison with control subjects. The        molecular profiling achieved by measuring the brain levels of 25 inflammatory        factors known to be involved in neuroinflammation allowed a stratification of the        AD patients in three distinct ""neuroinflammatory clusters"". These findings        strengthen the relevance of neuroinflammation in AD pathogenesis suggesting, in        particular, that the differential involvement of neuroinflammatory molecules        released by microglial cells during the development of the disease may contribute        to modulate the characteristics and the severity of the neuropathological        changes, driving-at least in part-the AD phenotypic diversity.",b17782b76fef49eb5dcdbec412f838315245f7a3,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b17782b76fef49eb5dcdbec412f838315245f7a3,33803478,PMC7967159,background,False,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,0.1875787377357483,0.06521739130434782,10,6.208,0.7085427135678392,0.5628140703517588,0.27306409543040333

Most cases of AD are sporadic, and very few are inherited; the pathogenesis of        sporadic AD is complex and remains to be elucidated. The asparaginyl        endopeptidase (AEP) or legumain is the only recognized cysteine protease that        specifically hydrolyzes peptide bonds after asparagine residues in mammals. The        expression level of AEPs in healthy brains is far lower than that of peripheral        organs. Recently, growing evidence has indicated that aging may upregulate and        overactivate brain AEPs. The overactivation of AEPs drives the onset of AD        through cleaving tau and amyloid precursor proteins (APP), and SET, an inhibitor        of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). The AEP-mediated cleavage of these peptides        enhances amyloidosis, promotes tau hyperphosphorylation, and ultimately induces        neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment. Upregulated AEPs and related        deleterious reactions constitute upstream events of amyloid/tau toxicity in the        brain, and represent early pathological changes in AD. Thus, upregulated AEPs are        an emerging drug target for disease modification and a potential biomarker for        predicting preclinical AD. However, the presence of the blood-brain barrier        greatly hinders establishing body-fluid-based methods to measure brain AEPs.        Research on AEP-activity-based imaging probes and our recent work suggest that        the live brain imaging of AEPs could be used to evaluate its predictive efficacy        as an AD biomarker. To advance translational research in this area, AEP imaging        probes applicable to human brain and AEP inhibitors with good druggability are        urgently needed.",d64113cd877e15a470189e9b84c290e7f3b92483,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d64113cd877e15a470189e9b84c290e7f3b92483,36142134,PMC9499314,,False,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,0.18742996454238892,0.010416666666666666,10,6.208,0.7135678391959799,0.5678391959798995,0.2526067113057653

Large-scale epidemiological studies associate        traffic-related particulate matter (PM) with impaired cognitive functions and        increased incidence of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease.        Inhaled components of PM may directly invade the brain via the olfactory route,        or act through peripheral system responses resulting in inflammation and        oxidative stress in the brain. Microglia are the immune cells of the brain        implicated in the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. However, it remains        unknown how PM affects live human microglia. RESULTS: Here we show that two        different PMs derived from exhausts of cars running on EN590 diesel or compressed        natural gas (CNG) alter the function of human microglia-like cells in vitro. We        exposed human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived microglia-like cells        (iMGLs) to traffic related PMs and explored their functional responses. Lower        concentrations of PMs ranging between 10 and 100 µg ml(-1) increased microglial        survival whereas higher concentrations became toxic over time. Both tested        pollutants impaired microglial phagocytosis and increased secretion of a few        proinflammatory cytokines with distinct patterns, compared to lipopolysaccharide        induced responses. iMGLs showed pollutant dependent responses to production of        reactive oxygen species (ROS) with CNG inducing and EN590 reducing ROS        production. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that traffic-related air pollutants        alter the function of human microglia and warrant further studies to determine        whether these changes contribute to adverse effects in the brain and on cognition        over time.

At the border-associated brain regions, bona fide CD206(+) BAMs        are minimally replaced by BM-derived cells, and their turnover rates are not        accelerated by AD. In contrast, all other myeloid cells are swiftly replenished        by BM progenitors.

Aβ deposits        and NFT formation are the central pathological hallmarks in AD brains, and the        majority of AD cases have been shown to exhibit a complex combination of systemic        comorbidities. While AD is the foremost common cause of dementia in the elderly,        age-related hearing loss (ARHL) is the most predominant sensory deficit in the        elderly. During aging, chronic inflammation and resulting endothelial dysfunction        have been described and might be key contributors to AD; we discuss an intriguing        possible link between inner ear strial microvascular pathology and blood-brain        barrier pathology and present ARHL as a potentially modifiable and treatable risk        factor for AD development. We present compelling evidence that ARHL might well be        seen as an important risk factor in AD development: progressive hearing        impairment, leading to social isolation, and its comorbidities, such as frailty,        falls, and late-onset depression, link ARHL with cognitive decline and increased        risk of dementia, rendering it tempting to speculate that ARHL might be a        potential common molecular and pathological trigger for AD. Additionally, one        could speculate that amyloid-beta might damage the blood-labyrinth barrier as it        does to the blood-brain barrier, leading to ARHL pathology.

The gut of mammals harbors a vast        and complex population of microorganisms, commonly referred to as the microbiota.        There's a growing recognition that these gut microbes are intrinsically        intertwined with mammalian physiology.

Its prominent        neuropathological features are the extracellular neuritic plaques and        intercellular neurofibrillary tangles composed of aggregated β-amyloid (Aβ) and        hyperphosphorylated tau protein, respectively. In the past few decades,        disease-modifying therapy targeting Aβ has been the focus of AD drug development.        Even though it is encouraging that two of these drugs have recently received        accelerated US Food and Drug Administration approval for AD treatment, their        efficacy or long-term safety is controversial. Tau has received increasing        attention as a potential therapeutic target, since evidence indicates that tau        pathology is more associated with cognitive dysfunction. Moreover, inflammation,        especially neuroinflammation, accompanies AD pathological processes and is also        linked to cognitive deficits. Accumulating evidence indicates that inflammation        has a complex and tight interplay with tau pathology. Here, we review recent        evidence on the interaction between tau pathology, focusing on tau        post-translational modification and dissemination, and neuroinflammatory        responses, including glial cell activation and inflammatory signaling pathways.        Then, we summarize the latest clinical trials targeting tau and        neuroinflammation. Sustained and increased inflammatory responses in glial cells        and neurons are pivotal cellular drivers and regulators of the exacerbation of        tau pathology, which further contributes to its worsening by aggravating        inflammatory responses.

Fine-tuned therapeutic modulation of immune dysfunction to        ameliorate disease cannot be achieved without the characterization of diverse        microglial states that initiate unique, and sometimes contradictory, immune        responses that evolve over time in chronic inflammatory environments. Because of        the functional differences between human and murine microglia, untangling        distinct, disease-relevant reactive states and their corresponding effects on        pathology or neuronal health may not be possible without the use of human cells.        In order to profile shifting microglial states in early AD and identify        microglia-specific drivers of disease, we differentiated human induced        pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) carrying a familial AD PSEN2 mutation or its        isogenic control into cerebral organoids and quantified the changes in cytokine        concentrations over time with Luminex XMAP technology. We used partial least        squares (PLS) modeling to build cytokine signatures predictive of disease and age        to identify key differential patterns of cytokine expression that inform the        overall organoid immune milieu and quantified the corresponding changes in        protein pathology. AD organoids exhibited an overall reduction in cytokine        secretion after an initial amplified immune response. We demonstrate that reduced        synapse density observed in the AD organoids is prevented with microglial        depletion. Crucially, these differential effects of dysregulated immune signaling        occurred without the accumulation of pathological proteins. In this study, we        used microglia-containing AD organoids to quantitatively characterize an evolving        immune milieu, made up of a diverse of collection of activation patterns and        immune responses, to identify how a dynamic, overall neuroinflammatory state        negatively impacts neuronal health and the cell-specific contribution of        microglia.",ab2d1560503445f7ca2ddda810ba340ddcc05dad,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ab2d1560503445f7ca2ddda810ba340ddcc05dad,38014053,PMC10680718,background,False,bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology,101680187,0.18359363079071045,0.07407407407407407,0,0.0,0.1306532663316583,0.06532663316582915,0.11410470379146588

Many microRNAs (miRNAs) were found deregulated in        the brain or blood of AD patients, suggesting a possible key role in different        stages of neurodegeneration. In particular, mitogen-activated protein kinases        (MAPK) signaling can be impaired by miRNA dysregulation during AD. Indeed, the        aberrant MAPK pathway may facilitate the development of amyloid-beta (Aβ) and Tau        pathology, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and brain cell death. The aim of        this review was to describe the molecular interactions between miRNAs and MAPKs        during AD pathogenesis by selecting evidence from experimental AD models.        Publications ranging from 2010 to 2023 were considered, based on PubMed and Web        of Science databases. According to obtained data, several miRNA deregulations may        regulate MAPK signaling in different stages of AD and conversely. Moreover,        overexpressing or silencing miRNAs involved in MAPK regulation was seen to        improve cognitive deficits in AD animal models. In particular, miR-132 is of        particular interest due to its neuroprotective functions by inhibiting Aβ and Tau        depositions, as well as oxidative stress, through ERK/MAPK1 signaling modulation.

Identifying new AD therapeutic targets is crucial for better        elucidating the pathogenesis and establishing a valid treatment of AD. Growing        evidence suggests that microglia play a critical role in AD. Microglia are        resident macrophages in the central nervous system (CNS), and their core        properties supporting main biological functions include surveillance,        phagocytosis, and the release of soluble factors. Activated microglia not only        directly mediate the central immune response, but also participate in the        pathological changes of AD, including amyloid-beta (Aβ) aggregation, tau protein        phosphorylation, synaptic dissection, neuron loss, memory function decline, etc.        Based on these recent findings, we provide a new framework to summarize the role        of microglia in AD memory impairment.

Here, we characterize pathogenic aggregates composed of β(2)-microglobulin        (β(2)M) and Aβ that trigger neurodegeneration in AD. β(2)M, a component of major        histocompatibility complex class I (MHC class I), is upregulated in the brains of        individuals with AD and constitutes the amyloid plaque core. Elevation of β(2)M        aggravates amyloid pathology independent of MHC class I, and coaggregation with        β(2)M is essential for Aβ neurotoxicity. B2m genetic ablation abrogates amyloid        spreading and cognitive deficits in AD mice.

Lead (Pb) is a        heavy metal contaminant, which is closely related to the incidence of AD.        However, the research on the role of microglia in Pb-induced AD-like pathology is        limited. To determine the mechanism by which Pb exposure aggravates AD        progression and the role of microglial activation, we exposed APP/PS1 mice and        Aβ(1-42)-treated BV-2 cells to Pb. Our results suggested that chronic Pb exposure        exacerbated learning and memory impairments in APP/PS1 mice. Pb exposure        increased the activation of microglia in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice, which        was associated with increased deposition of Aβ(1-42), and induced hippocampal        neuron damage. Pb exposure upregulated copper transporter 1 (CTR1) and        downregulated copper P-type ATPase transporter (ATP7A) in the hippocampus of        APP/PS1 mice and Aβ(1-42)-treated BV-2 cells. Moreover, Pb enhanced mitochondrial        translocation of the mitochondrial copper transporter COX17, leading to an        increase in mitochondrial copper concentration and mitochondrial damage. This        could be reversed by copper-chelating agents or by inhibiting the mitochondrial        translocation of COX17. The increased mitochondrial copper concentration caused        by increased mitochondrial translocation of COX17 after Pb exposure may be        related to the enhanced mitochondrial import pathway of AIF/CHCHD4. These results        indicate that Pb induces the activation of microglia by increasing the        concentration of copper in the mitochondria of microglia, and microglia release        inflammatory factors to promote neuroinflammation, thus aggravating the pathology        of AD.

Modelling aspects of AD is challenging due to its complex multifactorial etiology        and pathology. The present study aims to establish a cost-effective and rapid        method to model the two primary pathologies in organotypic brain slices. Coronal        hippocampal brain slices (150 µm) were generated from postnatal (day 8-10) C57BL6        wild-type mice and cultured for 9 weeks. Collagen hydrogels containing either an        empty load or a mixture of human Aβ42 and P301S aggregated tau were applied to        the slices. The media was further supplemented with various intracellular pathway        modulators or heavy metals to augment the appearance of Aβ plaques and tau NFTs,        as assessed by immunohistochemistry. Immunoreactivity for Aβ and tau was        significantly increased in the ventral areas in slices with a mixture of human        Aβ42 and P301S aggregated tau compared to slices with empty hydrogels. Aβ plaque-        and tau NFT-like pathologies could be induced independently in slices. Heavy        metals (aluminum, lead, cadmium) potently augmented Aβ plaque-like pathology,        which developed intracellularly prior to cell death. Intracellular pathway        modulators (scopolamine, wortmannin, MHY1485) significantly boosted tau NFT-like        pathologies. A combination of nanomolar concentrations of scopolamine,        wortmannin, MHY1485, lead, and cadmium in the media strongly increased Aβ plaque-        and tau NFT-like immunoreactivity in ventral areas compared to the slices with        non-supplemented media. The results highlight that we could harness the potential        of the collagen hydrogel-based spreading of human Aβ42 and P301S aggregated tau,        along with pharmacological manipulation, to produce pathologies relevant to AD.

This study explored AD-related diagnostic        and therapeutic biomarkers from the perspective of immune infiltration by        analyzing public data from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus database. METHOD: In        this study, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was conducted to        identify modules and hub genes contributing to AD development. A protein-protein        interaction network was constructed when the genes in the modules were enriched        and examined by Gene Ontology (GO)/Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)        analysis. Furthermore, a gene network was established using topological WGCNA,        from which five hub genes were selected. Logistic regression analysis and        receiver operating characteristic curve analysis were performed to explore the        clinical value of genes in AD diagnosis. The genes in the core module intersected        with the hub genes, and four intersection genes (ATP2A2, ATP6V1D, CAP2, and        SYNJ1) were selected. These four genes were enriched by gene set enrichment        analysis (GSEA). Finally, an immune infiltration analysis was performed. RESULTS:        The GO/KEGG analysis suggested that genes in the core module played a role in the        differentiation and growth of neural cells and in the transmission of        neurotransmitters. The GSEA of core genes showed that these four genes were        mainly enriched in immune/infection pathways (e.g., cholera infection and        Helicobacter pylori infection pathways) and other metabolic pathways.

Three        new DNA biomarkers showed in-sample predictive ability on average 8 years        pre-onset, after adjustment for age, sex, and white blood cell proportions        (p-values: 0.022-<0.00001). Our longitudinally-derived panel replicated nominally        (p = 0.012) in an external cohort (n = 146 cases, 324 controls).

Nonhuman primates        (NHPs) share genetic, anatomical, and physiological similarities with humans,        making them ideal model animals for investigating the pathogenesis of AD and        potential therapies. However, the use of NHPs in AD research has been hindered by        the paucity of AD monkey models due to their long generation time, ethical        considerations, and technical challenges in genetically modifying monkeys.        METHODS: Here, we developed an AD-like NHP model by overexpressing human tau in        the bilateral hippocampi of adult rhesus macaque monkeys. We evaluated the        pathological features of these monkeys with immunostaining, Nissl staining,        cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron        emission tomography (PET), and behavioural tests. RESULTS: We demonstrated that        after hippocampal overexpression of tau protein, these monkeys displayed multiple        pathological features of AD, including 3-repeat (3R)/4-repeat (4R) tau        accumulation, tau hyperphosphorylation, tau propagation, neuronal loss,        hippocampal atrophy, neuroinflammation, Aβ clearance deficits, blood vessel        damage, and cognitive decline. More interestingly, the accumulation of both 3R        and 4R tau is specific to NHPs but not found in adult rodents. CONCLUSIONS: This        work establishes a tau-induced AD-like NHP model with many key pathological and        behavioural features of AD. In addition, our model may potentially become one of        the AD NHP models adopted by researchers worldwide since it can be generated        within 2 ~ 3 months through a single injection of AAVs into the monkey brains.        Hence, our model NHPs may facilitate mechanistic studies and therapeutic        treatments for AD.",58d81ebf1c75586f66b97bea483b10d5f466786f,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/58d81ebf1c75586f66b97bea483b10d5f466786f,38281031,PMC10821564,background,False,Alzheimer's research & therapy,101511643,0.17328819632530212,0.016666666666666666,1,8.823,0.271356783919598,0.7839195979899497,0.21694458285068946

Population-based data        are contradictory about whether this variant increases the risk of Alzheimer's        disease. In East Asian populations, the prevalence of the ALDH2 rs671 variant is        30-50%, making the National Human Brain Bank for Development and Function (the        largest brain bank in East Asia) an important resource to explore the link        between the ALDH2 rs671 polymorphism and Alzheimer's disease pathology. Here,        using 469 postmortem brains, we find that while the ALDH2 rs671 variant is        associated with increased plaque deposits and a higher Aβ40/42 ratio, it is not        an independent risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. Mechanistically, we show that        lower ALDH2 activity leads to 4-HNE accumulation in the brain. The (R)-4-HNE        enantiomer adducts to residue Lys53 of C99, favoring Aβ40 generation in the Golgi        apparatus. Decreased ALDH2 activity also lowers inflammatory factor secretion, as        well as amyloid β phagocytosis and spread in brains of patients with Alzheimer's        disease.

Our review highlights that studies on animal models only partially        clarify what happens in humans. Human and mice microglia are hugely        heterogeneous. Like a two-sided coin, microglia can be protective or harmful,        depending on the context.

This emerging trend is poised to        pose a substantial challenge to the fields of medicine and public health in the        years ahead. In this context, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is regarded as an ND that        causes recent memory loss, motor impairment and cognitive deficits. AD is the        most common cause of dementia in the elderly and its development is linked to        multifactorial interactions between the environment, genetics, aging and        lifestyle. The pathological hallmarks in AD are the accumulation of β-amyloid        peptide (Aβ), the hyperphosphorylation of tau protein, neurotoxic events and        impaired glucose metabolism. Due to pharmacological limitations and in view of        the prevailing glycemic hypometabolism, the ketogenic diet (KD) emerges as a        promising non-pharmacological possibility for managing AD, an approach that has        already demonstrated efficacy in addressing other disorders, notably epilepsy.        The KD consists of a food regimen in which carbohydrate intake is discouraged at        the expense of increased lipid consumption, inducing metabolic ketosis whereby        the main source of energy becomes ketone bodies instead of glucose. Thus, under        these dietary conditions, neuronal death via lack of energy would be decreased,        inasmuch as the metabolism of lipids is not impaired in AD. In this way, the        clinical picture of patients with AD would potentially improve via the slowing        down of symptoms and delaying of the progression of the disease. Hence, this        review aims to explore the rationale behind utilizing the KD in AD treatment        while emphasizing the metabolic interplay between the KD and the improvement of        AD indicators, drawing insights from both preclinical and clinical        investigations. Via a comprehensive examination of the studies detailed in this        review, it is evident that the KD emerges as a promising alternative for managing        AD.

This study aimed to investigate the key factor for the        underlying interactions and shared signaling pathways in the vasculature of DR        and AD. Methods: We retrieved single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data        regarding human fibrovascular membrane (FVM) of proliferative diabetic        retinopathy (PDR) and human hippocampus vessels of AD from the NCBI-GEO database.

10.3390/ijms25031689,Retinal Alterations Predict Early Prodromal Signs of Neurodegenerative Disease.,2024.0,"Neurodegenerative diseases are an increasingly common group of diseases that        occur late in life with a significant impact on personal, family, and economic        life. Among these, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are the        major disorders that lead to mild to severe cognitive and physical impairment and        dementia. Interestingly, those diseases may show onset of prodromal symptoms        early after middle age. Commonly, the evaluation of these neurodegenerative        diseases is based on the detection of biomarkers, where functional and structural        magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have shown a central role in revealing early or        prodromal phases, although it can be expensive, time-consuming, and not always        available. The aforementioned diseases have a common impact on the visual system        due to the pathophysiological mechanisms shared between the eye and the brain. In        Parkinson's disease, α-synuclein deposition in the retinal cells, as well as in        dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra, alters the visual cortex and        retinal function, resulting in modifications to the visual field. Similarly, the        visual cortex is modified by the neurofibrillary tangles and neuritic amyloid β        plaques typically seen in the Alzheimer's disease brain, and this may reflect the        accumulation of these biomarkers in the retina during the early stages of the        disease, as seen in postmortem retinas of AD patients. In this light, the        ophthalmic evaluation of retinal neurodegeneration could become a cost-effective        method for the early diagnosis of those diseases, overcoming the limitations of        functional and structural imaging of the deep brain. This analysis is commonly        used in ophthalmic practice, and interest in it has risen in recent years.

Although most cases of AD and        PD are sporadic, some are caused by genetic mutations that are inherited. Both        sporadic and familial cases display complex neuropathology and represent the most        perplexing neurological disorders. Because of the undefined pathogenesis and        complex clinical manifestations, there is still no effective treatment for both        AD and PD. Understanding the pathogenesis of these important neurodegenerative        diseases is important for developing successful therapies. Increasing evidence        suggests that microglial autophagy is associated with the pathogenesis of AD and        PD, and its dysfunction has been implicated in disease progression.

Human genetics has implicated a wide        range of cell surface receptors as playing a role in the disease, many of which        are involved in the production or clearance of neurotoxins in the brain. Amyloid        precursor protein, a membrane-bound signaling molecule, is at the very heart of        the disease: hereditary mutations in its gene are associated with a greatly        increased risk of getting the disease. A proteolytic breakdown product of amyloid        precursor protein, the neurotoxic Aβ peptide, has been the target for many drug        discovery efforts. Antibodies have been designed to target Aβ production with        some success, although they have not proved efficacious in clinical trials with        regards to cognitive benefits to date. Many of the recently identified genes        associated with late-onset Alzheimer's disease risk are integral to the innate        immune system. Some of these genes code for microglial proteins, such as the        strongest genetic risk factor for the disease, namely APOE, and the cell surface        receptors CD33 and TREM2 which are involved in clearance of the Aβ peptide from        the brain.

One contributory factor is likely to be the enhanced production of inflammatory        mediators and it is now known that microglia with this secretory phenotype        exhibit other adaptations including in their morphology, function, and        metabolism. AD, like many neurological disorders, demonstrates a sex bias and        recent evidence indicates that the sexual dimorphism in microglial function,        which has been recognized for many years in early development, persists into        adulthood and aging. Here, we demonstrate sex-related differences in microglia        from post mortem tissue of male and female AD patients and a marked increase in        the number of dystrophic and rod-shaped microglia in tissue from female AD        patients compared with males. Furthermore, there was an increase in iron-laden        microglia in tissue from female AD patients and this has been reported to reflect        mitochondrial changes. To address this further, we assessed changes in microglia        from male and female APP/PS1 mice and demonstrate that iron accumulation in        microglia is increased to a greater extent in tissue prepared from females        compared with males. This was associated with altered expression of genes coding        for proteins that modulate mitochondrial function.

Under low-oxygen tension, the non-diseased        brain has the ability to cope with hypoxia by triggering a homeostatic response        governed by the highly conserved hypoxia-inducible family (HIF) of transcription        factors. With the advent of advanced neuroimaging tools, it is now recognized        that cerebral hypoperfusion, and consequently hypoxia, is a consistent feature        along the Alzheimer's disease (AD) continuum. Of note, the reduction in cerebral        blood flow and tissue oxygenation detected during the prodromal phases of AD,        drastically aggravates as disease progresses.

10.1186/s12974-023-02702-3,Regulatory T cells decrease C3-positive reactive astrocytes in Alzheimer-like        pathology.,2023.0,"BACKGROUND: Increasing evidence supports a key role for peripheral immune        processes in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), highlighting an        intricate interplay between brain resident glial cells and both innate and        adaptive peripheral immune effectors. We previously showed that regulatory T        cells (Tregs) have a beneficial impact on disease progression in AD-like        pathology, notably by modulating the microglial response associated with Aβ        deposits in a mouse model of amyloid pathology. Besides microglia, reactive        astrocytes also play a critical role in neuroinflammatory processes associated        with AD. Different phenotypes of reactive astrocytes have previously been        characterized, including A1-like neurotoxic and A2-like neuroprotective subtypes.        However, the precise impact of Tregs on astrocyte reactivity and phenotypes in AD        still remains poorly defined. METHODS: We assessed the impact of Treg        immunomodulation on astrocyte reactivity in a mouse model of AD-like amyloid        pathology. Using 3D imaging, we carried out extensive morphological analyses of        astrocytes following either depletion or amplification of Tregs. We further        assessed the expression of several A1- and A2-like markers by immunofluorescence        and RT-qPCR. RESULTS: Modulation of Tregs did not significantly impact the        magnitude of global astrocyte reactivity in the brain nor in the close vicinity        of cortical amyloid deposits. We did not observe changes in the number,        morphology, or branching complexity of astrocytes according to immunomodulation        of Tregs. However, early transient depletion of Tregs modulated the balance of        reactive astrocyte subtypes, resulting in increased C3-positive A1-like        phenotypes associated with amyloid deposits. Conversely, early depletion of Tregs        decreased markers of A2-like phenotypes of reactive astrocytes associated with        larger amyloid deposits. Intriguingly, modulation of Tregs also impacted the        cerebral expression of several markers of A1-like subsets in healthy mice.        CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that Tregs contribute to modulate and fine-tune        the balance of reactive astrocyte subtypes in AD-like amyloid pathology, by        dampening C3-positive astrocytes in favor of A2-like phenotypes. This effect of        Tregs may partly relate to their capacity at modulating steady state astrocyte        reactivity and homeostasis.

Our prior studies have revealed        that loss of Adaptor protein-4 (AP-4) complex function, linked primarily to        Spastic Paraplegia (HSP), leads to a similar build of lysosomes in structures we        term ""AP-4 dystrophies"". Surprisingly, these AP-4 dystrophies were also        characterized by enrichment of components of APP processing machinery, β-site        cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and Presenilin 2. Our studies examining whether the        abnormal axonal lysosome build up resulting from AP-4 loss could lead to        amyloidogenesis revealed that the loss of AP-4 complex function in an Alzheimer's        disease model resulted in a strong increase in size and abundance of amyloid        plaques in the hippocampus and corpus callosum as well as increased microglial        association with the plaques. Interestingly, we found a further increase in        enrichment of the secretase, BACE1, in the axonal swellings of the plaques of        Alzheimer model mice lacking AP-4 complex compared to those having normal AP-4        complex function, suggestive of increased amyloidogenic processing under this        condition. Additionally, the exacerbation of plaque pathology was region-specific        as it did not increase in the cortex. The burden of the AP-4 linked axonal        dystrophies/AP-4 dystrophies was higher in the corpus callosum and hippocampus        compared to the cortex, establishing the critical role of AP-4 -dependent axonal        lysosome transport and maturation in regulating amyloidogenic amyloid precursor        protein processing.",6fb05417d0fd29c620762b286b68343816f6ccb1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6fb05417d0fd29c620762b286b68343816f6ccb1,38617351,PMC11014495,background,False,bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology,101680187,0.1626458615064621,0.0,0,0.0,0.1658291457286432,0.07537688442211055,0.08497466297455168

Riboflavin (also known as        vitamin B2) ameliorates cognitive impairment via anti-oxidative stress and        anti-inflammation properties; however, the underlying mechanisms linking        riboflavin metabolism and microglial function in cognitive impairment remain        unclear. Here, it is demonstrated that riboflavin kinase (RFK), a critical enzyme        in riboflavin metabolism, is specifically expressed in microglia. An intermediate        product of riboflavin, flavin mononucleotide (FMN), inhibited RFK expression via        regulation of lysine-specific methyltransferase 2B (KMT2B). FMN supplementation        attenuated the pro-inflammatory TNFR1/NF-κB signaling pathway, and this effect is        abolished by KMT2B overexpression. To improve the limited anti-inflammatory        efficiency of free FMN, a biomimetic microglial nanoparticle strategy (designated        as MNPs@FMN) is established, which penetrated the blood brain barrier with        enhanced microglial-targeted delivery efficiency. Notably, MNPs@FMN ameliorated        cognitive impairment and dysfunctional synaptic plasticity in a        lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory mouse model and in a 5xFAD mouse model of        Alzheimer's disease.

As such, a number of studies demonstrated the        potential contribution of H. pylori infection to the incidence and progression of        Alzheimer's disease (AD). Considering unanswered questions regarding the effect        of H. pylori infection on brain activity, we sought to investigate the impact of        H. pylori infection on the expression of AD-associated risk factors. We used two        H. pylori clinical strains obtained from two patients with peptic ulcer and        evaluated their influence on the expression level of AD-associated genes (APP,        ApoE2, ApoE4, ABCA7, BIN1, Clu, CD33) and genes for inflammatory markers (TLR-4,        IL-8, TNF-α) by RT-qPCR in human glioblastoma (U87MG) and astrocyte (1321N1) cell        lines. The expression of inflammatory cytokines was further assessed by ELISA        assay. The exposure of U97MG and 1321N1 cells to H. pylori strains resulted in a        significant enhancement in the expression level of the risk allele ApoE4, while        reducing the expression of the protective allele ApoE2. H. pylori infection        remarkably increased the expression level of main AD-associated risk genes, and        also pro-inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, we noticed a substantial elevation        in the mRNA expression level of transmembrane receptor TLR-4 following H. pylori        infection. Our findings presented the potential for H. pylori to stimulate the        expression of AD-associated risk genes and trigger neuroinflammation in the brain        tissue.

Pharmacological interventions to slow the progression of        AD are intensively studied. A potential direction targets neuronal sigma-1        receptors (S1Rs). S1R ligands are recognized as promising therapeutic agents that        may alleviate symptom severity of AD, possibly via preventing amyloid-β-(Aβ-)        induced neurotoxicity on the endoplasmic reticulum stress-associated pathways.        Furthermore, S1Rs may also modulate adult neurogenesis, and the impairment of        this process is reported to be associated with AD. We aimed to investigate the        effects of two S1R agonists, dimethyltryptamine (DMT) and PRE084, in an        Aβ-induced in vivo mouse model characterizing neurogenic and        anti-neuroinflammatory symptoms of AD, and the modulatory effects of S1R agonists        were analyzed by immunohistochemical methods and western blotting. DMT, binding        moderately to S1R but with high affinity to 5-HT receptors, negatively influenced        neurogenesis, possibly as a result of activating both receptors differently. In        contrast, the highly selective S1R agonist PRE084 stimulated hippocampal cell        proliferation and differentiation. Regarding neuroinflammation, DMT and PRE084        significantly reduced Aβ(1-42)-induced astrogliosis, but neither had remarkable        effects on microglial activation. In summary, the highly selective S1R agonist        PRE084 may be a promising therapeutic agent for AD.

Under normal physiology, microglia are        primarily responsible for regulating central nervous system homeostasis through        the phagocytic clearance of redundant protein aggregates, apoptotic cells,        damaged neurons, and synapses. Furthermore, microglial cells can promote and        mitigate amyloid β phagocytosis and tau phosphorylation. Dysregulation of the        microglial programming alters cellular morphology, molecular signaling, and        secretory inflammatory molecules that contribute to various neurodegenerative        disorders especially Alzheimer's disease (AD).

Recent studies have shown that neuronal        pyroptosis mediated by the NLRP3 inflammasome plays a crucial role in the        pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. OBJECTIVE AND METHOD: The NLRP3        inflammasome is a multiprotein complex that, when activated within cells,        triggers an inflammatory response, ultimately leading to pyroptotic cell death of        neurons. Pyroptosis is a typical pro-inflammatory programmed cell death process        occurring downstream of NLRP3 inflammasome activation, characterized by the        formation of pores on the cell membrane by the GSDMD protein, leading to cell        lysis and the release of inflammatory factors. It has been found that NLRP3        inflammasome-mediated neuronal pyroptosis is closely associated with the        development of various neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease,        traumatic brain injury, and Parkinson's disease. Therefore, inhibiting NLRP3        inflammasome activation and attenuating neuronal pyroptosis could potentially        serve as novel strategies for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.        RESULTS: The aim of this review is to explore the role of NLRP3        activation-mediated neuronal pyroptosis and neuroinflammation in        neurodegenerative diseases. Firstly, we extensively discuss the relationship        between NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated neuronal pyroptosis and neuroinflammation in        various neurodegenerative diseases. Subsequently, we further explore the        mechanisms driving NLRP3 activation and assembly, as well as the        post-translational modifications regulating NLRP3 inflammasome activation.        CONCLUSION: Understanding these mechanisms will contribute to a deeper        understanding of the link between neuronal pyroptosis and neurodegenerative        diseases, and hold significant implications for the treatment and prevention of        neurodegenerative diseases.",bebe3c32190d51ec3e7f1bee6f1e56ee6dc152c1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bebe3c32190d51ec3e7f1bee6f1e56ee6dc152c1,37725102,,background,False,Inflammation research : official journal of the European Histamine Research,9508160,0.15520648658275604,0.0,5,6.986,0.5276381909547738,0.6532663316582915,0.2236976243667866

In        neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, astrocytes can take on a        hypertrophic appearance. These reactive astrocytes are canonically associated        with increases in cytoskeletal proteins, such as glial fibrillary acidic protein        and vimentin. However, the molecular alterations that characterize astrocytes in        human disease tissues have not been extensively studied with single cell        resolution. Using single nucleus RNA sequencing data from normal, pathologic        aging, and Alzheimer's disease brains, we identified the transcriptomic changes        associated with reactive astrocytes. Deep learning-based clustering algorithms        denoised expression data for 17,012 genes and clustered 15,529 astrocyte nuclei,        identifying protoplasmic, gray matter and fibrous, white matter astrocyte        clusters. RNA trajectory analyses revealed a spectrum of reactivity within        protoplasmic astrocytes characterized by a modest increase of reactive genes and        a marked decrease in homeostatic genes. Amyloid but not tau pathology correlated        with astrocyte reactivity. To identify reactivity-associated genes, linear        regressions of gene expression versus reactivity were used to identify the top 52        upregulated and 144 downregulated genes. Gene Ontology analysis revealed that        upregulated genes were associated with cellular growth, responses to metal ions,        inflammation, and proteostasis. Downregulated genes were involved in cellular        interactions, neuronal development, ERBB signaling, and synapse regulation.        Transcription factors were significantly enriched among the downregulated genes.        Using co-immunofluorescence staining of Alzheimer's disease brain tissues, we        confirmed pathologic downregulation of ERBB4 and transcription factor NFIA in        reactive astrocytes.

10.14336/AD.2022.0221,Brain Mitochondrial Dysfunction: A Possible Mechanism Links Early Life Anxiety to        Alzheimer's Disease in Later Life.,2022.0,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is usually manifested in patients with dementia,        accompanied by anxiety and other mental symptoms. Emerging evidence from humans        indicates that people who suffer from anxiety in their early life are more likely        to develop AD in later life. Mitochondria, the prominent organelles of energy        production in the brain, have crucial physiological significance for the brain,        requiring considerable energy to maintain its normal physiological activities.        Net reactive oxygen species (ROS) was produced by mitochondrial impairment, in        which oxidative stress is also included, and the production of ROS is mostly more        than that of removal. In this paper, we propose that as a critical process in        brain pathology, mitochondrial dysfunction caused by anxiety triggering oxidative        stress might be a possible mechanism that links early life anxiety to AD in later        life. Several pivotal physiological roles of mitochondria are reviewed, including        functions regulating glucose homeostasis, which may disrupt in oxidative stress.        Increased levels of oxidative stress are constantly shown in anxiety disorder        patients, and antioxidant drugs have promise in treating anxiety. In the early        stages of AD, mitochondrial dysfunction is concentrated around senile plaques, a        landmark lesion composed of aggregated Aβ and Tau protein. In turn, the        accumulated Aβ and Tau disrupts mitochondrial activity, and the tricky        physiological processes of mitochondria might be significant to the course of AD.        In the end, we conclude that mitochondria might present as one of the novel        therapeutic targets to block oxidative stress in patients with anxiety disorders        to prevent AD in the early stage.",7dd04ca587aa33717a110eee03cb71327bc3c83f,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7dd04ca587aa33717a110eee03cb71327bc3c83f,35855329,PMC9286915,background,False,Aging and disease,101540533,0.15431228280067444,0.005813953488372093,6,9.968,0.5577889447236181,0.8743718592964824,0.2634433868385663
10.3389/fnins.2022.909669,Rodent Modeling of Alzheimer's Disease in Down Syndrome: In vivo and ex vivo        Approaches.,2022.0,"There are an estimated 6 million people with Down syndrome (DS) worldwide. In        developed countries, the vast majority of these individuals will develop        Alzheimer's disease neuropathology characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-β        (Aβ) plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles within the brain, which leads to the        early onset of dementia (AD-DS) and reduced life-expectancy. The mean age of        onset of clinical dementia is ~55 years and by the age of 80, approaching 100% of        individuals with DS will have a dementia diagnosis. DS is caused by trisomy of        chromosome 21 (Hsa21) thus an additional copy of a gene(s) on the chromosome must        cause the development of AD neuropathology and dementia. Indeed, triplication of        the gene APP which encodes the amyloid precursor protein is sufficient and        necessary for early onset AD (EOAD), both in people who have and do not have DS.        However, triplication of other genes on Hsa21 leads to profound differences in        neurodevelopment resulting in intellectual disability, elevated incidence of        epilepsy and perturbations to the immune system. This different biology may        impact on how AD neuropathology and dementia develops in people who have DS.        Indeed, genes on Hsa21 other than APP when in three-copies can modulate        AD-pathogenesis in mouse preclinical models. Understanding this biology better is        critical to inform drug selection for AD prevention and therapy trials for people        who have DS. Here we will review rodent preclinical models of AD-DS and how these        can be used for both in vivo and ex vivo (cultured cells and organotypic slice        cultures) studies to understand the mechanisms that contribute to the early        development of AD in people who have DS and test the utility of treatments to        prevent or delay the development of disease.",775448eaafe9a0778171871a684d4373653cbdb3,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/775448eaafe9a0778171871a684d4373653cbdb3,35747206,PMC9209729,background,False,Frontiers in neuroscience,101478481,0.15431228280067444,0.02390438247011952,6,5.152,0.5628140703517588,0.3015075376884422,0.1855036790342803

The kynurenine pathway (KP) and several        of its metabolites, especially quinolinic acid (QA), are considered to be        involved in the neuropathogenesis of AD. The important metabolites and key        enzymes show significant importance in neuroinflammation and AD. Meanwhile, the        discovery of changed levels of KP metabolites in patients with AD suggests that        KP metabolites may have a prominent role in the pathogenesis of AD. Further, some        KP metabolites exhibit other effects on the brain, such as oxidative stress        regulation and neurotoxicity. Both analogs of the neuroprotective and        antineuroinflammation metabolites and small molecule enzyme inhibitors preventing        the formation of neurotoxic and neuroinflammation compounds may have potential        therapeutic significance.

Growing evidence in humans shows that obesity increases        the risk of developing AD by threefold. Hippocampal neuroinflammation in rodents        correlates with poor memory performance, suggesting that it contributes to        cognitive decline. Here we propose that reducing obesity/T2D-driven        neuroinflammation may prevent the progression of cognitive decline associated        with AD-like neurodegenerative states. Near-infrared light (NIR) has attracted        increasing attention as it was shown to improve learning and memory in both        humans and animal models. We previously reported that transcranial NIR delivery        reduced amyloid beta and Tau pathology and improved memory function in mouse        models of AD. Here, we report the effects of NIR in preventing obesity-induced        neuroinflammation in a diet-induced obese mouse model. Five-week-old wild-type        mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 13 weeks to induce obesity prior to        transcranial delivery of NIR for 4 weeks during 90-s sessions given 5 days a        week. After sacrifice, brain slices were subjected to free-floating        immunofluorescence for microglia and astrocyte markers to evaluate glial        activation and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to evaluate        expression levels of inflammatory cytokines and brain-derived neurotrophic factor        (BDNF). The hippocampal and cortical regions of the HFD group had increased        expression of the activated microglial marker CD68 and the astrocytic marker        glial fibrillary acidic protein. NIR-treated HFD groups showed decreased levels        of these markers. PCR revealed that hippocampal tissue from the HFD group had        increased levels of pro-inflammatory interleukin (IL)-1β and tumor necrosis        factor-α. Interestingly, the same samples showed increased levels of the        anti-inflammatory IL-10. All these changes were attenuated by NIR treatment.        Lastly, hippocampal levels of the neurotrophic factor BDNF were increased in        NIR-treated HFD mice, compared to untreated HFD mice. The marked reductions in        glial activation and pro-inflammatory cytokines along with elevated BDNF provide        insights into how NIR could reduce neuroinflammation.

The expression profiling of postmortem        brain tissue from AD patients and controls provides evidence about AD        etiopathogenesis. In the current study, we used published AD expression profiling        data to construct spatiotemporal specific coexpression networks in AD and        analyzed the network preservation features of each brain region in different        disease stages to identify the most dramatically changed coexpression modules and        obtained AD-related biological pathways, brain regions and circuits, cell types        and key genes based on these modules.

Cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (C3G), a dietary        anthocyanin found in many fruits and vegetables, has been reported as an        antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antitumor agent. However, there have been no        reports on whether C3G can regulate the M1/M2 shift in an Alzheimer's disease        model. We attempted to investigate the effects of C3G on M1/M2 polarization and        the mechanism to regulate anti-inflammation and phagocytosis, both in vitro and        in vivo. HMC3 cells were treated with β-amyloid (Aβ42) in the presence or absence        of 50 μM C3G for different time intervals, and APPswe/PS1ΔE9 mice were orally        administered 30 mg/kg/day of C3G for 38 weeks. The in vitro data revealed that        C3G could shift the M1 phenotype of microglia to M2 by reducing the expression of        M1-specific markers (CD86 and CD80), inflammatory cytokines (IL-Iβ, IL-6, TNF-α),        reactive oxygen species, and enhancing the expression of M2-specific markers        (CD206 and CD163). The APPswe/PS1ΔE9 mice results were consistent with the in        vitro data, indicating a significant reduction in inflammatory cytokines and        higher expression of M2-specific markers such as CD206 and Arg1 in C3G-treated        Alzheimer's disease model mice. Additionally, C3G was found to upregulate PPARγ        expression levels both in vitro and in vivo, whereas a PPARγ antagonist (GW9662)        was found to block C3G-mediated effects in vitro. In this study, we confirmed        that C3G could regulate microglial polarization by activating PPARγ and        eliminating accumulated β-amyloid by enhancing Aβ42 phagocytosis through the        upregulation of TREM2.",c9f0766834664e958b68a4c4bf70ff10bd668b01,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c9f0766834664e958b68a4c4bf70ff10bd668b01,35670898,PMC9363298,,False,Molecular neurobiology,8900963,0.15140382945537567,0.015151515151515152,19,5.682,0.9045226130653267,0.3417085427135678,0.23841642826405293

This study aims to elucidate this mechanism by integrating        transcriptomics and TSPO, Aβ PET imaging in clinical AD cohort. METHODS: We        analyzed 85 patients with PET/MR imaging for microglial activation (TSPO,        [(18)F]DPA-714) and Aβ ([(18)F]AV-45) within the prospective Alzheimer's Disease        Immunization and Microbiota Initiative Study Cohort (ADIMIC).

However, the association between inflammation and        brain structure in vivo and the transcriptome-driven functional basis with        relevance to neurodegenerative disorders remains elusive. The aim of the present        study is to identify the association among inflammation, brain structure, and        neurodegenerative disorders at genetic and transcriptomic levels. Genetic        variants associated with inflammatory cytokines were selected from the latest and        largest genome-wide association studies of European ancestry. Neurodegenerative        disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD),        amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and        brain structure imaging measures were selected as the outcomes. Two-sample        Mendelian randomization analyses were conducted to identify the causal        associations. Single-nucleus transcriptome data of the occipitotemporal cortex        was further analyzed to identify the differential expressed genes in AD, which        were tested for biological processes and protein interaction network. MR analysis        indicated that genetically predicted TREM2 and sTREM2 were significantly        associated with AD (TREM2: z-score = -9.088, p-value = 1.02 × 10(-19); sTREM2:        z-score = -7.495, p-value = 6.61 × 10(-14)). The present study found no evidence        to support the causal associations between other inflammatory cytokines and the        risks of AD, PD, ALS, or DLB.

10.1186/s12974-023-02821-x,Microglial cell response to experimental periodontal disease.,2023.0,"OBJECTIVES: Microglial activation is critical for modulating the        neuroinflammatory process and the pathological progression of neurodegenerative        diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Microglia are involved in forming        barriers around extracellular neuritic plaques and the phagocytosis of β-amyloid        peptide (Aβ). In this study, we tested the hypothesis that periodontal disease        (PD) as a source of infection alters inflammatory activation and Aβ phagocytosis        by the microglial cells. METHODS: Experimental PD was induced using ligatures in        C57BL/6 mice for 1, 10, 20, and 30 days to assess the progression of PD. Animals        without ligatures were used as controls. Maxillary bone loss and local        periodontal tissue inflammation associated with the development of PD were        confirmed by morphometric bone analysis and cytokine expression, respectively.        The frequency and the total number of activated microglia (CD45(+) CD11b(+)        MHCII(+)) in the brain were analyzed by flow cytometry. Mouse microglial cells        (1 × 10(5)) were incubated with heat-inactivated bacterial biofilm isolated from        the ligatures retrieved from the teeth or with Klebsiella variicola, a relevant        PD-associated bacteria in mice. Expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines,        toll-like receptors (TLR), and receptors for phagocytosis was measured by        quantitative PCR. The phagocytic capacity of microglia to uptake β-amyloid was        analyzed by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Ligature placement caused progressive        periodontal disease and bone resorption that was already significant on day 1        post-ligation (p < 0.05) and continued to increase until day 30 (p < 0.0001). The        severity of periodontal disease increased the frequency of activated microglia in        the brains on day 30 by 36%. In parallel, heat-inactivated PD-associated total        bacteria and Klebsiella variicola increased the expression of TNFα, IL-1β, IL-6,        TLR2, and TLR9 in microglial cells (1.6-, 83-, 3.2-, 1.5-, 1.5-fold, respectively        p < 0.01). Incubation of microglia with Klebsiella variicola increased the        Aβ-phagocytosis by 394% and the expression of the phagocytic receptor MSR1 by        33-fold compared to the non-activated cells (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: We showed        that inducing PD in mice results in microglia activation in vivo and that        PD-associated bacteria directly promote a pro-inflammatory and phagocytic        phenotype in microglia.

10.3390/ijms24010884,Microglial Activation and Priming in Alzheimer's Disease: State of the Art and        Future Perspectives.,2023.0,"Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, having a        remarkable social and healthcare burden worldwide. Amyloid β (Aβ) and protein Tau        aggregates are disease hallmarks and key players in AD pathogenesis. However, it        has been hypothesized that microglia can contribute to AD pathophysiology, as        well. Microglia are CNS-resident immune cells belonging to the myeloid lineage of        the innate arm of immunity. Under physiological conditions, microglia are in        constant motion in order to carry on their housekeeping function, and they        maintain an anti-inflammatory, quiescent state, with low expression of cytokines        and no phagocytic activity. Upon various stimuli (debris, ATP, misfolded        proteins, aggregates and pathogens), microglia acquire a phagocytic function and        overexpress cytokine gene modules. This process is generally regarded as        microglia activation and implies that the production of pro-inflammatory        cytokines is counterbalanced by the synthesis and the release of        anti-inflammatory molecules. This mechanism avoids excessive inflammatory        response and inappropriate microglial activation, which causes tissue damage and        brain homeostasis impairment. Once the pathogenic stimulus has been cleared,        activated microglia return to the naïve, anti-inflammatory state. Upon repeated        stimuli (as in the case of Aβ deposition in the early stage of AD), activated        microglia shift toward a less protective, neurotoxic phenotype, known as ""primed""        microglia. The main characteristic of primed microglia is their lower capability        to turn back toward the naïve, anti-inflammatory state, which makes these cells        prone to chronic activation and favours chronic inflammation in the brain. Primed        microglia have impaired defence capacity against injury and detrimental effects        on the brain microenvironment. Additionally, priming has been associated with AD        onset and progression and can represent a promising target for AD treatment        strategies. Many factors (genetics, environmental factors, baseline inflammatory        status of microglia, ageing) generate an aberrantly activated phenotype that        undergoes priming easier and earlier than normally activated microglia do. Novel,        promising targets for therapeutic strategies for AD have been sought in the field        of microglia activation and, importantly, among those factors influencing the        baseline status of these cells. The CX3CL1 pathway could be a valuable target        treatment approach in AD, although preliminary findings from the studies in this        field are controversial. The current review aims to summarize state of the art on        the role of microglia dysfunction in AD pathogenesis and proposes biochemical        pathways with possible targets for AD treatment.",06ac953c6c85c53d4d819bf235add9b0172ba1d7,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/06ac953c6c85c53d4d819bf235add9b0172ba1d7,36614325,PMC9820926,background,True,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,0.14915917813777924,0.36585365853658536,14,6.208,0.8140703517587939,0.6231155778894473,0.40666710630320413

Considering inflammation hampers functions of        the involved tissues, the CSF abnormalities reported in these conditions are        suggestive of ChP injury. Indeed, several studies document ChP damage in aging        and AD, which nevertheless remains to be systematically characterized. We here        report that the changes elicited in the CSF by AD are consistent with a perturbed        aging process and accompanied by aberrant accumulation of inflammatory signals        and metabolically active proteins in the ChP.

10.1186/s13195-023-01330-6,A small-molecule TLR4 antagonist reduced neuroinflammation in female E4FAD mice.,2023.0,"BACKGROUND: APOE genotype is the greatest genetic risk factor for sporadic        Alzheimer's disease (AD). APOE4 increases AD risk up to 12-fold compared to        APOE3, an effect that is greater in females. Evidence suggests that one-way APOE        could modulate AD risk and progression through neuroinflammation. Indeed, APOE4        is associated with higher glial activation and cytokine levels in AD patients and        mice. Therefore, identifying pathways that contribute to APOE4-associated        neuroinflammation is an important approach for understanding and treating AD.        Human and in vivo evidence suggests that TLR4, one of the key receptors involved        in the innate immune system, could be involved in APOE-modulated        neuroinflammation. Consistent with that idea, we previously demonstrated that the        TLR4 antagonist IAXO-101 can reduce LPS- and Aβ-induced cytokine secretion in        APOE4 glial cultures. Therefore, the goal of this study was to advance these        findings and determine whether IAXO-101 can modulate neuroinflammation, Aβ        pathology, and behavior in mice that express APOE4. METHODS: We used mice that        express five familial AD mutations and human APOE3 (E3FAD) or APOE4 (E4FAD).        Female and male E4FAD mice and female E3FAD mice were treated with vehicle or        IAXO-101 in two treatment paradigms: prevention from 4 to 6 months of age or        reversal from 6 to 7 months of age. Learning and memory were assessed by modified        Morris water maze. Aβ deposition, fibrillar amyloid deposition, astrogliosis, and        microgliosis were assessed by immunohistochemistry. Soluble levels of Aβ and        apoE, insoluble levels of apoE and Aβ, and IL-1β were measured by ELISA. RESULTS:        IAXO-101 treatment resulted in lower Iba-1 coverage, lower number of reactive        microglia, and improved memory in female E4FAD mice in both prevention and        reversal paradigms. IAXO-101-treated male E4FAD mice also had lower Iba-1        coverage and reactivity in the RVS paradigm, but there was no effect on behavior.        There was also no effect of IAXO-101 treatment on neuroinflammation and behavior        in female E3FAD mice.

We previously documented that Treg immunomodulatory mechanisms are        compromised in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Ex vivo expansion of Tregs restores and        amplifies their immunosuppressive functions in vitro. A key question is whether        adoptive transfer of ex vivo expanded human Tregs can suppress neuroinflammation        and amyloid pathology in a preclinical mouse model. METHODS: An immunodeficient        mouse model of AD was generated by backcrossing the 5xFAD onto Rag2 knockout mice        (5xFAD-Rag2KO). Human Tregs were expanded ex vivo for 24 days and administered to        5xFAD-Rag2KO. Changes in amyloid burden, microglia characteristics and reactive        astrocytes were evaluated using ELISA and confocal microscopy. NanoString Mouse        AD multiplex gene expression analysis was applied to explore the impact of ex        vivo expanded Tregs on the neuroinflammation transcriptome. RESULTS: Elimination        of mature B and T lymphocytes and natural killer cells in 5xFAD-Rag2KO mice was        associated with upregulation of 95 inflammation genes and amplified number of        reactive microglia within the dentate gyrus. Administration of ex vivo expanded        Tregs reduced amyloid burden and reactive glial cells in the dentate gyrus and        frontal cortex of 5xFAD-Rag2KO mice. Interrogation of inflammation gene        expression documented down-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL1A&B,        IL6), complement cascade (C1qa, C1qb, C1qc, C4a/b), toll-like receptors (Tlr3,        Tlr4 and Tlr7) and microglial activations markers (CD14, Tyrobp,Trem2) following        Treg administration. CONCLUSIONS: Ex vivo expanded Tregs with amplified        immunomodulatory function, suppressed neuroinflammation and alleviated AD        pathology in vivo.

It was first described        by the two physicians from whom it took its name. Nowadays, we have extensively        expanded our knowledge about this disease. Starting from a merely clinical and        histopathologic description, we have now reached better molecular comprehension.        For instance, we passed from an old conceptualization of the disease based on        plaques and tangles to a more modern vision of mixed proteinopathy in a        one-to-one relationship with an alteration of specific glial and neuronal        phenotypes. However, no disease-modifying therapies are yet available. It is        likely that the only way to find a few ""magic bullets"" is to deepen this aspect        more and more until we are able to draw up specific molecular profiles for single        AD cases. This review reports the most recent classifications of AD atypical        variants in order to summarize all the clinical evidence using several discrimina        (for example, post mortem neurofibrillary tangle density, cerebral atrophy, or        FDG-PET studies). The better defined four atypical forms are posterior cortical        atrophy (PCA), logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia (LvPPA),        behavioral/dysexecutive variant and AD with corticobasal degeneration (CBS).        Moreover, we discuss the usefulness of such classifications before outlining the        molecular-genetic aspects focusing on microglial activity or, more generally,        immune system control of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration.",6d4a6ad2fd8c074dad3718676dd8496f445fe522,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6d4a6ad2fd8c074dad3718676dd8496f445fe522,37509674,PMC10377159,,False,Biomedicines,101691304,0.14829370379447937,0.05668016194331984,1,4.757,0.2964824120603015,0.24623115577889448,0.14856721109155116
10.3389/fnins.2023.1106570,Increased central auditory gain in 5xFAD Alzheimer's disease mice as an early        biomarker candidate for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis.,2023.0,"Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative illness without a cure. All        current therapies require an accurate diagnosis and staging of AD to ensure        appropriate care. Central auditory processing disorders (CAPDs) and hearing loss        have been associated with AD, and may precede the onset of Alzheimer's dementia.        Therefore, CAPD is a possible biomarker candidate for AD diagnosis. However,        little is known about how CAPD and AD pathological changes are correlated. In the        present study, we investigated auditory changes in AD using transgenic        amyloidosis mouse models. AD mouse models were bred to a mouse strain commonly        used for auditory experiments, to compensate for the recessive accelerated        hearing loss on the parent background. Auditory brainstem response (ABR)        recordings revealed significant hearing loss, a reduced ABR wave I amplitude, and        increased central gain in 5xFAD mice. In comparison, these effects were milder or        reversed in APP/PS1 mice. Longitudinal analyses revealed that in 5xFAD mice,        central gain increase preceded ABR wave I amplitude reduction and hearing loss,        suggesting that it may originate from lesions in the central nervous system        rather than the peripheral loss. Pharmacologically facilitating cholinergic        signaling with donepezil reversed the central gain in 5xFAD mice. After the        central gain increased, aging 5xFAD mice developed deficits for hearing sound        pips in the presence of noise, consistent with CAPD-like symptoms of AD patients.        Histological analysis revealed that amyloid plaques were deposited in the        auditory cortex of both mouse strains. However, in 5xFAD but not APP/PS1 mice,        plaque was observed in the upper auditory brainstem, specifically the inferior        colliculus (IC) and the medial geniculate body (MGB). This plaque distribution        parallels histological findings from human subjects with AD and correlates in age        with central gain increase. Overall, we conclude that auditory alterations in        amyloidosis mouse models correlate with amyloid deposits in the auditory        brainstem and may be reversed initially through enhanced cholinergic signaling.        The alteration of ABR recording related to the increase in central gain prior to        AD-related hearing disorders suggests that it could potentially be used as an        early biomarker of AD diagnosis.",3e0ddfec9fa6d53dc163df3097dcde352eba6ba0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3e0ddfec9fa6d53dc163df3097dcde352eba6ba0,37304021,PMC10250613,,False,Frontiers in neuroscience,101478481,0.14804719388484955,0.0,3,5.152,0.4472361809045226,0.3065326633165829,0.15747948479862067

The intricate pathogenesis        causes severe impairment of neurons, which, in turn, exacerbates Aβ aggregation        and facilitates AD progression. Herein, multifunctional melanin-like metal ion        chelators and neuroinflammation regulators (named PDA@K) were constructed for        targeted treatment of AD. In this platform, intrinsically bioactive material        polydopamine nanoparticles (PDA) with potent metal ion chelating and ROS        scavenging effects were decorated with the KLVFF peptide, endowing the system        with the capacity of enhanced pathological blood-brain barrier (BBB) crossing and        lesion site accumulation via Aβ hitchhiking. In vitro and in vivo experiment        revealed that PDA@K had high affinity toward Aβ and were able to hitch a ride on        Aβ to achieve increased pathological BBB crossing. The engineered PDA@K        effectively mitigated Aβ aggregate and alleviated neuroinflammation. The        modulated inflammatory microenvironment by PDA@K promoted microglial polarization        toward the M2-like phenotype, which restored their critical functions for neuron        care and plaque removal. After 3-week treatment of PDA@K, spatial learning and        memory deficit as well as neurologic changes of FAD(4T) transgenic mice were        largely rescued. Transcriptomics analysis further revealed the therapeutic        mechanism of PDA@K.

By forming a complex with        mitochondrial Tu translation elongation factor (TUFM), TSFM participates in        mitochondrial protein translation. We have previously reported that TUFM        regulates translation of beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) via ROS        (reactive oxygen species)-dependent mechanism, suggesting a potential role in        amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing associated with Alzheimer's disease        (AD), which led to the speculation that TSFM may regulate APP processing in a        similar way to TUFM. METHODS AND RESULTS: Here, we report that in cultured cells,        knockdown or overexpression TSFM did not change protein levels in BACE1 and APP.        Besides, the levels of cytoplasmic ROS and mitochondrial superoxide, in addition        to ATP level, cell viability and mitochondrial membrane potential were not        significantly altered by TSFM knockdown in the short term. Further transcriptome        analysis revealed that expression of majority of mitochondrial genes were not        remarkably changed by TSFM silencing. The possibility of TSFM involved in        cardiomyopathy and cancer development was uncovered using bioinformatics        analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, short-term regulation of TSFM level in        cultured cells does not cause a significant change in proteins involved in APP        processing, levels in ROS and ATP associated with mitochondrial function.

Recently, miRNA dysregulation has been found in neurodegenerative diseases such        as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). The diagnosis of        Alzheimer's and Parkinson's is currently challenging, mainly occurring when        pathology is already present, and although treatments are available for both        diseases, the role of treatment is primarily to prevent or delay the progress of        the diseases instead of fully overcoming the diseases. Therefore, the challenge        in the near future will be to determine effective drugs to tackle the        dysregulated biological pathways in neurodegenerative diseases. In the present        study, we describe the dysregulation of miRNAs in blood of Alzheimer's and        Parkinson's patients with the aim to identify common mechanisms between the 2        pathologies and potentially to identify common therapeutic targets which can stop        or delay the progression of two most frequent neuropathologies.

Here, we show glial cell activation and miR-21 overexpression in mouse        organotypic hippocampal slices transplanted with SH-SY5Y cells expressing the        human APP695 Swedish mutation. The upregulation of miR-21 only in the CSF from a        small series of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) AD patients, but not in non-AD        MCI individuals, supports its discriminatory potential.

In AD neurons, miR-124/miR-21        overexpression was recapitulated in their exosomes. In AD microglia, the        upregulation of iNOS and miR-21/miR-146a supports their activation.

One of the key features of AD is the accumulation of reactive oxygen        species (ROS), which leads to an overall increase in oxidative damage. The        nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) is a master regulator of the        antioxidant response in cells. Under low ROS levels, Nrf2 is kept in the        cytoplasm. However, an increase in ROS production leads to a translocation of        Nrf2 into the nucleus, where it activates the transcription of several genes        involved in the cells' antioxidant response. Additionally, Nrf2 activation        increases autophagy function. However, in AD, the accumulation of Aβ and tau        reduces Nrf2 levels, decreasing the antioxidant response. The reduced Nrf2 levels        contribute to the further accumulation of Aβ and tau by impairing their        autophagy-mediated turnover.

Of particular interest, it can be        demonstrated that Aβ pathology is present in the hearts of patients with AD,        while the formation of NFT in the auditory system can be detected much earlier        than the onset of symptoms. Progressive hearing impairment may beget social        isolation and accelerate cognitive decline and increase the risk of developing        dementia. The current review discusses the concept of a brain-ear-heart axis by        which Aβ and NFT inhibition could be achieved through targeted supplementation of        neurotrophic factors to the cochlea and the brain. Such amyloid inhibition might        also indirectly affect amyloid accumulation in the heart, thus reducing the risk        of developing AD-associated amyloid cardiomyopathy and cardiovascular disease.",0575538c0dfe4a2e45a86161e17eacd32c6d8bd5,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0575538c0dfe4a2e45a86161e17eacd32c6d8bd5,34204299,PMC8235707,,False,Biomolecules,101596414,0.14499425888061523,0.007142857142857143,9,6.064,0.678391959798995,0.49246231155778897,0.22198356122484503

While apolipoprotein E (APOE) is known to        modify AD risk, it remains unclear how microglial apoE impacts brain cognition        and AD pathology. Here, using conditional mouse models expressing apoE isoforms        in microglia and central nervous system-associated macrophages (CAMs), we        demonstrate a cell-autonomous effect of apoE3-mediated microglial activation and        function, which are negated by apoE4. Expression of apoE3 in microglia/CAMs        improves cognitive function, increases microglia surrounding amyloid plaque and        reduces amyloid pathology and associated toxicity, whereas apoE4 expression        either compromises or has no effects on these outcomes by impairing lipid        metabolism. Single-cell transcriptomic profiling reveals increased antigen        presentation and interferon pathways upon apoE3 expression. In contrast, apoE4        expression downregulates complement and lysosomal pathways, and promotes        stress-related responses. Moreover, in the presence of mouse endogenous apoE,        microglial apoE4 exacerbates amyloid pathology. Finally, we observed a reduction        in Lgals3-positive responsive microglia surrounding amyloid plaque and an        increased accumulation of lipid droplets in APOE4 human brains and induced        pluripotent stem cell-derived microglia.

The senescent cells can be recognized and removed by NK cells.        However, NK cell function is gradually inactivated with age. Therefore, this        study used senescence as an entry point to investigate how NK cells affect AD.        METHODS: The study validated the correlation between cognition and aging through        a prospective cohort of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey        database. A cellular trajectory analysis of the aging population was performed        using single-cell nuclear transcriptome sequencing data from patients with AD and        different ages. The genome-wide association study (GWAS) cohort of AD patients        was used as the outcome event, and the expression quantitative trait locus was        used as an instrumental variable. Causal associations between genes and AD were        analyzed by bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) and co-localization.        Finally, clinical cohorts were constructed to validate the expression of key        genes. RESULTS: A correlation between cognition and aging was demonstrated using        2,171 older adults over 60 years of age. Gene regulation analysis revealed that        most of the highly active transcription factors were concentrated in the NK cell        subpopulation of AD. NK cell trajectories were constructed for different age        populations. MR and co-localization analyses revealed that CHD6 may be one of the        factors influencing AD. CONCLUSION: We explored different levels of AD and aging        from population cohorts, single-cell data, and GWAS cohorts and found that there        may be some correlations of NK cells between aging and AD.

We        now report on a double transgenic APP(NL-G-F) MAPT(P301S) mouse that at 6 months        of age exhibits robust Aβ plaque accumulation, intense MAPT pathology, strong        inflammation and extensive neurodegeneration. The presence of Aβ pathology        potentiated the other major pathologies, including MAPT pathology, inflammation        and neurodegeneration. However, MAPT pathology neither changed levels of amyloid        precursor protein nor potentiated Aβ accumulation. The APP(NL-G-F)/MAPT(P301S)        mouse model also showed strong accumulation of N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A),        which was recently shown to be elevated in the AD brain. M6A primarily        accumulated in neuronal soma, but also co-localized with a subset of astrocytes        and microglia. The accumulation of m6A corresponded with increases in METTL3 and        decreases in ALKBH5, which are enzymes that add or remove m(6)A from mRNA,        respectively.

Stimulation of human        brain endothelial cells with interferon-β decreased the levels of the adherens        junction protein VE-cadherin as well as tight junction proteins Occludin and        Claudin-5 and increased barrier leakiness. Depletion of the Type I interferon        receptor in human brain endothelial cells prevented interferon-β-induced        VE-cadherin downregulation and restored endothelial barrier integrity.

Recently, neuroinflammation has been recognized as a prominent        feature of the AD brain and substantial evidence suggests that the inflammatory        response modulates disease progression. Additionally, dysregulation of calcium        (Ca(2+)) homeostasis represents another early factor involved in the AD        pathogenesis, as intracellular Ca(2+) concentration is essential to ensure proper        cellular and neuronal functions. Although growing evidence supports the        involvement of Ca(2+) in the mechanisms of neurodegeneration-related inflammatory        processes, scant data are available on its contribution in microglia and        astrocytes functioning, both in health and throughout the AD continuum.

Recent research has identified a hormone called irisin, which is        produced during exercise, that has shown promising effects on cognitive function.        Irisin acts on the brain by promoting neuroprotection by enhancing the growth and        survival of neurons. It also plays a role in metabolism, energy regulation, and        glucose homeostasis. Furthermore, irisin has been found to modulate autophagy,        which is a cellular process involved in the clearance of protein aggregates,        which are a hallmark of AD. Additionally, irisin has been shown to protect        against cell death, apoptosis, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation, all of        which are implicated in AD pathogenesis.

Nuclear acetyl-CoA pools are generated partially from        local acetate that is metabolized by acetyl-CoA synthetase 2 (ACSS2). However,        the underlying mechanism of histone acetylation dysregulation in AD remains        poorly understood. METHODS: We detected ACSS2 expression and histone acetylation        levels in the brains of AD patients and 5 × FAD mice. When we altered ACSS2        expression by injecting adeno-associated virus into the dorsal hippocampus of        5 × FAD mice and replenished ACSS2 substrate (acetate), we observed changes in        cognitive function by Morris water maze. We next performed RNA-seq, ChIP-qPCR,        and electrophysiology to study molecular mechanism underlying ACSS2-mediated        spatial learning and memory in 5 × FAD mice. RESULTS: We reported that ACSS2        expression and histone acetylation (H3K9, H4K12) were reduced in the hippocampus        and prefrontal cortex of 5 × FAD mice. Reduced ACSS2 levels were also observed in        the temporal cortex of AD patients. 5 × FAD mice exhibited a low enrichment of        acetylated histones on the promoters of NMDARs and AMPARs, together with impaired        basal and activity-dependent synaptic plasticity, all of which were rescued by        ACSS2 upregulation. Moreover, acetate replenishment enhanced ac-H3K9 and ac-H4K12        in 5 × FAD mice, leading to an increase of NMDARs and AMPARs and a restoration of        synaptic plasticity and cognitive function in an ACSS2-dependent manner.        CONCLUSION: ACSS2 is a key molecular switch of cognitive impairment and that        targeting ACSS2 or acetate administration may serve as a novel therapeutic        strategy for the treatment of intermediate or advanced AD. Nuclear acetyl-CoA        pools are generated partly from local acetate that is metabolized by acetyl-CoA        synthetase 2 (ACSS2). Model depicts that ACSS2 expression is downregulated in the        brains of 5×FAD model mice and AD patients. Of note, ACSS2 downregulation        mediates a reduction in ionotropic glutamate receptor expression through histone        acetylation, which exacerbates synaptic plasticity impairment in AD. These        deficits can be rescued by ACSS2 upregulation or acetate supplementation (GTA, an        FDA-approved food additive), which may serve as a promising therapeutic strategy        for AD treatment.",ae614f270afb2679f60dc6f43f3887799620ea09,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ae614f270afb2679f60dc6f43f3887799620ea09,37438762,PMC10339567,background,False,Molecular neurodegeneration,101266600,0.14235107600688934,0.0,7,18.879,0.6030150753768844,0.9748743718592965,0.2793887398874939

In the brain, it is also present        and significantly elevated after hemorrhage in premature infants and in distinct        conditions affecting the cerebrospinal fluid circulation of adults. However,        current knowledge on SP-G-expression is limited to ependymal cells and some        neurons in the subventricular and superficial cortex. Therefore, we primarily        focused on the distribution of SP-G-immunoreactivity (ir) and its spatial        relationships with components of the neurovascular unit in murine forebrains.        Triple fluorescence labeling elucidated SP-G-co-expressing neurons in the        habenula, infundibulum, and hypothalamus. Exploring whether SP-G might play a        role in Alzheimer's disease (AD), 3xTg-AD mice were investigated and displayed        age-dependent hippocampal deposits of β-amyloid and hyperphosphorylated tau        separately from clustered, SP-G-containing dots with additional Reelin-ir-which        was used as established marker for disease progression in this specific context.        Semi-quantification of those dots, together with immunoassay-based quantification        of intra- and extracellular SP-G, revealed a significant elevation in old 3xTg        mice when compared to age-matched wildtype animals. This suggests a role of SP-G        for the pathophysiology of AD, but a confirmation with human samples is required.",d410b8de22dcb83fb0ff88c59ea461839462a52f,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d410b8de22dcb83fb0ff88c59ea461839462a52f,35053244,PMC8773979,background,False,Biomolecules,101596414,0.14235107600688934,0.02857142857142857,2,6.064,0.4020100502512563,0.49748743718592964,0.18905851734621612
10.3389/fcell.2022.999024,Alzheimer's disease: Pathophysiology and dental pulp stem cells therapeutic        prospects.,2022.0,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a destructive neurodegenerative disease with the        progressive dysfunction, structural disorders and decreased numbers of neurons in        the brain, which leads to long-term memory impairment and cognitive decline.        There is a growing consensus that the development of AD has several molecular        mechanisms similar to those of other neurodegenerative diseases, including        excessive accumulation of misfolded proteins and neurotoxic substances produced        by hyperactivated microglia. Nonetheless, there is currently a lack of effective        drug candidates to delay or prevent the progression of the disease. Based on the        excellent regenerative and reparative capabilities of stem cells, the application        of them to repair or replace injured neurons carries enormous promise. Dental        pulp stem cells (DPSCs), originated from ectomesenchyme of the cranial neural        crest, hold a remarkable potential for neuronal differentiation, and additionally        express a variety of neurotrophic factors that contribute to a protective effect        on injured neuronal cells. Notably, DPSCs can also express immunoregulatory        factors to control neuroinflammation and potentiate the regeneration and recovery        of injured neurons. These extraordinary features along with accessibility make        DPSCs an attractive source of postnatal stem cells for the regeneration of        neurons or protection of existing neural circuitry in the neurodegenerative        diseases. The present reviews the latest research advance in the pathophysiology        of AD and elaborate the neurodifferentiation and neuroprotective properties of        DPSCs as well as their application prospects in AD.",43b7b2bf1160e1ef8a6213086b450eccfda0ec86,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/43b7b2bf1160e1ef8a6213086b450eccfda0ec86,36187488,PMC9520621,background,False,Frontiers in cell and developmental biology,101630250,0.14223189651966095,0.03910614525139665,2,6.081,0.40703517587939697,0.507537688442211,0.19549795670469816

We previously showed that amyloid β (Aβ) toxic conformer with a turn        at positions 22-23 is essential for forming highly toxic oligomers. In the        present study, we evaluated phenotypic changes with aging in AD model        App(NL-P-F/NL-P-F) (NL-P-F) mice with Swedish mutation (NL), Iberian mutation        (F), and mutation (P) overproducing E22P-Aβ, a mimic of toxic conformer utilizing        the knock-in technique. Furthermore, the role of the toxic conformer in AD        pathology was investigated. NL-P-F mice produced soluble toxic conformers from an        early age. They showed impaired synaptic plasticity, glial cell activation, and        cognitive decline, followed by the accumulation of Aβ plaques and tau        hyperphosphorylation. In addition, the protein expression of hypoxia-inducible        factor (HIF)-1α was increased, and gene expression of HIF-3α was decreased in        NL-P-F mice. HIF dysregulation due to the production of soluble toxic conformers        may be involved in AD pathology in NL-P-F mice. This study could reveal the role        of a highly toxic Aβ on AD pathogenesis, thereby contributing to the development        of a novel therapeutic strategy targeting the toxic conformer.",8e23bc976a8aa70b3b6010d359aa63c56cca7bef,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8e23bc976a8aa70b3b6010d359aa63c56cca7bef,36362046,PMC9654501,,False,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,0.14211279153823853,0.056179775280898875,3,6.208,0.457286432160804,0.6331658291457286,0.22867358676981103
10.3390/cells13060511,Recent Research Trends in Neuroinflammatory and Neurodegenerative Disorders.,2024.0,"Neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease        (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), traumatic brain injury (TBI) and Amyotrophic        lateral sclerosis (ALS) are chronic major health disorders. The exact mechanism        of the neuroimmune dysfunctions of these disease pathogeneses is currently not        clearly understood. These disorders show dysregulated neuroimmune and        inflammatory responses, including activation of neurons, glial cells, and        neurovascular unit damage associated with excessive release of proinflammatory        cytokines, chemokines, neurotoxic mediators, and infiltration of peripheral        immune cells into the brain, as well as entry of inflammatory mediators through        damaged neurovascular endothelial cells, blood-brain barrier and tight junction        proteins. Activation of glial cells and immune cells leads to the release of many        inflammatory and neurotoxic molecules that cause neuroinflammation and        neurodegeneration. Gulf War Illness (GWI) and myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic        fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) are chronic disorders that are also associated with        neuroimmune dysfunctions. Currently, there are no effective disease-modifying        therapeutic options available for these diseases. Human induced pluripotent stem        cell (iPSC)-derived neurons, astrocytes, microglia, endothelial cells and        pericytes are currently used for many disease models for drug discovery. This        review highlights certain recent trends in neuroinflammatory responses and        iPSC-derived brain cell applications in neuroinflammatory disorders.",c3b9491fdb9a0c421ec1f2dc1998f9d052388d9e,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c3b9491fdb9a0c421ec1f2dc1998f9d052388d9e,38534355,PMC10969521,background,False,Cells,101600052,0.14187483489513397,0.0038314176245210726,0,7.666,0.20603015075376885,0.7286432160804021,0.18429602254347424

These        metabolic disorders are associated with neurodegenerative diseases, particularly        Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's disease related dementias. Innate        inflammatory signaling plays a critical role in this association, potentially via        the early activation of the cGAS/STING pathway. To determine acute systemic        metabolic and inflammatory responses and corresponding changes in the brain, we        used a high fat diet fed obese mouse model of prediabetes and cognitive        impairment. We observed acute systemic changes in metabolic and inflammatory        responses, with impaired glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, and alterations        in peripheral immune cell populations. Central inflammatory changes included        microglial activation in a pro-inflammatory environment with cGAS/STING        activation. Blocking gap junctions in neuron-microglial co-cultures significantly        decreased cGAS/STING activation.
