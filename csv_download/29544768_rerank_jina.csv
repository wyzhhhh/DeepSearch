Stochastics of Cellular Differentiation Explained by Epigenetics: The Case of T-Cell Differentiation and Functional Plasticity,"Epigenetic marks including histone modifications and DNA methylation are associated with the regulation of gene expression and activity. In addition, an increasing number of non-coding RNAs with regulatory activity on gene expression have been identified. Alongside, technological advancements allow for the analysis of these mechanisms with high resolution up to the single-cell level. For instance, the assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) simultaneously probes for chromatin accessibility and nucleosome positioning. Thus, it provides information on two levels of epigenetic regulation. Development and differentiation of T cells into functional subset cells including memory T cells are dynamic processes driven by environmental signals. Here, we briefly review the current knowledge of how epigenetic regulation contributes to subset specification, differentiation and memory development in T cells. Specifically, we focus on epigenetic mechanisms differentially active in the two distinct T cell populations expressing Î±Î² or Î³Î´ T cell receptors. We also discuss examples of epigenetic alterations of T cells in autoimmune diseases. DNA methylation and histone acetylation are subject to modification by several classes of 'epigenetic modifiers', some of which are in clinical use or in preclinical development. Therefore, we address the impact of some epigenetic modifiers on T-cell activation and differentiation, and discuss possible synergies with T cell-based immunotherapeutic strategies.",28799233,,10.1111/sji.12589,3,Scandinavian journal of immunology,323767,3.889,0.8590735793113708,0.1939799331103679,0.27424749163879597,0.6090896325366553
Molecular Mechanisms of Epigenetic Regulators as Activatable Targets in Cancer Theranostics,"Epigenetics is defined as somatically inheritable changes that are not accompanied by alterations in DNA sequence. Epigenetics encompasses DNA methylation, covalent histone modifications, non-coding RNA as well as nucleosome remodeling. Notably, abnormal epigenetic changes play a critical role in cancer development including malignant transformation, metastasis, prognosis, drug resistance and tumor recurrence, which can provide effective targets for cancer prognosis, diagnosis and therapy. Understanding these changes provide effective means for cancer diagnosis and druggable targets for better clinical applications. Histone modifications and related enzymes have been found to correlate well with cancer incidence and prognosis in recent years. Dysregulated expression or mutation of histone modification enzymes and histone modification status abnormalities have been considered to play essential roles in tumorigenesis and clinical outcomes of cancer treatment. Some of the histone modification inhibitors have been extensively employed in clinical practice and many others are still under laboratory research or pre-clinical assessment. Here we summarize the important roles of epigenetics, especially histone modifications in cancer diagnostics and therapeutics, and also discuss the developmental implications of activatable epigenetic targets in cancer theranostics.",28933282,,10.2174/0929867324666170921101947,8,Current medicinal chemistry,9440157,4.74,0.8455602526664734,0.4280936454849498,0.4414715719063545,0.681249195078145
Epigenetic alterations in cancer,"Genetic and epigenetic modifications in DNA contribute to altered gene expression in aging and cancer. In human cancers, epigenetic changes such as DNA methylation, histone modifications, micro RNAs and nucleosome remodelling all control gene expression. The link between the genetics and epigenetics in cancer is further shown by existence of aberrant metabolism and biochemical pathways in cancer or mutation in genes that are epigenetic players. Reversal of these epigenetic changes has been clearly shown to have therapeutic value in various forms of lymphoma and preleukemia and similar results are appearing for the treatment of solid tumors. In this review, we discuss the functional effects of epigenetic changes inducible by hypoxia, the epigenetic alterations in cancer and how they contribute to tumor progression and their relevance to epigenetic therapy.",32114424,,10.2741/4847,65,Frontiers in bioscience (Landmark edition),101612996,3.115,0.8357518315315247,0.919732441471572,0.15719063545150502,0.7168357143035302
Role of the N6-methyladenosine RNA mark in gene regulation and its implications on development and disease,"Epigenetics is a field that encompasses chemical modifications of DNA and histone proteins, both of which alter gene expression without changing the underlying nucleotide sequence. DNA methylation and modifications of histone tails have been studied in detail and are now known to be global gene regulatory mechanisms. An analogous post-transcriptional modification is chemical modification of specific nucleotides in RNA. Study of RNA modifications is a nascent field as yet, and the significance of these marks in controlling cell growth and differentiation is just beginning to be appreciated. The addition of a methyl group to adenosine (N-methyl-6-adenosine) or m6A is the most abundant modification in mammalian mRNAs. Though identified four decades ago, interest in this particular modification was set off by the discovery that the obesity gene FTO was an RNA demethylase. Since then, many studies have investigated m6A modification in different species. In this review, we summarize the current literature and hypotheses about the presence and function of this ubiquitous RNA modification in mammals, viruses, yeast and plants in terms of the consensus sequence and the methyltransferase/demethylation machinery identified thus far. We discuss its potential role in regulating molecular and physiological processes in each of these organisms, especially its role in RNA splicing, RNA degradation and development. We also enlist the methodologies developed so far, both locus-specific and transcriptome-wide, to study this modification. Lastly, we discuss whether m6A alterations have consequences on modulating disease aetiology, and speculate about its potential role in cancer.",25305461,,10.1093/bfgp/elu039,42,Briefings in functional genomics,101528229,4.84,0.8125700354576111,0.8528428093645485,0.46153846153846156,0.7504182754551687
"Epigenetics and epigenomics: underlying mechanisms, relevance, and implications in crop improvement","Epigenetics is defined as changes in gene expression that are not associated with changes in DNA sequence but due to the result of methylation of DNA and post-translational modifications to the histones. These epigenetic modifications are known to regulate gene expression by bringing changes in the chromatin state, which underlies plant development and shapes phenotypic plasticity in responses to the environment and internal cues. This review articulates the role of histone modifications and DNA methylation in modulating biotic and abiotic stresses, as well as crop improvement. It also highlights the possibility of engineering epigenomes and epigenome-based predictive models for improving agronomic traits.",33089419,,10.1007/s10142-020-00756-7,14,Functional & integrative genomics,100939343,3.674,0.7908535599708557,0.6187290969899666,0.25418060200668896,0.6490940757818444
"Potential Role of DNA Methylation as a Driver of Plastic Responses to the Environment Across Cells, Organisms, and Populations","There is great interest in exploring epigenetic modifications as drivers of adaptive organismal responses to environmental change. Extending this hypothesis to populations, epigenetically driven plasticity could influence phenotypic changes across environments. The canonical model posits that epigenetic modifications alter gene regulation and subsequently impact phenotypes. We first discuss origins of epigenetic variation in nature, which may arise from genetic variation, spontaneous epimutations, epigenetic drift, or variation in epigenetic capacitors. We then review and synthesize literature addressing three facets of the aforementioned model: (i) causal effects of epigenetic modifications on phenotypic plasticity at the organismal level, (ii) divergence of epigenetic patterns in natural populations distributed across environmental gradients, and (iii) the relationship between environmentally induced epigenetic changes and gene expression at the molecular level. We focus on DNA methylation, the most extensively studied epigenetic modification. We find support for environmentally associated epigenetic structure in populations and selection on stable epigenetic variants, and that inhibition of epigenetic enzymes frequently bears causal effects on plasticity. However, there are pervasive confounding issues in the literature. Effects of chromatin-modifying enzymes on phenotype may be independent of epigenetic marks, alternatively resulting from functions and protein interactions extrinsic of epigenetics. Associations between environmentally induced changes in DNA methylation and expression are strong in plants and mammals but notably absent in invertebrates and nonmammalian vertebrates. Given these challenges, we describe emerging approaches to better investigate how epigenetic modifications affect gene regulation, phenotypic plasticity, and divergence among populations.",38324384,PMC10899001,10.1093/gbe/evae022,0,Genome biology and evolution,101509707,4.065,0.786786675453186,0.0,0.3010033444816054,0.5322726741682328
Epigenomic alterations in cancer: mechanisms and therapeutic potential,"The human cell requires ways to specify its transcriptome without altering the essential sequence of DNA; this is achieved through mechanisms which govern the epigenetic state of DNA and epitranscriptomic state of RNA. These alterations can be found as modified histone proteins, cytosine DNA methylation, non-coding RNAs, and mRNA modifications, such as N6-methyladenosine (m6A). The different aspects of epigenomic and epitranscriptomic modifications require protein complexes to write, read, and erase these chemical alterations. Reflecting these important roles, many of these reader/writer/eraser proteins are either frequently mutated or differentially expressed in cancer. The disruption of epigenetic regulation in the cell can both contribute to cancer initiation and progression, and increase the likelihood of developing resistance to chemotherapies. Development of therapeutics to target proteins involved in epigenomic/epitranscriptomic modifications has been intensive, but further refinement is necessary to achieve ideal treatment outcomes without too many off-target effects for cancer patients. Therefore, further integration of clinical outcomes combined with large-scale genomic analyses is imperative for furthering understanding of epigenomic mechanisms in cancer.",35383835,,10.1042/CS20210449,4,"Clinical science (London, England : 1979)",7905731,6.876,0.7851439118385315,0.25418060200668896,0.6822742474916388,0.6583773170027845
Epigenetic modifications of gene expression by lifestyle and environment,"Epigenetics oftenly described as the heritable changes in gene expression independent of changes in DNA sequence. Various environmental factors such as nutrition-dietary components, lifestyle, exercise, physical activity, toxins, and other contributing factors remodel the genome either in a constructive or detrimental way. Since epigenetic changes are reversible and nutrition is one of the many epigenetic regulators that modify gene expression without changing the DNA sequence, dietary nutrients and bioactive food components contribute to epigenetic phenomena either by directly suppressing DNA methylation or histone catalyzing enzymes or by changing the availability of substrates required for enzymatic reactions. Diets that contain catechol-dominant polyphenols are reported to suppress enzyme activity and activate epigenetically silenced genes. Furthermore, several dietary nutrients play a crucial role in one-carbon metabolism including folate, cobalamin, riboflavin, pyridoxine, and methionine by directly affecting S-adenosyl-L-methionine. Soy polyphenols block DNA methyltransferases and histone deacetylases to reverse aberrant CpG island methylation. Organosulfur rich compounds such as the sulforaphane found in broccoli appear to normalize DNA methylation and activate miR-140 expression, which represses SOX9 and ALDH1 and decreases tumor growth. The purpose of this short communication is to overview the epigenetic regulatory mechanisms of diet and other environmental factors. We discuss the epigenetic contributions of dietary components with a particular focus on nutritional polyphenols and flavonoids as epigenetic mediators that modify epigenetic tags and control gene expression. These mechanisms provide new insights to better understand the influence of dietary nutrients on epigenetic modifications and gene expression.",29043603,,10.1007/s12272-017-0973-3,44,Archives of pharmacal research,8000036,6.01,0.7818307876586914,0.862876254180602,0.5752508361204013,0.7567238906554155
Epigenetic control of gene regulation during development and disease: A view from the retina,"Complex biological processes, such as organogenesis and homeostasis, are stringently regulated by genetic programs that are fine-tuned by epigenetic factors to establish cell fates and/or to respond to the microenvironment. Gene regulatory networks that guide cell differentiation and function are modulated and stabilized by modifications to DNA, RNA and proteins. In this review, we focus on two key epigenetic changes - DNA methylation and histone modifications - and discuss their contribution to retinal development, aging and disease, especially in the context of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and diabetic retinopathy. We highlight less-studied roles of DNA methylation and provide the RNA expression profiles of epigenetic enzymes in human and mouse retina in comparison to other tissues. We also review computational tools and emergent technologies to profile, analyze and integrate epigenetic information. We suggest implementation of editing tools and single-cell technologies to trace and perturb the epigenome for delineating its role in transcriptional regulation. Finally, we present our thoughts on exciting avenues for exploring epigenome in retinal metabolism, disease modeling, and regeneration.",29544768,PMC6054546,10.1016/j.preteyeres.2018.03.002,56,Progress in retinal and eye research,9431859,19.704,0.7769615650177002,0.8929765886287625,0.9565217391304348,0.8360766045624596
Epigenetics: The master control of endothelial cell fate in cancer,"The development of new blood vessels from pre-existing vasculature is called angiogenesis. The growth of tumors depends on a network of supplying vessels that provide them with oxygen and nutrients. Pro-angiogenic factors that are secreted by tumors will trigger the sprouting of nearby existing blood vessels towards themselves and therefore researchers have developed targeted therapy towards these pro-angiogenic proteins to inhibit angiogenesis. However, certain pro-angiogenic proteins tend to bypass the inhibition. Thus, instead of targeting these expressed proteins, research towards angiogenesis inhibition had been focused on a deeper scale, epigenetic modifications. Epigenetic regulatory mechanisms are a heritable change in a sequence of stable but reversible gene function modification yet do not affect the DNA primary sequence directly. Methylation of DNA, modification of histone and silencing of micro-RNA (miRNA)-associated gene are currently considered to initiate and sustain epigenetic changes. Recent findings on the subject matter have provided an insight into the mechanism of epigenetic modifications, thus this review aims to present an update on the latest studies.",31302197,,10.1016/j.lfs.2019.116652,3,Life sciences,375521,6.78,0.776114284992218,0.19732441471571907,0.6722408026755853,0.6395816144735917
Cancer epigenetics: an introduction,"Epigenetic and genetic alterations contribute to cancer initiation and progression. Epigenetics refers to the study of heritable changes in gene expression without alterations in DNA sequences. Epigenetic changes are reversible and include key processes of DNA methylation, chromatin modifications, nucleosome positioning, and alterations in noncoding RNA profiles. Disruptions in epigenetic processes can lead to altered gene function and cellular neoplastic transformation. Epigenetic modifications precede genetic changes and usually occur at an early stage in neoplastic development. Recent technological advances offer a better understanding of the underlying epigenetic alterations during carcinogenesis and provide insight into the discovery of putative epigenetic biomarkers for detection, prognosis, risk assessment, and disease monitoring. In this chapter we provide information on various epigenetic mechanisms and their role in carcinogenesis, in particular, epigenetic modifications causing genetic changes and the potential clinical impact of epigenetic research in the future.",25421652,,10.1007/978-1-4939-1804-1_1,98,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,0.0,0.7754347920417786,0.959866220735786,0.0,0.6572341193722243
Epigenetic Regulation of Vascular Diseases,"Epigenetic regulatory mechanisms, encompassing diverse molecular processes including DNA methylation, histone post-translational modifications, and noncoding RNAs, are essential to numerous processes such as cell differentiation, growth and development, environmental adaptation, aging, and disease states. In many cases, epigenetic changes occur in response to environmental cues and lifestyle factors, resulting in persistent changes in gene expression that affect vascular disease risk during the lifetime of the individual. Biological aging-a powerful cardiovascular risk factor-is partly genetically determined yet strongly influenced by traditional risk factors, reflecting epigenetic modulation. Quantification of specific DNA methylation patterns may serve as an accurate predictor of biological age-a concept known as the epigenetic clock, which could help to refine cardiovascular risk assessment. Epigenetic reprogramming of monocytes rewires cellular immune signaling and induces a metabolic shift toward aerobic glycolysis, thereby increasing innate immune responses. This form of trained epigenetic memory can be maladaptive, thus augmenting vascular inflammation. Somatic mutations in epigenetic regulatory enzymes lead to clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential, a precursor of hematologic malignancies and a recently recognized cardiovascular risk factor; moreover, epigenetic regulators are increasingly being targeted in cancer therapeutics. Thus, understanding epigenetic regulatory mechanisms lies at the intersection between cancer and cardiovascular disease and is of paramount importance to the burgeoning field of cardio-oncology (Graphic Abstract).",31070469,PMC6531339,10.1161/ATVBAHA.119.312193,24,"Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology",9505803,10.514,0.7662936449050903,0.7491638795986622,0.8528428093645485,0.7801775247356963
DNA methylation mediated downregulation of histone H3 variant H3.3 affects cell proliferation contributing to the development of HCC,"Chromatin alterations brought by histone variants and modifications potentially regulate gene transcription from tumor initiation to progression. Histone H3.3 variant is one such epigenetic player important for disease progression and development. Though many studies have implicated H3.3 role in cancer progression and metastasis, its regulation, importance of specific modifications and chaperones have been not understood yet. We report DNA methylation mediated downregulation of histone H3 variant H3.3 in HCC and a concomitant increase in the level of the H3.2 variant. The loss of H3.3 in cancer tissues correlates with a decrease in the histone modifications associated with active transcription like H3K9/K14/K27Ac and H3K4Me3. The ectopic overexpression of H3.3 and H3.2 did not affect global PTMs and cell physiology, probably owing to the deregulation of specific histone chaperones CAF-1 (for H3.2) and HIRA (for H3.3) as observed in HCC tissues. Notably, knockdown of P150, a subunit of CAF-1 leads to a cell cycle arrest in S-phase in a neoplastic rat liver cell line, possibly due to the decrease in the histone levels necessary for DNA packaging. Remarkably, modulation of H3.3 in pre-neoplastic rat liver cells lead to an increase in cell proliferation and a decreased transcription of tumor suppressor genes, recapitulating the tumor cell phenotype. Our data suggests, inhibition of DNA methylation and histone deacetylation leads to the restoration of histone H3 variant expression in tumor cells.",34626773,,10.1016/j.bbadis.2021.166284,4,Biochimica et biophysica acta.

Epigenetics and Precision Oncology,"Epigenetic alterations such as DNA methylation defects and aberrant covalent histone modifications occur within all cancers and are selected for throughout the natural history of tumor formation, with changes being detectable in early onset, progression, and ultimately recurrence and metastasis. The ascertainment and use of these marks to identify at-risk patient populations, refine diagnostic criteria, and provide prognostic and predictive factors to guide treatment decisions are of growing clinical relevance. Furthermore, the targetable nature of epigenetic modifications provides a unique opportunity to alter treatment paradigms and provide new therapeutic options for patients whose malignancies possess these aberrant epigenetic modifications, paving the way for new and personalized medicine. DNA methylation has proven to be of significant clinical utility for its stability and relative ease of testing. The intent of this review is to elaborate upon well-supported examples of epigenetic precision medicine and how the field is moving forward, primarily in the context of aberrant DNA methylation.",28926426,PMC5708865,10.1097/PPO.0000000000000281,46,"Cancer journal (Sudbury, Mass.)",100931981,2.074,0.7643643021583557,0.8695652173913043,0.12374581939799331,0.657280788652873
"Causes, effects, and clinical implications of perturbed patterns within the cancer epigenome","Somatic mutations accumulating over a patient's lifetime are well-defined causative factors that fuel carcinogenesis. It is now clear, however, that epigenomic signature is also largely perturbed in many malignancies. These alterations support the transcriptional program crucial for the acquisition and maintenance of cancer hallmarks. Epigenetic instability may arise due to the genetic mutations or transcriptional deregulation of the proteins implicated in epigenetic signaling. Moreover, external stimulation and physiological aging may also participate in this phenomenon. The epigenomic signature is frequently associated with a cell of origin, as well as with tumor stage and differentiation, which all reflect its high heterogeneity across and within various tumors. Here, we will overview the current understanding of the causes and effects of the altered and heterogeneous epigenomic landscape in cancer. We will focus mainly on DNA methylation and post-translational histone modifications as the key regulatory epigenetic signaling marks. In addition, we will describe how this knowledge is translated into the clinic. We will particularly concentrate on the applicability of epigenetic alterations as biomarkers for improved diagnosis, prognosis, and prediction. Finally, we will also review current developments regarding epi-drug usage in clinical and experimental settings.",33359485,,10.1016/j.semcancer.2020.12.014,8,Seminars in cancer biology,9010218,17.012,0.7595822811126709,0.431438127090301,0.919732441471572,0.7259834823799771
"Epigenetics in cancer development, diagnosis and therapy","Cancer is a dangerous disease and one of the leading causes of death in the world. In 2020, there were nearly 10 million cancer deaths and approximately 20 million new cases. New cases and deaths from cancer are expected to increase further in the coming years. To have a deeper insight into the mechanism of carcinogenesis, epigenetics studies have been published and received much attention from scientists, doctors, and patients. Among alterations in epigenetics, DNA methylation and histone modification are studied by many scientists. They have been reported to be a major contributor in tumor formation and are involved in metastasis. From the understanding of DNA methylation and histone modification, effective, accurate and cost-effective methods for diagnosis and screening of cancer patients have been introduced. Furthermore, therapeutic approaches and drugs targeting altered epigenetics have also been clinically studied and have shown positive results in combating tumor progression. Several cancer drugs that rely on DNA methylation inactivation or histone modification have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of cancer patients. In summary, epigenetics changes such as DNA methylation or histone modification are take part in tumor growth, and they also have great prospect to study diagnostic and therapeutic methods of this dangerous disease.",37225325,,10.1016/bs.pmbts.2023.01.009,1,Progress in molecular biology and translational science,101498165,4.025,0.7550956010818481,0.0802675585284281,0.2842809364548495,0.5259670596457644
Epigenetics in Health and Disease,"Epigenetic mechanisms, which include DNA methylation, histone modification, and microRNA (miRNA), can produce heritable phenotypic changes without a change in DNA sequence. Disruption of gene expression patterns which are governed by epigenetics can result in autoimmune diseases, cancers, and various other maladies. Mechanisms of epigenetics include DNA methylation (and demethylation), histone modifications, and non-coding RNAs such as microRNAs. Compared to numerous studies that have focused on the field of genetics, research on epigenetics is fairly recent. In contrast to genetic changes, which are difficult to reverse, epigenetic aberrations can be pharmaceutically reversible. The emerging tools of epigenetics can be used as preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutic markers. With the development of drugs that target the specific epigenetic mechanisms involved in the regulation of gene expression, development and utilization of epigenetic tools are an appropriate and effective approach that can be clinically applied to the treatment of various diseases.",32445090,,10.1007/978-981-15-3449-2_1,216,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,121103,3.65,0.7547342777252197,0.9899665551839465,0.2140468227424749,0.6936432422204162
(De)Toxifying the Epigenetic Code,"Cells are continuously subjected to an array of reactive/toxic chemical species which are produced both endogenously through metabolic pathways and taken up exogenously by diet and exposure to drugs or toxins. As a result, proteins often undergo non-enzymatic covalent modifications (NECMs) by these species, which can alter protein structure, function, stability, and binding partner affinity. NECMs accumulate over time and are linked to various diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, cancer, and diabetes. In the cellular proteome, histones have some of the longest half-lives, making them prime targets for NECMs. In addition, histones have emerged as key regulators of transcription, a function that is primarily controlled by modification of their tails. These modifications are usually installed or removed enzymatically, but recent evidence suggests that some may also occur non-enzymatically. Despite the vast knowledge detailing the relationship between histone modifications and gene regulation, NECMs on histones remain poorly explored. A major reason for this difference stems from the fact that, unlike their enzymatically installed counterparts, NECMs are difficult to both control and test in vivo. Here, we review advances in our understanding of the effect non-enzymatic covalent modifications (NECMs) have on the epigenetic landscape, cellular fate, and their implications in disease. Cumulatively, this illustrates how the epigenetic code is directly toxified by chemicals and detoxified by corresponding eraser enzymes.",30839196,PMC6583786,10.1021/acs.chemrestox.9b00013,15,Chemical research in toxicology,8807448,3.973,0.7507355809211731,0.6287625418060201,0.2809364548494983,0.6323811478838075
Epigenetic Modifications in Neurological Diseases: Natural Products as Epigenetic Modulators a Treatment Strategy,"Epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation, covalent histone modifications, and small noncoding RNAs, play a key role in regulating the gene expression. This regulatory mechanism is important in cellular differentiation and development. Recent advances in the field of epigenetics extended the role of epigenetic mechanisms in controlling key biological processes such as genome imprinting and X-chromosome inactivation. Aberrant epigenetic modifications are associated with the development of many diseases. The role of epigenetic modifications in various neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington disease, epilepsy, and multiple sclerosis is rapidly emerging. The use of epigenetic modifying drugs to treat these diseases has been the interest in recent years. A number of natural products having diverse mechanism of action are used for drug discovery. For many years, natural compounds have been used to treat various neurodegenerative diseases, but the use of such compounds as epigenetic modulators to reverse or treat neurological diseases are not well studied. In this chapter, we mainly focus on how various epigenetic modifications play a key role in neurodegenerative diseases, their mechanism of action, and how it acts as a potential therapeutic target for epigenetic drugs to treat these diseases will be discussed.",27651245,,10.1007/978-3-319-28383-8_1,4,Advances in neurobiology,101571545,0.0,0.7414869070053101,0.2608695652173913,0.0033444816053511705,0.49773495356773456
"A Summary of the Biological Processes, Disease-Associated Changes, and Clinical Applications of DNA Methylation","DNA methylation at cytosines followed by guanines, CpGs, forms one of the multiple layers of epigenetic mechanisms controlling and modulating gene expression through chromatin structure. It closely interacts with histone modifications and chromatin remodeling complexes to form the local genomic and higher-order chromatin landscape. DNA methylation is essential for proper mammalian development, crucial for imprinting and plays a role in maintaining genomic stability. DNA methylation patterns are susceptible to change in response to environmental stimuli such as diet or toxins, whereby the epigenome seems to be most vulnerable during early life. Changes of DNA methylation levels and patterns have been widely studied in several diseases, especially cancer, where interest has focused on biomarkers for early detection of cancer development, accurate diagnosis, and response to treatment, but have also been shown to occur in many other complex diseases. Recent advances in epigenome engineering technologies allow now for the large-scale assessment of the functional relevance of DNA methylation. As a stable nucleic acid-based modification that is technically easy to handle and which can be analyzed with great reproducibility and accuracy by different laboratories, DNA methylation is a promising biomarker for many applications.",29224136,,10.1007/978-1-4939-7481-8_1,10,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,0.0,0.7403621077537537,0.5050167224080268,0.006688963210702341,0.546558401775998
The landscape of histone modifications in epigenomics since 2020,"Histone proteins are a primary component of chromatin; therefore, any modifications to their structure are anticipated to affect the behavior of our genetic material, which is manifested in the form of phenotypic changes at a molecular, cellular or organic level. The majority of histone modifications are of either methylation or acetylation type that regulate gene expression. Though, not all of these modifications are concerned with the direct regulation of gene transcription. Throughout its 13-year run,Epigenomicshas never ceased to cover these most gripping epigenetic stories, a significant proportion of which is in the matter of histones and their modifications. As such, the current perspective piece is intended to highlight original histone-oriented contributions published inEpigenomicssince 2020.",36710634,,10.2217/epi-2022-0437,4,Epigenomics,101519720,4.357,0.7394223809242249,0.26421404682274247,0.3411371237458194,0.5647236626682473
The Role of Epigenetic Modifications in Human Cancers and the Use of Natural Compounds as Epidrugs: Mechanistic Pathways and Pharmacodynamic Actions,"Cancer is a complex disease resulting from the genetic and epigenetic disruption of normal cells. The mechanistic understanding of the pathways involved in tumor transformation has implicated a priori predominance of epigenetic perturbations and a posteriori genetic instability. In this work, we aimed to explain the mechanistic involvement of epigenetic pathways in the cancer process, as well as the abilities of natural bioactive compounds isolated from medicinal plants (flavonoids, phenolic acids, stilbenes, and ketones) to specifically target the epigenome of tumor cells. The molecular events leading to transformation, angiogenesis, and dissemination are often complex, stochastic, and take turns. On the other hand, the decisive advances in genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics have allowed, in recent years, for the mechanistic decryption of the molecular pathways of the cancerization process. This could explain the possibility of specifically targeting this or that mechanism leading to cancerization. With the plasticity and flexibility of epigenetic modifications, some studies have started the pharmacological screening of natural substances against different epigenetic pathways (DNA methylation, histone acetylation, histone methylation, and chromatin remodeling) to restore the cellular memory lost during tumor transformation. These substances can inhibit DNMTs, modify chromatin remodeling, and adjust histone modifications in favor of pre-established cell identity by the differentiation program. Epidrugs are molecules that target the epigenome program and can therefore restore cell memory in cancerous diseases. Natural products isolated from medicinal plants such as flavonoids and phenolic acids have shown their ability to exhibit several actions on epigenetic modifiers, such as the inhibition of DNMT, HMT, and HAT. The mechanisms of these substances are specific and pleiotropic and can sometimes be stochastic, and their use as anticancer epidrugs is currently a remarkable avenue in the fight against human cancers.",35327559,PMC8945214,10.3390/biom12030367,23,Biomolecules,101596414,6.064,0.739234209060669,0.7391304347826086,0.5852842809364549,0.7084234685802141
"Out of sight, out of mind? Germ cells and the potential impacts of epigenomic drugs","Epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation and histone modifications, determine the way DNA is packaged within the nucleus and regulate cell-specific gene expression. The heritability of these modifications provides a memory of cell identity and function. Common dysregulation of epigenetic modifications in cancer has driven substantial interest in the development of epigenetic modifying drugs. Although these drugs have the potential to be highly beneficial for patients, they act systemically and may have ""off-target"" effects in other cells such as the patients' sperm or eggs. This review discusses the potential for epigenomic drugs to impact on the germline epigenome and subsequent offspring and aims to foster further examination into the possible effects of these drugs on gametes. Ultimately, the information gained by further research may improve the clinical guidelines for the use of such drugs in patients of reproductive age.",30613387,PMC6305226,10.12688/f1000research.15935.1,3,F1000Research,101594320,0.0,0.7301936745643616,0.20066889632107024,0.010033444816053512,0.4802566729660417
[Epigenetics in the genesis and development of cancers],"Cancer is a complex disease caused by the malignant cellular proliferation and metastasis. Elucidating its pathogenic mechanism is one of the major challenges that we face currently. Epigenetic mechanisms are essential for maintaining specific patterns of gene expression and normal development and growth of living individuals. Disorders of epigenetic markers, such as histone modification, DNA/RNA methylation, and changes in the three-dimensional conformation of chromatin, can interfere with gene expression to some extent, and result in cancers. This review provides a brief overview of epigenetics, focusing on their association with the genesis of cancers, and we look forward to the application of epigenetics in cancer clinical diagnosis and treatment.",31307967,,10.16288/j.yczz.19-077,0,Yi chuan = Hereditas,9436478,0.0,0.7293270230293274,0.0033444816053511705,0.013377926421404682,0.44094069542294767
Epigenomic insights into common human disease pathology,"The epigenome-the chemical modifications and chromatin-related packaging of the genome-enables the same genetic template to be activated or repressed in different cellular settings. This multi-layered mechanism facilitates cell-type specific function by setting the local sequence and 3D interactive activity level. Gene transcription is further modulated through the interplay with transcription factors and co-regulators. The human body requires this epigenomic apparatus to be precisely installed throughout development and then adequately maintained during the lifespan. The causal role of the epigenome in human pathology, beyond imprinting disorders and specific tumour suppressor genes, was further brought into the spotlight by large-scale sequencing projects identifying that mutations in epigenomic machinery genes could be critical drivers in both cancer and developmental disorders. Abrogation of this cellular mechanism is providing new molecular insights into pathogenesis. However, deciphering the full breadth and implications of these epigenomic changes remains challenging. Knowledge is accruing regarding disease mechanisms and clinical biomarkers, through pathogenically relevant and surrogate tissue analyses, respectively. Advances include consortia generated cell-type specific reference epigenomes, high-throughput DNA methylome association studies, as well as insights into ageing-related diseases from biological 'clocks' constructed by machine learning algorithms. Also, 3rd-generation sequencing is beginning to disentangle the complexity of genetic and DNA modification haplotypes. Cell-free DNA methylation as a cancer biomarker has clear clinical utility and further potential to assess organ damage across many disorders. Finally, molecular understanding of disease aetiology brings with it the opportunity for exact therapeutic alteration of the epigenome through CRISPR-activation or inhibition.",38602535,PMC11008083,10.1007/s00018-024-05206-2,0,Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS,9705402,9.207,0.7268136143684387,0.006688963210702341,0.8160535117056856,0.6006366636043408
The emerging field of epigenetics in neurodegeneration and neuroprotection,"Epigenetic mechanisms - including DNA methylation, histone post-translational modifications and changes in nucleosome positioning - regulate gene expression, cellular differentiation and development in almost all tissues, including the brain. In adulthood, changes in the epigenome are crucial for higher cognitive functions such as learning and memory. Striking new evidence implicates the dysregulation of epigenetic mechanisms in neurodegenerative disorders and diseases. Although these disorders differ in their underlying causes and pathophysiologies, many involve the dysregulation of restrictive element 1-silencing transcription factor (REST), which acts via epigenetic mechanisms to regulate gene expression. Although not somatically heritable, epigenetic modifications in neurons are dynamic and reversible, which makes them good targets for therapeutic intervention.",28515491,PMC6380351,10.1038/nrn.2017.46,133,Nature reviews.

Epigenetic Regulations in Mammalian Cells: Roles and Profiling Techniques,"The genome is almost identical in all the cells of the body. However, the functions and morphologies of each cell are different, and the factors that determine them are the genes and proteins expressed in the cells. Over the past decades, studies on epigenetic information, such as DNA methylation, histone modifications, chromatin accessibility, and chromatin conformation have shown that these properties play a fundamental role in gene regulation. Furthermore, various diseases such as cancer have been found to be associated with epigenetic mechanisms. In this study, we summarized the biological properties of epigenetics and single-cell epigenomic profiling techniques, and discussed future challenges in the field of epigenetics.",36859473,PMC9982057,10.14348/molcells.2023.0013,4,Molecules and cells,9610936,4.25,0.7122321724891663,0.26755852842809363,0.32441471571906355,0.5457339523229312
"Extrapolating histone marks across developmental stages, tissues, and species: an enhancer prediction case study","Background:Dynamic activation and inactivation of gene regulatory DNA produce the expression changes that drive the differentiation of cellular lineages. Identifying regulatory regions active during developmental transitions is necessary to understand how the genome specifies complex developmental programs and how these processes are disrupted in disease. Gene regulatory dynamics are mediated by many factors, including the binding of transcription factors (TFs) and the methylation and acetylation of DNA and histones. Genome-wide maps of TF binding and DNA and histone modifications have been generated for many cellular contexts; however, given the diversity and complexity of animal development, these data cover only a small fraction of the cellular and developmental contexts of interest. Thus, there is a need for methods that use existing epigenetic and functional genomics data to analyze the thousands of contexts that remain uncharacterized.Results:To investigate the utility of histone modification data in the analysis of cellular contexts without such data, I evaluated how well genome-wide H3K27ac and H3K4me1 data collected in different developmental stages, tissues, and species were able to predict experimentally validated heart enhancers active at embryonic day 11.5 (E11.5) in mouse. Using a machine-learning approach to integrate the data from different contexts, I found that E11.5 heart enhancers can often be predicted accurately from data from other contexts, and I quantified the contribution of each data source to the predictions. The utility of each dataset correlated with nearness in developmental time and tissue to the target context: data from late developmental stages and adult heart tissues were most informative for predicting E11.5 enhancers, while marks from stem cells and early developmental stages were less informative. Predictions based on data collected in non-heart tissues and in human hearts were better than random, but worse than using data from mouse hearts.Conclusions:The ability of these algorithms to accurately predict developmental enhancers based on data from related, but distinct, cellular contexts suggests that combining computational models with epigenetic data sampled from relevant contexts may be sufficient to enable functional characterization of many cellular contexts of interest.",25765133,PMC4342796,10.1186/s12864-015-1264-3,9,BMC genomics,100965258,4.547,0.7109293937683105,0.45819397993311034,0.391304347826087,0.5964573018128257
Implication of epigenetics in pancreas development and disease,"Pancreas development is controlled by a complex interaction of signaling pathways and transcription factor networks that determine pancreatic specification and differentiation of exocrine and endocrine cells. Epigenetics adds a new layer of gene regulation. DNA methylation, histone modifications and non-coding RNAs recently appeared as important epigenetic factors regulating pancreas development. In this review, we report recent findings obtained by analyses in model organisms as well as genome-wide approaches that demonstrate the role of these epigenetic regulators in the control of exocrine and endocrine cell differentiation, identity, function, proliferation and regeneration. We also highlight how altered epigenetic processes contribute to pancreatic disorders: diabetes and pancreatic cancer. Uncovering these epigenetic events can help to better understand these diseases, provide novel therapeutical targets for their treatment, and improve cell-based therapies for diabetes.",26696517,,10.1016/j.beem.2015.10.010,15,Best practice & research.

The DNA methylation landscape in cancer,"As one of the most abundant and well-studied epigenetic modifications, DNA methylation plays an essential role in normal development and cellular biology. Global alterations to the DNA methylation landscape contribute to alterations in the transcriptome and deregulation of cellular pathways. Indeed, improved methods to study DNA methylation patterning and dynamics at base pair resolution and across individual DNA molecules on a genome-wide scale has highlighted the scope of change to the DNA methylation landscape in disease states, particularly during tumorigenesis. More recently has been the development of DNA hydroxymethylation profiling techniques, which allows differentiation between 5mC and 5hmC profiles and provides further insights into DNA methylation dynamics and remodeling in tumorigenesis. In this review, we describe the distribution of DNA methylation and DNA hydroxymethylation in different genomic contexts, first in normal cells, and how this is altered in cancer. Finally, we discuss DNA methylation profiling technologies and the most recent advances in single-cell methods, bisulfite-free approaches and ultra-long read sequencing techniques.",31845735,PMC6923322,10.1042/EBC20190037,121,Essays in biochemistry,43306,7.258,0.704871654510498,0.9665551839464883,0.705685618729097,0.7573711532414158
The promise of epigenetic therapy: reprogramming the cancer epigenome,"Epigenetics refers to heritable molecular determinants of phenotype independent of DNA sequence. Epigenetic features include DNA methylation, histone modifications, non-coding RNAs, and chromatin structure. The epigenetic status of cells plays a crucial role in determining their differentiation state and proper function within multicellular organisms. Disruption of these processes is now understood to be a major contributor to cancer development and progression, and recent efforts have attempted to pharmacologically reverse such altered epigenetics. In this mini-review we introduce the concept of epigenetic drivers of cancer and discuss how aberrant DNA methylation, histone modifications, and chromatin states are being targeted using drugs either in preclinical, or clinical development, and how they fit in the context of existing therapies.",28412585,,10.1016/j.gde.2017.03.015,76,Current opinion in genetics & development,9111375,4.665,0.7041600942611694,0.9297658862876255,0.43478260869565216,0.6954057555533572
Epigenetics and pharmacology,"Recent advances in the understanding of gene regulation have shown there to be much more regulation of the genome than first thought, through epigenetic mechanisms. These epigenetic mechanisms are systems that have evolved to either switch off gene activity altogether, or fine-tune any existing genetic activation. Such systems are present in all genes and include chromatin modifications and remodelling, DNA methylation (such as CpG island methylation rates) and histone covalent modifications (e.g. acetylation, methylation), RNA interference by short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). These systems regulate genomic activity 'beyond' simple transcriptional factor inducer or repressor function of genes to generate mRNA. Epigenetic regulation of gene activity has been shown to be important in maintaining normal phenotypic activity of cells, as well as having a role in development and diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's. Newer classes of drugs regulate epigenetic mechanisms to counteract disease states in humans. The reports in this issue describe some advances in epigenetic understanding that relate to human disease, and our ability to control these mechanisms by pharmacological means. Increasingly the importance of epigenetics is being uncovered - it is pharmacology that will have to keep pace.",25966315,PMC4439868,10.1111/bph.13136,9,British journal of pharmacology,7502536,9.473,0.7014064192771912,0.46153846153846156,0.8327759197324415,0.6797067278204953
Cell-type-specific epigenetic effects of early life stress on the brain,"Early life stress (ELS) induces long-term phenotypic adaptations that contribute to increased vulnerability to a host of neuropsychiatric disorders. Epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation, histone modifications and non-coding RNA, are a proposed link between environmental stressors, alterations in gene expression, and phenotypes. Epigenetic modifications play a primary role in shaping functional differences between cell types and can be modified by environmental perturbations, especially in early development. Together with contributions from genetic variation, epigenetic mechanisms orchestrate patterns of gene expression within specific cell types that contribute to phenotypic variation between individuals. To date, many studies have provided insights into epigenetic changes resulting from ELS. However, most of these studies have examined heterogenous brain tissue, despite evidence of cell-type-specific epigenetic modifications in phenotypes associated with ELS. In this review, we focus on rodent and human studies that have examined epigenetic modifications induced by ELS in select cell types isolated from the brain or associated with genes that have cell-type-restricted expression in neurons, microglia, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. Although significant challenges remain, future studies using these approaches can enable important mechanistic insight into the role of epigenetic variation in the effects of ELS on brain function.",35948532,PMC9365848,10.1038/s41398-022-02076-9,12,Translational psychiatry,101562664,7.989,0.700894832611084,0.5819397993311036,0.7558528428093646,0.688095427994744
"Methyl Group Metabolism in Differentiation, Aging, and Cancer","Methyl group metabolism belongs to a relatively understudied field of research. Its importance lies in the fact that methyl group metabolic pathways are crucial for the successful conversion of dietary nutrients into the basic building blocks to carry out any cellular methylation reaction. Methyl groups play essential roles in numerous cellular functions such as DNA methylation, nucleotide- and protein biosynthesis. Especially, DNA methylation is responsible for organizing the genome into transcriptionally silent and active regions. Ultimately, it is this proper annotation that determines the quality of expression patterns required to ensure and shape the phenotypic integrity and function of a highly specialized cell type. Life is characterized by constantly changing environmental conditions, which are addressed by changes in DNA methylation. This relationship is increasingly coming into focus as it is of fundamental importance for differentiation, aging, and cancer. The stability and permanence of these metabolic processes, fueling the supplementation of methyl groups, seem to be important criteria to prevent deficiencies and erosion of the methylome. Alterations in the metabolic processes can lead to epigenetic and genetic perturbations, causative for diverse disorders, accelerated aging, and various age-related diseases. In recent decades, the intake of methyl group compounds has changed significantly due to, e.g., environmental pollution and food additives. Based on the current knowledge, this review provides a brief overview of the highly interconnected relationship between nutrition, metabolism, changes in epigenetic modifications, cancer, and aging. One goal is to provide an impetus to additionally investigate changes in DNA methylation as a possible consequence of an impaired methyl group metabolism.",35955511,PMC9369357,10.3390/ijms23158378,2,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,6.208,0.6887825131416321,0.14715719063545152,0.5886287625418061,0.5604266985204307
"The interaction between epigenetics, nutrition and the development of cancer","Unlike the genome, the epigenome can be modified and hence some epigenetic risk markers have the potential to be reversed. Such modifications take place by means of drugs, diet or environmental exposures. It is widely accepted that epigenetic modifications take place during early embryonic and primordial cell development, but it is also important that we gain an understanding of the potential for such changes later in life. These ""later life"" epigenetic modifications in response to dietary intervention are the focus of this paper. The epigenetic modifications investigated include DNA methylation, histone modifications and the influence of microRNAs. The epigenotype could be used not only to predict susceptibility to certain cancers but also to assess the effectiveness of dietary modifications to reduce such risk. The influence of diet or dietary components on epigenetic modifications and the impact on cancer initiation or progression has been assessed herein.",25647662,PMC4344568,10.3390/nu7020922,62,Nutrients,101521595,6.706,0.6836307048797607,0.9063545150501672,0.6688963210702341,0.7252285901519367
Epigenetic aspects of DC development and differentiation,"In this review we introduce the basic principles of epigenetic gene regulation and discuss them in the context of dendritic cell (DC) development and differentiation. Epigenetic mechanisms control the accessibility of chromatin for DNA binding proteins and thus they control gene expression. These mechanisms comprise chemical modifications of DNA and histones, chromatin remodeling and chromatin conformation. The variety of epigenetic mechanisms allow high-end fine tuning and flexibility of gene expression, a prerequisite in the process of DC lineage development.",33126080,,10.1016/j.molimm.2020.10.011,4,Molecular immunology,7905289,4.174,0.6833138465881348,0.2709030100334448,0.3177257525083612,0.527714060461242
Laboratory methods to decipher epigenetic signatures: a comparative review,"Epigenetics refers to nucleotide sequence-independent events, and heritable changes, including DNA methylation and histone modification (as the two main processes), contributing to the phenotypic features of the cell. Both genetics and epigenetics contribute to determining the outcome of regulatory gene expression systems. Indeed, the flexibility of epigenetic effects and stability of genetic coding lead to gene regulation complexity in response signals. Since some epigenetic changes are significant in abnormalities such as cancers and neurodegenerative diseases, the initial changes, dynamic and reversible properties, and diagnostic potential of epigenomic phenomena are subject to epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) for therapeutic aims. Based on recent studies, methodological developments are necessary to improve epigenetic research. As a result, several methods have been developed to explore epigenetic alterations at low, medium, and high scales, focusing on DNA methylation and histone modification detection. In this research field, bisulfite-, enzyme sensitivity- and antibody specificity-based techniques are used for DNA methylation, whereas histone modifications are gained based on antibody recognition. This review provides a mechanism-based understanding and comparative overview of the most common techniques for detecting the status of epigenetic effects, including DNA methylation and histone modifications, for applicable approaches from low- to high-throughput scales.",34763654,PMC8582164,10.1186/s11658-021-00290-9,5,Cellular & molecular biology letters,9607427,8.702,0.6826795339584351,0.3076923076923077,0.7792642140468228,0.6269990247228872
Epigenetic modifications in neuropathic pain,"Neuropathic pain (NP) is a common symptom in many diseases of the somatosensory nervous system, which severely affects the patient's quality of life. Epigenetics are heritable alterations in gene expression that do not cause permanent changes in the DNA sequence. Epigenetic modifications can affect gene expression and function and can also mediate crosstalk between genes and the environment. Increasing evidence shows that epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation, histone modification, non-coding RNA, and RNA modification, are involved in the development and maintenance of NP. In this review, we focus on the current knowledge of epigenetic modifications in the development and maintenance of NP. Then, we illustrate different facets of epigenetic modifications that regulate gene expression and their crosstalk. Finally, we discuss the burgeoning evidence supporting the potential of emerging epigenetic therapies, which has been valuable in understanding mechanisms and offers novel and potent targets for NP therapy.",34823400,PMC8647219,10.1177/17448069211056767,10,Molecular pain,101242662,3.37,0.6826795339584351,0.5083612040133779,0.18394648829431437,0.5480692588365995
Viral epigenetics,"DNA tumor viruses including members of the polyomavirus, adenovirus, papillomavirus, and herpes virus families are presently the subject of intense interest with respect to the role that epigenetics plays in control of the virus life cycle and the transformation of a normal cell to a cancer cell. To date, these studies have primarily focused on the role of histone modification, nucleosome location, and DNA methylation in regulating the biological consequences of infection. Using a wide variety of strategies and techniques ranging from simple ChIP to ChIP-chip and ChIP-seq to identify histone modifications, nuclease digestion to genome wide next generation sequencing to identify nucleosome location, and bisulfite treatment to MeDIP to identify DNA methylation sites, the epigenetic regulation of these viruses is slowly becoming better understood. While the viruses may differ in significant ways from each other and cellular chromatin, the role of epigenetics appears to be relatively similar. Within the viral genome nucleosomes are organized for the expression of appropriate genes with relevant histone modifications particularly histone acetylation. DNA methylation occurs as part of the typical gene silencing during latent infection by herpesviruses. In the simple tumor viruses like the polyomaviruses, adenoviruses, and papillomaviruses, transformation of the cell occurs via integration of the virus genome such that the virus's normal regulation is disrupted. This results in the unregulated expression of critical viral genes capable of redirecting cellular gene expression. The redirected cellular expression is a consequence of either indirect epigenetic regulation where cellular signaling or transcriptional dysregulation occurs or direct epigenetic regulation where epigenetic cofactors such as histone deacetylases are targeted. In the more complex herpersviruses transformation is a consequence of the expression of the viral latency proteins and RNAs which again can have either a direct or indirect effect on epigenetic regulation of cellular expression. Nevertheless, many questions still remain with respect to the specific mechanisms underlying epigenetic regulation of the viruses and transformation.",25421681,PMC4478594,10.1007/978-1-4939-1804-1_30,32,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,0.0,0.6814088821411133,0.802675585284281,0.020066889632107024,0.5733938242679455
Insights from epigenetic studies on human health and evolution,"Epigenetic variation represents a unique aspect of human biological variation that can shed light on our evolutionary history as well as the etiology of human disease. DNA methylation is the most commonly studied type of epigenetic modification and can alter gene expression without changing the underlying DNA sequence. DNA methylation occurs throughout all living organisms although its function seems to have evolved from genome defense in fungi, bacteria and plants to a more complex role in gene regulation and cellular differentiation in animals. Human DNA methylation was originally studied in imprinting diseases and cancer, but more recently has been investigated as a mechanism to mediate the impact of environmental and psychosocial stressors on human health and disease.",30015224,,10.1016/j.gde.2018.06.008,8,Current opinion in genetics & development,9111375,4.665,0.6806663870811462,0.43478260869565216,0.43812709030100333,0.5829817720480188
Bioinformatic tools for DNA methylation and histone modification: A survey,"Epigenetic inheritance occurs due to different mechanisms such as chromatin and histone modifications, DNA methylation and processes mediated by non-coding RNAs. It leads to changes in gene expressions and the emergence of new traits in different organisms in many diseases such as cancer. Recent advances in experimental methods led to the identification of epigenetic target sites in various organisms. Computational approaches have enabled us to analyze mass data produced by these methods. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods have been broadly used to identify these target sites and their patterns. By using these patterns, the emergence of diseases could be prognosticated. In this study, target site prediction tools for two major epigenetic mechanisms comprising histone modification and DNA methylation are reviewed. Publicly accessible databases are reviewed as well. Some suggestions regarding the state-of-the-art methods and databases have been made, including examining patterns of epigenetic changes that are important in epigenotypes detection.",33677056,,10.1016/j.ygeno.2021.03.004,6,Genomics,8800135,4.31,0.6756575703620911,0.35785953177257523,0.33444816053511706,0.5438560806787931
Epigenomics in stress tolerance of plants under the climate change,"Background:Climate change has had a tremendous impact on the environment in general as well as agricultural crops grown in these situations as time passed. Agricultural production of crops is less suited and of lower quality due to disturbances in plant metabolism brought on by sensitivity to environmental stresses, which are brought on by climate change. Abiotic stressors that are specific to climate change, including as drought, extremes in temperature, increasing CO2, waterlogging from heavy rain, metal toxicity, and pH changes, are known to negatively affect an array of species. Plants adapt to these challenges by undergoing genome-wide epigenetic changes, which are frequently accompanied by differences in transcriptional gene expression. The sum of a cell's biochemical modifications to its nuclear DNA, post-translational modifications to histones, and variations in the synthesis of non-coding RNAs is called an epigenome. These modifications frequently lead to variations in gene expression that occur without any alteration in the underlying base sequence.Epigenetic mechanisms and marks:The methylation of homologous loci by three different modifications-genomic (DNA methylation), chromatin (histone modifications), and RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM)-could be regarded as epigenetic mechanisms that control the regulation of differential gene expression. Stresses from the environment cause chromatin remodelling, which enables plant cells to adjust their expression patterns temporarily or permanently. EPIGENOMICS' CONSEQUENCES FOR GENOME STABILITY AND GENE EXPRESSION: DNA methylation affects gene expression in response to abiotic stressors by blocking or suppressing transcription. Environmental stimuli cause changes in DNA methylation levels, either upward in the case of hypermethylation or downward in the case of hypomethylation. The type of stress response that occurs as a result also affects the degree of DNA methylation alterations. Stress is also influenced by DRM2 and CMT3 methylating CNN, CNG, and CG. Both plant development and stress reactions depend on histone changes. Gene up-regulation is associated with histone tail phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and acetylation, while gene down-regulation is associated with de-acetylation and biotinylation. Plants undergo a variety of dynamic changes to histone tails in response to abiotic stressors. The relevance of these transcripts against stress is highlighted by the accumulation of numerous additional antisense transcripts, a source of siRNAs, caused by abiotic stresses. The study highlights the finding that plants can be protected from a range of abiotic stresses by epigenetic mechanisms such DNA methylation, histone modification, and RNA-directed DNA methylation. TRANSGENERATIONAL INHERITANCE AND SOURCES OF EPIGENETIC VARIATION: Stress results in the formation of epialleles, which are either transient or enduring epigenetic stress memory in plants. After the stress is gone, the stable memory is kept for the duration of the plant's remaining developmental cycles or passed on to the next generations, leading to plant evolution and adaptability. The bulk of epigenetic changes brought on by stress are temporary and return to normal after the stress has passed. Some of the modifications, however, might be long-lasting and transmitted across mitotic or even meiotic cell divisions. Epialleles often have genetic or non-genetic causes. Epialleles can arise spontaneously due to improper methylation state maintenance, short RNA off-target effects, or other non-genetic causes. Developmental or environmental variables that influence the stability of epigenetic states or direct chromatin modifications may also be non-genetic drivers of epigenetic variation. Transposon insertions that change local chromatin and structural rearrangements, such copy number changes that are genetically related or unrelated, are two genetic sources of epialleles.Epigenomics in crop improvement:To include epigenetics into crop breeding, it is necessary to create epigenetic variation as well as to identify and evaluate epialleles. Epigenome editing or epi-genomic selection may be required for epiallele creation and identification. In order to combat the challenges given by changing environments, these epigenetic mechanisms have generated novel epialleles that can be exploited to develop new crop types that are more climate-resilient. Numerous techniques can be used to alter the epigenome generally or at specific target loci in order to induce the epigenetic alterations necessary for crop development. Technologies like CRISPR/Cas9 and dCas, which have recently advanced, have opened up new avenues for the study of epigenetics. Epialleles could be employed in epigenomics-assisted breeding in addition to sequence-based markers for crop breeding.Conclusions and future prospectus:A few of the exciting questions that still need to be resolved in the area of heritable epigenetic variation include a better understanding of the epigenetic foundation of characteristics, the stability and heritability of epialleles, and the sources of epigenetic variation in crops. Investigating long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) as an epigenetic process might open up a new path to understanding crop plant's ability to withstand abiotic stress. For many of these technologies and approaches to be more applicable and deployable at a lower cost, technological breakthroughs will also be necessary. Breeders will probably need to pay closer attention to crop epialleles and how they can affect future responses to climate changes. The development of epialleles suitable for particular environmental circumstances may be made possible by creating targeted epigenetic changes in pertinent genes and by comprehending the molecular underpinnings of trans generational epigenetic inheritance. More research on a wider variety of plant species is required in order to fully comprehend the mechanisms that produce and stabilise epigenetic variation in crops. In addition to a collaborative and multidisciplinary effort by researchers in many fields of plant science, this will require a greater integration of the epigenomic data gathered in many crops. Before it may be applied generally, more study is required.",37294468,,10.1007/s11033-023-08539-6,2,Molecular biology reports,403234,2.742,0.6717936396598816,0.1505016722408027,0.13712374581939799,0.46060126740796914
DNA Methylation and Histone Modification in Hypertension,"Systemic hypertension, which eventually results in heart failure, renal failure or stroke, is a common chronic human disorder that particularly affects elders. Although many signaling pathways involved in the development of hypertension have been reported over the past decades, which has led to the implementation of a wide variety of anti-hypertensive therapies, one half of all hypertensive patients still do not have their blood pressure controlled. The frontier in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying hypertension has now advanced to the level of epigenomics. Particularly, increasing evidence is emerging that DNA methylation and histone modifications play an important role in gene regulation and are involved in alteration of the phenotype and function of vascular cells in response to environmental stresses. This review seeks to highlight the recent advances in our knowledge of the epigenetic regulations and mechanisms of hypertension, focusing on the role of DNA methylation and histone modification in the vascular wall. A better understanding of the epigenomic regulation in the hypertensive vessel may lead to the identification of novel target molecules that, in turn, may lead to novel drug discoveries for the treatment of hypertension.",29649151,PMC5979462,10.3390/ijms19041174,48,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,6.208,0.6693127155303955,0.8762541806020067,0.5919732441471572,0.69523311426807
Metabolic reprogramming and epigenetic modifications on the path to cancer,"Metabolic rewiring and epigenetic remodeling, which are closely linked and reciprocally regulate each other, are among the well-known cancer hallmarks. Recent evidence suggests that many metabolites serve as substrates or cofactors of chromatin-modifying enzymes as a consequence of the translocation or spatial regionalization of enzymes or metabolites. Various metabolic alterations and epigenetic modifications also reportedly drive immune escape or impede immunosurveillance within certain contexts, playing important roles in tumor progression. In this review, we focus on how metabolic reprogramming of tumor cells and immune cells reshapes epigenetic alterations, in particular the acetylation and methylation of histone proteins and DNA. We also discuss other eminent metabolic modifications such as, succinylation, hydroxybutyrylation, and lactylation, and update the current advances in metabolism- and epigenetic modification-based therapeutic prospects in cancer.",34050894,PMC9243210,10.1007/s13238-021-00846-7,140,Protein & cell,101532368,15.328,0.6676896214485168,0.9765886287625418,0.9130434782608695,0.7785401942737924
A review of epigenetic changes in asthma: methylation and acetylation,"Several studies show that childhood and adulthood asthma and its symptoms can be modulated through epigenetic modifications. Epigenetic changes are inheritable modifications that can modify the gene expression without changing the DNA sequence. The most common epigenetic alternations consist of DNA methylation and histone modifications. How these changes lead to asthmatic phenotype or promote the asthma features, in particular by immune pathways regulation, is an understudied topic. Since external effects, like exposure to tobacco smoke, air pollution, and drugs, influence both asthma development and the epigenome, elucidating the role of epigenetic changes in asthma is of great importance. This review presents available evidence on the epigenetic process that drives asthma genes and pathways, with a particular focus on DNA methylation, histone methylation, and acetylation. We gathered and assessed studies conducted in this field over the past two decades. Our study examined asthma in different aspects and also shed light on the limitations and the important factors involved in the outcomes of the studies. To date, most of the studies in this area have been carried out on DNA methylation. Therefore, the need for diagnostic and therapeutic applications through this molecular process calls for more research on the histone modifications in this disease.",33781317,PMC8008616,10.1186/s13148-021-01049-x,19,Clinical epigenetics,101516977,7.259,0.6568784117698669,0.68561872909699,0.7123745819397993,0.6737257092692779
[Lung cancer and epigenetic modifications],"Epigenetic alterations, including DNA methylation, histone modifications, and noncoding RNA expression, have been reported to play a major role in the genesis of lung cancer. DNA methylation, histone modifications, and RNA expression are epigenetic markers in assesment of early detection, prognosis and evaluation of treatment of lung cancer. In this rewiev we summarize the common epigenetic changes associated with lung cancer to give some clarity to its etiology, and to provide an overview of the potential translational applications of these changes, including applications for early detection, diagnosis, prognostication, and therapeutics.",27481083,,10.5578/tt.10231,10,Tuberkuloz ve toraks,417364,0.0,0.6553360223770142,0.5117056856187291,0.023411371237458192,0.500225024797446
Cellular reprogramming technology for dissecting cancer epigenome in vivo,"Decades of studies have shown that epigenetic alterations play a significant role on cancer development both in vitro and in vivo. However, considering that many cancers harbor mutations at epigenetic modifier genes and that transcription factor-mediated gene regulations are tightly coupled with epigenetic modifications, the majority of epigenetic alterations in cancers could be the consequence of the dysfunction or dysregulation of epigenetic modifiers caused by genetic abnormalities. Therefore, it remains unclear whether bona fide epigenetic abnormalities have causal roles on cancer development. Reprogramming technologies enable us to actively alter epigenetic regulations while preserving genomic information. Taking advantage, recent studies have provided in vivo evidence for the significant impact of epigenetic abnormalities on the initiation, maintenance and progression of cancer cells.",28651445,,10.2217/epi-2017-0018,3,Epigenomics,101519720,4.357,0.654342770576477,0.2040133779264214,0.34448160535117056,0.5023046590014046
New Promises to Cure Cancer and Other Genetic Diseases/Disorders: Epi-drugs Through Epigenetics,"All the heritable alterations in gene expression and chromatin structure due to chemical modifications that do not involve changes in the primary gene nucleotide sequence are referred to as epigenetics. DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNAs are distinct types of epigenetic inheritance. Epigenetic patterns have been linked to the developmental stages, environmental exposure, and diet. Therapeutic strategies are now being developed to target human diseases such as cancer with mutations in epigenetic regulatory genes using specific inhibitors. Within the past two decades, seven epigenetic drugs have received regulatory approval and many others show their candidature in clinical trials. The current article represents a review of epigenetic heritance, diseases connected with epigenetic alterations and regulatory approved epigenetic drugs as future medicines.",31161992,,10.2174/1568026619666190603094439,1,Current topics in medicinal chemistry,101119673,3.57,0.6534587144851685,0.08361204013377926,0.19732441471571907,0.4482625196610008
Targeting the epigenetic regulation of antitumour immunity,"Dysregulation of the epigenome drives aberrant transcriptional programmes that promote cancer onset and progression. Although defective gene regulation often affects oncogenic and tumour-suppressor networks, tumour immunogenicity and immune cells involved in antitumour responses may also be affected by epigenomic alterations. This could have important implications for the development and application of both epigenetic therapies and cancer immunotherapies, and combinations thereof. Here, we review the role of key aberrant epigenetic processes - DNA methylation and post-translational modification of histones - in tumour immunogenicity, as well as the effects of epigenetic modulation on antitumour immune cell function. We emphasize opportunities for small-molecule inhibitors of epigenetic regulators to enhance antitumour immune responses, and discuss the challenges of exploiting the complex interplay between cancer epigenetics and cancer immunology to develop treatment regimens combining epigenetic therapies with immunotherapies.",32929243,,10.1038/s41573-020-0077-5,170,Nature reviews.

Epigenetic approaches in glioblastoma multiforme and their implication in screening and diagnosis,"Epigenetic modifications have been reported in a number of non-germ-line tumor types. Epigenetic modifications to the genome, especially DNA methylation and histone modifications, affect gene expression causing increased risk for cancers and other diseases. We have summarized information about DNA methylation percentages in Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) line HTB-12, alveolar cell carcinoma, and acute lymphocytic leukemia samples and determined H3 (K27) methyltransferase activity in GBM and leukemia cells and made comparisons to H3 (K27) methyltransferase activity in normal astrocyte, lung, and lymphocyte cells. GBM and alveolar cell carcinoma gDNA possessed lower gDNA methylation percentages compared to normal cells. Methyl-sensitive cut counting analysis (MSCC) showed fold decreases in GBM CpG methylation sites for genes PBK, KIF23, COL6A3, and LOX. There was no significant difference in CpG DNA methylation, but less histone methyltransferase activity in acute lymphocytic leukemia compared to normal cells. GBM possessed increased histone methyltransferase activity compared to normal samples. Challenges in the field in diagnosis and prognosis for cancer risk especially with regard to the results of this work are discussed.",25421677,,10.1007/978-1-4939-1804-1_26,5,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,0.0,0.6457903385162354,0.3110367892976589,0.026755852842809364,0.45503273153783486
Chemistry-Driven Epigenetic Investigation of Histone and DNA Modifications,"In the regulation processes of gene expression, genomic DNA and nuclear proteins, including histone proteins, cooperate with each other, leading to the distinctive functions of eukaryotic cells such as pluripotency and differentiation. Chemical modification of histone proteins and DNA has been revealed as one of the major driving forces in the complicated epigenetic regulation system. However, understanding of the precise molecular mechanisms is still limited. To address this issue, researchers have proposed both biological and chemical strategies for the preparation and detection of modified proteins and nucleic acids. In this review, we focus on chemical methods around the field of epigenetics. Chemical protein synthesis has enabled the preparation of site-specifically modified histones and their successful application to various in vitro assays, which have emphasized the significance of posttranslational modifications of interest. We also review the modification-specific chemical reactions against synthetic and genomic DNA, which enabled discrimination of several modified bases at single-base resolution.",30070422,,10.1002/tcr.201800040,6,"Chemical record (New York, N.Y.)",101085550,6.935,0.6451199054718018,0.3612040133779264,0.68561872909699,0.5964364917780642
Epigenetic and Genetic Contributions to Adaptation in Chlamydomonas,"Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation or histone modifications, can be transmitted between cellular or organismal generations. However, there are no experiments measuring their role in adaptation, so here we use experimental evolution to investigate how epigenetic variation can contribute to adaptation. We manipulated DNA methylation and histone acetylation in the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii both genetically and chemically to change the amount of epigenetic variation generated or transmitted in adapting populations in three different environments (salt stress, phosphate starvation, and high CO2) for two hundred asexual generations. We find that reducing the amount of epigenetic variation available to populations can reduce adaptation in environments where it otherwise happens. From genomic and epigenomic sequences from a subset of the populations, we see changes in methylation patterns between the evolved populations over-represented in some functional categories of genes, which is consistent with some of these differences being adaptive. Based on whole genome sequencing of evolved clones, the majority of DNA methylation changes do not appear to be linked to cis-acting genetic mutations. Our results show that transgenerational epigenetic effects play a role in adaptive evolution, and suggest that the relationship between changes in methylation patterns and differences in evolutionary outcomes, at least for quantitative traits such as cell division rates, is complex.",28535256,,10.1093/molbev/msx166,34,Molecular biology and evolution,8501455,8.8,0.6448963284492493,0.8127090301003345,0.802675585284281,0.7100147201464726
Epigenetic mechanisms underlying nervous system diseases,"Epigenetic mechanisms act as control systems for modulating genomic structure and activity in response to evolving profiles of cell-extrinsic, cell-cell, and cell-intrinsic signals. These dynamic processes are responsible for mediating cell- and tissue-specific gene expression and function and gene-gene and gene-environmental interactions. The major epigenetic mechanisms include DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation; histone protein posttranslational modifications, nucleosome remodeling/repositioning, and higher-order chromatin reorganization; noncoding RNA regulation; and RNA editing. These mechanisms are intimately involved in executing fundamental genomic programs, including gene transcription, posttranscriptional RNA processing and transport, translation, X-chromosome inactivation, genomic imprinting, retrotransposon regulation, DNA replication, and DNA repair and the maintenance of genomic stability. For the nervous system, epigenetics offers a novel and robust framework for explaining how brain development and aging occur, neural cellular diversity is generated, synaptic and neural network connectivity and plasticity are mediated, and complex cognitive and behavioral phenotypes are inherited transgenerationally. Epigenetic factors and processes are, not surprisingly, implicated in nervous system disease pathophysiology through several emerging paradigms - mutations and genetic variation in genes encoding epigenetic factors; impairments in epigenetic factor expression, localization, and function; epigenetic mechanisms modulating disease-associated factors and pathways; and the presence of deregulated epigenetic profiles in central and peripheral tissues.",29325627,PMC6822391,10.1016/B978-0-444-63233-3.00005-1,26,Handbook of clinical neurology,166161,0.0,0.6441131830215454,0.7792642140468228,0.030100334448160536,0.5483408195119239
Regulation of Gene Expression and the Elucidative Role of CRISPR-Based Epigenetic Modifiers and CRISPR-Induced Chromosome Conformational Changes,"In complex multicellular systems, gene expression is regulated at multiple stages through interconnected complex molecular pathways and regulatory networks. Transcription is the first step in gene expression and is subject to multiple layers of regulation in which epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation, histone tail modifications, and chromosomal conformation play an essential role. In recent years, CRISPR-Cas9 systems have been employed to unearth this complexity and provide new insights on the contribution of chromatin dysregulation in the development of genetic diseases, as well as new tools to prevent or reverse this dysregulation. In this review, we outline the recent development of a variety of CRISPR-based epigenetic editors for targeted DNA methylation/demethylation, histone modification, and three-dimensional DNA conformational change, highlighting their relative performance and impact on gene regulation. Finally, we provide insights on the future developments aimed to accelerate our understanding of the causal relationship between epigenetic marks, genome organization, and gene regulation.",33616442,,10.1089/crispr.2020.0108,3,The CRISPR journal,101738191,4.321,0.6435533165931702,0.20735785953177258,0.3377926421404682,0.49516209029035024
The Role of Epigenetics in the Regulation of Hemostatic Balance,"Epigenetics, a term conventionally used to explain the intricate interplay between genes and the environment, is now regarded as the fundament of developmental biology. Several lines of evidence garnered over the past decades suggest that epigenetic alterations, mostly encompassing DNA methylation, histone tail modifications, and generation of microRNAs, play an important, though still incompletely explored, role in both primary and secondary hemostasis. Epigenetic variations may interplay with platelet functions and their responsiveness to antiplatelet drugs, and they may also exert a substantial contribution in modulating the production and release into the bloodstream of proteins involved in blood coagulation and fibrinolysis. This emerging evidence may have substantial biological and clinical implications. An enhanced understanding of posttranscriptional mechanisms would help to clarify some remaining enigmatic issues in primary and secondary hemostasis, which cannot be thoughtfully explained by genetics or biochemistry alone. Increased understanding would also pave the way to developing innovative tests for better assessment of individual risk of bleeding or thrombosis. The accurate recognition of key epigenetic mechanisms in hemostasis would then contribute to identify new putative therapeutic targets, and develop innovative agents that could be helpful for preventing or managing a vast array of hemostasis disturbances.",33368118,,10.1055/s-0040-1718400,4,Seminars in thrombosis and hemostasis,431155,6.398,0.6408606171607971,0.27424749163879597,0.6454849498327759,0.5684628585907927
Genome-wide analysis of epigenetic dynamics across human developmental stages and tissues,"Background:Epigenome is highly dynamic during the early stages of embryonic development. Epigenetic modifications provide the necessary regulation for lineage specification and enable the maintenance of cellular identity. Given the rapid accumulation of genome-wide epigenomic modification maps across cellular differentiation process, there is an urgent need to characterize epigenetic dynamics and reveal their impacts on differential gene regulation.Methods:We proposed DiffEM, a computational method for differential analysis of epigenetic modifications and identified highly dynamic modification sites along cellular differentiation process. We applied this approach to investigating 6 epigenetic marks of 20 kinds of human early developmental stages and tissues, including hESCs, 4 hESC-derived lineages and 15 human primary tissues.Results:We identified highly dynamic modification sites where different cell types exhibit distinctive modification patterns, and found that these highly dynamic sites enriched in the genes related to cellular development and differentiation. Further, to evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we correlated the dynamics scores of epigenetic modifications with the variance of gene expression, and compared the results of our method with those of the existing algorithms. The comparison results demonstrate the power of our method in evaluating the epigenetic dynamics and identifying highly dynamic regions along cell differentiation process.",30967107,PMC6457072,10.1186/s12864-019-5472-0,3,BMC genomics,100965258,4.547,0.6406359076499939,0.21070234113712374,0.39464882943143814,0.5054517787037087
Epigenetic Modifications at the Center of the Barker Hypothesis and Their Transgenerational Implications,"Embryo/fetal nutrition and the environment in the reproductive tract influence the subsequent risk of developing adult diseases and disorders, as formulated in the Barker hypothesis. Metabolic syndrome, obesity, heart disease, and hypertension in adulthood have all been linked to unwanted epigenetic programing in embryos and fetuses. Multiple studies support the conclusion that environmental challenges, such as a maternal low-protein diet, can change one-carbon amino acid metabolism and, thus, alter histone and DNA epigenetic modifications. Since histones influence gene expression and the program of embryo development, these epigenetic changes likely contribute to the risk of adult disease onset not just in the directly affected offspring, but for multiple generations to come. In this paper, we hypothesize that the effects of parental nutritional status on fetal epigenetic programming are transgenerational and warrant further investigation. Numerous studies supporting this hypothesis are reviewed, and potential research techniques to study these transgenerational epigenetic effects are offered.",34886453,PMC8656758,10.3390/ijerph182312728,8,International journal of environmental research and public health,101238455,4.614,0.6399610638618469,0.43812709030100333,0.411371237458194,0.5538763038689476
Computational methods and next-generation sequencing approaches to analyze epigenetics data: Profiling of methods and applications,"Epigenetics is mainly comprised of features that regulate genomic interactions thereby playing a crucial role in a vast array of biological processes. Epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation and histone modifications influence gene expression by modulating the packaging of DNA in the nucleus. A plethora of studies have emphasized the importance of analyzing epigenetics data through genome-wide studies and high-throughput approaches, thereby providing key insights towards epigenetics-based diseases such as cancer. Recent advancements have been made towards translating epigenetics research into a high throughput approach such as genome-scale profiling. Amongst all, bioinformatics plays a pivotal role in achieving epigenetics-related computational studies. Despite significant advancements towards epigenomic profiling, it is challenging to understand how various epigenetic modifications such as chromatin modifications and DNA methylation regulate gene expression. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) provides accurate and parallel sequencing thereby allowing researchers to comprehend epigenomic profiling. In this review, we summarize different computational methods such as machine learning and other bioinformatics tools, publicly available databases and resources to identify key modifications associated with epigenetic machinery. Additionally, the review also focuses on understanding recent methodologies related to epigenome profiling using NGS methods ranging from library preparation, different sequencing platforms and analytical techniques to evaluate various epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation and histone modifications.

Current understanding of epigenetics mechanism as a novel target in reducing cancer stem cells resistance,"At present, after extensive studies in the field of cancer, cancer stem cells (CSCs) have been proposed as a major factor in tumor initiation, progression, metastasis, and recurrence. CSCs are a subpopulation of bulk tumors, with stem cell-like properties and tumorigenic capabilities, having the abilities of self-renewal and differentiation, thereby being able to generate heterogeneous lineages of cancer cells and lead to resistance toward anti-tumor treatments. Highly resistant to conventional chemo- and radiotherapy, CSCs have heterogeneity and can migrate to different organs and metastasize. Recent studies have demonstrated that the population of CSCs and the progression of cancer are increased by the deregulation of different epigenetic pathways having effects on gene expression patterns and key pathways connected with cell proliferation and survival. Further, epigenetic modifications (DNA methylation, histone modifications, and RNA methylations) have been revealed to be key drivers in the formation and maintenance of CSCs. Hence, identifying CSCs and targeting epigenetic pathways therein can offer new insights into the treatment of cancer. In the present review, recent studies are addressed in terms of the characteristics of CSCs, the resistance thereof, and the factors influencing the development thereof, with an emphasis on different types of epigenetic changes in genes and main signaling pathways involved therein. Finally, targeted therapy for CSCs by epigenetic drugs is referred to, which is a new approach in overcoming resistance and recurrence of cancer.",34051847,PMC8164819,10.1186/s13148-021-01107-4,21,Clinical epigenetics,101516977,7.259,0.6390605568885803,0.705685618729097,0.7157190635451505,0.6677172705879977
An Engineered Split-TET2 Enzyme for Chemical-inducible DNA Hydroxymethylation and Epigenetic Remodeling,"DNA methylation is a stable and heritable epigenetic modification in the mammalian genome and is involved in regulating gene expression to control cellular functions. The reversal of DNA methylation, or DNA demethylation, is mediated by the ten-eleven translocation (TET) protein family of dioxygenases. Although it has been widely reported that aberrant DNA methylation and demethylation are associated with developmental defects and cancer, how these epigenetic changes directly contribute to the subsequent alteration in gene expression or disease progression remains unclear, largely owing to the lack of reliable tools to accurately add or remove DNA modifications in the genome at defined temporal and spatial resolution. To overcome this hurdle, we designed a split-TET2 enzyme to enable temporal control of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) oxidation and subsequent remodeling of epigenetic states in mammalian cells by simply adding chemicals. Here, we describe methods for introducing a chemical-inducible epigenome remodeling tool (CiDER), based on an engineered split-TET2 enzyme, into mammalian cells and quantifying the chemical inducible production of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) with immunostaining, flow cytometry or a dot-blot assay. This chemical-inducible epigenome remodeling tool will find broad use in interrogating cellular systems without altering the genetic code, as well as in probing the epigenotype-phenotype relations in various biological systems.",29286410,PMC5755596,10.3791/56858,0,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,101313252,1.424,0.6384972333908081,0.010033444816053512,0.10367892976588629,0.4058408149508728
Advances in epigenetics in systemic sclerosis: molecular mechanisms and therapeutic potential,"Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a prototypical inflammatory fibrotic disease involving inflammation, vascular abnormalities and fibrosis that primarily affect the skin and lungs. The aetiology of SSc is unknown and its pathogenesis is only partially understood. Of all the rheumatic diseases, SSc carries the highest all-cause mortality rate and represents an unmet medical need. A growing body of evidence implicates epigenetic aberrations in this intractable disease, including specific modifications affecting the three main cell types involved in SSc pathogenesis: immune cells, endothelial cells and fibroblasts. In this Review, we discuss the latest insights into the role of DNA methylation, histone modifications and non-coding RNAs in SSc and how these epigenetic alterations affect disease features. In particular, histone modifications have a role in the regulation of gene expression pertinent to activation of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts, governing their fate. DNA methyltransferases are crucial in disease pathogenesis by mediating methylation of DNA in specific promoters, regulating expression of specific pathways.

Research Progress in Predicting DNA Methylation Modifications and the Relation with Human Diseases,"DNA methylation is an important mode of regulation in epigenetic mechanisms, and it is one of the research foci in the field of epigenetics. DNA methylation modification affects a series of biological processes, such as eukaryotic cell growth, differentiation, and transformation mechanisms, by regulating gene expression. In this review, we systematically summarized the DNA methylation databases, prediction tools for DNA methylation modification, machine learning algorithms for predicting DNA methylation modification, and the relationship between DNA methylation modification and diseases such as hypertension, Alzheimer's disease, diabetic nephropathy, and cancer. An in-depth understanding of DNA methylation mechanisms can promote accurate prediction of DNA methylation modifications and the treatment and diagnosis of related diseases.",34533438,,10.2174/0929867328666210917115733,5,Current medicinal chemistry,9440157,4.74,0.6360140442848206,0.31438127090301005,0.44481605351170567,0.5334478914538355
Targeting DNA Hypomethylation in Malignancy by Epigenetic Therapies,"DNA methylation is a chemically reversible epigenetic modification that regulates the chromatin structure and gene expression, and thereby takes part in various cellular processes like embryogenesis, genomic imprinting, X-chromosome inactivation, and genome stability. Alterations in the normal methylation levels of DNA may contribute to the development of pathological conditions like cancer. Even though both hypo- and hypermethylation-mediated abnormalities are prevalent in the cancer genome, the field of cancer epigenetics has been more focused on targeting hypermethylation. As a result, DNA hypomethylation-mediated abnormalities remained relatively less explored, and currently, there are no approved drugs that can be clinically used to target hypomethylation. Understanding the precise role of DNA hypomethylation is not only crucial from a mechanistic point of view but also for the development of pharmacological agents that can reverse the hypomethylated state of the DNA. This chapter focuses on the causes and impact of DNA hypomethylation in the development of cancer and describes the possible ways to pharmacologically target it, especially by using a naturally occurring physiologic agent S-adenosylmethionine (SAM).",31576549,,10.1007/978-3-030-22254-3_14,17,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,121103,3.65,0.6360140442848206,0.6655518394648829,0.21739130434782608,0.5581970553334342
Emerging concepts on the role of epigenetics in the relationships between nutrition and health,"Understanding the physiological and metabolic underpinnings that confer individual differences in responses to diet and diet-related chronic disease is essential to advance the field of nutrition. This includes elucidating the differences in gene expression that are mediated through programming of the genome through epigenetic chromatin modifications. Epigenetic landscapes are influenced by age, genetics, toxins and other environmental factors, including dietary exposures and nutritional status. Epigenetic modifications influence transcription and genome stability are established during development with life-long consequences. They can be inherited from one generation to the next. The covalent modifications of chromatin, which include methylation and acetylation, on DNA nucleotide bases, histone proteins and RNA are derived from intermediates of one-carbon metabolism and central metabolism. They influence key physiological processes throughout life, and together with inherited DNA primary sequence, contribute to responsiveness to environmental stresses, diet and risk for age-related chronic disease. Revealing diet-epigenetic relationships has the potential to transform nutrition science by increasing our fundamental understanding of: (i) the role of nutrients in biological systems, (ii) the resilience of living organisms in responding to environmental perturbations, and (iii) the development of dietary patterns that programme physiology for life-long health. Epigenetics may also enable the classification of individuals with chronic disease for specific dietary management and/or for efficacious diet-pharmaceutical combination therapies. These new emerging concepts at the interface of nutrition and epigenetics were discussed, and future research needs identified by leading experts at the 26th Marabou Symposium entitled 'Nutrition, Epigenetics, Genetics: Impact on Health and Disease'.

Epigenetic impacts of endocrine disruptors in the brain,"The acquisition of reproductive competence is organized and activated by steroid hormones acting upon the hypothalamus during critical windows of development. This review describes the potential role of epigenetic processes, particularly DNA methylation, in the regulation of sexual differentiation of the hypothalamus by hormones. We examine disruption of these processes by endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in an age-, sex-, and region-specific manner, focusing on how perinatal EDCs act through epigenetic mechanisms to reprogram DNA methylation and sex steroid hormone receptor expression throughout life. These receptors are necessary for brain sexual differentiation and their altered expression may underlie disrupted reproductive physiology and behavior. Finally, we review the literature on histone modifications and non-coding RNA involvement in brain sexual differentiation and their perturbation by EDCs. By putting these data into a sex and developmental context we conclude that perinatal EDC exposure alters the developmental trajectory of reproductive neuroendocrine systems in a sex-specific manner.",27663243,PMC5429819,10.1016/j.yfrne.2016.09.002,23,Frontiers in neuroendocrinology,7513292,8.333,0.6312534213066101,0.7424749163879598,0.7591973244147158,0.6790865009445012
Epigenetics and Malaria Susceptibility/Protection: A Missing Piece of the Puzzle,"A better understanding of stable changes in regulation of gene expression that result from epigenetic events is of great relevance in the development of strategies to prevent and treat infectious diseases. Histone modification and DNA methylation are key epigenetic mechanisms that can be regarded as marks, which ensure an accurate transmission of the chromatin states and gene expression profiles over generations of cells. There is an increasing list of these modifications, and the complexity of their action is just beginning to be understood. It is clear that the epigenetic landscape plays a fundamental role in most biological processes that involve the manipulation and expression of DNA. Although the molecular mechanism of gene regulation is relatively well understood, the hierarchical order of events and dependencies that lead to protection against infection remain largely unknown. In this review, we propose that host epigenetics is an essential, though relatively under studied, factor in the protection or susceptibility to malaria.",30158923,PMC6104485,10.3389/fimmu.2018.01733,10,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,8.786,0.6306849718093872,0.5150501672240803,0.7892976588628763,0.6392805483030236
The role of epigenetic mechanisms in the regulation of gene expression in the cyclical endometrium,"Background:The human endometrium is a highly dynamic tissue whose function is mainly regulated by the ovarian steroid hormones estradiol and progesterone. The serum levels of these and other hormones are associated with three specific phases that compose the endometrial cycle: menstrual, proliferative, and secretory. Throughout this cycle, the endometrium exhibits different transcriptional networks according to the genes expressed in each phase. Epigenetic mechanisms are crucial in the fine-tuning of gene expression to generate such transcriptional networks. The present review aims to provide an overview of current research focused on the epigenetic mechanisms that regulate gene expression in the cyclical endometrium and discuss the technical and clinical perspectives regarding this topic.Main body:The main epigenetic mechanisms reported are DNA methylation, histone post-translational modifications, and non-coding RNAs. These epigenetic mechanisms induce the expression of genes associated with transcriptional regulation, endometrial epithelial growth, angiogenesis, and stromal cell proliferation during the proliferative phase. During the secretory phase, epigenetic mechanisms promote the expression of genes associated with hormone response, insulin signaling, decidualization, and embryo implantation. Furthermore, the global content of specific epigenetic modifications and the gene expression of non-coding RNAs and epigenetic modifiers vary according to the menstrual cycle phase. In vitro and cell type-specific studies have demonstrated that epithelial and stromal cells undergo particular epigenetic changes that modulate their transcriptional networks to accomplish their function during decidualization and implantation.Conclusion and perspectives:Epigenetic mechanisms are emerging as key players in regulating transcriptional networks associated with key processes and functions of the cyclical endometrium. Further studies using next-generation sequencing and single-cell technology are warranted to explore the role of other epigenetic mechanisms in each cell type that composes the endometrium throughout the menstrual cycle. The application of this knowledge will definitively provide essential information to understand the pathological mechanisms of endometrial diseases, such as endometriosis and endometrial cancer, and to identify potential therapeutic targets and improve women's health.",34034824,PMC8146649,10.1186/s13148-021-01103-8,25,Clinical epigenetics,101516977,7.259,0.6293190717697144,0.7692307692307693,0.7190635451505016,0.6752503059380828
"Multigenerational epigenetic inheritance: One step forward, two generations back","Modifications to DNA and histone proteins serve a critical regulatory role in the developing and adult brain, and over a decade of research has established the importance of these ""epigenetic"" modifications in a wide variety of brain functions across the lifespan. Epigenetic patterns orchestrate gene expression programs that establish the phenotypic diversity of various cellular classes in the central nervous system, play a key role in experience-dependent gene regulation in the adult brain, and are commonly implicated in neurodevelopmental, psychiatric, and neurodegenerative disease states. In addition to these established roles, emerging evidence indicates that epigenetic information can potentially be transmitted to offspring, giving rise to inter- and trans-generational epigenetic inheritance phenotypes. However, our understanding of the cellular events that participate in this information transfer is incomplete, and the ability of this transfer to overcome complete epigenetic reprogramming during embryonic development is highly controversial. This review explores the existing literature on multigenerational epigenetic mechanisms in the central nervous system. First, we focus on the cellular mechanisms that may perpetuate or counteract this type of information transfer, and consider how epigenetic modification in germline and somatic cells regulate important aspects of cellular and organismal development. Next, we review the potential phenotypes resulting from ancestral experiences that impact gene regulatory modifications, including how these changes may give rise to unique metabolic phenotypes. Finally, we discuss several caveats and technical limitations that influence multigenerational epigenetic effects. We argue that studies reporting multigenerational epigenetic changes impacting the central nervous system must be interpreted with caution, and provide suggestions for how epigenetic information transfer can be mechanistically disentangled from genetic and environmental influences on brain function.",31470104,,10.1016/j.nbd.2019.104591,22,Neurobiology of disease,9500169,7.046,0.6282933950424194,0.7190635451505016,0.6989966555183946,0.660588077159231
Cancer type-specific epigenetic changes: gastric cancer,"Gastric cancer (GC) remains a major cause of mortality despite declining rate in the world. Epigenetic alterations contribute significantly to the development and progression of gastric tumors. Epigenetic refers to the number of modifications of the chromatin structure that affect gene expression without altering the primary sequence of DNA, and these changes lead to transcriptional activation or silencing of the gene. Over the years, the study of epigenetic processes has increased, and novel therapeutic approaches have emerged. This chapter summarizes the main epigenomic mechanisms described recently involved in gastric carcinogenesis, focusing on the roles that aberrant DNA methylation, histone modifications (histone acetylation and methylation), and miRNAs (oncogenic and tumor suppressor function of miRNA) play in the onset and progression of gastric tumors. Clinical implications of these epigenetic alterations in GC are also discussed.",25421656,,10.1007/978-1-4939-1804-1_5,12,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,0.0,0.6278371214866638,0.5852842809364549,0.033444816053511704,0.5004480922899917
Differential gene methylation patterns in cancerous and nonâcancerous cells,"Largeâscale projects, such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Human Epigenome Project (HEP) and Human Epigenome Atlas (HEA), provide an insight into DNA methylation and histone modification markers. Changes in the epigenome significantly contribute to the initiation and progression of cancer. The goal of the present study was to characterize the prostate cancer malignant transformation model using the CpG island methylation pattern. The Human Prostate Cancer EpiTect Methyl II Signature PCR Array was used to evaluate the methylation status of 22 genes in prostate cancer cell lines: PC3, PC3M, PC3MPro4 and PC3MLN4, each representing different metastatic potential in vivo. Subsequently, it was ascertained whether DNA methylation plays a role in the expression of these genes in prostate cancer cells. Hypermethylation of APC, DKK3, GPX3, GSTP1, MGMT, PTGS2, RASSF1, TIMP2 and TNFRSF10D resulted in downregulation of their expression in prostate cancer cell lines as compared to WT fibroblasts. Mining of the TCGA data deposited in the MetHC database found increases in the methylation status of these 9 genes in prostate cancer patients, further supporting the role of methylation in altering the expression of these genes in prostate cancer. Future studies are warranted to investigate the role of these proteins in prostate cancer development.",31115550,PMC6549081,10.3892/or.2019.7159,9,Oncology reports,9422756,4.136,0.6265812516212463,0.46488294314381273,0.3076923076923077,0.5304638011399719
[Epigenetic Regulation and Epigenomic Landscape in Normal Physiological Hematopoiesis--Editorial],"Abstract The physiological hematopoiesis depends on the programmed expression of a series of gene regulated by mechanisms at various levels. Currently, the epigenetic regulation has been considered as the most important mechanism during hematopoietic differentiation, resulting in a specific epigenomic landscape in the hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. We try to concisely review the epigenetic mechanisms, including the genomic methylation, the histone modifications and the expression profiles of noncoding RNA, illustrating briefly the differentiation from the hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells to to the erythroid, myeloid and lymphoid cells.",31839027,,10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2019.06.001,0,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,0.0,0.6264670491218567,0.013377926421404682,0.03678929765886288,0.3859136742891675
Learning the Formation Mechanism of Domain-Level Chromatin States with Epigenomics Data,"Epigenetic modifications can extend over long genomic regions to form domain-level chromatin states that play critical roles in gene regulation. The molecular mechanism for the establishment and maintenance of these states is not fully understood and remains challenging to study with existing experimental techniques. Here, we took a data-driven approach and parameterized an information-theoretic model to infer the formation mechanism of domain-level chromatin states from genome-wide epigenetic modification profiles. This model reproduces statistical correlations among histone modifications and identifies well-known states. Importantly, it predicts drastically different mechanisms and kinetic pathways for the formation of euchromatin and heterochromatin. In particular, long, strong enhancer and promoter states grow gradually from short but stable regulatory elements via a multistep process. On the other hand, the formation of heterochromatin states is highly cooperative, and no intermediate states are found along the transition path. This cooperativity can arise from a chromatin looping-mediated spreading of histone methylation mark and supports collapsed, globular three-dimensional conformations rather than regular fibril structures for heterochromatin. We further validated these predictions using changes of epigenetic profiles along cell differentiation. Our study demonstrates that information-theoretic models can go beyond statistical analysis to derive insightful kinetic information that is otherwise difficult to access.",31053260,PMC6531873,10.1016/j.bpj.2019.04.006,20,Biophysical journal,370626,3.699,0.6256668567657471,0.6923076923076923,0.25752508361204013,0.5653666692433947
Signaling coupled epigenomic regulation of gene expression,"Inheritance of genomic information independent of the DNA sequence, the epigenetics, as well as gene transcription are profoundly shaped by serine/threonine and tyrosine signaling kinases and components of the chromatin remodeling complexes. To precisely respond to a changing external milieu, human cells efficiently translate upstream signals into post-translational modifications (PTMs) on histones and coregulators such as corepressors, coactivators, DNA-binding factors and PTM modifying enzymes. Because a protein with multiple residues for putative PTMs is expected to undergo more than one PTM in cells stimulated with growth factors, the outcome of combinational PTM codes on histones and coregulators is profoundly shaped by regulatory interplays between PTMs. The genomic functions of signaling kinases in cancer cells are manifested by the downstream effectors of cytoplasmic signaling cascades as well as translocation of the cytoplasmic signaling kinases to the nucleus. Signaling-mediated phosphorylation of histones serves as a regulatory switch for other PTMs, and connects chromatin remodeling complexes into gene transcription and gene activity. Here, we will discuss the recent advances in signaling-dependent epigenomic regulation of gene transcription using a few representative cancer-relevant serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases and their interplay with chromatin remodeling factors in cancer cells.",28650470,,10.1038/onc.2017.201,8,Oncogene,8711562,8.756,0.6242935061454773,0.44481605351170567,0.7859531772575251,0.6207299498411325
Aging: Epigenetic modifications,"Aging is one of the most complex and irreversible health conditions characterized by continuous decline in physical/mental activities that eventually poses an increased risk of several diseases and ultimately death. These conditions cannot be ignored by anyone but there are evidences that suggest that exercise, healthy diet and good routines may delay the Aging process significantly. Several studies have demonstrated that Epigenetics plays a key role in Aging and Aging-associated diseases through methylation of DNA, histone modification and non-coding RNA (ncRNA). Comprehension and relevant alterations in these epigenetic modifications can lead to new therapeutic avenues of age-delaying contrivances. These processes affect gene transcription, DNA replication and DNA repair, comprehending epigenetics as a key factor in understanding Aging and developing new avenues for delaying Aging, clinical advancements in ameliorating aging-related diseases and rejuvenating health.

Epigenetic modifications in acute myeloid leukemia: The emerging role of circular RNAs (Review),"Canonical epigenetic modifications, which include histone modification, chromatin remodeling and DNA methylation, play key roles in numerous cellular processes. Epigenetics underlies how cells that posses DNA with similar sequences develop into different cell types with different functions in an organism. Earlier epigenetic research has primarily been focused at the chromatin level. However, the number of studies on epigenetic modifications of RNA, such as N1âmethyladenosine, 2'âOâribosemethylation, inosine, 5âmethylcytidine, N6âmethyladenosine (m6A) and pseudouridine, has seen an increase. Circular RNAs (circRNAs), a type of RNA species that lacks a 5' cap or 3' poly(A) tail, are abundantly expressed in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and may regulate disease progression. circRNAs possess various functions, including microRNA sponging, gene transcription regulation and RNAâbinding protein interaction. Furthermore, circRNAs are m6A methylated in other types of cancer, such as colorectal and hypopharyngeal squamous cell cancers. Therefore, the critical roles of circRNA epigenetic modifications, particularly m6A, and their possible involvement in AML are discussed in the present review. Epigenetic modification of circRNAs may become a diagnostic and therapeutic target for AML in the future.",34792180,PMC8651224,10.3892/ijo.2021.5287,5,International journal of oncology,9306042,5.884,0.6214834451675415,0.3177257525083612,0.5652173913043478,0.5494786958630666
Epigenetic Dysregulation in Autoimmune and Inflammatory Skin Diseases,"Epigenetics is the study of heritable, reversible gene expression patterns that do not originate from alterations in the DNA sequence. Epigenetic modifications influence gene expression patterns and include DNA methylation, histone modifications, and gene regulation via non-coding RNAs. While the study of epigenetics has been most broadly applied to neoplastic diseases, the role of the epigenome in a wide range of disease processes including autoimmune, allergic, and inflammatory processes is increasingly being recognized. Recent advances in the study of the epigenome have led to novel insights into the pathogenesis and potential therapeutic targets of various pathologic entities including inflammatory diseases. In this review, we examine the nature of epigenetic modifications in several well-studied autoimmune, allergic, and/or inflammatory disorders of the skin including systemic lupus erythematosus, vitiligo, systemic sclerosis, alopecia areata, pemphigus, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, keloidal scarring, and hidradenitis suppurativa with the aim to determine how such epigenetic changes may be targeted for therapeutic benefit.",36346551,,10.1007/s12016-022-08956-8,8,Clinical reviews in allergy & immunology,9504368,10.817,0.6195863485336304,0.44816053511705684,0.8662207357859532,0.6346280633007803
New insights into the epigenetics of inflammatory rheumatic diseases,"Over the past decade, awareness of the importance of epigenetic alterations in the pathogenesis of rheumatic diseases has grown in parallel with a general recognition of the fundamental role of epigenetics in the regulation of gene expression. Large-scale efforts to generate genome-wide maps of epigenetic modifications in different cell types, as well as in physiological and pathological contexts, illustrate the increasing recognition of the relevance of epigenetics. To date, although several reports have demonstrated the occurrence of epigenetic alterations in a wide range of inflammatory rheumatic conditions, epigenomic information is rarely used in a clinical setting. By contrast, several epigenetic biomarkers and treatments are currently in use for personalized therapies in patients with cancer. This Review highlights advances from the past 5 years in the field of epigenetics and their application to inflammatory rheumatic diseases, delineating the future lines of development for a rational use of epigenetic information in clinical settings and in personalized medicine. These advances include the identification of epipolymorphisms associated with clinical outcomes, DNA methylation as a contributor to disease susceptibility in rheumatic conditions, the discovery of novel epigenetic mechanisms that modulate disease susceptibility and the development of new epigenetic therapies.",28905855,,10.1038/nrrheum.2017.147,24,Nature reviews.

Dissecting early life stress-induced adolescent depression through epigenomic approach,"Early life stress (ELS), such as abuse and neglect during childhood, can lead to psychiatric disorders in later life. Previous studies have suggested that ELS can cause profound changes in gene expression through epigenetic mechanisms, which can lead to psychiatric disorders in adulthood; however, studies on epigenetic modifications associated with ELS and psychiatric disorders in adolescents are limited. Moreover, how these epigenetic modifications can lead to psychiatric disorders in adolescents is not fully understood. Commonly, DNA methylation, histone modification, and the regulation of noncoding RNAs have been attributed to the reprogramming of epigenetic profiling associated with ELS. Although only a few studies have attempted to examine epigenetic modifications in adolescents with ELS, existing evidence suggests that there are commonalities and differences in epigenetic profiling between adolescents and adults. In addition, epigenetic modifications are sex-dependent and are influenced by the type of ELS. In this review, we have critically evaluated the current evidence on epigenetic modifications in adolescents with ELS, particularly DNA methylation and the expression of microRNAs in both preclinical models and humans. We have also clarified the impact of ELS on psychiatric disorders in adolescents to predict the development of neuropsychiatric disorders and to prevent and recover these disorders through personalized medicine.",36517640,PMC9812796,10.1038/s41380-022-01907-x,8,Molecular psychiatry,9607835,13.437,0.6164164543151855,0.451505016722408,0.8929765886287625,0.6387461936593455
Age-Related Macular Degeneration: From Epigenetics to Therapeutic Implications,"Aberrant regulation of epigenetic mechanisms, including the two most common types; DNA methylation and histone modification have been implicated in common chronic progressive conditions, including Alzheimer disease, cardiovascular disease, and age-related macular degeneration (AMD). All these conditions are complex, meaning that environmental factors, genetic factors, and their interactions play a role in disease pathophysiology. Although genome wide association studies (GWAS), and studies on twins demonstrate the genetic/hereditary component to these complex diseases, including AMD, this contribution is much less than 100%. Moreover, the contribution of the hereditary component decreases in the advanced, later onset forms of these chronic diseases including AMD. This underscores the need to elucidate how the genetic and environmental factors function to exert their influence on disease pathophysiology. By teasing out epigenetic mechanisms and how they exert their influence on AMD, therapeutic targets can be tailored to prevent and/or slow down disease progression.

Editing the Epigenome: Reshaping the Genomic Landscape,"The eukaryotic epigenome has an instrumental role in determining and maintaining cell identity and function. Epigenetic components such as DNA methylation, histone tail modifications, chromatin accessibility, and DNA architecture are tightly correlated with central cellular processes, while their dysregulation manifests in aberrant gene expression and disease. The ability to specifically edit the epigenome holds the promise of enhancing understanding of how epigenetic modifications function and enabling manipulation of cell phenotype for research or therapeutic purposes. Genome engineering technologies use highly specific DNA-targeting tools to precisely deposit epigenetic changes in a locus-specific manner, creating diverse epigenome editing platforms.

Recent developments in epigenetics of acute and chronic kidney diseases,"The growing epidemic of obesity and diabetes, the aging population as well as prevalence of drug abuse has led to significant increases in the rates of the closely associated acute and chronic kidney diseases, including diabetic nephropathy. Furthermore, evidence shows that parental behavior and diet can affect the phenotype of subsequent generations via epigenetic transmission mechanisms. These data suggest a strong influence of the environment on disease susceptibility and that, apart from genetic susceptibility, epigenetic mechanisms need to be evaluated to gain critical new information about kidney diseases. Epigenetics is the study of processes that control gene expression and phenotype without alterations in the underlying DNA sequence. Epigenetic modifications, including cytosine DNA methylation and covalent post-translational modifications of histones in chromatin, are part of the epigenome, the interface between the stable genome and the variable environment. This dynamic epigenetic layer responds to external environmental cues to influence the expression of genes associated with disease states. The field of epigenetics has seen remarkable growth in the past few years with significant advances in basic biology, contributions to human disease, as well as epigenomics technologies. Further understanding of how the renal cell epigenome is altered by metabolic and other stimuli can yield novel new insights into the pathogenesis of kidney diseases.

The role of epigenetic modifications facilitating human diseases is well established. Previous studies have identified histone and cytosine code during normal and pathological conditions with special emphasis on how these modifications regulate transcriptional events. Recent studies have also mapped these epigenetic modification and pathways leading to carcinogenesis. Discovery of drugs that target proteins/enzymes in the epigenetic pathways may provide better therapeutic opportunities, and identification of such modulators for DNA methylation, histone modifications, and expression of noncoding RNAs for several cancer types is underway. In this review, we provide a detailed description of recent developments in the field of epigenetics and its impact on personalized medicine to manage cervical cancer.",28521327,,10.1159/000475804,10,Public health genomics,101474167,2.132,0.6113819479942322,0.5183946488294314,0.12709030100334448,0.4959261587630944
Role of epigenetic modifications in luminal breast cancer,"Luminal breast cancers represent approximately 75% of cases. Explanations into the causes of endocrine resistance are complex and are generally ascribed to genomic mechanisms. Recently, attention has been drawn to the role of epigenetic modifications in hormone resistance. We review these here. Epigenetic modifications are reversible, heritable and include changes in DNA methylation patterns, modification of histones and altered microRNA expression levels that target the receptors or their signaling pathways. Large-scale analyses indicate distinct epigenomic profiles that distinguish breast cancers from normal and benign tissues. Taking advantage of the reversibility of epigenetic modifications, drugs that target epigenetic modifiers, given in combination with chemotherapies or endocrine therapies, may represent promising approaches to restoration of therapy responsiveness in these cases.",25689414,PMC4539290,10.2217/epi.15.10,22,Epigenomics,101519720,4.357,0.6112079620361328,0.7224080267558528,0.34782608695652173,0.5807715999641546
A translational perspective on epigenetics in allergic diseases,"The analysis of epigenetic modifications in allergic diseases has recently attracted substantial interest because epigenetic modifications can mediate the effects of the environment on the development of or protection from allergic diseases. Furthermore, recent research has provided evidence for an altered epigenomic landscape in disease-relevant cell populations. Although still in the early phase, epigenetic modifications, particularly DNA methylation and microRNAs, might have potential for assisting in the stratification of patients for treatment and complement or replace in the future biochemical or clinical tests. The first epigenetic biomarkers correlating with the successful outcome of immunotherapy have been reported, and with personalized treatment options being rolled out, epigenetic modifications might well play a role in monitoring or even predicting the response to tailored therapy. However, further studies in larger cohorts with well-defined phenotypes in specific cell populations need to be performed before their implementation. Furthermore, the epigenome provides an interesting target for therapeutic intervention, with microRNA mimics, inhibitors, and antisense oligonucleotides being evaluated in clinical trials in patients with other diseases. Selection or engineering of populations of extracellular vesicles and epigenetic editing represent novel tools for modulation of the cellular phenotype and responses, although further technological improvements are required. Moreover, interactions between the host epigenome and the microbiome are increasingly recognized, and interventions of the microbiome could contribute to modulation of the epigenome with a potential effect on the overall goal of prevention of allergic diseases.",30195377,,10.1016/j.jaci.2018.07.009,24,The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology,1275002,14.29,0.6098146438598633,0.7558528428093646,0.903010033444816,0.6976613615667541
Potential epigenetic modifications implicated in triple- to quadruple-negative breast cancer transition: a review,"Current research on triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has resulted in delineation into the quadruple-negative breast cancer (QNBC) subgroup. Epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation, histone posttranslational modifications and associated changes in chromatin architecture have been implicated in breast cancer pathogenesis. Herein, the authors highlight genes with observed epigenetic modifications that are associated with more aggressive TNBC/QNBC pathogenesis and possible interventions. Advanced literature searches were done on PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus and Google Scholar. The results suggest that nine epigenetically altered genes/differentially expressed proteins in addition to the downregulated androgen receptor are associated with TNBC aggressiveness and could be implicated in the TNBC to QNBC transition. Thus, restoring the normal expression of these genes via epigenetic reprogramming could be therapeutically beneficial to TNBC and QNBC patients.",35473304,,10.2217/epi-2022-0033,5,Epigenomics,101519720,4.357,0.6086522340774536,0.3210702341137124,0.3511705685618729,0.49963950098158916
The inter-talk betweenMycobacterium tuberculosisand the epigenetic mechanisms,"Epigenetics regulate gene function without any alteration in the DNA sequence. The epigenetics represent one of the most important regulators in different cellular processes and have initially been developed in microorganisms as a protective strategy. The evaluation of the epigenetic mechanisms is also important in achieving an efficient control strategy in tuberculosis (TB). TB is one of the most significant epidemiological concerns in human history. Despite severalin vivoandin vitrostudies that have evaluated different epigenetic modifications in TB, many aspects of the association between epigenetics and TB are not fully understood. The current paper is aimed at reviewing our knowledge on histone modifications and DNA methylation modifications, as well as miRNAs regulation in TB.",32267165,,10.2217/epi-2019-0187,9,Epigenomics,101519720,4.357,0.6077213883399963,0.4682274247491639,0.35451505016722407,0.5291813279872754
The Role of Epigenetics in Autoimmune/Inflammatory Disease,"Historically, systemic self-inflammatory conditions were classified as either autoinflammatory and caused by the innate immune system or autoimmune and driven by adaptive immune responses. However, it became clear that reality is much more complex and that autoimmune/inflammatory conditions range along an ""inflammatory spectrum"" with primarily autoinflammatory vs. autoimmune conditions resembling extremes at either end. Epigenetic modifications influence gene expression and alter cellular functions without modifying the genomic sequence. Methylation of CpG DNA dinucleotides and/or their hydroxymethylation, post-translational modifications to amino termini of histone proteins, and non-coding RNA expression are main epigenetic events. The pathophysiology of autoimmune/inflammatory diseases has been closely linked with disease causing gene mutations (rare) or a combination of genetic susceptibility and epigenetic modifications arising from exposure to the environment (more common). Over recent years, progress has been made in understanding molecular mechanisms involved in systemic inflammation and the contribution of innate and adaptive immune responses. Epigenetic events have been identified as (i) central pathophysiological factors in addition to genetic disease predisposition and (ii) as co-factors determining clinical pictures and outcomes in individuals with monogenic disease. Thus, a complete understanding of epigenetic contributors to autoimmune/inflammatory disease will result in approaches to predict individual disease outcomes and the introduction of effective, target-directed, and tolerable therapies. Here, we summarize recent findings that signify the importance of epigenetic modifications in autoimmune/inflammatory disorders along the inflammatory spectrum choosing three examples: the autoinflammatory bone condition chronic nonbacterial osteomyelitis (CNO), the ""mixed pattern"" disorder psoriasis, and the autoimmune disease systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).",31333659,PMC6620790,10.3389/fimmu.2019.01525,90,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,8.786,0.6060321927070618,0.9498327759197325,0.7926421404682275,0.7121142989018291
Epigenetics in breast and prostate cancer,"Most recent investigations into cancer etiology have identified a key role played by epigenetics. Specifically, aberrant DNA and histone modifications which silence tumor suppressor genes or promote oncogenes have been demonstrated in multiple cancer models. While the role of epigenetics in several solid tumor cancers such as colorectal cancer are well established, there is emerging evidence that epigenetics also plays a critical role in breast and prostate cancer. In breast cancer, DNA methylation profiles have been linked to hormone receptor status and tumor progression. Similarly in prostate cancer, epigenetic patterns have been associated with androgen receptor status and response to therapy. The regulation of key receptor pathways and activities which affect clinical therapy treatment options by epigenetics renders this field high priority for elucidating mechanisms and potential targets. A new set of methylation arrays are now available to screen epigenetic changes and provide the cutting-edge tools needed to perform such investigations. The role of nutritional interventions affecting epigenetic changes particularly holds promise. Ultimately, determining the causes and outcomes from epigenetic changes will inform translational applications for utilization as biomarkers for risk and prognosis as well as candidates for therapy.",25421674,PMC4364390,10.1007/978-1-4939-1804-1_23,44,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,0.0,0.6035230159759521,0.8662207357859532,0.04013377926421405,0.5433847125956047
Deciphering the role of epigenetic modifications in fatty liver disease: A systematic review,"Background:Fatty liver disease (FLD), primarily nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), is the most common liver disorder that affects a quarter of the global population. NAFLD is a spectrum of disease ranging from simple steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, which is associated with increased risk of developing liver cancer. Given that the pathogenic mechanisms of fatty liver remain largely elusive, it is important to further investigate potential underlying mechanisms including epigenetic modifications. Here, we performed a systematic review of human epigenetic studies on FLD presence.Methods:Five bibliographic databases were screened until 28 August 2020. We included cross-sectional, case-control and cohort studies in humans that examined the association of epigenetic modifications including global, candidate or epigenome-wide methylation of DNA, noncoding RNAs and histone modifications with FLD.Results:In total 36 articles, based on 33 unique studies, consisting of 12 112 participants met the inclusion criteria. Among these, two recent epigenome-wide association studies conducted among large population-based cohorts have reported the association between cg06690548 (SLC7A11) and FLD. Moreover, several studies have demonstrated the association between microRNAs (miRNAs) and FLD, in which miR-122, miR-34a and miR-192 were recognized as the most relevant miRNAs as biomarkers for FLD. We did not find any studies examining histone modifications in relation to FLD.Conclusions:Cumulative evidence suggests a link between epigenetic mechanisms, specifically DNA methylation and miRNAs, and FLD. Further efforts should investigate the molecular pathways by which these epigenetic markers may regulate FLD and also the potential role of histone modifications in FLD.",33350463,PMC8243926,10.1111/eci.13479,9,European journal of clinical investigation,245331,5.722,0.6011253595352173,0.47157190635451507,0.5418060200668896,0.5633508010054114
EpiFactors: a comprehensive database of human epigenetic factors and complexes,"Epigenetics refers to stable and long-term alterations of cellular traits that are not caused by changes in the DNA sequence per se. Rather, covalent modifications of DNA and histones affect gene expression and genome stability via proteins that recognize and act upon such modifications. Many enzymes that catalyse epigenetic modifications or are critical for enzymatic complexes have been discovered, and this is encouraging investigators to study the role of these proteins in diverse normal and pathological processes. Rapidly growing knowledge in the area has resulted in the need for a resource that compiles, organizes and presents curated information to the researchers in an easily accessible and user-friendly form. Here we present EpiFactors, a manually curated database providing information about epigenetic regulators, their complexes, targets and products. EpiFactors contains information on 815 proteins, including 95 histones and protamines. For 789 of these genes, we include expressions values across several samples, in particular a collection of 458 human primary cell samples (for approximately 200 cell types, in many cases from three individual donors), covering most mammalian cell steady states, 255 different cancer cell lines (representing approximately 150 cancer subtypes) and 134 human postmortem tissues. Expression values were obtained by the FANTOM5 consortium using Cap Analysis of Gene Expression technique. EpiFactors also contains information on 69 protein complexes that are involved in epigenetic regulation.

Beyond genetics: Exploring the role of epigenetic alterations in breast cancer,"Breast cancer remains a major global health challenge. Its rising incidence is attributed to factors such as delayed diagnosis, the complexity of its subtypes, and increasing drug resistance, all contributing to less-than-ideal patient outcomes. Central to the progression of breast cancer are epigenetic aberrations, which significantly contribute to drug resistance and the emergence of cancer stem cell traits. These include alterations in DNA methylation, histone modifications, and the expression of non-coding RNAs. Understanding these epigenetic changes is crucial for developing advanced breast cancer management strategies despite their complexity. Investigating these epigenetic modifications offers the potential for novel diagnostic markers, more accurate prognostic indicators, and the identification of reliable predictors of treatment response. This could lead to the development of new targeted therapies. However, this requires sustained, focused research efforts to navigate the challenges of understanding breast cancer carcinogenesis and its epigenetic underpinnings. A deeper understanding of epigenetic mechanisms in breast cancer can revolutionize personalized medicine. This could lead to significant improvements in patient care, including early detection, precise disease stratification, and more effective treatment options.",38306863,,10.1016/j.prp.2024.155174,0,"Pathology, research and practice",7806109,3.309,0.6004226803779602,0.020066889632107024,0.17391304347826086,0.39904959484884966
"Epigenetics in formation, function, and failure of the endocrine pancreas","Background:Epigenetics, in the broadest sense, governs all aspects of the life of any multicellular organism, as it controls how differentiated cells arrive at their unique phenotype during development and differentiation, despite having a uniform (with some exceptions such as T-cells and germ cells) genetic make-up. The endocrine pancreas is no exception. Transcriptional regulators and epigenetic modifiers shape the differentiation of the five major endocrine cell types from their common precursor in the fetal pancreatic bud. Beyond their role in cell differentiation, interactions of the organism with the environment are also often encoded into permanent or semi-permanent epigenetic marks and affect cellular behavior and organismal health. Epigenetics is defined as any heritable - at least through one mitotic cell division - change in phenotype or trait that is not the result of a change in genomic DNA sequence, and it forms the basis that mediates the environmental impact on diabetes susceptibility and islet function.Scope of review:We will summarize the impact of epigenetic regulation on islet cell development, maturation, function, and pathophysiology. We will briefly recapitulate the major epigenetic marks and their relationship to gene activity, and outline novel strategies to employ targeted epigenetic modifications as a tool to improve islet cell function.Major conclusions:The improved understanding of the epigenetic underpinnings of islet cell differentiation, function and breakdown, as well as the development of innovative tools for their manipulation, is key to islet cell biology and the discovery of novel approaches to therapies for islet cell failure.",28951829,PMC5605720,10.1016/j.molmet.2017.05.015,16,Molecular metabolism,101605730,8.568,0.600364089012146,0.6521739130434783,0.7658862876254181,0.6438304935410669
Loss of H3K27 methylation identifies poor outcomes in adult-onset acute leukemia,"Background:Acute leukemia is an epigenetically heterogeneous disease. The intensity of treatment is currently guided by cytogenetic and molecular genetic risk classifications; however these incompletely predict outcomes, requiring additional information for more accurate outcome predictions. We aimed to identify potential prognostic implications of epigenetic modification of histone proteins, with a focus on H3K4 and H3K27 methylation marks in relation to mutations in chromatin, splicing and transcriptional regulators in adult-onset acute lymphoblastic and myeloid leukemia.Results:Histone 3 lysine 4 di- and trimethylation (H3K4me2, H3K4me3) and lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) mark expression was evaluated in 241 acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 114 B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) and 14T-cell ALL (T-ALL) patient samples at time of diagnosis using reverse phase protein array. Expression levels of the marks were significantly lower in AML than in B and T-ALL in both bone marrow and peripheral blood, as well as compared to normal CD34+ cells. In AML, greater loss of H3K27me3 was associated with increased proliferative potential and shorter overall survival in the whole patient population, as well as in subsets with DNA methylation mutations. To study the prognostic impact of H3K27me3 in the context of cytogenetic aberrations and mutations, multivariate analysis was performed and identified lower H3K27me3 level as an independent unfavorable prognostic factor in all, as well as in TP53 mutated patients. AML with decreased H3K27me3 demonstrated an upregulated anti-apoptotic phenotype. In ALL, the relative quantity of histone methylation expression correlated with response to tyrosine kinase inhibitor in patients who carried the Philadelphia cytogenetic aberration and prior smoking behavior.Conclusion:This study shows that proteomic profiling of epigenetic modifications has clinical implications in acute leukemia and supports the idea that epigenetic patterns contribute to a more accurate picture of the leukemic state that complements cytogenetic and molecular genetic subgrouping. A combination of these variables may offer more accurate outcome prediction and we suggest that histone methylation mark measurement at time of diagnosis might be a suitable method to improve patient outcome prediction and subsequent treatment intensity stratification in selected subgroups.",33509276,PMC7841917,10.1186/s13148-021-01011-x,5,Clinical epigenetics,101516977,7.259,0.5999539494514465,0.32441471571906355,0.7224080267558528,0.5693369181658512
A Tox21 Approach to Altered Epigenetic Landscapes: Assessing Epigenetic Toxicity Pathways Leading to Altered Gene Expression and Oncogenic Transformation In Vitro,"An emerging vision for toxicity testing in the 21st century foresees in vitro assays assuming the leading role in testing for chemical hazards, including testing for carcinogenicity. Toxicity will be determined by monitoring key steps in functionally validated molecular pathways, using tests designed to reveal chemically-induced perturbations that lead to adverse phenotypic endpoints in cultured human cells. Risk assessments would subsequently be derived from the causal in vitro endpoints and concentration vs. effect data extrapolated to human in vivo concentrations. Much direct experimental evidence now shows that disruption of epigenetic processes by chemicals is a carcinogenic mode of action that leads to altered gene functions playing causal roles in cancer initiation and progression. In assessing chemical safety, it would therefore be advantageous to consider an emerging class of carcinogens, the epigenotoxicants, with the ability to change chromatin and/or DNA marks by direct or indirect effects on the activities of enzymes (writers, erasers/editors, remodelers and readers) that convey the epigenetic information. Evidence is reviewed supporting a strategy for in vitro hazard identification of carcinogens that induce toxicity through disturbance of functional epigenetic pathways in human somatic cells, leading to inactivated tumour suppressor genes and carcinogenesis. In the context of human cell transformation models, these in vitro pathway measurements ensure high biological relevance to the apical endpoint of cancer. Four causal mechanisms participating in pathways to persistent epigenetic gene silencing were considered: covalent histone modification, nucleosome remodeling, non-coding RNA interaction and DNA methylation. Within these four interacting mechanisms, 25 epigenetic toxicity pathway components (SET1, MLL1, KDM5, G9A, SUV39H1, SETDB1, EZH2, JMJD3, CBX7, CBX8, BMI, SUZ12, HP1, MPP8, DNMT1, DNMT3A, DNMT3B, TET1, MeCP2, SETDB2, BAZ2A, UHRF1, CTCF, HOTAIR and ANRIL) were found to have experimental evidence showing that functional perturbations played ""driver"" roles in human cellular transformation. Measurement of epigenotoxicants presents challenges for short-term carcinogenicity testing, especially in the high-throughput modes emphasized in the Tox21 chemicals testing approach. There is need to develop and validate in vitro tests to detect both, locus-specific, and genome-wide, epigenetic alterations with causal links to oncogenic cellular phenotypes. Some recent examples of cell-based high throughput chemical screening assays are presented that have been applied or have shown potential for application to epigenetic endpoints.",28587163,PMC5486002,10.3390/ijms18061179,13,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,6.208,0.5980774760246277,0.6020066889632107,0.5953177257525084,0.5983113685579204
Insects as models to study the epigenetic basis of disease,"Epigenetic inheritance refers to changes in gene expression that are heritable across generations but are not caused by changes in the DNA sequence. Many environmental factors are now known to cause epigenetic changes, including the presence of pathogens, parasites, harmful chemicals and other stress factors. There is increasing evidence that transcriptional reprogramming caused by epigenetic modifications can be passed from parents to offspring. Indeed, diseases such as cancer can occur in the offspring due to epigenetically-inherited gene expression profiles induced by stress experienced by the parent. Empirical studies to investigate the role of epigenetics in trans-generational gene regulation and disease require appropriate model organisms. In this review, we argue that selected insects can be used as models for human diseases with an epigenetic component because the underlying molecular mechanisms (DNA methylation, histone acetylation and the expression of microRNAs) are evolutionarily conserved. Insects offer a number of advantages over mammalian models including ethical acceptability, short generation times and the potential to investigate complex interacting parameters such as fecundity, longevity, gender ratio, and resistance to pathogens, parasites and environmental stress.",25778758,,10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2015.02.009,37,Progress in biophysics and molecular biology,401233,4.799,0.5974904298782349,0.8294314381270903,0.45819397993311034,0.616019341538981
Epigenomics in an extraterrestrial environment: organ-specific alteration of DNA methylation and gene expression elicited by spaceflight in Arabidopsis thaliana,"Background:Plants adapted to diverse environments on Earth throughout their evolutionary history, and developed mechanisms to thrive in a variety of terrestrial habitats. When plants are grown in the novel environment of spaceflight aboard the International Space Station (ISS), an environment completely outside their evolutionary history, they respond with unique alterations to their gene expression profile. Identifying the genes important for physiological adaptation to spaceflight and dissecting the biological processes and pathways engaged by plants during spaceflight has helped reveal spaceflight adaptation, and has furthered understanding of terrestrial growth processes. However, the underlying regulatory mechanisms responsible for these changes in gene expression patterns are just beginning to be explored. Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation at position five in cytosine, has been shown to play a role in the physiological adaptation to adverse terrestrial environments, and may play a role in spaceflight as well.Results:Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing of DNA of Arabidopsis grown on the ISS from seed revealed organ-specific patterns of differential methylation compared to ground controls. The overall levels of methylation in CG, CHG, and CHH contexts were similar between flight and ground DNA, however, thousands of specifically differentially methylated cytosines were discovered, and there were clear organ-specific differences in methylation patterns. Spaceflight leaves had higher methylation levels in CHG and CHH contexts within protein-coding genes in spaceflight; about a fifth of the leaf genes were also differentially regulated in spaceflight, almost half of which were associated with reactive oxygen signaling.Conclusions:The physiological adaptation of plants to spaceflight is likely nuanced by epigenomic modification. This is the first examination of differential genomic methylation from plants grown completely in the spaceflight environment of the ISS in plant growth hardware developed for informing exploration life support strategies. Yet even in this optimized plant habitat, plants respond as if stressed. These data suggest that gene expression associated with physiological adaptation to spaceflight is regulated in part by methylation strategies similar to those engaged with familiar terrestrial stress responses. The differential methylation maps generated here provide a useful reference for elucidating the layers of regulation of spaceflight responses.",30866818,PMC6416986,10.1186/s12864-019-5554-z,24,BMC genomics,100965258,4.547,0.5959041118621826,0.7591973244147158,0.3979933110367893,0.5889805942076106
"Microbiome, inflammation, epigenetic alterations, and mental diseases","Major mental diseases such as autism, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and major depressive disorder are debilitating illnesses with complex etiologies. Recent findings show that the onset and development of these illnesses cannot be well described by the one-gene; one-disease approach. Instead, their clinical presentation is thought to result from the regulative interplay of a large number of genes. Even though the involvement of many genes are likely, up regulating and activation or down regulation and silencing of these genes by the environmental factors play a crucial role in contributing to their pathogenesis. Much of this interplay may be moderated by epigenetic changes. Similar to genetic mutations, epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation, histone modifications, and RNA interference can influence gene expression and therefore may cause behavioral and neuronal changes observed in mental disorders. Environmental factors such as diet, gut microbiota, and infections have significant role in these epigenetic modifications. Studies show that bioactive nutrients and gut microbiota can alter either DNA methylation and histone signatures through a variety of mechanisms. Indeed, microbes within the human gut may play a significant role in the regulation of various elements of ""gut-brain axis,"" via their influence on inflammatory cytokines and production of antimicrobial peptides that affect the epigenome through their involvement in generating short chain fatty acids, vitamin synthesis, and nutrient absorption. In addition, they may participate in-gut production of many common neurotransmitters. In this review we will consider the potential interactions of diet, gastrointestinal microbiome, inflammation, and epigenetic alterations in psychiatric disorders.",28691768,PMC9586840,10.1002/ajmg.b.32567,94,"American journal of medical genetics.

The Development of Epigenetics in the Study of Disease Pathogenesis,"The study of epigenetics has its roots in the study of organism change over time and response to environmental change, although over the past several decades the definition has been formalized to include heritable alterations in gene expression that are not a result of alterations in underlying DNA sequence. In this chapter, we discuss first the history and milestones in the 100+ years of epigenetic study, including early discoveries of DNA methylation, histone posttranslational modification, and noncoding RNA. We then discuss how epigenetics has changed the way that we think of both health and disease, offering as examples studies examining the epigenetic contributions to aging, including the recent development of an epigenetic ""clock"", and explore how antiaging therapies may work through epigenetic modifications. We then discuss a nonpathogenic role for epigenetics in the clinic: epigenetic biomarkers. We conclude by offering two examples of modern state-of-the-art integrated multi-omics studies of epigenetics in disease pathogenesis, one which sought to capture shared mechanisms among multiple diseases, and another which used epigenetic big data to better understand the pathogenesis of a single tissue from one disease.",32445091,,10.1007/978-981-15-3449-2_2,12,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,121103,3.65,0.5956101417541504,0.5886287625418061,0.22408026755852842,0.5199078910725572
Molecular Pathways: At the Crossroads of Cancer Epigenetics and Immunotherapy,"Epigenetic regulation allows heritably modulating gene expression profiles without modifying the primary sequence of gDNA. Under physiologic conditions, epigenetic patterns determine tissue-specific gene expression landscapes, gene imprinting, inactivation of chromosome X, and preservation of genomic stability. The most characterized mediators of epigenetic inheritance are gDNA methylation and histone posttranslational modifications that cooperate to alter chromatin state and genome transcription. According to these notions, it is not surprising that cancer cells invariantly deploy epigenetic alterations to achieve gene expression patterns required for neoplastic transformation and tumor progression. In this context, the recently uncovered use of epigenetic alterations by cancer cells to become stealth from the host's immune recognition has significant immunobiologic relevance in tumor progression, and it appears to have potential clinical usefulness. Indeed, immune evasion is among the major obstacles to further improve the efficacy of cancer immunotherapies and to increase long-lasting disease control. Luckily, different ""epigenetic drugs"" able to revert these ""epimutations"" are available, some of which have already been approved for clinical use. Here, we summarize the immunomodulatory activities of epigenetic drugs that lead to improved immune recognition of cancer cells and focus on the potential of this class of agents in improving the anticancer activity of novel immunotherapies through combinatorial epigenetic immunotherapy approaches.",26374074,,10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-14-2914,57,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for,9502500,13.801,0.5945512652397156,0.8963210702341137,0.8963210702341137,0.7152591872374747
Drugs and Epigenetic Molecular Functions. A Pharmacological Data Scientometric Analysis,"Interactions of drugs with the classical epigenetic mechanism of DNA methylation or histone modification are increasingly being elucidated mechanistically and used to develop novel classes of epigenetic therapeutics. A data science approach is used to synthesize current knowledge on the pharmacological implications of epigenetic regulation of gene expression. Computer-aided knowledge discovery for epigenetic implications of current approved or investigational drugs was performed by querying information from multiple publicly available gold-standard sources to (i) identify enzymes involved in classical epigenetic processes, (ii) screen original biomedical scientific publications including bibliometric analyses, (iii) identify drugs that interact with epigenetic enzymes, including their additional non-epigenetic targets, and (iv) analyze computational functional genomics of drugs with epigenetic interactions. PubMed database search yielded 3051 hits on epigenetics and drugs, starting in 1992 and peaking in 2016. Annual citations increased to a plateau in 2000 and show a downward trend since 2008. Approved and investigational drugs in the DrugBank database included 122 compounds that interacted with 68 unique epigenetic enzymes. Additional molecular functions modulated by these drugs included other enzyme interactions, whereas modulation of ion channels or G-protein-coupled receptors were underrepresented. Epigenetic interactions included (i) drug-induced modulation of DNA methylation, (ii) drug-induced modulation of histone conformations, and (iii) epigenetic modulation of drug effects by interference with pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics. Interactions of epigenetic molecular functions and drugs are mutual. Recent research activities on the discovery and development of novel epigenetic therapeutics have passed successfully, whereas epigenetic effects of non-epigenetic drugs or epigenetically induced changes in the targets of common drugs have not yet received the necessary systematic attention in the context of pharmacological plasticity.",34298869,PMC8311652,10.3390/ijms22147250,6,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,6.208,0.5933736562728882,0.36454849498327757,0.5986622073578596,0.5486663342319604
Coupling epigenetics and RNA polyadenylation: missing links,"Precise regulation of gene expression is crucial for plant survival. As a cotranscriptional regulatory mechanism, pre-mRNA polyadenylation is essential for fine-tuning gene expression. Polyadenylation can be alternatively projected at various sites of a transcript, which contributes to transcriptome diversity. Epigenetic modification is another mechanism of transcriptional control. Recent studies have uncovered crosstalk between cotranscriptional polyadenylation processes and both epigenomic and epitranscriptomic markers. Genetic analyses have demonstrated that DNA methylation, histone modifications, and epitranscriptomic modification are involved in regulating polyadenylation in plants. Here we summarize current understanding of the links between epigenetics and polyadenylation and their novel biological efficacy for plant development and environmental responses. Unresolved issues and future directions are discussed to shed light on the field.",36175275,,10.1016/j.tplants.2022.08.023,2,Trends in plant science,9890299,22.012,0.5926666259765625,0.15384615384615385,0.959866220735786,0.5783424505023255
Crosstalk between metabolism and epigenetic modifications in autoimmune diseases: a comprehensive overview,"Little information is available regarding mechanistic links between epigenetic modifications and autoimmune diseases. It seems plausible to surmise that aberrant gene expression and energy metabolism would disrupt immune tolerance, which could ultimately result in autoimmune responses. Metaboloepigenetics is an emerging paradigm that defines the interrelationships between metabolism and epigenetics. Epigenetic modifications, such as the methylation/demethylation of DNA and histone proteins and histone acetylation/deacetylation can be dynamically produced and eliminated by a group of enzymes that consume several metabolites derived from various physiological pathways. Recent insights into cellular metabolism have demonstrated that environmental stimuli such as dietary exposure and nutritional status act through the variation in concentration of metabolites to affect epigenetic regulation and breakdown biochemical homeostasis. Metabolites, including S-adenosylmethionine, acetyl-CoA, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, Î±-ketoglutarate, and ATP serve as cofactors for chromatin-modifying enzymes, such as methyltransferases, deacetylases and kinases, which are responsible for chromatin remodelling. The concentration of crucial nutrients, such as glucose, glutamine, and oxygen, spatially and temporally modulate epigenetic modifications to regulate gene expression and the reaction to stressful microenvironments in disease pathology. In this review, we focus on the interaction between metabolic intermediates and epigenetic modifications, integrating environmental signals with programmes through modification of the epigenome-metabolome to speculate as to how this may influence autoimmune diseases.",29974127,PMC11105184,10.1007/s00018-018-2864-2,25,Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS,9705402,9.207,0.590011715888977,0.7725752508361204,0.8193979933110368,0.6724016783628177
Context-Dependent Functions of KDM6 Lysine Demethylases in Physiology and Disease,"Histone lysine methylation is a major epigenetic modification that participates in several cellular processes including gene regulation and chromatin structure. This mark can go awry in disease contexts such as cancer. Two decades ago, the discovery of histone demethylase enzymes thirteen years ago sheds light on the complexity of the regulation of this mark. Here we address the roles of lysine demethylases JMJD3 and UTX in physiological and disease contexts. The two demethylases play pivotal roles in many developmental and disease contexts via regulation of di- and trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27me2/3) in repressing gene expression programs. JMJD3 and UTX participate in several biochemical settings including methyltransferase and chromatin remodeling complexes. They have histone demethylase-dependent and -independent activities and a variety of context-specific interacting factors. The structure, amounts, and function of the demethylases can be altered in disease due to genetic alterations or aberrant gene regulation. Therefore, academic and industrial initiatives have targeted these enzymes using a number of small molecule compounds in therapeutic approaches. In this chapter, we will touch upon inhibitor formulations, their properties, and current efforts to test them in preclinical contexts to optimize their therapeutic outcomes. Demethylase inhibitors are currently used in targeted therapeutic approaches that might be particularly effective when used in conjunction with systemic approaches such as chemotherapy.",37751139,,10.1007/978-3-031-38176-8_7,0,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,121103,3.65,0.5893619060516357,0.023411371237458192,0.22742474916387959,0.40378436771124904
DNA Methylation Profiling of hTERT Gene Alongside with the Telomere Performance in Gastric Adenocarcinoma,"Purpose:Epigenetic modification including of DNA methylation, histone acetylation, histone methylation, histon phosphorylation and non-coding RNA can impress the gene expression and genomic stability and cause different types of malignancies and also main human disorder. Conspicuously, the epigenetic alteration special DNA methylation controls telomere length, telomerase activity and also function of different genes particularly hTERT expression. Telomeres are important in increasing the lifespan, health, aging, and the development and progression of some diseases like cancer.Methods:This review provides an assessment of the epigenetic alterations of telomeres, telomerase and repression of its catalytic subunit, hTERT and function of long non-coding RNAs such as telomeric-repeat containing RNA (TERRA) in carcinogenesis and tumorgenesis of gastric cancer.Results:hTERT expression is essential and indispensable in telomerase activation through immortality and malignancies and also plays an important role in maintaining telomere length. Telomeres and telomerase have been implicated in regulating epigenetic factors influencing certain gene expression. Correspondingly, these changes in the sub telomere and telomere regions are affected by the shortening of telomere length and increased telomerase activity and hTERT gene expression have been observed in many cancers, remarkably in gastric cancer.Conclusion:Epigenetic alteration and regulation of hTERT gene expression are critical in controlling telomerase activity and its expression.

Epigenomics and the microbiota,"The mammalian gastrointestinal tract is home to trillions of commensal microorganisms that collectively make up the intestinal microbiota. These microbes are important environmental factors that regulate homeostasis, and alterations in the composition of the microbiota have been associated with several diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes, and cancer. New research is beginning to uncover epigenomic pathways that may regulate this relationship with the microbiota. Epigenomic modifications alter the structure of the chromatin and therefore regulate the transcriptional program of a cell. These modifications are maintained by the dynamic activity of various modifying and demodifying enzymes, the activities of which can be influenced by metabolites and other environmental cues. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are a class of epigenomic-modifying enzymes that are regulated by both endogenous and exogenous factors, and recent studies have suggested that host HDAC expression is important for regulating communication between the intestinal microbiota and mammalian host cells.",25330924,PMC4310797,10.1177/0192623314553805,17,Toxicologic pathology,7905907,1.93,0.5890073776245117,0.6688963210702341,0.11705685618729098,0.5105950620262121
The Impact of Nutrition and Environmental Epigenetics on Human Health and Disease,"Environmental epigenetics describes how environmental factors affect cellular epigenetics and, hence, human health. Epigenetic marks alter the spatial conformation of chromatin to regulate gene expression. Environmental factors with epigenetic effects include behaviors, nutrition, and chemicals and industrial pollutants. Epigenetic mechanisms are also implicated during development in utero and at the cellular level, so environmental exposures may harm the fetus by impairing the epigenome of the developing organism to modify disease risk later in life. By contrast, bioactive food components may trigger protective epigenetic modifications throughout life, with early life nutrition being particularly important. Beyond their genetics, the overall health status of an individual may be regarded as an integration of many environmental signals starting at gestation and acting through epigenetic modifications. This review explores how the environment affects the epigenome in health and disease, with a particular focus on cancer. Understanding the molecular effects of behavior, nutrients, and pollutants might be relevant for developing preventative strategies and personalized heath programs. Furthermore, by restoring cellular differentiation, epigenetic drugs could represent a potential strategy for the treatment of many diseases including cancer.",30388784,PMC6275017,10.3390/ijms19113425,118,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,6.208,0.5886526703834534,0.9632107023411371,0.6020066889632107,0.6662350804909416
Applications of bioinformatics in epigenetics,"Epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation, post-translational chromatin modifications and non-coding RNA-mediated mechanisms are responsible for epigenetic inheritance. Change in gene expression due to these epigenetic modifications are responsible for new traits in different organisms leading to various diseases including cancer, diabetic kidney disease (DKD), diabetic nephropathy (DN) and renal fibrosis. Bioinformatics is an effective approach for epigenomic profiling. These epigenomic data can be analyzed by a large number of bioinformatics tools and software. Many databases are available online, which comprises huge amount of information regarding these modifications. Recent methodologies include many sequencing and analytical techniques to extrapolate different types of epigenetic data. This data can be used to design drugs against diseases linked to epigenetic modifications.

Recent advances in class IIa histone deacetylases research,"Epigenetic control plays an important role in gene regulation through chemical modifications of DNA and post-translational modifications of histones. An essential post-translational modification is the histone acetylation/deacetylation-process which is regulated by histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs). The mammalian zinc dependent HDAC family is subdivided into three classes: class I (HDACs 1-3, 8), class II (IIa: HDACs 4, 5, 7, 9; IIb: HDACs 6, 10) and class IV (HDAC 11).

Emerging technologies for studying DNA methylation for the molecular diagnosis of cancer,"DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism that plays a key role in regulating gene expression and other functions. Although this modification is seen in different sequence contexts, the most frequently detected DNA methylation in mammals involves cytosine-guanine dinucleotides. Pathological alterations in DNA methylation patterns are described in a variety of human diseases, including cancer. Unlike genetic changes, DNA methylation is heavily influenced by subtle modifications in the cellular microenvironment. In all cancers, aberrant DNA methylation is involved in the alteration of a large number of oncological pathways with relevant theranostic utility. Several technologies for DNA methylation mapping have been developed recently and successfully applied in cancer studies. The scope of these technologies varies from assessing a single cytosine-guanine locus to genome-wide distribution of DNA methylation. Here, we review the strengths and weaknesses of these approaches in the context of clinical utility for the molecular diagnosis of human cancers.",25797072,PMC4422757,10.1586/14737159.2015.1027194,16,Expert review of molecular diagnostics,101120777,5.67,0.5874106884002686,0.6555183946488294,0.5351170568561873,0.5905735033411645
"Two genomes, one cell: Mitochondrial-nuclear coordination via epigenetic pathways","Background:Virtually all eukaryotic cells contain spatially distinct genomes, a single nuclear genome that harbours the vast majority of genes and much smaller genomes found in mitochondria present at thousands of copies per cell. To generate a coordinated gene response to various environmental cues, the genomes must communicate with each another. Much of this bi-directional crosstalk relies on epigenetic processes, including DNA, RNA, and histone modification pathways. Crucially, these pathways, in turn depend on many metabolites generated in specific pools throughout the cell, including the mitochondria. They also involve the transport of metabolites as well as the enzymes that catalyse these modifications between nuclear and mitochondrial genomes.Scope of review:This study examines some of the molecular mechanisms by which metabolites influence the activity of epigenetic enzymes, ultimately affecting gene regulation in response to metabolic cues. We particularly focus on the subcellular localisation of metabolite pools and the crosstalk between mitochondrial and nuclear proteins and RNAs. We consider aspects of mitochondrial-nuclear communication involving histone proteins, and potentially their epigenetic marks, and discuss how nuclear-encoded enzymes regulate mitochondrial function through epitranscriptomic pathways involving various classes of RNA molecules within mitochondria.Major conclusions:Epigenetic communication between nuclear and mitochondrial genomes occurs at multiple levels, ultimately ensuring a coordinated gene expression response between different genetic environments. Metabolic changes stimulated, for example, by environmental factors, such as diet or physical activity, alter the relative abundances of various metabolites, thereby directly affecting the epigenetic machinery. These pathways, coupled to regulated protein and RNA transport mechanisms, underpin the coordinated gene expression response. Their overall importance to the fitness of a cell is highlighted by the identification of many mutations in the pathways we discuss that have been linked to human disease including cancer.",32217072,PMC7300384,10.1016/j.molmet.2020.01.006,40,Molecular metabolism,101605730,8.568,0.5865820646286011,0.8394648829431438,0.7692307692307693,0.6736883692119433
Genomic and Epigenomic Alterations in Cancer,"Multiple genetic and epigenetic events characterize tumor progression and define the identity of the tumors. Advances in high-throughput technologies, like gene expression profiling, next-generation sequencing, proteomics, and metabolomics, have enabled detailed molecular characterization of various tumors. The integration and analyses of these high-throughput data have unraveled many novel molecular aberrations and network alterations in tumors. These molecular alterations include multiple cancer-driving mutations, gene fusions, amplification, deletion, and post-translational modifications, among others. Many of these genomic events are being used in cancer diagnosis, whereas others are therapeutically targeted with small-molecule inhibitors. Multiple genes/enzymes that play a role in DNA and histone modifications are also altered in various cancers, changing the epigenomic landscape during cancer initiation and progression. Apart from protein-coding genes, studies are uncovering the critical regulatory roles played by noncoding RNAs and noncoding regions of the genome during cancer progression. Many of these genomic and epigenetic events function in tandem to drive tumor development and metastasis. Concurrent advances in genome-modulating technologies, like gene silencing and genome editing, are providing ability to understand in detail the process of cancer initiation, progression, and signaling as well as opening up avenues for therapeutic targeting.

Epigenetic control of transposable elements and cell fate decision,"Transposable elements (TEs) are the most prevalent elements in mammalian genomes. Although potential risks for genome stability, they are a pool of potential regulatory sequences, chromatin control elements, protein-coding genes, and substrates for evolutionary processes. Consequently, a delicate balance is maintained between the potential benefits and deleterious aspects of TEs, and this balance is mediated by the epigenetic regulatory system. In this review, we introduce the role of heterochromatin associated epigentic modifications such as histone 3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) and DNA methylation in the silencing of TEs as well as epigenetic modifications such as histone 3 lysine 4 monomethylation (H3K4me1) and histone 3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac) in activation of TEs. Further, we elaborate the functions of TEs as binding sites of transcription factors and as anchors of chromosomal conformation in regulation of gene expression. We introduce the impact of TEs on the process of cell fate determination including natural embryonic development in vivo and artificial cell fate transition in vitro. We discuss the main challenges associated with computational TEs analysis and TEs functions exploration, as well as the different experimental and computational strategies in studying these processes.

Analysis of Combinatorial Epigenomic States,"Hundreds of distinct chemical modifications to DNA and histone amino acids have been described. Regulation exerted by these so-called epigenetic marks is vital to normal development, stability of cell identity through mitosis, and nongenetic transmission of traits between generations through meiosis. Loss of this regulation contributes to many diseases.

Epigenetic Alterations and Inflammation as Emerging Use for the Advancement of Treatment in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer,"Lung cancer remains one of the most common malignancies in the world. Nowadays, the most common lung cancer is non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), namely, adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell lung carcinoma. Epigenetic alterations that refer to DNA methylation, histone modifications, and noncoding RNA expression, are now suggested to drive the genesis and development of NSCLC. Additionally, inflammation-related tumorigenesis also plays a vital role in cancer research and efforts have been attempted to reverse such condition. During the occurrence and development of inflammatory diseases, the immune component of inflammation may cause epigenetic changes, but it is not always certain whether the immune component itself or the stimulated host cells cause epigenetic changes. Moreover, the links between epigenetic alterations and cancer-related inflammation and their influences on the human cancer are not clear so far. Therefore, the connection between epigenetic drivers, inflammation, and NSCLC will be summarized. Investigation on such topic is most likely to shed light on the molecular and immunological mechanisms of epigenetic and inflammatory factors and promote the application of epigenetics in the innovative diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for NSCLC.",35514980,PMC9066637,10.3389/fimmu.2022.878740,15,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,8.786,0.5831440091133118,0.6354515050167224,0.7959866220735786,0.6361740308860473
The Advances in Epigenetics for Cancer Radiotherapy,"Cancer is an important factor threatening human life and health; in recent years, its morbidity and mortality remain high and demosntrate an upward trend. It is of great significance to study its pathogenesis and targeted therapy. As the complex mechanisms of epigenetic modification has been increasingly discovered, they are more closely related to the occurrence and development of cancer. As a reversible response, epigenetic modification is of great significance for the improvement of classical therapeutic measures and the discovery of new therapeutic targets. It has become a research focusto explore the multi-level mechanisms of RNA, DNA, chromatin and proteins. As an important means of cancer treatment, radiotherapy has made great progress in technology, methods, means and targeted sensitization after years of rapid development, and even research on radiotherapy based on epigenetic modification is rampant. A series of epigenetic effects of radiation on DNA methylation, histone modification, chromosome remodeling, RNA modification and non-coding RNA during radiotherapy affects the therapeutic effects and prognosis. Starting from the epigenetic mechanism of tumorigenesis, this paper reviews the latest progress in the mechanism of interaction between epigenetic modification and cancer radiotherapy and briefly introduces the main types, mechanisms and applications of epigenetic modifiers used for radiotherapy sensitization in order to explore a more individual and dynamic approach of cancer treatment based on epigenetic mechanism.

Epigenetic Regulation of BDNF Gene during Development and Diseases,"Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is required for the development of the nervous system, proper cognitive function and memory formation. While aberrant expression of BDNF has been implicated in neurological disorders, the transcriptional regulation of BDNF remains to be elucidated. In response to different stimuli, BDNF expression can be initiated from different promoters. Several studies have suggested that the expression of BDNF is regulated by promoter methylation. An emerging theme points to the possibility that histone modifications at the BDNF promoters may link to the neurological pathology. Thus, understanding the epigenetic regulation at the BDNF promoters will shed light on future therapies for neurological disorders. The present review summarizes the current knowledge of histone modifications of the BDNF gene in neuronal diseases, as well as the developmental regulation of the BDNF gene based on data from the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE).",28272318,PMC5372587,10.3390/ijms18030571,31,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,6.208,0.5816001296043396,0.7926421404682275,0.6086956521739131,0.6292276362910318
Piecing together cis-regulatory networks: insights from epigenomics studies in plants,"5-Methylcytosine, a chemical modification of DNA, is a covalent modification found in the genomes of both plants and animals. Epigenetic inheritance of phenotypes mediated by DNA methylation is well established in plants. Most of the known mechanisms of establishing, maintaining and modifying DNA methylation have been worked out in the reference plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Major functions of DNA methylation in plants include regulation of gene expression and silencing of transposable elements (TEs) and repetitive sequences, both of which have parallels in mammalian biology, involve interaction with the transcriptional machinery, and may have profound effects on the regulatory networks in the cell. Methylome and transcriptome dynamics have been investigated in development and environmental responses in Arabidopsis and agriculturally and ecologically important plants, revealing the interdependent relationship among genomic context, methylation patterns, and expression of TE and protein coding genes. Analyses of methylome variation among plant natural populations and species have begun to quantify the extent of genetic control of methylome variation vs. true epimutation, and model the evolutionary forces driving methylome evolution in both short and long time scales. The ability of DNA methylation to positively or negatively modulate binding affinity of transcription factors (TFs) provides a natural link from genome sequence and methylation changes to transcription. Technologies that allow systematic determination of methylation sensitivities of TFs, in native genomic and methylation context without confounding factors such as histone modifications, will provide baseline datasets for building cell-type- and individual-specific regulatory networks that underlie the establishment and inheritance of complex traits.

Genome-Wide DNA Methylation Protocol for Epigenetics Studies,"Epigenetic modification are heritable changes in gene expression not encoded by the DNA sequence therefore playing a significant role in a broad range of biological processes and diseases.A key player of the epigenetic modifications is the DNA methylation, a process involving the covalent transfer of a methyl group to the C-5 position of the cytosine ring of DNA forming 5-methylcytosine (5mC), catalyzed by DNA methyltransferases. Altering the structure of the chromatin, DNA methylation has the potential to down-regulate gene expression.The here presented protocol shows a method to obtain DNA samples ready for NGS sequencing for genome-wide methylation analysis.",35727538,,10.1007/978-1-0716-2313-8_2,0,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,0.0,0.5813624858856201,0.033444816053511704,0.05016722408026756,0.36553989955812793
MicroRNAs and Epigenetics,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression mainly at the posttranscriptional level. Similar to protein-coding genes, their expression is also controlled by genetic and epigenetic mechanisms. Disruption of these control processes leads to abnormal expression of miRNAs in cancer. In this chapter, we discuss the supportive links between miRNAs and epigenetics in the context of carcinogenesis. miRNAs can be epigenetically regulated by DNA methylation and/or specific histone modifications. However, they can themselves (epi-miRNAs) repress key enzymes that drive epigenetic remodeling and also bind to complementary sequences in gene promoters, recruiting specific protein complexes that modulate chromatin structure and gene expression. All these issues affect the transcriptional landscape of cells. Most important, in the cancer clinical scenario, knowledge about miRNAs epigenetic dysregulation can not only be beneficial as a prognostic biomarker, but can also help in the design of new therapeutic approaches.",28882223,,10.1016/bs.acr.2017.06.003,48,Advances in cancer research,370416,5.767,0.5807682275772095,0.8795986622073578,0.5551839464882943,0.6354174582854561
[Metal-mediated Epigenetic Regulation of Gene Expression],"Epigenetics is the study of heritable changes in gene expression that occur without alterations in the DNA sequence. Several studies have shown that environmental chemicals can alter epigenetic modifications, including histone modifications and DNA methylation. Environmental chemicals may show toxic effects via epigenetic mechanism-regulated changes in gene expression. Previously, we reported that zinc treatment rapidly decreased Lys(4)-trimethylated and Lys(9)-acetylated histone H3 in the metallothionein (MT) promoter, and also decreased total histone H3. The chromatin structure in the MT promoter may be locally disrupted by zinc-induced nucleosome removal. We also showed that chromium (VI) inhibited MT gene transcription by modifying the transcription potential of the co-activator p300. MT is a small cysteine-rich protein that is active in zinc homeostasis, cadmium detoxification, and protection against reactive oxygen species. Epigenetic changes might influence the cytoprotective function of the MT gene. In this review, I briefly summarize the results of previous studies and discuss the mechanisms and toxicological significance of metal-mediated epigenetic modifications.",28250320,,10.1248/yakushi.16-00230-4,1,Yakugaku zasshi : Journal of the Pharmaceutical Society of Japan,413613,0.314,0.5801141858100891,0.0903010033444816,0.10033444816053512,0.3861956017870568
The emerging role of mRNA methylation in normal and pathological behavior,"Covalent RNA modifications were recently rediscovered as abundant RNA chemical tags. Similarly to DNA epigenetic modifications, they have been proposed as essential regulators of gene expression. Here we focus on 3 of the most abundant adenosine methylations: N6-methyladenosine (m6A), N6,2'-O-dimethyladenosine (m6Am) and N1-methyladenosine (m1A). We review the potential role of these modifications on mature mRNA in regulating gene expression within the adult brain, nervous system function and normal and pathological behavior. Dynamic mRNA modifications, summarized as the epitranscriptome, regulate transcript maturation, translation and decay, and thus crucially determine gene expression beyond primary transcription regulation. However, the extent of this regulation in the healthy and maladapted adult brain is poorly understood. Analyzing this novel layer of gene expression control in addition to epigenetics and posttranslational regulation of proteins will be highly relevant for understanding the molecular underpinnings of behavior and psychiatric disorders.",29027751,,10.1111/gbb.12428,40,"Genes, brain, and behavior",101129617,3.708,0.5767803192138672,0.842809364548495,0.2608695652173913,0.5668039774814975
Chromatin modifications and genomic contexts linked to dynamic DNA methylation patterns across human cell types,"DNA methylation is related closely to sequence contexts and chromatin modifications; however, their potential differences in different genomic regions across cell types remain largely unexplored. We used publicly available genome-scale DNA methylation and histone modification profiles to study their relationships among different genomic regions in human embryonic stem cells (H1), H1-derived neuronal progenitor cultured cells (NPC), and foetal fibroblasts (IMR90) using the Random forests classifier. Histone modifications achieved high accuracy in modelling DNA methylation patterns on a genome scale in the three cell types. The inclusion of sequence features helped improve accuracy only in non-promoter regions of IMR90. Furthermore, the top six feature combinations obtained by mean decrease Gini were important indicators of different DNA methylation patterns, suggesting that H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 are important indicators that are independent of genomic regions and cell types. H3K9me3 was IMR90-specific and exhibited a genomic region-specific correlation with DNA methylation. Variations of essential chromatin modification signals may effectively discriminate changes of DNA methylation between H1 and IMR90. Genes with different co-variations of epigenetic marks exhibited genomic region-specific biological relevance. This study provides an integrated strategy to identify systematically essential epigenetic and genetic elements of genomic region-specific and cell type-specific DNA methylation patterns.",25673498,PMC4325317,10.1038/srep08410,5,Scientific reports,101563288,4.996,0.5757668614387512,0.3311036789297659,0.48494983277591974,0.5086708192043878
"A pan-cancer analysis of driver gene mutations, DNA methylation and gene expressions reveals that chromatin remodeling is a major mechanism inducing global changes in cancer epigenomes","Background:Recent large-scale cancer sequencing studies have discovered many novel cancer driver genes (CDGs) in human cancers. Some studies also suggest that CDG mutations contribute to cancer-associated epigenomic and transcriptomic alterations across many cancer types. Here we aim to improve our understanding of the connections between CDG mutations and altered cancer cell epigenomes and transcriptomes on pan-cancer level and how these connections contribute to the known association between epigenome and transcriptome.Method:Using multi-omics data including somatic mutation, DNA methylation, and gene expression data of 20 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project, we conducted a pan-cancer analysis to identify CDGs, when mutated, have strong associations with genome-wide methylation or expression changes across cancer types, which we refer as methylation driver genes (MDGs) or expression driver genes (EDGs), respectively.Results:We identified 32 MDGs, among which, eight are known chromatin modification or remodeling genes. Many of the remaining 24 MDGs are connected to chromatin regulators through either regulating their transcription or physically interacting with them as potential co-factors. We identified 29 EDGs, 26 of which are also MDGs. Further investigation on target genes' promoters methylation and expression alteration patterns of these 26 overlapping driver genes shows that hyper-methylation of target genes' promoters are significantly associated with down-regulation of the same target genes and hypo-methylation of target genes' promoters are significantly associated with up-regulation of the same target genes.Conclusion:This finding suggests a pivotal role for genetically driven changes in chromatin remodeling in shaping DNA methylation and gene expression patterns during tumor development.",30400878,PMC6218985,10.1186/s12920-018-0425-z,10,BMC medical genomics,101319628,3.622,0.5730214715003967,0.5217391304347826,0.20735785953177258,0.48963228089354904
"Epigenetics, Nutrition, Disease and Drug Development","Epigenetic mechanisms comprising of DNA methylation, histone modifications and gene silencing by RNA interference have been strongly linked to the development and progression of various diseases. These findings have triggered research on epigenetic functions and signal pathways as targets for novel drug discovery. Dietary intake has also presented significant influence on human health and disease development and nutritional modifications have proven important in prevention, but also the treatment of disease. Moreover, a strong link between nutrition and epigenetic changes has been established. Therefore, in attempts to develop novel safer and more efficacious drugs, both nutritional requirements and epigenetic mechanisms need to be addressed.",29692252,,10.2174/1570163815666180419154954,1,Current drug discovery technologies,101157212,0.0,0.5727227926254272,0.09364548494983277,0.05351170568561873,0.37306511370234663
From air pollution to cardiovascular diseases: the emerging role of epigenetics,"The association between air pollution and a wide-ranging spectrum of acute and chronic disorders-including cardiovascular diseases-is widely acknowledged. Exposure to airborne pollutants triggers harmful mechanisms such as oxidative stress and systemic inflammation, which lead to increased incidence of myocardial infarction, arterial hypertension, stroke, and heart failure. Sustained efforts have been made in recent years to discover how environmental exposures affect human health through epigenetic phenomena, such as DNA methylation, histone modifications and non-coding RNA-mediated gene regulation. This review summarizes the current evidences on the relationship between air pollution exposure, epigenetic alterations and cardiovascular impact, in view of present implications and future perspectives.",32506306,,10.1007/s11033-020-05570-9,4,Molecular biology reports,403234,2.742,0.571647047996521,0.2809364548494983,0.14046822742474915,0.42726916525276215
epidecodeR: a functional exploration tool for epigenetic and epitranscriptomic regulation,"Recent technological advances in sequencing DNA and RNA modifications using high-throughput platforms have generated vast epigenomic and epitranscriptomic datasets whose power in transforming life science is yet fully unleashed. Currently available in silico methods have facilitated the identification, positioning and quantitative comparisons of individual modification sites. However, the essential challenge to link specific 'epi-marks' to gene expression in the particular context of cellular and biological processes is unmet. To fast-track exploration, we generated epidecodeR implemented in R, which allows biologists to quickly survey whether an epigenomic or epitranscriptomic status of their interest potentially influences gene expression responses. The evaluation is based on the cumulative distribution function and the statistical significance in differential expression of genes grouped by the number of 'epi-marks'. This tool proves useful in predicting the role of H3K9ac and H3K27ac in associated gene expression after knocking down deacetylases FAM60A and SDS3 and N6-methyl-adenosine-associated gene expression after knocking out the reader proteins. We further used epidecodeR to explore the effectiveness of demethylase FTO inhibitors and histone-associated modifications in drug abuse in animals. epidecodeR is available for downloading as an R package at https://bioconductor.riken.jp/packages/3.13/bioc/html/epidecodeR.html.",38271482,,10.1093/bib/bbad521,0,Briefings in bioinformatics,100912837,13.994,0.5715872645378113,0.03678929765886288,0.8996655518394648,0.5302433286223522
Role of epigenetics in innate lymphoid cells,"Epigenetics plays a crucial role in gene regulation and cell function without changing the DNA sequence. The process of differentiation in eukaryotes during cellular morphogenesis is a paradigm of epigenetic change; stem cells develop into pluripotent cell lines in the embryo, eventually becoming terminally developed cells. Recently, epigenetic changes were shown to play an important role in immune cell development, activation and differentiation, which impacts chromatin remodeling, DNA methylation, post-translational histone modifications and small or lncRNA engagement. Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are newly identified immune cells that lack antigen receptors. ILCs differentiate from hematopoietic stem cells via multipotent progenitor stages. In this editorial, the authors discuss the epigenetic regulation of ILC differentiation and function.",37435673,,10.2217/epi-2023-0221,0,Epigenomics,101519720,4.357,0.5712883472442627,0.04013377926421405,0.35785953177257523,0.42237167055391545
The 'Alu-ome' shapes the epigenetic environment of regulatory elements controlling cellular defense,"Promoters and enhancers are sites of transcription initiation (TSSs) and carry specific histone modifications, including H3K4me1, H3K4me3, and H3K27ac. Yet, the principles governing the boundaries of such regulatory elements are still poorly characterized. Alu elements are good candidates for a boundary function, being highly abundant in gene-rich regions, while essentially excluded from regulatory elements. Here, we show that the interval ranging from TSS to first upstream Alu, accommodates all H3K4me3 and most H3K27ac marks, while excluding DNA methylation. Remarkably, the average length of these intervals greatly varies in-between tissues, being longer in stem- and shorter in immune-cells. The very shortest TSS-to-first-Alu intervals were observed at promoters active in T-cells, particularly at immune genes, where first-Alus were traversed by RNA polymerase II transcription, while accumulating H3K4me1 signal. Finally, DNA methylation at first-Alus was found to evolve with age, regressing from young to middle-aged, then recovering later in life. Thus, the first-Alus upstream of TSSs appear as dynamic boundaries marking the transition from DNA methylation to active histone modifications at regulatory elements, while also participating in the recording of immune gene transcriptional events by positioning H3K4me1-modified nucleosomes.",35544277,PMC9122584,10.1093/nar/gkac346,2,Nucleic acids research,411011,19.16,0.5709893107414246,0.15719063545150502,0.9531772575250836,0.5646671650401724
Epigenetic reprogramming during prostate cancer progression: A perspective from development,"Conrad Waddington's theory of epigenetic landscape epitomize the process of cell fate and cellular decision-making during development. Wherein the epigenetic code maintains patterns of gene expression in pluripotent and differentiated cellular states during embryonic development and differentiation. Over the years disruption or reprogramming of the epigenetic landscape has been extensively studied in the course of cancer progression. Cellular dedifferentiation being a key hallmark of cancer allow us to take cues from the biological processes involving epigenetic reprogramming in development such as the cellular differentiation and morphogenesis. Here, we discuss the role of epigenetic landscape and its modifiers in cell-fate determination, differentiation and prostate cancer progression. Lately, the emergence of RNA-modifications has also furthered our understanding of epigenetics in cancer. The overview of the epigenetic code regulating androgen signalling, and progression to aggressive neuroendocrine stage of PCa reinforces its gene regulatory functions during the development of prostate gland as well as cancer progression. Additionally, we also highlight the clinical implications of cancer cell epigenome, and discuss the recent advancements in the therapeutic strategies targeting the advanced stage disease.",33545340,PMC7612861,10.1016/j.semcancer.2021.01.009,9,Seminars in cancer biology,9010218,17.012,0.5696132779121399,0.47491638795986624,0.9230769230769231,0.6213666289546419
Epigenetic modification mechanisms involved in keloid: current status and prospect,"Keloid, a common dermal fibroproliferative disorder, is benign skin tumors characterized by the aggressive fibroblasts proliferation and excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix. However, common therapeutic approaches of keloid have limited effectiveness, emphasizing the momentousness of developing innovative mechanisms and therapeutic strategies. Epigenetics, representing the potential link of complex interactions between genetics and external risk factors, is currently under intense scrutiny. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that multiple diverse and reversible epigenetic modifications, represented by DNA methylation, histone modification, and non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), play a critical role in gene regulation and downstream fibroblastic function in keloid. Importantly, abnormal epigenetic modification manipulates multiple behaviors of keloid-derived fibroblasts, which served as the main cellular components in keloid skin tissue, including proliferation, migration, apoptosis, and differentiation. Here, we have reviewed and summarized the present available clinical and experimental studies to deeply investigate the expression profiles and clarify the mechanisms of epigenetic modification in the progression of keloid, mainly including DNA methylation, histone modification, and ncRNAs (miRNA, lncRNA, and circRNA). Besides, we also provide the challenges and future perspectives associated with epigenetics modification in keloid. Deciphering the complicated epigenetic modification in keloid is hopeful to bring novel insights into the pathogenesis etiology and diagnostic/therapeutic targets in keloid, laying a foundation for optimal keloid ending.",33243301,PMC7690154,10.1186/s13148-020-00981-8,31,Clinical epigenetics,101516977,7.259,0.5693738460540771,0.7959866220735786,0.725752508361204,0.6459721337194028
Epigenetic alterations and advancement of treatment in peripheral T-cell lymphoma,"Peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) is a rare and heterogeneous group of clinically aggressive diseases associated with poor prognosis. Except for ALK + anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL), most peripheral T-cell lymphomas are highly malignant and have an aggressive disease course and poor clinical outcomes, with a poor remission rate and frequent relapse after first-line treatment. Aberrant epigenetic alterations play an important role in the pathogenesis and development of specific types of peripheral T-cell lymphoma, including the regulation of the expression of genes and signal transduction. The most common epigenetic alterations are DNA methylation and histone modification. Histone modification alters the level of gene expression by regulating the acetylation status of lysine residues on the promoter surrounding histones, often leading to the silencing of tumour suppressor genes or the overexpression of proto-oncogenes in lymphoma. DNA methylation refers to CpG islands, generally leading to tumour suppressor gene transcriptional silencing. Genetic studies have also shown that some recurrent mutations in genes involved in the epigenetic machinery, including TET2, IDH2-R172, DNMT3A, RHOA, CD28, IDH2, TET2, MLL2, KMT2A, KDM6A, CREBBP, and EP300, have been observed in cases of PTCL. The aberrant expression of miRNAs has also gradually become a diagnostic biomarker. These provide a reasonable molecular mechanism for epigenetic modifying drugs in the treatment of PTCL. As epigenetic drugs implicated in lymphoma have been continually reported in recent years, many new ideas for the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of PTCL originate from epigenetics in recent years. Novel epigenetic-targeted drugs have shown good tolerance and therapeutic effects in the treatment of peripheral T-cell lymphoma as monotherapy or combination therapy. NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines also recommended epigenetic drugs for PTCL subtypes as second-line therapy. Epigenetic mechanisms provide new directions and therapeutic strategies for the research and treatment of peripheral T-cell lymphoma. Therefore, this paper mainly reviews the epigenetic changes in the pathogenesis of peripheral T-cell lymphoma and the advancement of epigenetic-targeted drugs in the treatment of peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL).",33160401,PMC7648940,10.1186/s13148-020-00962-x,29,Clinical epigenetics,101516977,7.259,0.5673373937606812,0.7892976588628763,0.7290969899665551,0.6440813660222949
Cancer-associated infectious agents and epigenetic regulation,"Infectious agents are one of the factors which contribute to cancer development. Few examples include human papilloma virus in cervical cancer, hepatitis virus in hepatocellular carcinoma, herpes virus in Kaposi's sarcoma, Epstein-Barr virus in nasopharyngeal carcinoma, human T-cell lymphotropic virus type-1 (HTLV-1) in T-cell leukemia and lymphoma, Helicobacter pylori in gastric cancer. These agents cause genomic instability in the host and most of them affect host immune system. Infectious agents may integrate in the host genome although their sit of integration is not fixed. Expression of some infectious agents involves epigenetic regulation by DNA methylation, histone modification, miRNA level alteration, and chromatin condensation. This chapter provides examples where epigenetic regulation has been reported in cancer-associated infectious agents.

Epigenetics of the developing and aging brain: Mechanisms that regulate onset and outcomes of brain reorganization,"Brain development is a life-long process that encompasses several critical periods of transition, during which significant cognitive changes occur. Embryonic development, puberty, and reproductive senescence are all periods of transition that are hypersensitive to environmental factors. Rather than isolated episodes, each transition builds upon the last and is influenced by consequential changes that occur in the transition before it. Epigenetic marks, such as DNA methylation and histone modifications, provide mechanisms by which early events can influence development, cognition, and health outcomes. For example, parental environment influences imprinting patterns in gamete cells, which ultimately impacts gene expression in the embryo which may result in hypersensitivity to poor maternal nutrition during pregnancy, raising the risks for cognitive impairment later in life. This review explores how epigenetics induce and regulate critical periods, and also discusses how early environmental interactions prime a system towards a particular health outcome and influence susceptibility to disease or cognitive impairment throughout life.",33657435,PMC8989071,10.1016/j.neubiorev.2021.02.040,13,Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews,7806090,9.052,0.5631977915763855,0.6053511705685619,0.8093645484949833,0.6208618187585403

Epigenetic editing: Dissecting chromatin function in context,"How epigenetic mechanisms regulate genome output and response to stimuli is a fundamental question in development and disease. Past decades have made tremendous progress in deciphering the regulatory relationships involved by correlating aggregated (epi)genomics profiles with global perturbations. However, the recent development of epigenetic editing technologies now enables researchers to move beyond inferred conclusions, towards explicit causal reasoning, through 'programing' precise chromatin perturbations in single cells. Here, we first discuss the major unresolved questions in the epigenetics field that can be addressed by programable epigenome editing, including the context-dependent function and memory of chromatin states. We then describe the epigenetic editing toolkit focusing on CRISPR-based technologies, and highlight its achievements, drawbacks and promise.

Epigenetic Mechanisms in Understanding Nanomaterial-Induced Toxicity,"The toxic effects of different forms of nanomaterials comprise a series of biological effects such as oxidative stress; DNA damage; inflammatory response; activation of nuclear transcription factors. Some of these are key characteristics of human carcinogens and have been considered for hazard identification of nanomaterials. In addition, epigenetic changes also play a key role in the multi-step sequential process of carcinogenesis. Epigenetic modifications may constitute changes in DNA methylation, histone modifications (methylation, acetylation etc), and changes in non-coding RNA, leading to an altered gene expression profile. In this chapter, we describe the state-of-the-art of epigenetic modifications induced by different nanomaterials, from a limited number of in vitro- in vivo and human studies, a majority of which is primarily focused on DNA methylation. We also highlight the potential challenges and future directions in the field of epigenetics research in nanomaterial toxicology.",35583646,,10.1007/978-3-030-88071-2_9,1,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,121103,3.65,0.5621464848518372,0.09698996655518395,0.23076923076923078,0.4028397303759852
The impact of methodology on the reproducibility and rigor of DNA methylation data,"Epigenetic modifications are crucial for normal development and implicated in disease pathogenesis. While epigenetics continues to be a burgeoning research area in neuroscience, unaddressed issues related to data reproducibility across laboratories remain. Separating meaningful experimental changes from background variability is a challenge in epigenomic studies. Here we show that seemingly minor experimental variations, even under normal baseline conditions, can have a significant impact on epigenome outcome measures and data interpretation. We examined genome-wide DNA methylation and gene expression profiles of hippocampal tissues from wild-type rats housed in three independent laboratories using nearly identical conditions. Reduced-representation bisulfite sequencing and RNA-seq respectively identified 3852 differentially methylated and 1075 differentially expressed genes between laboratories, even in the absence of experimental intervention. Difficult-to-match factors such as animal vendors and a subset of husbandry and tissue extraction procedures produced quantifiable variations between wild-type animals across the three laboratories. Our study demonstrates that seemingly minor experimental variations, even under normal baseline conditions, can have a significant impact on epigenome outcome measures and data interpretation. This is particularly meaningful for neurological studies in animal models, in which baseline parameters between experimental groups are difficult to control. To enhance scientific rigor, we conclude that strict adherence to protocols is necessary for the execution and interpretation of epigenetic studies and that protocol-sensitive epigenetic changes, amongst naive animals, may confound experimental results.",35013473,PMC8748700,10.1038/s41598-021-04346-w,2,Scientific reports,101563288,4.996,0.5619661211967468,0.1605351170568562,0.4882943143812709,0.4669455590056735
Epigenetic control of natriuretic peptides: implications for health and disease,"The natriuretic peptides (NPs) family, including a class of hormones and their receptors, is largely known for its beneficial effects within the cardiovascular system to preserve regular functions and health. The concentration level of each component of the family is of crucial importance to guarantee a proper control of both systemic and local cardiovascular functions. A fine equilibrium between gene expression, protein secretion and clearance is needed to achieve the final optimal level of NPs. To this aim, the regulation of gene expression and translation plays a key role. In this regard, we know the existence of fine regulatory mechanisms, the so-called epigenetic mechanisms, which target many genes at either the promoter or the 3'UTR region to inhibit or activate their expression. The gene encoding ANP (NPPA) is regulated by histone modifications, DNA methylation, distinct microRNAs and a natural antisense transcript (NPPA-AS1) with consequent implications for both health and disease conditions. Notably, ANP modulates microRNAs on its own. Histone modifications of BNP gene (NPPB) are associated with several cardiomyopathies. The proBNP processing is regulated by miR30-GALNT1/2 axis.

A better understanding of the epigenetic control of the NPs family will allow to gain more insights on the pathological basis of common cardiovascular diseases and to identify novel therapeutic targets.

Targeting the Epigenome as a Novel Therapeutic Approach for Breast Cancer,"Breast cancer is one of complex diseases that are influenced by environment. Various genetic and epigenetic alterations are provoking causes of breast carcinogenesis. Dynamic epigenetic regulation including DNA methylation and histone modification induces dysregulation of genes related to proliferation, apoptosis, and metastasis in breast cancer. DNA methylation is strongly associated with the repression of transcription through adding to the methyl group by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), and tumor suppressor genes such as CCND2 and RUNX3 have been investigated to undergo hypermethylation at promoter region in breast cancer. In addition, histone deacetylases (HDACs) contribute to transcriptional repression by removing acetyl group at lysine residues leading to tumorigenesis. Since epigenetic changes are reversible, therapeutic approaches have been applied with epigenetic modification drugs such as DNMT inhibitors and HDAC inhibitors. In this chapter, we will summarize the feature of epigenetic markers in breast cancer cells and the effect of single or combination of epigenetic reagents for breast cancer therapy.",29282690,,10.1007/978-981-10-6020-5_14,2,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,121103,3.65,0.5574538707733154,0.16387959866220736,0.23411371237458195,0.4140709846713471
Progress and promises of epigenetic drugs and epigenetic diets in cancer prevention and therapy: A clinical update,"Epigenetic modifications are heritable yet reversible, essential for normal physiological functions and biological development. Aberrant epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation, histone modification, and non-coding RNA (ncRNA)-mediated gene regulation play a crucial role in cancer progression. In cellular reprogramming, irregular epigenomic modulations alter cell signaling pathways and the expression of tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes, resulting in cancer growth and metastasis. Therefore, alteration of epigenetic-status in cancer cells can be used as a potential target for cancer therapy. Several synthetic epigenetic inhibitors (epi-drugs) and natural epigenetic modulatory bioactives (epi-diets) have been shown to have the potential to alter the aberrant epigenetic status and inhibit cancer progression. Further, the use of combinatorial approaches with epigenetic drugs and diets has brought promising outcomes in cancer prevention and therapy. In this article, we have summarized the epigenetic modulatory activities of epi-drugs, epi-diets, and their combination against various cancers. We have also compiled the preclinical and clinical status of these epigenetic modulators in different cancers.",33309850,,10.1016/j.semcancer.2020.12.006,20,Seminars in cancer biology,9010218,17.012,0.5570623278617859,0.6956521739130435,0.9264214046822743,0.6586521124361351
CRISPR-dCas9 system for epigenetic editing towards therapeutic applications,"In the past few decades, epigenetics has emerged as an important area of study to enable a better understanding of gene expression and its regulation. Due to epigenetics, stable phenotypic changes have been possible without alterations in DNA sequences. Epigenetic changes may occur due to DNA methylation, acetylation, phosphorylation and other such mechanisms which alter the level of gene expression without making any difference to DNA sequences. In this chapter, CRISPR-dCas9 used to bring about epigenome modifications for regulating gene expression towards a therapeutic approaches for treating human diseases have been discussed.",37225318,,10.1016/bs.pmbts.2023.02.005,0,Progress in molecular biology and translational science,101498165,4.025,0.556369423866272,0.043478260869565216,0.29431438127090304,0.4013801827478568
Global histone modification profiling reveals the epigenomic dynamics during malignant transformation in a four-stage breast cancer model,"Background:Epigenetic regulation has emerged to be the critical steps for tumorigenesis and metastasis. Multiple histone methyltransferase and demethylase have been implicated as tumor suppressors or oncogenes recently. But the key epigenomic events in cancer cell transformation still remain poorly understood.Methods:A breast cancer transformation model was established via stably expressing three oncogenes in primary breast epithelial cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by the next-generation sequencing of histone methylations was performed to determine epigenetic events during transformation. Western blot, quantitative RT-PCR, and immunostaining were used to determine gene expression in cells and tissues.Results:Histones H3K9me2 and me3, two repressive marks of transcription, decrease in in vitro breast cancer cell model and in vivo clinical tissues. A survey of enzymes related with H3K9 methylation indicated that KDM3A/JMJD1A, a demethylase for H3K9me1 and me2, gradually increases during cancer transformation and is elevated in patient tissues. KDM3A/JMJD1A deficiency impairs the growth of tumors in nude mice and transformed cell lines. Genome-wide ChIP-seq analysis reveals that the boundaries of decreased H3K9me2 large organized chromatin K9 modifications (LOCKs) are enriched with cancer-related genes, such as MYC and PAX3. Further studies show that KDM3A/JMJD1A directly binds to these oncogenes and regulates their transcription by removing H3K9me2 mark.Conclusions:Our study demonstrates reduction of histones H3K9 me2 and me3, and elevation of KDM3A/JMJD1A as important events for breast cancer, and illustrates the dynamic epigenomic mechanisms during breast cancer transformation.",27034728,PMC4815258,10.1186/s13148-016-0201-x,38,Clinical epigenetics,101516977,7.259,0.556369423866272,0.8327759197324415,0.7324414715719063,0.6468651325806327
Epigenetics in lung cancer diagnosis and therapy,"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. The initiation and progression of lung cancer is the result of the interaction between permanent genetic and dynamic epigenetic alterations. DNA methylation is the best studied epigenetic mark in human cancers. Altered DNA methylation in cancer was identified in 1983. Within 30 years of this discovery, DNA methylation inhibitors are used clinically to treat a variety of cancers, highlighting the importance of the epigenetic basis of cancer. In addition, histone modifications, nucleosome remodeling, and micro RNA (miRNA)-mediated gene regulation are also fundamental to tumor genesis. Distinct chromatin alterations occur in all stages of lung cancer, including initiation, growth, and metastasis. Therefore, stage-specific epigenetic changes can be used as powerful and reliable tools for early diagnosis of lung cancer and to monitor patient prognosis. Moreover, since epigenetic changes are dynamic and reversible, chromatin modifiers are promising targets for the development of more effective therapeutic strategies against cancer. This review summarizes the chromatin alterations in lung cancer, focusing on the diagnostic and therapeutic approaches targeting epigenetic modifications that could help to reduce the high case-fatality rate of this dreadful disease.",25939322,,10.1007/s10555-015-9563-3,93,Cancer metastasis reviews,8605731,9.237,0.5561886429786682,0.9531772575250836,0.8260869565217391,0.6895660285965655
Dietary metabolites derived from gut microbiota: critical modulators of epigenetic changes in mammals,"The mammalian gastrointestinal tract harbors trillions of commensal microorganisms, collectively known as the microbiota. The microbiota is a critical source of environmental stimuli and, thus, has a tremendous impact on the health of the host. The microbes within the microbiota regulate homeostasis within the gut, and any alteration in their composition can lead to disorders that include inflammatory bowel disease, allergy, autoimmune disease, diabetes, mental disorders, and cancer. Hence, restoration of the gut flora following changes or imbalance is imperative for the host. The low-molecular-weight compounds and nutrients such as short-chain fatty acids, polyamines, polyphenols, and vitamins produced by microbial metabolism of nondigestible food components in the gut actively participate in various epigenomic mechanisms that reprogram the genome by altering the transcriptional machinery of a cell in response to environmental stimuli. These epigenetic modifications are caused by a set of highly dynamic enzymes, notably histone acetylases, deacetylases, DNA methylases, and demethylases, that are influenced by microbial metabolites and other environmental cues. Recent studies have shown that host expression of histone acetylases and histone deacetylases is important for regulating communication between the intestinal microbiota and the host cells. Histone acetylases and deacetylases influence the molecular expression of genes that affect not only physiological functions but also behavioral shifts that occur via neuroepigenetic modifications of genes. The underlying molecular mechanisms, however, have yet to be fully elucidated and thus provide a new area of research. The present review provides insights into the current understanding of the microbiota and its association with mammalian epigenomics as well as the interaction of pathogens and probiotics with host epigenetic machinery.",28444216,,10.1093/nutrit/nux001,77,Nutrition reviews,376405,6.846,0.5548624396324158,0.9331103678929766,0.6755852842809364,0.6546565942142321
A linear time algorithm for detecting long genomic regions enriched with a specific combination of epigenetic states,"Background:Epigenetic modifications are essential for controlling gene expression. Recent studies have shown that not only single epigenetic modifications but also combinations of multiple epigenetic modifications play vital roles in gene regulation. A striking example is the long hypomethylated regions enriched with modified H3K27me3 (called, ""K27HMD"" regions), which are exposed to suppress the expression of key developmental genes relevant to cellular development and differentiation during embryonic stages in vertebrates. It is thus a biologically important issue to develop an effective optimization algorithm for detecting long DNA regions (e.g., >4 kbp in size) that harbor a specific combination of epigenetic modifications (e.g., K27HMD regions). However, to date, optimization algorithms for these purposes have received little attention, and available methods are still heuristic and ad hoc.Results:In this paper, we propose a linear time algorithm for calculating a set of non-overlapping regions that maximizes the sum of similarities between the vector of focal epigenetic states and the vectors of raw epigenetic states at DNA positions in the set of regions. The average elapsed time to process the epigenetic data of any of human chromosomes was less than 2 seconds on an Intel Xeon CPU. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm, we estimated large K27HMD regions in the medaka and human genomes using our method, ChromHMM, and a heuristic method.Conclusions:We confirmed that the advantages of our method over those of the two other methods. Our method is flexible enough to handle other types of epigenetic combinations. The program that implements the method is called ""CSMinfinder"" and is made available at: http://mlab.cb.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~ichikawa/Segmentation/",25708947,PMC4331722,10.1186/1471-2164-16-S2-S8,0,BMC genomics,100965258,4.547,0.5535053014755249,0.046822742474916385,0.4013377926421405,0.42173528790872633
Planarian flatworms as a new model system for understanding the epigenetic regulation of stem cell pluripotency and differentiation,"Planarian flatworms possess pluripotent stem cells (neoblasts) that are able to differentiate into all cell types that constitute the adult body plan. Consequently, planarians possess remarkable regenerative capabilities. Transcriptomic studies have revealed that gene expression is coordinated to maintain neoblast pluripotency, and ensure correct lineage specification during differentiation. But as yet they have not revealed how this regulation of expression is controlled. In this review, we propose that planarians represent a unique and effective system to study the epigenetic regulation of these processes in an in vivo context. We consolidate evidence suggesting that although DNA methylation is likely present in some flatworm lineages, it does not regulate neoblast function in Schmidtea mediterranea. A number of phenotypic studies have documented the role of histone modification and chromatin remodelling complexes in regulating distinct neoblast processes, and we focus on four important examples of planarian epigenetic regulators: Nucleosome Remodeling Deacetylase (NuRD) complex, Polycomb Repressive Complex (PRC), the SET1/MLL methyltransferases, and the nuclear PIWI/piRNA complex. Given the recent advent of ChIP-seq in planarians, we propose future avenues of research that will identify the genomic targets of these complexes allowing for a clearer picture of how neoblast processes are coordinated at the epigenetic level. These insights into neoblast biology may be directly relevant to mammalian stem cells and disease. The unique biology of planarians will also allow us to investigate how extracellular signals feed into epigenetic regulatory networks to govern concerted neoblast responses during regenerative polarity, tissue patterning, and remodelling.",29694837,,10.1016/j.semcdb.2018.04.007,14,Seminars in cell & developmental biology,9607332,7.499,0.5533544421195984,0.6220735785953178,0.745819397993311,0.6055912605894849
Tumor purity and differential methylation in cancer epigenomics,"DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification of DNA molecule that plays a vital role in gene expression regulation. It is not only involved in many basic biological processes, but also considered an important factor for tumorigenesis and other human diseases. Study of DNA methylation has been an active field in cancer epigenomics research. With the advances of high-throughput technologies and the accumulation of enormous amount of data, method development for analyzing these data has gained tremendous interests in the fields of computational biology and bioinformatics. In this review, we systematically summarize the recent developments of computational methods and software tools in high-throughput methylation data analysis with focus on two aspects: differential methylation analysis and tumor purity estimation in cancer studies.",27199459,,10.1093/bfgp/elw016,8,Briefings in functional genomics,101528229,4.84,0.5515737533569336,0.45484949832775917,0.46488294314381273,0.5148907403084746
Epigenomics and the kidney,"Purpose of review:Epigenetic modifications are reversible changes to a cell's DNA or histones that alter gene expression but not DNA sequence. The present review will explore epigenomic profiling and bioinformatics techniques for the study of kidney development and disease.Recent findings:Reversible DNA and histone modifications influence chromatin accessibility and can be measured by a variety of recent techniques including DNase-seq, ATAC-seq, and single cell ATAC-seq. These approaches have been used to demonstrate that DNA methylation is critical for nephron progenitor maturation, for example. New bioinformatics techniques allow the prediction of chromatin loops that connect regulatory elements to target genes. Recent studies have demonstrated that DNA elements regulate transcription in the kidney via long-range physical interactions and create a new framework for understanding how genome wide association studies risk loci contribute to kidney disease. Increasingly, epigenomic approaches are being combined with transcriptomic analyses to generate multimodal datasets.Summary:Epigenomics has expanded our knowledge of gene architecture and regulation.

Transcriptional and epigenetic control of early life cell fate decisions,"Purpose of review:Global epigenetic reprogramming of the parental genomes after fertilization ensures the establishment of genome organization permissive for cell specialization and differentiation during development. In this review, we highlight selected, well-characterized relationships between epigenetic factors and transcriptional cell fate regulators during the initial stages of mouse development.Recent findings:Blastomeres of the mouse embryo are characterized by atypical and dynamic histone modification arrangements, noncoding RNAs and DNA methylation profiles. Moreover, asymmetries in epigenomic patterning between embryonic cells arise as early as the first cleavage, with potentially instructive roles during the first lineage allocations in the mouse embryo. Although it is widely appreciated that transcription factors and developmental signaling pathways play a crucial role in cell fate specification at the onset of development, it is increasingly clear that their function is tightly connected to the underlying epigenetic status of the embryonic cells in which they act.Summary:Findings on the interplay between genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors during reprogramming and differentiation in the embryo are crucial for understanding the molecular underpinnings of disease processes, particularly tumorigenesis, which is characterized by global epigenetic rewiring and progressive loss of cellular identity.",35025815,,10.1097/CCO.0000000000000814,3,Current opinion in oncology,9007265,3.915,0.5491268634796143,0.22408026755852842,0.27759197324414714,0.4298105662483037
Heritable Epigenomic Modifications Influence Stress Resilience and Rapid Adaptations in the Brown Planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens),"DNA methylation in insects is integral to cellular differentiation, development, gene regulation, genome integrity, and phenotypic plasticity. However, its evolutionary potential and involvement in facilitating rapid adaptations in insects are enigmatic. Moreover, our understanding of these mechanisms is limited to a few insect species, of which none are pests of crops. Hence, we studied methylation patterns in the brown planthopper (BPH), a major rice pest, under pesticide and nutritional stress, across its life stages. Moreover, as the inheritance of epigenetic changes is fundamentally essential for acclimation, adaptability, and evolution, we determined the heritability and persistence of stress-induced methylation marks in BPH across generations. Our results revealed that DNA methylation pattern(s) in BPH varies/vary with environmental cues and is/are insect life-stage specific. Further, our findings provide novel insights into the heritability of stress-induced methylation marks in BPH. However, it was observed that, though heritable, these marks eventually fade in the absence of the stressors, thereby suggesting the existence of fitness cost(s) associated with the maintenance of the stressed epigenotype. Furthermore, we demonstrate how 5-azacytidine-mediated disruption of BPH methylome influences expression levels of stress-responsive genes and, thereby, highlight demethylation/methylation as a phenomenon underlying stress resilience of BPH.",35955860,PMC9368798,10.3390/ijms23158728,5,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,6.208,0.5480386018753052,0.33444816053511706,0.6120401337792643,0.5181208199880594
Pharmaco-epigenomics: On the Road of Translation Medicine,"Epigenomics refers to the study of genome-wide changes in epigenetic mechanisms including DNA methylation, histone modifications and non-coding RNAs expression. The alterations in normal DNA methylation and histone acetylation/deacetylation patterns lead to deregulated transcription and chromatin organization resulting in altered gene expression profiles that facilitates tumor development and progression. In consequence, novel therapeutic strategies aimed at reversing aberrant epigenetic marks in cancer cells have been developed and used in recent molecular studies and clinical trials. Pharmaco-epigenomics is a research area, which refers to the study of epigenome changes in cancer development and how chemotherapeutic agents can reverse these aberrant epigenetic marks by targeting the epigenetic machinery. Besides, the effects of genome-wide polymorphisms in populations leading to variations in drug response are also study subject of pharmaco-epigenomics and are being studied extensively in cancer. Recent findings showed that drug response could be largely influenced by the presence of aberrant epigenetic marks of the whole genome. This implies that biological pathways and cellular processes are under the impact of epigenome status. However, data about the relationship between drug response and the epigenomic variations is still scarce mainly because the epigenome is highly variable between individuals. The present chapter reviewed the advances on the epigenetics changes mainly DNA methylation and histones modifications on cervical and breast human cancers. A special emphasis in how they could be used as targets for the development and use of novel drugs in cancer therapy is delineated.",31713163,,10.1007/978-3-030-24100-1_3,7,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,121103,3.65,0.5478269457817078,0.4080267558528428,0.23745819397993312,0.4577931574355799
"Epigenetic and epitranscriptomic changes in colorectal cancer: Diagnostic, prognostic, and treatment implications","A cancer cell is the final product of a complex mixture of genetic, epigenetic and epitranscriptomic alterations, whose final interplay contribute to cancer onset and progression. This is specifically true for colorectal cancer, a tumor with a strong epigenetic component, which acts earlier than any other genetic alteration in promoting cancer cell malignant transformation. The pattern of progressive, and usually subtype-specific, DNA and histone modifications that occur in colorectal cancer has been extensively studied in the last decade, providing plenty of data to explore. For this tumor, it became recently evident that also RNA modifications play a relevant role in the activation of oncogenes or repression of tumor suppressor genes. In this review we provide a brief overview of all epigenetic and epitranscriptomic changes that have been found associated to colorectal cancer till now. We explore the impact of these alterations in cancer prognosis and response to treatment and discuss their potential use as cancer biomarkers.",29360561,,10.1016/j.canlet.2018.01.049,31,Cancer letters,7600053,9.756,0.5477664470672607,0.7993311036789298,0.8394648829431438,0.6564190655647713

Epigenetic mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets in stroke,"Accumulating evidence indicates a central role for epigenetic modifications in the progression of stroke pathology. These epigenetic mechanisms are involved in complex and dynamic processes that modulate post-stroke gene expression, cellular injury response, motor function, and cognitive ability. Despite decades of research, stroke continues to be classified as a leading cause of death and disability worldwide with limited clinical interventions. Thus, technological advances in the field of epigenetics may provide innovative targets to develop new stroke therapies. This review presents the evidence on the impact of epigenomic readers, writers, and erasers in both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke pathophysiology. We specifically explore the role of DNA methylation, DNA hydroxymethylation, histone modifications, and epigenomic regulation by long non-coding RNAs in modulating gene expression and functional outcome after stroke.

Cancer epigenetics: Moving forward,"Defects in chromatin modifiers and remodelers have been described both for hematological and solid malignancies, corroborating and strengthening the role of epigenetic aberrations in the etiology of cancer. Furthermore, epigenetic marks-DNA methylation, histone modifications, chromatin remodeling, and microRNA-can be considered potential markers of cancer development and progression. Here, we review whether altered epigenetic landscapes are merely a consequence of chromatin modifier/remodeler aberrations or a hallmark of cancer etiology. We critically evaluate current knowledge on causal epigenetic aberrations and examine to what extent the prioritization of (epi)genetic deregulations can be assessed in cancer as some type of genetic lesion characterizing solid cancer progression. We also discuss the multiple challenges in developing compounds targeting epigenetic enzymes (named epidrugs) for epigenetic-based therapies.

Exploiting the Epigenome to Control Cancer-Promoting Gene-Expression Programs,"The epigenome is a key determinant of transcriptional output. Perturbations within the epigenome are thought to be a key feature of many, perhaps all cancers, and it is now clear that epigenetic changes are instrumental in cancer development. The inherent reversibility of these changes makes them attractive targets for therapeutic manipulation, and a number of small molecules targeting chromatin-based mechanisms are currently in clinical trials. In this perspective we discuss how understanding the cancer epigenome is providing insights into disease pathogenesis and informing drug development.

Functions and mechanisms of epigenetic inheritance in animals,"The idea that epigenetic determinants such as DNA methylation, histone modifications or RNA can be passed to the next generation through meiotic products (gametes) is long standing. Such meiotic epigenetic inheritance (MEI) is fairly common in yeast, plants and nematodes, but its extent in mammals has been much debated. Advances in genomics techniques are now driving the profiling of germline and zygotic epigenomes, thereby improving our understanding of MEI in diverse species. Whereas the role of DNA methylation in MEI remains unclear, insights from genome-wide studies suggest that a previously underappreciated fraction of mammalian genomes bypass epigenetic reprogramming during development. Notably, intergenerational inheritance of histone modifications, tRNA fragments and microRNAs can affect gene regulation in the offspring. It is important to note that MEI in mammals rarely constitutes transgenerational epigenetic inheritance (TEI), which spans multiple generations. In this Review, we discuss the examples of MEI in mammals, including mammalian epigenome reprogramming, and the molecular mechanisms of MEI in vertebrates in general. We also discuss the implications of the inheritance of histone modifications and small RNA for embryogenesis in metazoans, with a particular focus on insights gained from genome-wide studies.",30425324,,10.1038/s41580-018-0074-2,183,Nature reviews.

Epigenetics across the evolutionary tree: New paradigms from non-model animals,"All animals have evolved solutions to manage their genomes, enabling the efficient organization of meters of DNA strands in the nucleus and allowing for nuanced regulation of gene expression while keeping transposable elements suppressed. Epigenetic modifications are central to accomplishing all these. Recent advances in sequencing technologies and the development of techniques that profile epigenetic marks and chromatin accessibility using reagents that can be used in any species has catapulted epigenomic studies in diverse animal species, shedding light on the multitude of epigenomic mechanisms utilized across the evolutionary tree. Now, comparative epigenomics is a rapidly growing field that is uncovering mechanistic aspects of epigenetic modifications and chromatin organization in non-model invertebrates, ranging from octopus to sponges. This review puts recent discoveries in the epigenetics of non-model invertebrates in historical context, and describes new insight into the patterning and functions of DNA methylation and other highly conserved epigenetic modifications.",36403219,,10.1002/bies.202200036,1,"BioEssays : news and reviews in molecular, cellular and developmental biology",8510851,4.653,0.543832540512085,0.10033444816053512,0.4280936454849498,0.431985143036348
Epigenetic changes during ageing and their underlying mechanisms,"As life expectancy increases worldwide, ageing and age-related diseases arise as a major issue for societies around the globe. Understanding the biological mechanisms underlying the ageing process is thus instrumental for the development of efficient interventions aimed to prevent and treat age-related conditions. Current knowledge in the biogerontology field points to epigenetics as a critical component of the ageing process, not only by serving as a bona-fide marker of biological age but also by controlling and conferring inheritability to cellular and organismal ageing. This is reflected by a myriad of evidences demonstrating the relationship between DNA methylation, histone modifications, chromatin remodeling and small non-coding RNAs and several age-related phenotypes. Given the reversibility of epigenetic alterations, epigenetic reprogramming may also be envisioned as a potential approach to treat age-related disorders. Here we review how different types of epigenetic mechanisms are involved in the ageing process. In addition, we highlight how interventions modulate epigenetics and thus promote health- and lifespan.",32356238,,10.1007/s10522-020-09874-y,6,Biogerontology,100930043,4.284,0.5421058535575867,0.3712374581939799,0.3311036789297659,0.46573173955930114
An update on the role of epigenetics in systemic vasculitis,"Purpose of review:The purpose of this review is to discuss recent observations of epigenetic changes related to the complex pathogenesis of systemic vasculitides and their contribution to the field.Recent findings:There have been new observations of epigenetic changes in vasculitis and their potential role in disease pathogenesis in antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis, giant-cell arteritis, Kawasaki disease, BehÃ§et's disease, and IgA vasculitis. Some of this recent work has focused on the efficacy of using DNA methylation and miRNA expression as clinical biomarkers for disease activity and how DNA methylation and histone modifications interact to regulate disease-related gene expression.Summary:DNA methylation, histone modification, and miRNA expression changes are all fruitful ground for biomarker discovery and therapeutic targets in vasculitis. Current knowledge has provided targeted and suggested effects, but in many cases, has relied upon small cohorts, cosmopolitan cell populations, and limited knowledge of functional interactions. Expanding our knowledge of how these epigenetic mechanisms interact in a disease-specific and cell-specific manner will help to better understand the pathogenesis of systemic vasculitis.",28957963,PMC5805392,10.1097/BOR.0000000000000451,10,Current opinion in rheumatology,9000851,4.941,0.542075514793396,0.5317725752508361,0.4782608695652174,0.5272519978392483
A critical appraisal of clinical epigenetics,"Modern epigenetics emerged about 40 years ago. Since then, the field has rapidly grown. Unfortunately, this development has been accompanied by certain misconceptions and methodological shortcomings. A profound misconception is that chromatin modifications are a distinct layer of gene regulation that is directly responsive to the environment and potentially heritable between generations. This view ignores the fact that environmental factors affect gene expression mainly through signaling cascades and the activation or repression of transcription factors, which recruit chromatin regulators. The epigenome is mainly shaped by the DNA sequence and by transcription. Methodological shortcomings include the insufficient consideration of genetic variation and cell mixture distribution. Mis- and overinterpretation of epigenetic data foster genetic denialism (""We can control our genes"") and epigenetic determinism (""You are what your parents ate""). These erroneous beliefs can be overcome by using precise definitions, by raising the awareness about methodological pitfalls and by returning to the basic facts in molecular and cellular biology.",35902960,PMC9331128,10.1186/s13148-022-01315-6,1,Clinical epigenetics,101516977,7.259,0.5415300726890564,0.10367892976588629,0.7357859531772575,0.49281102020206263
Successful generation of epigenetic disease model mice by targeted demethylation of the epigenome,"Background:Epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation, play an important role in gene silencing and genome stability. Consequently, epigenetic dysregulation can cause several diseases, such as cancer, obesity, diabetes, autism, and imprinting disorders.Results:We validate three methods for the generation of epigenome-edited mice using the dCas9-SunTag and single-chain variable fragment-TET1 catalytic domain. We generate model mice for Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS), an imprinting disorder, by target-specific DNA demethylation in the H19 differentially methylated region. Like SRS patients, these mice show H19 upregulation and Igf2 downregulation, leading to severe intrauterine and postnatal growth retardation.Conclusion:This is the first report of an imprinting disease model animal generated by targeted demethylation of specific loci of the epigenome in fertilized eggs. Epigenome-edited animals are also useful for exploring the causative epimutations in epigenetic diseases.",32234052,PMC7110793,10.1186/s13059-020-01991-8,25,Genome biology,100960660,17.906,0.5414088368415833,0.7759197324414716,0.9464882943143813,0.6693269074561206
The Role of Selected Epigenetic Pathways in Cardiovascular Diseases as a Potential Therapeutic Target,"Epigenetics is a rapidly developing science that has gained a lot of interest in recent years due to the correlation between characteristic epigenetic marks and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Epigenetic modifications contribute to a change in gene expression while maintaining the DNA sequence. The analysis of these modifications provides a thorough insight into the cardiovascular system from its development to its further functioning. Epigenetics is strongly influenced by environmental factors, including known cardiovascular risk factors such as smoking, obesity, and low physical activity. Similarly, conditions affecting the local microenvironment of cells, such as chronic inflammation, worsen the prognosis in cardiovascular diseases and additionally induce further epigenetic modifications leading to the consolidation of unfavorable cardiovascular changes. A deeper understanding of epigenetics may provide an answer to the continuing strong clinical impact of cardiovascular diseases by improving diagnostic capabilities, personalized medical approaches and the development of targeted therapeutic interventions. The aim of the study was to present selected epigenetic pathways, their significance in cardiovascular diseases, and their potential as a therapeutic target in specific medical conditions.",37762023,PMC10531432,10.3390/ijms241813723,1,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,6.208,0.5408329367637634,0.10702341137123746,0.6153846153846154,0.46898136740942864
Epigenetics and the Environment in Airway Disease: Asthma and Allergic Rhinitis,"Asthma and rhinitis are complex, heterogeneous diseases characterized by chronic inflammation of the upper and lower airways. While genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified a number of susceptible loci and candidate genes associated with the pathogenesis of asthma and allergic rhinitis (AR), the risk-associated alleles account for only a very small percent of the genetic risk. In allergic airway and other complex diseases, it is thought that epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding microRNAs, caused by complex interactions between the underlying genome and the environment may account for some of this ""missing heritability"" and may explain the high degree of plasticity in immune responses. In this chapter, we will focus on the current knowledge of classical epigenetic modifications, DNA methylation and histone modifications, and their potential role in asthma and AR. In particular, we will review epigenetic variations associated with maternal airway disease, demographics, environment, and non-specific associations. The role of specific genetic haplotypes in environmentally induced epigenetic changes are also discussed. A major limitation of many of the current studies of asthma epigenetics is that they evaluate epigenetic modifications in both allergic and non-allergic asthma, making it difficult to distinguish those epigenetic modifications that mediate allergic asthma from those that mediate non-allergic asthma. Additionally, most DNA methylation studies in asthma use peripheral or cord blood due to poor accessibility of airway cells or tissue. Unlike DNA sequences, epigenetic alterations are quite cell- and tissue-specific, and epigenetic changes found in airway tissue or cells may be discordant from that of circulating blood. These two confounding factors should be considered when reviewing epigenetic studies in allergic airway disease.",32445095,,10.1007/978-981-15-3449-2_6,11,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,121103,3.65,0.5401962995529175,0.5618729096989966,0.2408026755852843,0.4846528967886067
Early Epigenetic Markers for Precision Medicine,"Over the last years, epigenetic changes, including DNA methylation and histone modifications detected in early tumorigenesis and cancer progression, have been proposed as biomarkers for cancer detection, tumor prognosis, and prediction to treatment response. Importantly for the clinical use of DNA methylation biomarkers, specific methylation signatures can be detected in many body fluids including serum/plasma samples. Several of these potential epigenetic biomarkers detected in women's cancers, colorectal cancers, prostate, pancreatic, gastric, and lung cancers are discussed. Studies conducted in breast cancer, for example, found that aberrant methylation detection of several genes in serum DNA and genome-wide epigenetic change could be used for early breast cancer diagnosis and prediction of breast cancer risk. In colorectal cancers, numerous studies have been conducted to identify specific methylation markers important for CRC detection and in fact clinical assays evaluating the methylation status of SEPT19 gene and vimentin, became commercially available. Furthermore, some epigenetic changes detected in gastric washes have been suggested as potential circulating noninvasive biomarkers for the early detection of gastric cancers. For the early detection of prostate cancer, few epigenetic markers have shown a better sensitivity and specificity than serum PSA, indicating that the inclusion of these markers together with current screening tools, could improve early diagnosis and may reduce unnecessary repeat biopsies. Similarly, in pancreatic cancers, abnormal DNA methylation of several genes including NPTX2, have been suggested as a diagnostic biomarker. Epigenetic dysregulation was also observed in several tumor suppressor genes and miRNAs in lung cancer patients, suggesting the important role of these changes in cancer initiation and progression. In conclusion, epigenetic changes detected in biological fluids could play an essential role in the early detection of several cancer types and this may have a great impact for the cancer precision medicine field.",30178243,,10.1007/978-1-4939-8751-1_1,16,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,0.0,0.5395291447639465,0.6588628762541806,0.06354515050167224,0.4681990922095385
H3K4 di-methylation governs smooth muscle lineage identity and promotes vascular homeostasis by restraining plasticity,"Epigenetic mechanisms contribute to the regulation of cell differentiation and function. Vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) are specialized contractile cells that retain phenotypic plasticity even after differentiation. Here, by performing selective demethylation of histone H3 lysine 4 di-methylation (H3K4me2) at SMC-specific genes, we uncovered that H3K4me2 governs SMC lineage identity. Removal of H3K4me2 via selective editing in cultured vascular SMCs and in murine arterial vasculature led to loss of differentiation and reduced contractility due to impaired recruitment of the DNA methylcytosine dioxygenase TET2. H3K4me2 editing altered SMC adaptative capacities during vascular remodeling due to loss of miR-145 expression. Finally, H3K4me2 editing induced a profound alteration of SMC lineage identity by redistributing H3K4me2 toward genes associated with stemness and developmental programs, thus exacerbating plasticity. Our studies identify the H3K4me2-TET2-miR145 axis as a central epigenetic memory mechanism controlling cell identity and function, whose alteration could contribute to various pathophysiological processes.",34582749,PMC8567421,10.1016/j.devcel.2021.09.001,15,Developmental cell,101120028,13.417,0.5392865538597107,0.6387959866220736,0.8896321070234113,0.6292575510449234
Epigenetics and Control of RNAs,"Histone modifications are epigenetic marks that fundamentally impact the regulation of gene expression. Integrating histone modification information in the analysis of gene expression traits (eQTL mapping) has been shown to significantly enhance the prediction of eQTLs. In this chapter, we describe (1) how to perform quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis using histone modification levels as traits and (2) how to integrate these data with information on RNA expression for the elucidation of the epigenetic control of transcript levels. We will provide a comprehensive introduction into the topic, describe in detail how ChIP-seq data are analyzed and elaborate on how to integrate ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data from a segregating disease animal model for the identification of the epigenetic control of RNA expression.",27933526,,10.1007/978-1-4939-6427-7_9,1,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,0.0,0.5388922691345215,0.11036789297658862,0.06688963210702341,0.3587868664974353
Comprehensive analysis of epigenetic signatures of human transcription control,"Advances in sequencing technologies have enabled exploration of epigenetic and transcriptional profiles at a genome-wide level. The epigenetic and transcriptional landscapes are now available in hundreds of mammalian cell and tissue contexts. Many studies have performed multi-omics analyses using these datasets to enhance our understanding of relationships between epigenetic modifications and transcription regulation. Nevertheless, most studies so far have focused on the promoters/enhancers and transcription start sites, and other features of transcription control including exons, introns and transcription termination remain underexplored. We investigated the interplay between epigenetic modifications and diverse transcription features using the data generated by the Roadmap Epigenomics project. A comprehensive analysis of histone modifications, DNA methylation, and RNA-seq data of thirty-three human cell lines and tissue types allowed us to confirm the generality of previously described relationships, as well as to generate new hypotheses about the interplay between epigenetic modifications and transcription features. Importantly, our analysis included previously under-explored features of transcription control, namely, transcription termination sites, exon-intron boundaries, and the exon inclusion ratio. We have made the analyses freely available to the scientific community at joshiapps.cbu.uib.no/perepigenomics_app/ for easy exploration, validation and hypothesis generation.",34291238,,10.1039/d0mo00130a,1,Molecular omics,101713384,4.212,0.5386192202568054,0.11371237458193979,0.3210702341137124,0.4101280538932137
Combinatorial epigenetic deregulation by Helicobacter pylori and Epstein-Barr virus infections in gastric tumourigenesis,"Epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation, histone modifications, chromatin remodelling and microRNAs, convert environmental signals to transcriptional outputs but are commonly hijacked by pathogenic microorganisms. Recent advances in cancer epigenomics have shed new light on the importance of epigenetic deregulation in Helicobacter pylori- and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-driven gastric tumourigenesis. Moreover, it is becoming apparent that epigenetic mechanisms interact through crosstalk and feedback loops, which modify global gene expression patterns. The SWI/SNF remodelling complexes are commonly involved in gastric cancers associated with H. pylori or EBV through different mechanisms, including microRNA-mediated deregulation and genetic mutations. While H. pylori causes epigenetic silencing of tumour-suppressor genes to deregulate cellular pathways, EBV-positive tumours exhibit a widespread and distinctive DNA hypermethylation profile. Given the early successes of epigenetic drugs in haematological malignancies, further studies are mandated to enrich and translate our understanding of combinatorial epigenetic deregulation in gastric cancers into interventional strategies in the clinic.

Determining Epigenetic Targets: A Beginner's Guide to Identifying Genome Functionality Through Database Analysis,"There can now be little doubt that the cis-regulatory genome represents the largest information source within the human genome essential for health. In addition to containing up to five times more information than the coding genome, the cis-regulatory genome also acts as a major reservoir of disease-associated polymorphic variation. The cis-regulatory genome, which is comprised of enhancers, silencers, promoters, and insulators, also acts as a major functional target for epigenetic modification including DNA methylation and chromatin modifications. These epigenetic modifications impact the ability of cis-regulatory sequences to maintain tissue-specific and inducible expression of genes that preserve health. There has been limited ability to identify and characterize the functional components of this huge and largely misunderstood part of the human genome that, for decades, was ignored as ""Junk"" DNA. In an attempt to address this deficit, the current chapter will first describe methods of identifying and characterizing functional elements of the cis-regulatory genome at a genome-wide level using databases such as ENCODE, the UCSC browser, and NCBI. We will then explore the databases on the UCSC genome browser, which provides access to DNA methylation and chromatin modification datasets. Finally, we will describe how we can superimpose the huge volume of study data contained in the NCBI archives onto that contained within the UCSC browser in order to glean relevant in vivo study data for any locus within the genome. An ability to access and utilize these information sources will become essential to informing the future design of experiments and subsequent determination of the role of epigenetics in health and disease and will form a critical step in our development of personalized medicine.",26025621,,10.1007/7651_2015_263,0,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,0.0,0.5365557670593262,0.05016722408026756,0.07023411371237458,0.3460137277941241
Enzymatic approaches for profiling cytosine methylation and hydroxymethylation,"Background:In mammals, modifications to cytosine bases, particularly in cytosine-guanine (CpG) dinucleotide contexts, play a major role in shaping the epigenome. The canonical epigenetic mark is 5-methylcytosine (5mC), but oxidized versions of 5mC, including 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), are now known to be important players in epigenomic dynamics. Understanding the functional role of these modifications in gene regulation, normal development, and pathological conditions requires the ability to localize these modifications in genomic DNA. The classical approach for sequencing cytosine modifications has involved differential deamination via the chemical sodium bisulfite; however, bisulfite is destructive, limiting its utility in important biological or clinical settings where detection of low frequency populations is critical. Additionally, bisulfite fails to resolve 5mC from 5hmC.Scope of review:To summarize how enzymatic rather than chemical approaches can be leveraged to localize and resolve different cytosine modifications in a non-destructive manner.Major conclusions:Nature offers a suite of enzymes with biological roles in cytosine modification in organisms spanning from bacteriophages to mammals. These enzymatic activities include methylation by DNA methyltransferases, oxidation of 5mC by TET family enzymes, hypermodification of 5hmC by glucosyltransferases, and the generation of transition mutations from cytosine to uracil by DNA deaminases. Here, we describe how insights into the natural reactivities of these DNA-modifying enzymes can be leveraged to convert them into powerful biotechnological tools. Application of these enzymes in sequencing can be accomplished by relying on their natural activity, exploiting their ability to discriminate between cytosine modification states, reacting them with functionalized substrate analogs to introduce chemical handles, or engineering the DNA-modifying enzymes to take on new reactivities. We describe how these enzymatic reactions have been combined and permuted to localize DNA modifications with high specificity and without the destructive limitations posed by chemical methods for epigenetic sequencing.",34375743,PMC8829811,10.1016/j.molmet.2021.101314,9,Molecular metabolism,101605730,8.568,0.534885823726654,0.4782608695652174,0.7725752508361204,0.57109871831626
Getting a handle on chemical probes of chomatin readers,"The dynamic nature of histone post-translational modifications such as methylation or acetylation makes possible the alteration of disease associated epigenetic states through the manipulation of the associated epigenetic machinery. One approach is through small molecule perturbation. Chemical probes of epigenetic reader domains have been critical in improving our understanding of the biological consequences of modulating their targets, while also enabling the development of novel probe-based reagents. By appending a functional handle to a reader domain probe, a chemical toolbox of reagents can be created to facilitate chemiprecipitation of epigenetic complexes, evaluate probe selectivity, developin vitroscreening assays, visualize cellular target localization, enable target degradation and recruit epigenetic machinery to a site within the genome in a highly controlled fashion.",31920100,PMC8025116,10.4155/fmc-2019-0274,4,Future medicinal chemistry,101511162,4.767,0.5344606637954712,0.28762541806020064,0.44816053511705684,0.4678335889127342
Epigenetic mechanisms in paediatric brain tumours: regulators lose control,"Epigenetic mechanisms are essential to regulate gene expression during normal development. However, they are often disrupted in pathological conditions including tumours, where they contribute to their formation and maintenance through altered gene expression. In recent years, next generation genomic techniques has allowed a remarkable advancement of our knowledge of the genetic and molecular landscape of paediatric brain tumours and have highlighted epigenetic deregulation as a common hallmark in their pathogenesis. This review describes the main epigenetic dysregulations found in paediatric brain tumours, including at DNA methylation and histone modifications level, in the activity of chromatin-modifying enzymes and in the expression of non-coding RNAs. How these altered processes influence tumour biology and how they can be leveraged to dissect the molecular heterogeneity of these tumours and contribute to their classification is also addressed. Finally, the availability and value of preclinical models as well as the current clinical trials exploring targeting key epigenetic mediators in paediatric brain tumours are discussed.",35076654,,10.1042/BST20201227,2,Biochemical Society transactions,7506897,4.919,0.5337316393852234,0.1705685618729097,0.47157190635451507,0.448667077276619
The impact of epigenetics on cardiovascular disease,"Mortality and morbidity from cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) represents a huge burden to society. It is recognized that environmental factors and individual lifestyles play important roles in disease susceptibility, but the link between these external risk factors and our genetics has been unclear. However, the discovery of sequence-independent heritable DNA changes (epigenetics) have helped us to explain the link between genes and the environment. Multiple diverse epigenetic processes, including DNA methylation, histone modification, and the expression of non-coding RNA molecules affect the expression of genes that produce important changes in cellular differentiation and function, influencing the health and adaptability of the organism. CVDs such as congenital heart disease, cardiomyopathy, heart failure, cardiac fibrosis, hypertension, and atherosclerosis are now being viewed as much more complex and dynamic disorders. The role of epigenetics in these and other CVDs is currently under intense scrutiny, and we can expect important insights to emerge, including novel biomarkers and new approaches to enable precision medicine. This review summarizes the recent advances in our understanding of the role of epigenetics in CVD.",31112654,,10.1139/bcb-2019-0045,42,Biochemistry and cell biology = Biochimie et biologie cellulaire,8606068,3.73,0.5328201651573181,0.8561872909698997,0.26421404682274247,0.5437723666529193
A convolutional neural network-based regression model to infer the epigenetic crosstalk responsible for CG methylation patterns,"Background:Epigenetic modifications, including CG methylation (a major form of DNA methylation) and histone modifications, interact with each other to shape their genomic distribution patterns. However, the entire picture of the epigenetic crosstalk regulating the CG methylation pattern is unknown especially in cells that are available only in a limited number, such as mammalian oocytes. Most machine learning approaches developed so far aim at finding DNA sequences responsible for the CG methylation patterns and were not tailored for studying the epigenetic crosstalk.Results:We built a machine learning model named epiNet to predict CG methylation patterns based on other epigenetic features, such as histone modifications, but not DNA sequence. Using epiNet, we identified biologically relevant epigenetic crosstalk between histone H3K36me3, H3K4me3, and CG methylation in mouse oocytes. This model also predicted the altered CG methylation pattern of mutant oocytes having perturbed histone modification, was applicable to cross-species prediction of the CG methylation pattern of human oocytes, and identified the epigenetic crosstalk potentially important in other cell types.Conclusions:Our findings provide insight into the epigenetic crosstalk regulating the CG methylation pattern in mammalian oocytes and other cells. The use of epiNet should help to design or complement biological experiments in epigenetics studies.",34162326,PMC8220828,10.1186/s12859-021-04272-8,0,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,3.307,0.5326986312866211,0.05351170568561873,0.16387959866220736,0.3630974396415379
How to Slow down the Ticking Clock: Age-Associated Epigenetic Alterations and Related Interventions to Extend Life Span,"Epigenetic alterations pose one major hallmark of organismal aging. Here, we provide an overview on recent findings describing the epigenetic changes that arise during aging and in related maladies such as neurodegeneration and cancer. Specifically, we focus on alterations of histone modifications and DNA methylation and illustrate the link with metabolic pathways. Age-related epigenetic, transcriptional and metabolic deregulations are highly interconnected, which renders dissociating cause and effect complicated. However, growing amounts of evidence support the notion that aging is not only accompanied by epigenetic alterations, but also at least in part induced by those. DNA methylation clocks emerged as a tool to objectively determine biological aging and turned out as a valuable source in search of factors positively and negatively impacting human life span. Moreover, specific epigenetic signatures can be used as biomarkers for age-associated disorders or even as targets for therapeutic approaches, as will be covered in this review. Finally, we summarize recent potential intervention strategies that target epigenetic mechanisms to extend healthy life span and provide an outlook on future developments in the field of longevity research.",35159278,PMC8915189,10.3390/cells11030468,18,Cells,101600052,7.666,0.5323339700698853,0.6789297658862876,0.7491638795986622,0.6050191111389212
Ensembl regulation resources,"New experimental techniques in epigenomics allow researchers to assay a diversity of highly dynamic features such as histone marks, DNA modifications or chromatin structure.

Epigenetic roles of PIWIâinteracting RNAs (piRNAs) in cancer metastasis (Review),"Pâelementâinduced wimpy testis (PIWI)âinteracting RNAs (piRNAs) are epigeneticârelated short ncRNAs that participate in chromatin regulation, transposon silencing, and modification of specific gene sites. These epigenetic factors or alterations are also involved in the growth of a variety of human cancers, including lung, breast, and colon cancer. Accumulating evidence has revealed that tumor metastasis and invasion involve genetic and epigenetic factors. Cancer metastasis is characterized by epigenetic alterations including DNA methylation and histone modification. Changes in DNA methylation, H3K9me3 heterochromatin and transposable elements have been detected in several cancers. piRNAs may function in gene silencing and gene modification upstream or downstream of oncogenes in cancer cell lines or cancer tissues. In addition to piRNAs, PIWI proteins can be used as biomarkers for prognosis, diagnosis and clinical evaluation and may be factors in cancer metastasis. Here, we elucidated the possible mechanisms by which piRNAs regulate cancer metastasis, including but not restricted to influencing DNA and histone methylation and transposable elements.",30226604,,10.3892/or.2018.6684,15,Oncology reports,9422756,4.136,0.5303581357002258,0.6421404682274248,0.3110367892976589,0.5088503329251522
Epigenetics and Peripheral Artery Disease,"The term epigenetics is usually used to describe inheritable changes in gene function which do not involve changes in the DNA sequence. These typically include non-coding RNAs, DNA methylation and histone modifications. Smoking and older age are recognised risk factors for peripheral artery diseases, such as occlusive lower limb artery disease and abdominal aortic aneurysm, and have been implicated in promoting epigenetic changes. This brief review describes studies that have associated epigenetic factors with peripheral artery diseases and investigations which have examined the effect of epigenetic modifications on the outcome of peripheral artery diseases in mouse models. Investigations have largely focused on microRNAs and have identified a number of circulating microRNAs associated with human peripheral artery diseases. Upregulating or antagonising a number of microRNAs has also been reported to limit aortic aneurysm development and hind limb ischemia in mouse models. The importance of DNA methylation and histone modifications in peripheral artery disease has been relatively little studied. Whether circulating microRNAs can be used to assist identification of patients with peripheral artery diseases and be modified in order to improve the outcome of peripheral artery disease will require further investigation.",26888065,,10.1007/s11883-016-0567-4,9,Current atherosclerosis reports,100897685,5.967,0.5303581357002258,0.4816053511705686,0.5719063545150501,0.5289172225572593
Epigenetic alterations induced by genotoxic occupational and environmental human chemical carcinogens: An update of a systematic literature review,"Epigenetic alterations, such as changes in DNA methylation, histones/chromatin structure, nucleosome positioning, and expression of non-coding RNAs, are recognized among key characteristics of carcinogens; they may occur independently or concomitantly with genotoxic effects. While data on genotoxicity are collected through standardized guideline tests, data collected on epigenetic effects is far less uniform. In 2016, we conducted a systematic review of published studies of genotoxic carcinogens that reported epigenetic endpoints to better understand the evidence for epigenetic alterations of human carcinogens, and the potential association with genotoxic endpoints. Since then, the number of studies of epigenetic effects of chemicals has nearly doubled. This review stands as an update on epigenetic alterations induced by occupational and environmental human carcinogens that were previously and recently classified as Group 1 by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. We found that the evidence of epigenetic effects remains uneven across agents. Studies of DNA methylation are most abundant, while reports concerning effects on non-coding RNA have increased over the past 5 years. By contrast, mechanistic toxicology studies of histone modifications and chromatin state alterations remain few. We found that most publications of epigenetic effects of carcinogens were studies in exposed humans or human cells. Studies in rodents represent the second most common species used for epigenetic studies in toxicology, in vivo exposures being the most predominant. Future studies should incorporate dose- and time-dependent study designs and also investigate the persistence of effects following cessation of exposure, considering the dynamic nature of most epigenetic alterations.",35690411,PMC9188653,10.1016/j.mrrev.2021.108408,6,Mutation research.

Epigenome mapping highlights chromatin-mediated gene regulation in the protozoan parasite Trichomonas vaginalis,"Trichomonas vaginalis is an extracellular flagellated protozoan parasite that causes trichomoniasis, one of the most common non-viral sexually transmitted diseases. To survive and to maintain infection, T. vaginalis adapts to a hostile host environment by regulating gene expression. However, the mechanisms of transcriptional regulation are poorly understood for this parasite. Histone modification has a marked effect on chromatin structure and directs the recruitment of transcriptional machinery, thereby regulating essential cellular processes. In this study, we aimed to outline modes of chromatin-mediated gene regulation in T. vaginalis. Inhibition of histone deacetylase (HDAC) alters global transcriptional responses and induces hyperacetylation of histones and hypermethylation of H3K4. Analysis of the genome of T. vaginalis revealed that a number of enzymes regulate histone modification, suggesting that epigenetic mechanisms are important to controlling gene expression in this organism. Additionally, we describe the genome-wide localization of two histone H3 modifications (H3K4me3 and H3K27Ac), which we found to be positively associated with active gene expression in both steady and dynamic transcriptional states. These results provide the first direct evidence that histone modifications play an essential role in transcriptional regulation of T. vaginalis, and may help guide future epigenetic research into therapeutic intervention strategies against this parasite.",28345651,PMC5366954,10.1038/srep45365,10,Scientific reports,101563288,4.996,0.5296891927719116,0.5384615384615384,0.4916387959866221,0.523833582552779
Role of epigenetics in carcinogenesis: Recent advancements in anticancer therapy,"The role of epigenetics in the etiology of cancer progression is being emphasized for the past two decades to check the impact of chromatin modifiers and remodelers. Histone modifications, DNA methylation, chromatin remodeling, nucleosome positioning, regulation by non-coding RNAs and precisely microRNAs are influential epigenetic marks in the field of progressive cancer sub-types. Furthermore, constant epigenetic changes due to hyper or hypomethylation could efficiently serve as effective biomarkers of cancer diagnosis and therapeutic development. Ongoing research in the field of epigenetics has resulted in the resolutory role of various epigenetic markers and their inhibition using specific inhibitors to arrest their key cellular functions in in-vitro and pre-clinical studies. Although, the mechanism of epigenetics in cancer largely remains unexplored. Nevertheless, various advancements in the field of epigenetics have been made through transcriptome analysis and in-vitro genome targeting technologies to unravel the applicability of epigenetic markers for future cancer therapeutics and management. Therefore, this review emphasizes on recent advances in epigenetic landscapes that could be targeted/explored using novel approaches as personalized treatment modalities for cancer containment.",34182144,,10.1016/j.semcancer.2021.06.023,9,Seminars in cancer biology,9010218,17.012,0.529567539691925,0.48494983277591974,0.9297658862876255,0.600683667627864
"Epigenetic modifications in metabolic memory: What are the memories, and can we erase them?","Inherent and acquired abnormalities in gene regulation due to the influence of genetics and epigenetics (traits related to environment rather than genetic factors) underlie many diseases including diabetes. Diabetes could lead to multiple complications including retinopathy, nephropathy, and cardiovascular disease that greatly increase morbidity and mortality. Epigenetic changes have also been linked to diabetes-related complications. Genes associated with many pathophysiological features of these vascular complications (e.g., inflammation, fibrosis, and oxidative stress) can be regulated by epigenetic mechanisms involving histone posttranslational modifications, DNA methylation, changes in chromatin structure/remodeling, and noncoding RNAs. Intriguingly, these epigenetic changes triggered during early periods of hyperglycemic exposure and uncontrolled diabetes are not immediately corrected even after restoration of normoglycemia and metabolic balance. This latency in effect across time and conditions is associated with persistent development of complications in diabetes with prior history of poor glycemic control, termed as metabolic memory or legacy effect. Epigenetic modifications are generally reversible and provide a window of therapeutic opportunity to ameliorate cellular dysfunction and mitigate or ""erase"" metabolic memory. Notably, trained immunity and related epigenetic changes transmitted from hematopoietic stem cells to innate immune cells have also been implicated in metabolic memory. Hence, identification of epigenetic variations at candidate genes, or epigenetic signatures genome-wide by epigenome-wide association studies can aid in prompt diagnosis to prevent progression of complications and identification of much-needed new therapeutic targets. Herein, we provide a review of epigenetics and epigenomics in metabolic memory of diabetic complications covering the current basic research, clinical data, and translational implications.",35785987,PMC9359656,10.1152/ajpcell.00201.2022,7,American journal of physiology.

Epigenetics and Epigenomics of Plants,"The genetic material DNA in association with histone proteins forms the complex structure called chromatin, which is prone to undergo modification through certain epigenetic mechanisms including cytosine DNA methylation, histone modifications, and small RNA-mediated methylation. Alterations in chromatin structure lead to inaccessibility of genomic DNA to various regulatory proteins such as transcription factors, which eventually modulates gene expression. Advancements in high-throughput sequencing technologies have provided the opportunity to study the epigenetic mechanisms at genome-wide levels. Epigenomic studies using high-throughput technologies will widen the understanding of mechanisms as well as functions of regulatory pathways in plant genomes, which will further help in manipulating these pathways using genetic and biochemical approaches. This technology could be a potential research tool for displaying the systematic associations of genetic and epigenetic variations, especially in terms of cytosine methylation onto the genomic region in a specific cell or tissue. A comprehensive study of plant populations to correlate genotype to epigenotype and to phenotype, and also the study of methyl quantitative trait loci (QTL) or epiGWAS, is possible by using high-throughput sequencing methods, which will further accelerate molecular breeding programs for crop improvement.

"Maternal obesity, diabetes during pregnancy and epigenetic mechanisms that influence the developmental origins of cardiometabolic disease in the offspring","Since 1980, global obesity has doubled, and the incidence of cardiometabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes and heart disease is also increasing. While genetic susceptibility and adult lifestyle are implicated in these trends, evidence from clinical cohorts, epidemiological studies and animal model experiments support a role for early-life environmental exposures in determining the long-term health of an individual, which has led to the formulation of the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) theory. In fact, maternal obesity and diabetes during pregnancy, which are on the rise, are strongly associated with altered fetal growth and development as well as with lifelong perturbations in metabolic tissues. A mounting body of evidence implicates epigenetic mechanisms (e.g. DNA methylation and histone modifications) in the regulation of these effects and their transmission to future generations. This review critically discusses the current evidence (in animal model systems and humans) that implicates maternal obesity and diabetes during pregnancy in perturbing the epigenome of the next generation, and the consequential impact on growth, organ development and ultimately cardiometabolic disease progression. Additionally, this review will address some of the limitations of the DOHaD approach and areas that require further study. For example, future research requires verification of the mechanistic impact of the epigenetic marks and their persistence over the life course. Ultimately, this knowledge is needed to establish optimal screening, prevention and therapeutic approaches for children at risk of cardiometabolic disease development.",29308692,,10.1080/10408363.2017.1422109,81,Critical reviews in clinical laboratory sciences,8914816,7.721,0.5280771255493164,0.939799331103679,0.7525083612040134,0.6553078137911283
Epigenetics in rheumatoid arthritis,"Purpose of review:To give an overview of recently published articles addressing the role of epigenetic modifications in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Here we focused on DNA methylation and posttranslational histone modifications.Recent findings:Recent studies attempted to link epigenetic modifications with genetic or environmental risk factors for RA. There is evidence that histone deacetylases confer effects of environmental triggers such as smoking, diet or therapy on expression levels of target genes. Additionally, disturbed methylation patterns and cell-type specific histone methylation marks were identified as potential mediators of genetic risk in RA. Altered methylome signatures were found in several cell types in RA, first of all RA synovial fibroblasts, and contribute to the intrinsic fibroblast activation. The reversal of DNA hypomethylation by inhibiting the polyamine recycling pathway was suggested as new epigenetic therapy in RA. Moreover, targeting epigenetic reader proteins, such as bromodomain proteins, emerged as a new field in drug development and the first studies underscored the potential of these drugs not only in malignant and inflammatory conditions but also in autoimmune diseases.Summary:Epigenetic factors represent a promising area to link genetics, regulation of gene expression and environmental risk factors.",25415526,,10.1097/BOR.0000000000000128,62,Current opinion in rheumatology,9000851,4.941,0.5276968479156494,0.9096989966555183,0.4816053511705686,0.594878978314607
Novel Epigenetic Biomarkers Mediating Bisphenol A Exposure and Metabolic Phenotypes in Female Mice,"There is compelling evidence that epigenetic modifications link developmental environmental insults to adult disease susceptibility. Animal studies have associated perinatal bisphenol A (BPA) exposure to altered DNA methylation, but these studies are often limited to candidate gene and global non-loci-specific approaches. By using an epigenome-wide discovery platform, we elucidated epigenetic alterations in liver tissue from adult mice offspring (10 months) following perinatal BPA exposure at human physiologically relevant doses (50-ng, 50-Î¼g, and 50-mg BPA/kg diet). Biological pathway analysis identified an enrichment of significant differentially methylated regions in metabolic pathways among females. Furthermore, through the use of top enriched biological pathways, 4 candidate genes were chosen to assess DNA methylation as a mediating factor linking the association of perinatal BPA exposure to metabolic phenotypes previously observed in female offspring. DNA methylation status at Janus kinase-2 (Jak-2), retinoid X receptor (Rxr), regulatory factor x-associated protein (Rfxap), and transmembrane protein 238 (Tmem238) was used within a mediational regression analysis. DNA methylation in all four of the candidate genes was identified as a mediator in the mechanistic pathway of developmental BPA exposure and female-specific energy expenditure, body weight, and body fat phenotypes. Data generated from this study are crucial for deciphering the mechanistic role of epigenetics in the pathogenesis of chronic disease and the development of epigenetic-based prevention and therapeutic strategies for complex human disease.",27824486,PMC5412976,10.1210/en.2016-1441,22,Endocrinology,375040,5.051,0.5273317098617554,0.7290969899665551,0.4983277591973244,0.5618839757498291
"Epigenetic control of myeloid cell differentiation, identity and function","Myeloid cells are crucial effectors of the innate immune response and important regulators of adaptive immunity. The differentiation and activation of myeloid cells requires the timely regulation of gene expression; this depends on the interplay of a variety of elements, including transcription factors and epigenetic mechanisms. Epigenetic control involves histone modifications and DNA methylation, and is coupled to lineage-specifying transcription factors, upstream signalling pathways and external factors released in the bone marrow, blood and tissue environments. In this Review, we highlight key epigenetic events controlling myeloid cell biology, focusing on those related to myeloid cell differentiation, the acquisition of myeloid identity and innate immune memory.",25534619,,10.1038/nri3777,149,Nature reviews.

The Role of Epigenetics in the Latent Effects of Early Life Exposure to Obesogenic Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals,"Recent research supports a role for exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in the global obesity epidemic. Obesogenic EDCs have the potential to inappropriately stimulate adipogenesis and fat storage, influence metabolism and energy balance and increase susceptibility to obesity. Developmental exposure to obesogenic EDCs is proposed to interfere with epigenetic programming of gene regulation, partly by activation of nuclear receptors, thereby influencing the risk of obesity later in life. The goal of this minireview is to briefly describe the epigenetic mechanisms underlying developmental plasticity and to evaluate the evidence of a mechanistic link between altered epigenetic gene regulation by early life EDC exposure and latent onset of obesity. We summarize the results of recent in vitro, in vivo, and transgenerational studies, which clearly show that the obesogenic effects of EDCs such as tributyltin, brominated diphenyl ether 47, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are mediated by the activation and associated altered methylation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-Î³, the master regulator of adipogenesis, or its target genes. Importantly, studies are emerging that assess the effects of EDCs on the interplay between DNA methylation and histone modifications in altered chromatin structure. These types of studies coupled with genome-wide rather than gene-specific analyses are needed to improve mechanistic understanding of epigenetic changes by EDC exposure. Current advances in the field of epigenomics have led to the first potential epigenetic markers for obesity that can be detected at birth, providing an important basis to determine the effects of developmental exposure to obesogenic EDCs in humans.",26241072,PMC4588824,10.1210/en.2015-1434,47,Endocrinology,375040,5.051,0.5262818932533264,0.8729096989966555,0.5016722408026756,0.5906855239118621
Integration of microbiome and epigenome to decipher the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases,"The interaction between genetic predisposition and environmental factors are of great significance in the pathogenesis and development of autoimmune diseases (AIDs). The human mucosa is the most frequent site that interacts with the exterior environment, and commensal microbiota at the gut and other human mucosal cavities play a crucial role in the regulation of immune system. Growing evidence has shown that the compositional and functional changes of mucosal microbiota are closely related to AIDs. Gut dysbiosis not only influence the expression level of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) of antigen presenting cells, but also contribute to Th17/Treg imbalance. Epigenetic modifications triggered by environmental factors is an important mechanism that leads to altered gene expression. Researches addressing the role of DNA methylation, histone modification and non-coding RNA in AIDs have been increasing in recent years. Furthermore, studies showed that human microbiota and their metabolites can regulate immune cells and cytokines via epigenomic modifications. For example, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) produced by gut microbiota promote the differentiation of naÃ¯ve T cell into Treg by suppressing histone deacetylases (HDACs). Therefore, we propose that dysbiosis and resulting metabolites may cause aberrant immune responses via epigenetic modifications, and lead to AIDs. With the development of high-throughput sequencing, metagenome analysis has been applied to investigate the dysbiosis in AIDs patients. We have tested the fecal, dental and salivary samples from treatment-naÃ¯ve rheumatoid arthritis (RA) individuals by metagenomic shotgun sequencing and a metagenome-wide association study. Dysbiosis was detected in the gut and oral microbiomes of RA patients, but it was partially restored after treatment. We also found functional changes of microbiota and molecular mimicry of human antigens in RA individuals. By integrating the analysis of multi-omics of microbiome and epigenome, we could explore the interaction between human immune system and microbiota, and thereby unmasking specific and more sensitive biomarkers as well as potential therapeutic targets. Future studies aiming at the crosstalk between human dysbiosis and epigenetic modifications and their influences on AIDs will facilitate our understanding and better managing of these debilitating AIDs.",28342734,,10.1016/j.jaut.2017.03.009,64,Journal of autoimmunity,8812164,14.511,0.5260080099105835,0.9163879598662207,0.9063545150501672,0.6801533009296277
Epigenetics in Primary SjÃ¶gren's Syndrome,"Primary SjÃ¶gren's syndrome (SjS) is a chronic and systemic autoimmune epithelitis with predominant female incidence, which is characterized by exocrine gland dysfunction. Incompletely understood, the etiology of SjS is multi-factorial and evidence is growing to consider that epigenetic factors are playing a crucial role in its development. Independent from DNA sequence mutations, epigenetics is described as inheritable and reversible processes that modify gene expression. Epigenetic modifications reported in minor salivary gland and lymphocytes from SjS patients are related to (i) an abnormal DNA methylation process inducing in turn defective control of normally repressed genes involving such matters as autoantigens, retrotransposons, and the X chromosome in women; (ii) altered nucleosome positioning associated with autoantibody production; and (iii) altered control of microRNA. Results from epigenome-wide association studies have further revealed the importance of the interferon pathway in disease progression, the calcium signaling pathway for controlling fluid secretions, and a cell-specific cross talk with risk factors associated with SjS. Importantly, epigenetic modifications are reversible thus opening opportunities for therapeutic procedures in this currently incurable disease.",32445100,,10.1007/978-981-15-3449-2_11,4,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,121103,3.65,0.5253079533576965,0.2909698996655518,0.24414715719063546,0.4222081833858554
Implications of epigenetics and stress regulation on research and developmental care of preterm infants,"Epigenetics refers to chemical modifications leading to changes in gene expression without any alteration of the DNA structure. We suggest ways through which epigenetic mechanisms might contribute to alter developmental trajectories in preterm infants. Although theoretical and methodological issues still need to be addressed, we discuss how epigenetics might be an emergent research field with potential innovative insights for researchers and clinicians involved in the neonatal care of preterm infants.",25712710,,10.1111/1552-6909.12559,15,"Journal of obstetric, gynecologic, and neonatal nursing : JOGNN",8503123,2.042,0.5251405239105225,0.6454849498327759,0.12040133779264214,0.46826157187139705
ICGEC: a comparative method for measuring epigenetic conservation of genes via the integrated signal from multiple histone modifications between cell types,"Background:Histone post-translational modifications play crucial roles in epigenetic regulation of gene expression and are known to be associated with the phenotypic differences of different cell types. Therefore, it is of fundamental importance to dissect the genes and pathways involved in such a phenotypic variation at the level of epigenetics. However, the existing comparative approaches are largely based on the differences, especially the absolute difference in the levels of individual histone modifications of genes under contrasting conditions. Thus, a method for measuring the overall change in the epigenetic circumstance of each gene underpinned by multiple types of histone modifications between cell types is lacking.Results:To address this challenge, we developed ICGEC, a new method for estimating the degree of epigenetic conservation of genes between two cell lines. Different from existing comparative methods, ICGEC provides a reliable score for measuring the relative change in the epigenetic context of corresponding gene between two conditions and simultaneously produces a score for each histone mark. The application of ICGEC to the human embryonic stem cell line H1 and four H1-derived cell lines with available epigenomic data for the same 16 types of histone modifications indicated high robustness and reliability of ICGEC. Furthermore, the analysis of the epigenetically dynamic and conserved genes which were defined based on the ICGEC output results demonstrated that ICGEC can deepen our understanding of the biological processes of cell differentiation to overcome the limitations of traditional expression analysis. Specifically, the ICGEC-derived differentiation-direction-specific genes were shown to have putative functions that are well-matched with cell identity. Additionally, H3K79me1 and H3K27ac were found to be the main histone marks accounting for whether an epigenetically dynamic gene was differentially expressed between two cell lines.Conclusions:The use of ICGEC creates a convenient and robust way to measure the overall epigenetic conservation of individual genes and marks between two conditions. Thus, it provides a basis for exploring the epigenotype-phenotype relationship. ICGEC can be deemed a state-of-the-art method tailored for comparative epigenomic analysis of changes in cell dynamics.",32398001,PMC7216622,10.1186/s12864-020-6771-1,0,BMC genomics,100965258,4.547,0.5247448086738586,0.056856187290969896,0.40468227424749165,0.4071545775120075
"Nutrient Sensing by Histone Marks: Reading the Metabolic Histone Code Using Tracing, Omics, and Modeling","Several metabolites serve as substrates for histone modifications and communicate changes in the metabolic environment to the epigenome. Technologies such as metabolomics and proteomics have allowed us to reconstruct the interactions between metabolic pathways and histones. These technologies have shed light on how nutrient availability can have a dramatic effect on various histone modifications. This metabolism-epigenome cross talk plays a fundamental role in development, immune function, and diseases like cancer. Yet, major challenges remain in understanding the interactions between cellular metabolism and the epigenome. How the levels and fluxes of various metabolites impact epigenetic marks is still unclear. Discussed herein are recent applications and the potential of systems biology methods such as flux tracing and metabolic modeling to address these challenges and to uncover new metabolic-epigenetic interactions. These systems approaches can ultimately help elucidate how nutrients shape the epigenome of microbes and mammalian cells.",32638413,,10.1002/bies.202000083,6,"BioEssays : news and reviews in molecular, cellular and developmental biology",8510851,4.653,0.5235421657562256,0.3779264214046823,0.431438127090301,0.475998209152732
DNA methylation is stable during replication and cell cycle arrest,"DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification with important functions in development. Large-scale loss of DNA methylation is a hallmark of cancer. Recent work has identified large genomic blocks of hypomethylation associated with cancer, EBV transformation and replicative senescence, all of which change the proportion of actively proliferating cells within the population measured. We asked if replication or cell-cycle arrest affects the global levels of methylation or leads to hypomethylated blocks as observed in other settings. We used fluorescence activated cell sorting to isolate primary dermal fibroblasts in G0, G1 and G2 based on DNA content and Ki67 staining. We additionally examined G0 cells arrested by contact inhibition for one week to determine the effects of extended arrest. We analyzed genome wide DNA methylation from sorted cells using whole genome bisulfite sequencing. This analysis demonstrated no global changes or large-scale hypomethylated blocks in any of the examined cell cycle phases, indicating that global levels of methylation are stable with replication and arrest.",26648411,PMC4673417,10.1038/srep17911,24,Scientific reports,101563288,4.996,0.5227503776550293,0.7625418060200669,0.49498327759197325,0.5651552433154257
Epigenetics and assisted reproductive technologies,"Epigenetic modification controls gene activity without changes in the DNA sequence. The genome undergoes several phases of epigenetic programming during gametogenesis and early embryo development, coinciding with assisted reproductive technologies (ART) treatments. Imprinting disorders have been associated with ART techniques, but disentangling the influence of the ART procedures per se from the effect of the reproductive disease of the parents is a challenge. Epidemiological human studies have shown altered birthweight profiles in ART compared with spontaneously conceived singletons. Conception with cryopreserved/thawed embryos results in a higher risk of large-for-gestational-age babies, which may be due to epigenetic modification. Further animal studies have shown altered gene expression profiles in offspring conceived by ART related to altered glucose metabolism. It is controversial whether human adolescents conceived by ART have altered lipid and glucose profiles and thereby a higher long-term risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes. This commentary describes the basic concepts of epigenetics and gives a short overview of the existing literature on the association between imprinting disorders, epigenetic modification and ART.",26458360,,10.1111/aogs.12799,23,Acta obstetricia et gynecologica Scandinavica,370343,4.544,0.5219737887382507,0.745819397993311,0.3879598662207358,0.5399401260857599
TALEored Epigenetics: A DNA-Binding Scaffold for Programmable Epigenome Editing and Analysis,"Epigenetic modification of the cytosine 5-position is an important regulator of gene expression with essential roles in genome stability, development, and disease. In addition to 5-methylcytosine (mC), the oxidized mC derivatives 5-hydroxymethyl-, 5-formyl-, and 5-carboxylcytosine (hmC, fC, and caC) have recently been discovered. These are intermediates of an active demethylation pathway but might also represent new epigenetic marks with individual biological roles. This increase in chemical complexity of DNA-encoded information has created a pressing need for new approaches that allow reading and editing of this information. Transcription-activator-like effectors (TALEs) are DNA-binding domains with programmable sequence selectivity that enable the direct reading of epigenetic cytosine modifications but can also guide enzymatic editing domains to genomic loci of choice. Here, we review recent advances in employing TALEs for these applications.",26972580,,10.1002/cbic.201600072,2,Chembiochem : a European journal of chemical biology,100937360,3.461,0.5217757821083069,0.17391304347826086,0.1939799331103679,0.3866440645827099
Minor Changes for a Major Impact: A Review of Epigenetic Modifications in Cell-Based Therapies for Stroke,"Epigenetic changes in stroke may revolutionize cell-based therapies aimed at reducing ischemic stroke risk and damage. Epigenetic changes are a novel therapeutic target due to their specificity and potential for reversal. Possible targets for epigenetic modification include DNA methylation and demethylation, post-translational histone modification, and the actions of non-coding RNAs such as microRNAs. Many of these epigenetic modifications have been reported to modulate atherosclerosis development and progression, ultimately contributing to stroke pathogenesis. Furthermore, epigenetics may play a major role in inflammatory responses following stroke. Stem cells for stroke have demonstrated safety in clinical trials for stroke and show therapeutic benefit in pre-clinical studies. The efficacy of these cell-based interventions may be amplified with adjunctive epigenetic modifications. This review advances the role of epigenetics in atherosclerosis and inflammation in the context of stroke, followed by a discussion on current stem cell studies modulating epigenetics to ameliorate stroke damage.",36361891,PMC9656972,10.3390/ijms232113106,1,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,6.208,0.5217605233192444,0.11705685618729098,0.6187290969899666,0.4602135046269981
Getting personal with epigenetics: towards individual-specific epigenomic imputation with machine learning,"Epigenetic modifications are dynamic mechanisms involved in the regulation of gene expression. Unlike the DNA sequence, epigenetic patterns vary not only between individuals, but also between different cell types within an individual. Environmental factors, somatic mutations and ageing contribute to epigenetic changes that may constitute early hallmarks or causal factors of disease. Epigenetic modifications are reversible and thus promising therapeutic targets for precision medicine. However, mapping efforts to determine an individual's cell-type-specific epigenome are constrained by experimental costs and tissue accessibility. To address these challenges, we developed eDICE, an attention-based deep learning model that is trained to impute missing epigenomic tracks by conditioning on observed tracks. Using a recently published set of epigenomes from four individual donors, we show that transfer learning across individuals allows eDICE to successfully predict individual-specific epigenetic variation even in tissues that are unmapped in a given donor. These results highlight the potential of machine learning-based imputation methods to advance personalized epigenomics.",37550323,PMC10406842,10.1038/s41467-023-40211-2,1,Nature communications,101528555,17.694,0.5215016007423401,0.12040133779264214,0.939799331103679,0.5249410942246683
Epigenetic modification of nucleic acids: from basic studies to medical applications,"The epigenetic modification of nucleic acids represents one of the most significant areas of study in the field of nucleic acids because it makes gene regulation more complex and heredity more complicated, thus indicating its profound impact on aspects of heredity, growth, and diseases. The recent characterization of epigenetic modifications of DNA and RNA using chemical labelling strategies has promoted the discovery of these modifications, and the newly developed single-base or single-cell resolution mapping strategies have enabled large-scale epigenetic studies in eukaryotes. Due to these technological breakthroughs, several new epigenetic marks have been discovered that have greatly extended the scope and impact of epigenetic modifications in nucleic acids over the past few years. Because epigenetics is reversible and susceptible to environmental factors, it could potentially be a promising direction for clinical medicine research. In this review, we have comprehensively discussed how these epigenetic marks are involved in disease, including the pathogenesis, prevention, diagnosis and treatment of disease. These findings have revealed that the epigenetic modification of nucleic acids has considerable significance in various areas from methodology to clinical medicine and even in biomedical applications.",28352906,,10.1039/c6cs00599c,69,Chemical Society reviews,335405,60.615,0.520922839641571,0.9230769230769231,0.9899665551839465,0.6951623994371167
Epigenetic Drivers in Pediatric Medulloblastoma,"Epigenetics is the process by which gene expression is regulated by events other than alterations of the genome. This includes DNA methylation, histone modifications, chromatin remodeling, microRNAs, and long non-coding RNAs. Methylation of DNA, chromatin remodeling, and histone modifications regulate the chromatin and access of transcription factors to DNA and in turn gene transcription. Alteration of chromatin is now recognized to be deregulated in many cancers. Medulloblastoma is an embryonal tumor of the cerebellum and the most common malignant brain tumor in children, that occurs only rarely in adults. Medulloblastoma is characterized by four major molecularly and histopathologically distinct groups, wingless (WNT), sonic hedgehog (SHH), group 3 (G3), and group 4 (G4), that, except for WNT, are each now subdivided in several subgroups. Gene expression array, next-generation sequencing, and methylation profiling of several hundred primary tumors by several consortia and independent groups revealed that medulloblastomas harbor a paucity of mutations most of which occur in epigenetic regulators, genetic alterations in oncogenes and tumor suppressors, in addition to copy number alterations and chromosome gains and losses. Remarkably, some tumors have no reported mutations, suggesting that some genes required for oncogenesis might be regulated by epigenetic mechanisms which are still to be uncovered and validated. This review will highlight several epigenetic regulators focusing mainly on histone modifiers identified in medulloblastoma.",29178021,PMC5807456,10.1007/s12311-017-0899-9,41,"Cerebellum (London, England)",101089443,3.648,0.5203135013580322,0.8494983277591973,0.21070234113712374,0.5242282345940835
Epigenetic Modifications and Modulators in Prostate Cancer,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most common malignancies in men. Its clinical behavior ranges from indolent to aggressive. The clinical and morphological methods and features currently adopted show a low predictive value concerning the definition of its level of aggressiveness. Investigations have been led to understand its complex genomic landscape to improve diagnosis and prognosis as well as to define the potential role of new therapeutic targets. Epigenetic changes, including modifications in DNA methylation and histone acetylation, can contribute to the clinical behavior of PCa. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) can be used as potential biomarkers in the definition of PCa. The reversibility of epigenetic modifications opens the door to a potential perspective in the development of epigenetics modulators. The scope of this contribution is to review the main epigenetic modifications identified in PCa, including research on epigenetic modifiers and modulators.",29604923,,10.1615/CritRevOncog.2017020964,9,Critical reviews in oncogenesis,8914610,0.0,0.5191556811332703,0.4882943143812709,0.07357859531772576,0.4238679906197615
Effects of Dietary Nutrients on Epigenetic Changes in Cancer,"Gene-nutrient interactions are important contributors to health management and disease prevention. Nutrition can alter gene expression, as well as the susceptibility to disease, including cancer, through epigenetic changes. Nutrients can influence the epigenetic status through several mechanisms, such as DNA methylation, histone modifications, and miRNA-dependent gene silencing. These alterations were associated with either increased or decreased risk for cancer development. There is convincing evidence indicating that several foods have protective roles in cancer prevention, by inhibiting tumor progression directly or through modifying tumor's microenvironment that leads to hostile conditions favorable to tumor initiation or growth. While nutritional intakes from foods cannot be adequately controlled for dosage, the role of nutrients in the epigenetics of cancer has led to more research aimed at developing nutriceuticals and drugs as cancer therapies. Clinical studies are needed to evaluate the optimum doses of dietary compounds, the safety profile of dosages, to establish the most efficient way of administration, and bioavailability, in order to maximize the beneficial effects already discovered, and to ensure replicability. Thus, nutrition represents a promising tool to be used not only in cancer prevention, but hopefully also in cancer treatment.",30178249,,10.1007/978-1-4939-8751-1_7,12,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,0.0,0.5163668394088745,0.5919732441471572,0.07692307692307693,0.44359936785937154
Understanding epigenetic architecture of suicide neurobiology: A critical perspective,"Current understanding of environmental cross-talk with genetic makeup is found to be mediated through an epigenetic interface which is associated with prominent reversible and heritable changes at gene expression level. Recent emergence of epigenetic modulation in shaping the genetic information has become a key regulatory factor in answering the underlying complexities associated with several mental disorders. A comprehensive understanding of the pertinent changes in the epigenetic makeup of suicide phenotype exhibits a characteristic signature with the possibility of using it as a biomarker to help predict the risk factors associated with suicide. Within the scope of this current review, the most sought after epigenetic changes of DNA methylation and histone modification are thoroughly scrutinized to understand their close functional association with the broad spectrum of suicide phenotype.",27836463,PMC5183548,10.1016/j.neubiorev.2016.10.031,12,Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews,7806090,9.052,0.515863835811615,0.5953177257525084,0.8127090301003345,0.5911236526575376
The Role of Epigenetics in Brain and Spinal Cord Tumors,"Identification of distinct genetic and epigenetic profiles in various neuroepithelial tumors has improved the classification and uncovered novel diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive molecular biomarkers for improved prediction of treatment response and outcome. Especially, in pediatric high-grade brain tumors, such as diffuse midline glioma, H3K27M-altered and posterior fossa group A-ependymoma, epigenetic changes predominate, along with changes in expression of known oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes induced by histone modifications and DNA methylation. The precise role of epigenetic abnormalities is important for understanding tumorigenesis and the establishment of brain tumor treatment strategies. Using powerful epigenetic-based therapies for cancer cells, the aberrantly regulated epigenome can be restored to a more normal state through epigenetic reprogramming. Combinations of agents targeting DNA methylation and/or other epigenetic modifications may be a promising cancer treatment. Therefore, the integration of multi-omics data including epigenomics is now important for classifying primary brain tumors and predicting their biological behavior. Recent advances in molecular genetics and epigenetic integrated diagnostics of brain tumors influence new strategies for targeted therapy.",36587385,,10.1007/978-3-031-14732-6_8,1,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,121103,3.65,0.5158180594444275,0.12374581939799331,0.24749163879598662,0.3837383273054525
Harmonization of transcriptomic and methylomic analysis in environmental epidemiology studies for potential application in chemical risk assessment,"Recent efforts have posited the utility of transcriptomic-based approaches to understand chemical-related perturbations in the context of human health risk assessment. Epigenetic modification (e.g., DNA methylation) can influence gene expression changes and is known to occur as a molecular response to some chemical exposures. Characterization of these methylation events is critical to understand the molecular consequences of chemical exposures. In this context, a novel workflow was developed to interrogate publicly available epidemiological transcriptomic and methylomic data to identify relevant pathway level changes in response to chemical exposure, using inorganic arsenic as a case study. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was used to identify causal methylation events that result in concomitant downstream transcriptional deregulation. This analysis demonstrated an unequal distribution of differentially methylated regions across the human genome. After mapping these events to known genes, significant enrichment of a subset of these pathways suggested that arsenic-mediated methylation may be both specific and non-specific. Parallel GSEA performed on matched transcriptomic samples determined that a substantially reduced subset of these pathways are enriched and that not all chemically-induced methylation results in a downstream alteration in gene expression. The resulting pathways were found to be representative of well-established molecular events known to occur in response to arsenic exposure. The harmonization of enriched transcriptional patterns with those identified from the methylomic platform promoted the characterization of plausibly causal molecular signaling events. The workflow described here enables significant gene and methylation-specific pathways to be identified from whole blood samples of individuals exposed to environmentally relevant chemical levels. As future efforts solidify specific causal relationships between these molecular events and relevant apical endpoints, this novel workflow could aid risk assessments by identifying molecular targets serving as biomarkers of hazard, informing mechanistic understanding, and characterizing dose ranges that promote relevant molecular/epigenetic signaling events occuring in response to chemical exposures.",35537365,,10.1016/j.envint.2022.107278,0,Environment international,7807270,13.352,0.5157876014709473,0.06020066889632107,0.882943143812709,0.49810132342437435
Artificial light at night: melatonin as a mediator between the environment and epigenome,"The adverse effects of excessive use of artificial light at night (ALAN) are becoming increasingly evident and associated with several health problems including cancer. Results of epidemiological studies revealed that the increase in breast cancer incidents co-distribute with ALAN worldwide. There is compiling evidence that suggests that melatonin suppression is linked to ALAN-induced cancer risks, but the specific genetic mechanism linking environmental exposure and the development of disease is not well known. Here we propose a possible genetic link between environmental exposure and tumorigenesis processes. We discuss evidence related to the relationship between epigenetic remodelling and oncogene expression. In breast cancer, enhanced global hypomethylation is expected in oncogenes, whereas in tumour suppressor genes local hypermethylation is recognized in the promoter CpG chains. A putative mechanism of action involving epigenetic modifications mediated by pineal melatonin is discussed in relation to cancer prevalence. Taking into account that ALAN-induced epigenetic modifications are reversible, early detection of cancer development is of great significance in the treatment of the disease. Therefore, new biomarkers for circadian disruption need to be developed to prevent ALAN damage.",25780234,PMC4375362,10.1098/rstb.2014.0121,39,"Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London.

Epigenetic remodeling by vitamin C potentiates plasma cell differentiation,"Ascorbate (vitamin C) is an essential micronutrient in humans. The severe chronic deficiency of ascorbate, termed scurvy, has long been associated with increased susceptibility to infections. How ascorbate affects the immune system at the cellular and molecular levels remained unclear. From a micronutrient analysis, we identified ascorbate as a potent enhancer for antibody response by facilitating the IL-21/STAT3-dependent plasma cell differentiation in mouse and human B cells. The effect of ascorbate is unique as other antioxidants failed to promote plasma cell differentiation. Ascorbate is especially critical during early B cell activation by poising the cells to plasma cell lineage without affecting the proximal IL-21/STAT3 signaling and the overall transcriptome. As a cofactor for epigenetic enzymes, ascorbate facilitates TET2/3-mediated DNA modification and demethylation of multiple elements at thePrdm1locus. DNA demethylation augments STAT3 association at thePrdm1promoter and a downstream enhancer, thus ensuring efficient gene expression and plasma cell differentiation. The results suggest that an adequate level of ascorbate is required for antibody response and highlight how micronutrients may regulate the activity of epigenetic enzymes to regulate gene expression. Our findings imply that epigenetic enzymes can function as sensors to gauge the availability of metabolites and influence cell fate decisions.",36069787,PMC9451539,10.7554/eLife.73754,5,eLife,101579614,8.713,0.5149644017219543,0.3377926421404682,0.782608695652174,0.533058908591701
Epigenetic regulation and division of labor in social insects,"Analogous to multicellular organisms, social insect colonies are characterized by division of labor with queens and workers reflecting germline and soma, respectively. In multicellular organisms, such division is achieved through epigenetic factors regulating cell differentiation during development. Analogously, epigenetic regulation is postulated to regulate caste differences in social insects. We summarize recent findings about the role of epigenetics in social insects, focusing on DNA methylation and histone modifications. We specifically address (i) queen versus worker caste differentiation, (ii) queen versus worker caste differences, and (iii) division of labor among workers. Our review provides an overview of an exciting and controversially discussed field in developmental and molecular biology. It shows that our current understanding about the role of epigenetics in regulating division of labor in social insects is still fragmentary but that refined methods with well-replicated samples and targeted questions offer promising insights into this emerging field of socio-epigenomics.",37164259,,10.1016/j.cois.2023.101051,1,Current opinion in insect science,101635599,5.254,0.5147128701210022,0.12709030100334448,0.5183946488294314,0.43792471203915645
Epigenome Interactions with Patterned Neuronal Activity,"The temporal coding of action potential activity is fundamental to nervous system function. Here we consider how gene expression in neurons is regulated by specific patterns of action potential firing, with an emphasis on new information on epigenetic regulation of gene expression. Patterned action potential activity activates intracellular signaling networks selectively in accordance with the kinetics of activation and inactivation of second messengers, phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of protein kinases, and cytoplasmic and nuclear calcium dynamics, which differentially activate specific transcription factors. Increasing evidence also implicates activity-dependent regulation of epigenetic mechanisms to alter chromatin architecture. Changes in three-dimensional chromatin structure, including chromatin compaction, looping, double-stranded DNA breaks, histone and DNA modification, are altered by action potential activity to selectively inhibit or promote transcription of specific genes. These mechanisms of activity-dependent regulation of gene expression are important in neural development, plasticity, and in neurological and psychological disorders.",29482447,PMC6553633,10.1177/1073858418760744,3,"The Neuroscientist : a review journal bringing neurobiology, neurology and",9504819,7.235,0.514514684677124,0.22742474916387959,0.7023411371237458,0.49466198806379946
Snapshot: a package for clustering and visualizing epigenetic history during cell differentiation,"Background:Epigenetic modification of chromatin plays a pivotal role in regulating gene expression during cell differentiation. The scale and complexity of epigenetic data pose significant challenges for biologists to identify the regulatory events controlling cell differentiation.Results:To reduce the complexity, we developed a package, called Snapshot, for clustering and visualizing candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) based on their epigenetic signals during cell differentiation. This package first introduces a binarized indexing strategy for clustering the cCREs. It then provides a series of easily interpretable figures for visualizing the signal and epigenetic state patterns of the cCREs clusters during the cell differentiation. It can also use different hierarchies of cell types to highlight the epigenetic history specific to any particular cell lineage. We demonstrate the utility of Snapshot using data from a consortium project for ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON (VISION) of epigenomic data in hematopoiesis.Conclusion:The package Snapshot can identify all distinct clusters of genomic locations with unique epigenetic signal patterns during cell differentiation. It outperforms other methods in terms of interpreting and reproducing the identified cCREs clusters.

The Impact of Epigenetic Modifications in Myeloid Malignancies,"Myeloid malignancy is a broad term encapsulating myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Initial studies into genomic profiles of these diseases have shown 2000 somatic mutations prevalent across the spectrum of myeloid blood disorders. Epigenetic mutations are emerging as critical components of disease progression, with mutations in genes controlling chromatin regulation and methylation/acetylation status. Genes such as DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A), ten eleven translocation methylcytosine dioxygenase 2 (TET2), additional sex combs-like 1 (ASXL1), enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) and isocitrate dehydrogenase 1/2 (IDH1/2) show functional impact in disease pathogenesis. In this review we discuss how current knowledge relating to disease progression, mutational profile and therapeutic potential is progressing and increasing understanding of myeloid malignancies.",34065087,PMC8125972,10.3390/ijms22095013,10,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,6.208,0.5140801072120667,0.5418060200668896,0.6220735785953178,0.5412239840596815
Linking inter-individual variability to endocrine disruptors: insights for epigenetic inheritance,"Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) can induce a myriad of adverse health effects. An area of active investigation is the multi- and transgenerational inheritance of EDC-induced adverse health effects referring to the transmission of phenotypes across multiple generations via the germline. The inheritance of EDC-induced adverse health effects across multiple generations can occur independent of genetics, spurring much research into the transmission of underlying epigenetic mechanisms. Epigenetic mechanisms play important roles in the development of an organism and are responsive to environmental exposures. To date, rodent studies have demonstrated that acquired epigenetic marks, particularly DNA methylation, that are inherited following parental EDC exposure can escape embryonic epigenome reprogramming. The acquired epimutations can lead to subsequent adult-onset diseases. Increasing studies have reported inter-individual variations that occur with epigenetic inheritance. Factors that underlie differences among individuals could reveal previously unidentified mechanisms of epigenetic transmission. In this review, we give an overview of DNA methylation and posttranslational histone modification as the potential mechanisms for disease transmission, and define the requirements for multi- and transgenerational epigenetic inheritance. We subsequently evaluate rodent studies investigating how acquired changes in epigenetic marks especially DNA methylation across multiple generations can vary among individuals following parental EDC exposure. We also discuss potential sources of inter-individual variations and the challenges in identifying these variations. We conclude our review discussing the challenges in applying rodent generational studies to humans.",29218402,PMC5849504,10.1007/s00335-017-9729-0,5,Mammalian genome : official journal of the International Mammalian Genome Society,9100916,3.224,0.5138437747955322,0.3411371237458194,0.1605351170568562,0.4086407130378545
Influence of Benzo(a)pyrene on Different Epigenetic Processes,"Epigenetic changes constitute one of the processes that is involved in the mechanisms of carcinogenicity. They include dysregulation of DNA methylation processes, disruption of post-translational patterns of histone modifications, and changes in the composition and/or organization of chromatin. Benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) influences DNA methylation and, depending on its concentrations, as well as the type of cell, tissue and organism it causes hypomethylation or hypermethylation. Moreover, the exposure to polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), including BaP in tobacco smoke results in an altered methylation status of the offsprings. Researches have indicated a potential relationship between toxicity of BaP and deregulation of the biotin homeostasis pathway that plays an important role in the process of carcinogenesis. Animal studies have shown that parental-induced BaP toxicity can be passed on to the F1 generation as studied on marine medaka (Oryzias melastigma), and the underlying mechanism is likely related to a disturbance in the circadian rhythm. In addition, ancestral exposure of fish to BaP may cause intergenerational osteotoxicity in non-exposed F3 offsprings. Epidemiological studies of lung cancer have indicated that exposure to BaP is associated with changes in methylation levels at 15 CpG; therefore, changes in DNA methylation may be considered as potential mediators of BaP-induced lung cancer. The mechanism of epigenetic changes induced by BaP are mainly due to the formation of CpG-BPDE adducts, between metabolite of BaP-BPDE and CpG, which leads to changes in the level of 5-methylcytosine. BaP also acts through inhibition of DNA methyltransferases activity, as well as by increasing histone deacetylases HDACs, i.e., HDAC2 and HDAC3 activity. The aim of this review is to discuss the mechanism of the epigenetic action of BaP on the basis of the latest publications.",34948252,PMC8707600,10.3390/ijms222413453,11,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,6.208,0.5134931206703186,0.5652173913043478,0.6254180602006689,0.5462229627031945
Role of Epigenetics in the Pathogenesis of Asthma,"Asthma is a complex, heterogeneous and chronic airway inflammatory disease with different clinical phenotypes caused by diverse triggers and pathophysiological mechanisms. Asthma heritability has been established in many genetic studies but it is evident that only genetic elements are not responsible for the development of asthma. Increasing rate of asthma incidence during past decades has implicated the role of epigenetics in development of asthma. Environmental factors perform as initiator signals through epigenetic mechanisms. Three epigenetic mechanisms have been identified, including DNA methylation, histone modifications, and small noncoding RNAs. These mechanisms regulate the immune responses and inflammatory genes expression in asthma and allergy. This review explains the role of epigenetic modifications in controlling Th2 response and IgE production in asthma and also briefly overviews the role of environmental factors such as pollutions, allergens, prenatal exposures and diet in developing asthma. Recognizing environmental risk factors and their effects on epigenetic mechanisms would be of great interest for prognostic and preventive aspect in treatment of asthma.",28601047,,,10,"Iranian journal of allergy, asthma, and immunology",101146178,1.57,0.5134016275405884,0.5451505016722408,0.11371237458193979,0.4398135517751891
Epigenetic control of heredity,"Epigenetics is the field of science that deals with the study of changes in gene function that do not involve changes in DNA sequence and are heritable while epigenetics inheritance is the process of transmission of epigenetic modifications to the next generation. It can be transient, intergenerational, or transgenerational. There are various epigenetic modifications involving mechanisms such as DNA methylation, histone modification, and noncoding RNA expression, all of which are inheritable.

A growing body of literature implicates Adverse Childhood Experiences, including physical, sexual, and emotional abuse, in a broad range of negative health consequences including adult psychopathology, cardiovascular, and immune disease. Increasing evidence from animal, clinical, and epidemiological studies highlight the critical role of epigenetic programing, such as DNA methylation and histone modification, in altering gene expression, brain structure and function, and ultimately life-course trajectories.

Multifaceted regulation of enhancers in cancer,"Enhancer is one kind of cis-elements regulating gene transcription, whose activity is tightly controlled by epigenetic enzymes and histone modifications. Active enhancers are classified into typical enhancers, super-enhancers and over-active enhancers, according to the enrichment and location of histone modifications. Epigenetic factors control the level of histone modifications on enhancers to determine their activity, such as histone methyltransferases and acetylases. Transcription factors, cofactors and mediators co-operate together and are required for enhancer functions. In turn, abnormalities in these trans-acting factors affect enhancer activity. Recent studies have revealed enhancer dysregulation as one of the important features for cancer. Variations in enhancer regions and mutations of enhancer regulatory genes are frequently observed in cancer cells, and altering the activity of onco-enhancers is able to repress oncogene expression, and suppress tumorigenesis and metastasis. Here we summarize the recent discoveries about enhancer regulation in cancer and discuss their potential application in diagnosis and treatment.",35750313,,10.1016/j.bbagrm.2022.194839,2,Biochimica et biophysica acta.

The Role of Epigenomics in Osteoporosis and Osteoporotic Vertebral Fracture,"Osteoporosis is a complex multifactorial condition of the musculoskeletal system. Osteoporosis and osteoporotic vertebral fracture (OVF) are associated with high medical costs and can lead to poor quality of life. Genetic factors are important in determining bone mass and structure, as well as any predisposition for bone degradation and OVF. However, genetic factors are not enough to explain osteoporosis development and OVF occurrence. Epigenetics describes a mechanism for controlling gene expression and cellular processes without altering DNA sequences. The main mechanisms in epigenetics are DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). Recently, alterations in epigenetic mechanisms and their activity have been associated with osteoporosis and OVF. Here, we review emerging evidence that epigenetics contributes to the machinery that can alter DNA structure, gene expression, and cellular differentiation during physiological and pathological bone remodeling. A progressive understanding of normal bone metabolism and the role of epigenetic mechanisms in multifactorial osteopathy can help us better understand the etiology of the disease and convert this information into clinical practice. A deep understanding of these mechanisms will help in properly coordinating future individual treatments of osteoporosis and OVF.",33322579,PMC7763330,10.3390/ijms21249455,5,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,6.208,0.5122351050376892,0.34448160535117056,0.6287625418060201,0.5019898924540517
Novel epigenetic therapeutic strategies and targets in cancer,"The critical role of dysregulated epigenetic pathways in cancer genesis, development, and therapy has typically been established as a result of scientific and technical innovations in next generation sequencing. RNA interference, histone modification, DNA methylation and chromatin remodelling are epigenetic processes that control gene expression without causing mutations in the DNA. Although epigenetic abnormalities are thought to be a symptom of cell tumorigenesis and malignant events that impact tumor growth and drug resistance, physicians believe that related processes might be a key therapeutic target for cancer treatment and prevention due to the reversible nature of these processes. A plethora of novel strategies for addressing epigenetics in cancer therapy for immuno-oncological complications are currently available - ranging from basic treatment to epigenetic editing. - and they will be the subject of this comprehensive review. In this review, we cover most of the advancements made in the field of targeting epigenetics with special emphasis on microbiology, plasma science, biophysics, pharmacology, molecular biology, phytochemistry, and nanoscience.",36126898,,10.1016/j.bbadis.2022.166552,7,Biochimica et biophysica acta.

Epigenetic reprogramming in periodontal disease: Dynamic crosstalk with potential impact in oncogenesis,"Periodontitis is a chronic multifactorial inï¬ammatory disease associated with microbial dysbiosis and characterized by progressive destruction of the periodontal tissues. Such chronic infectious inflammatory disease is recognized as a major public health problem worldwide with measurable impact in systemic health. It has become evident that the periodontal disease phenotypes are not only determined by the microbiome effect, but the extent of the tissue response is also driven by the host genome and epigenome patterns responding to various environmental exposures. More recently there is mounting evidence indicating that epigenetic reprogramming in response to combined intrinsic and environmental exposures, might be particularly relevant due its plasticity and potential application towards precision health. The complex epigenetic crosstalk is reflected in the prognosis and progress of periodontal diseases and may also lead to a favorable landscape for cancer development. This review discusses epigenomics modifications focusing on the role of DNA methylation and pathways linking microbial infection and inflammatory pathways, which are also associated with carcinogenesis. There is a more clear vision whereas 'omics' technologies applied to unveil relevant epigenetic factors could play a significant role in the treatment of periodontal disease in a personalized mode, evidencing that public health approach should coexist with precision individualized treatment.",31850624,,10.1111/prd.12322,11,Periodontology 2000,9313276,12.239,0.5115869641304016,0.568561872909699,0.8695652173913043,0.5945775965384417
Epitranscriptomic regulation by m6A RNA methylation in brain development and diseases,"Cellular RNAs are pervasively tagged with diverse chemical moieties, collectively called epitranscriptomic modifications. The methylation of adenosine at N6position generates N6-methyladenosine (m6A), which is the most abundant and reversible epitranscriptomic modification in mammals. The m6A signaling is mediated by a dedicated set of proteins comprised of writers, erasers, and readers. Contrary to the activation-repression binary view of gene regulation, emerging evidence suggests that the m6A methylation controls multiple aspects of mRNA metabolism, such as splicing, export, stability, translation, and degradation, culminating in the fine-tuning of gene expression. Brain shows the highest abundance of m6A methylation in the body, which is developmentally altered. Within the brain, m6A methylation is biased toward neuronal transcripts and sensitive to neuronal activity. In a healthy brain, m6A maintains several developmental and physiological processes such as neurogenesis, axonal growth, synaptic plasticity, circadian rhythm, cognitive function, and stress response. The m6A imbalance contributes to the pathogenesis of acute and chronic CNS insults, brain cancer, and neuropsychiatric disorders. This review discussed the molecular mechanisms of m6A regulation and its implication in the developmental, physiological, and pathological processes of the brain.",32967524,PMC7820693,10.1177/0271678X20960033,33,Journal of cerebral blood flow and metabolism : official journal of the,8112566,6.96,0.5103744864463806,0.8060200668896321,0.6923076923076923,0.6058902437072933
Manipulating the epigenome for the treatment of disorders with thrombotic complications,"The haemostatic system is tightly regulated to maintain homeostasis to avoid unwanted bleeding or thrombotic complications. Recent research has highlighted the importance of epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation, histone modifications, and miRNA-based mechanisms, that alter gene expression. This can give rise to dysregulated haemostatic or vascular expressed molecules contributing to the development of thrombotic complications. Targeting these epigenetic changes could provide a new avenue for the treatment of pathological blood clots. However, the lack of tissue specificity warrants high-resolution genomic studies of the transcriptome and methylome that will reveal explicit epigenetic targets for the design of superior drugs with minimum off-target effects.",29330124,,10.1016/j.drudis.2018.01.004,2,Drug discovery today,9604391,8.369,0.509833037853241,0.1806020066889632,0.7625418060200669,0.49452858525375054
CRISPR/Cas mediated epigenome editing for cancer therapy,"The understanding of the relationship between epigenetic alterations, their effects on gene expression and the knowledge that these epigenetic alterations are reversible, have opened up new therapeutic pathways for treating various diseases, including cancer. This has led the research for a better understanding of the mechanism and pathways of carcinogenesis and provided the opportunity to develop the therapeutic approaches by targeting such pathways. Epi-drugs, DNA methyl transferase (DNMT) inhibitors and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors are the best examples of epigenetic therapies with clinical applicability. Moreover, precise genome editing technologies such as CRISPR/Cas has proven their efficacy in epigenome editing, including the alteration of epigenetic markers, such as DNA methylation or histone modification. The main disadvantage with DNA gene editing technologies is off-target DNA sequence alteration, which is not an issue with epigenetic editing. It is known that cancer is linked with epigenetic alteration, and thus CRISPR/Cas system shows potential for cancer therapy via epigenome editing. This review outlines the epigenetic therapeutic approach for cancer therapy using CRISPR/Cas, from the basic understanding of cancer epigenetics to potential applications of CRISPR/Cas in treating cancer.",33421620,,10.1016/j.semcancer.2020.12.018,14,Seminars in cancer biology,9010218,17.012,0.509215235710144,0.6254180602006689,0.9331103678929766,0.6172348270448156
Potential epigenomic co-management in rare diseases and epigenetic therapy,"The purpose of this review is to highlight the impact of the alternative splicing process on human disease. Epigenetic regulation determines not only what parts of the genome are expressed but also how they are spliced. The recent progress in the field of epigenetics has important implications for the study of rare diseases. The role of epigenetics in rare diseases is a key issue in molecular physiology and medicine because not only rare diseases can benefit from epigenetic research, but can also provide useful principles for other common and complex disorders such as cancer, cardiovascular, type 2 diabetes, obesity, and neurological diseases. Predominantly, epigenetic modifications include DNA methylation, histone modification, and RNA-associated silencing. These modifications in the genome regulate numerous cellular activities. Disruption of epigenetic regulation process can contribute to the etiology of numerous diseases during both prenatal and postnatal life. Here, I discuss current knowledge about this matter including some current epigenetic therapies and future directions in the field by emphasizing on the RNA-based therapy via antisense oligonucleotides to correct splicing defects.",31079569,,10.1080/15257770.2019.1594893,5,"Nucleosides, nucleotides & nucleic acids",100892832,1.449,0.5082542300224304,0.34782608695652173,0.10702341137123746,0.3959224376790101
Environmental Epigenetics and Genome Flexibility: Focus on 5-Hydroxymethylcytosine,"Convincing evidence accumulated over the last decades demonstrates the crucial role of epigenetic modifications for mammalian genome regulation and its flexibility. DNA methylation and demethylation is a key mechanism of genome programming and reprogramming. During ontogenesis, the DNA methylome undergoes both programmed changes and those induced by environmental and endogenous factors. The former enable accurate activation of developmental programs; the latter drive epigenetic responses to factors that directly or indirectly affect epigenetic biochemistry leading to alterations in genome regulation and mediating organism response to environmental transformations. Adverse environmental exposure can induce aberrant DNA methylation changes conducive to genetic dysfunction and, eventually, various pathologies. In recent years, evidence was derived that apart from 5-methylcytosine, the DNA methylation/demethylation cycle includes three other oxidative derivatives of cytosine-5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), 5-formylcytosine, and 5-carboxylcytosine. 5hmC is a predominantly stable form and serves as both an intermediate product of active DNA demethylation and an essential hallmark of epigenetic gene regulation. This makes 5hmC a potential contributor to epigenetically mediated responses to environmental factors. In this state-of-the-art review, we consolidate the latest findings on environmentally induced adverse effects on 5hmC patterns in mammalian genomes. Types of environmental exposure under consideration include hypnotic drugs and medicines (i.e., phenobarbital, diethylstilbestrol, cocaine, methamphetamine, ethanol, dimethyl sulfoxide), as well as anthropogenic pollutants (i.e., heavy metals, particulate air pollution, bisphenol A, hydroquinone, and pentachlorophenol metabolites). We put a special focus on the discussion of molecular mechanisms underlying environmentally induced alterations in DNA hydroxymethylation patterns and their impact on genetic dysfunction. We conclude that DNA hydroxymethylation is a sensitive biosensor for many harmful environmental factors each of which specifically targets 5hmC in different organs, cell types, and DNA sequences and induces its changes through a specific metabolic pathway. The associated transcriptional changes suggest that environmentally induced 5hmC alterations play a role in epigenetically mediated genome flexibility. We believe that knowledge accumulated in this review together with further studies will provide a solid basis for new approaches to epigenetic therapy and chemoprevention of environmentally induced epigenetic toxicity involving 5hmC patterns.",32370155,PMC7247348,10.3390/ijms21093223,15,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,6.208,0.5066600441932678,0.6488294314381271,0.6321070234113713,0.5601833174858604
Epigenomic Modifications in Modern and Ancient Genomes,"Epigenetic changes have been identified as a major driver of fundamental metabolic pathways. More specifically, the importance of epigenetic regulatory mechanisms for biological processes like speciation and embryogenesis has been well documented and revealed the direct link between epigenetic modifications and various diseases. In this review, we focus on epigenetic changes in animals with special attention on human DNA methylation utilizing ancient and modern genomes. Acknowledging the latest developments in ancient DNA research, we further discuss paleoepigenomic approaches as the only means to infer epigenetic changes in the past. Investigating genome-wide methylation patterns of ancient humans may ultimately yield in a more comprehensive understanding of how our ancestors have adapted to the changing environment, and modified their lifestyles accordingly. We discuss the difficulties of working with ancient DNA in particular utilizing paleoepigenomic approaches, and assess new paleoepigenomic data, which might be helpful in future studies.",35205223,PMC8872240,10.3390/genes13020178,5,Genes,101551097,4.141,0.5055921077728271,0.3511705685618729,0.31438127090301005,0.4364656325566729
Chromosome folding: driver or passenger of epigenetic state?,"Despite a growing understanding of how epigenetic marks such as histone modifications locally modify the activity of the chromatin with which they are associated, we know little about how marked regions on different parts of the genome are able to intercommunicate to effect regulation of gene expression programs. Recent advances in methods that systematically map pairwise chromatin interactions have uncovered important principles of chromosome folding, which are tightly linked to the epigenetic mark profiles and, hence, functional state of the underlying chromatin fiber.",25646381,PMC4315923,10.1101/cshperspect.a018721,5,Cold Spring Harbor perspectives in biology,101513680,9.708,0.5048597455024719,0.35451505016722407,0.8361204013377926,0.5410429376024866
Epigenetic Control of Smooth Muscle Cell Identity and Lineage Memory,"Vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs), like all cells, acquire a cell-specific epigenetic signature during development that includes acquisition of a unique repertoire of histone and DNA modifications. These changes are postulated to induce an open chromatin state (referred to as euchromatin) on the repertoire of genes that are expressed in differentiated SMC, including SMC-selective marker genes like Acta2 and Myh11, as well as housekeeping genes expressed by most cell types. In contrast, genes that are silenced in differentiated SMC acquire modifications associated with a closed chromatin state (ie, heterochromatin) and transcriptional silencing. Herein, we review mechanisms that regulate epigenetic control of the differentiated state of SMC. In addition, we identify some of the major limitations in the field and future challenges, including development of innovative new tools and approaches, for performing single-cell epigenetic assays and locus-selective editing of the epigenome that will allow direct studies of the functional role of specific epigenetic controls during development, injury repair, and disease, including major cardiovascular diseases, such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, and microvascular disease, associated with diabetes mellitus.",26449751,PMC4662608,10.1161/ATVBAHA.115.305044,53,"Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology",9505803,10.514,0.5038947463035583,0.8896321070234113,0.8561872909698997,0.6515007273807971
Ecotoxicological epigenetics in invertebrates: Emerging tool for the evaluation of present and past pollution burden,"The effect of environmental pollution on epigenetic changes and their heredity in affected organisms is of major concern as such changes can play a significant role in adaptation to changing environmental conditions. Changes of epigenetic marks including DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNA's can induce changes in gene transcription leading to physiological long-term changes or even transgenerational inheritance. Such mechanisms have until recently been scarcely studied in invertebrate organisms, mainly focusing on model species including Caenorhabditis elegans and Daphnia magna. However, more data are becoming available, particularly focused on DNA methylation changes caused by anthropogenic pollutants in a wide range of invertebrates. This review examines the literature from field and laboratory studies utilising invertebrate species exposed to environmental pollutants and their effect on DNA methylation. Possible mechanisms of epigenetic modifications and their role on physiology and adaptation as well as the incidence of intergenerational and transgenerational inheritance are discussed. Furthermore, critical research challenges are defined and the way forward is proposed. Future studies should focus on the use of next generation sequencing tools to define invertebrate methylomes under environmental stress in higher resolution, those data should further be linked to gene expression patterns and phenotypes and detailed studies focusing on transgenerational effects are encouraged. Moreover, studies of other epigenetic mechanisms in various invertebrate species, apart from DNA methylation would provide better understanding of interconnected cross-talk between epigenetic marks. Taken together incorporating epigenetic studies in ecotoxicology context presents a promising tool for development of sensitive biomarkers for environmental stress assessment.",34111635,,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.131026,11,Chemosphere,320657,8.943,0.5030860900878906,0.5719063545150501,0.8060200668896321,0.5774369383336708
Advances in the epigenetics of fibroblast biology and fibrotic diseases,"Fibroblasts have a central role in tissue fibrosis and fibrotic diseases. Fibroblast activation is regulated by several mechanisms including epigenetic modifications; histone modifications, DNA methylation and non-coding RNAs. Although research has significantly contributed to our basic understanding of fibrotic diseases over the last decade, cooperative activity of epigenetic mechanisms demonstrates the complexity of fibrogenesis. This review will summarise the latest epigenetic advances in fibroproliferative diseases. Current studies investigating biological implications of epigenetic modifiers, inhibitors of DNA methylation/histone modifying enzymes are promising. Given that ncRNA-based or CRISPR-based epigenetic-editing have shown therapeutic potential in the preclinical models; we consider epigenetic mechanisms represent a potential tool with clinical utility.",31731224,,10.1016/j.coph.2019.10.001,3,Current opinion in pharmacology,100966133,4.768,0.5019063949584961,0.23411371237458195,0.451505016722408,0.4382675827944957
Mendelian Randomization and the Environmental Epigenetics of Health: a Systematic Review,"Purpose of review:Epigenetic modifications are environmentally responsive and may play a mechanistic role in the development of disease. Mendelian randomization uses genetic variation to assess the causal effect of modifiable exposures on health outcomes. We conducted a systematic review of Mendelian randomization studies evaluating the causal role of DNA methylation (DNAm) changes on the development of health states, emphasizing on studies that formally evaluate exposure-DNAm, in addition to DNAm-outcome, causal associations.Recent findings:We identified 15 articles, 4 of them including an environmental determinant of DNAm, including self-reported tobacco smoke exposure, in utero tobacco smoke exposure, measured vitamin B12, and glycemia. Selected articles suggest a causal association of DNAm with some cardiometabolic endpoints. DNAm seemed to partly explain the association of postnatal and prenatal exposure to tobacco smoke and vitamin B12with inflammation biomarkers, birth weight, and cognitive outcomes, respectively. However, the current evidence is not sufficient to infer causality. Additional Mendelian randomization studies from large epidemiologic samples are needed to support the causal role of environmental factors as determinants of health-related epigenetic modifications.",30773605,,10.1007/s40572-019-0226-3,6,Current environmental health reports,101629387,6.521,0.501887321472168,0.38461538461538464,0.6521739130434783,0.5084902524150733
Epigenetics and its role in periodontal diseases: a state-of-the-art review,"The immune response to oral bacteria and the subsequent activation of inflammatory signaling is not only dependent on genetic factors. The importance of so-called epigenetic mechanisms presents additional regulatory pathways of genes involved in maintaining chronic inflammation, including gingivitis and periodontitis. The term epigenetics relates to changes in gene expression that are not encoded in the DNA sequence itself and include chemical alterations of DNA and its associated proteins. These changes lead to remodeling of the chromatin and subsequent activation or inactivation of a gene. Epigenetic mechanisms have been found to contribute to disease, including cancer and autoimmune or inflammatory diseases. In this state-of-the art review, the authors provide the latest findings on the involvement of epigenetic modifications in the development of periodontal disease and present emerging therapeutic strategies aimed at epigenetic targets (epidrugs) associated with the disruption of tissue homeostasis and the development of periodontitis.",25415244,,10.1902/jop.2014.140559,36,Journal of periodontology,8000345,4.494,0.5017309188842773,0.822742474916388,0.38461538461538464,0.5425101232369209
Epigenomic technologies for precision oncology,"Epigenetic patterns in a cell control the expression of genes and consequently determine the phenotype of a cell. Cancer cells possess altered epigenomes which include aberrant patterns of DNA methylation, histone tail modifications, nucleosome positioning and of the three-dimensional chromatin organization within a nucleus. These altered epigenetic patterns are potential useful biomarkers to detect cancer cells and to classify tumor types. In addition, the cancer epigenome dictates the response of a cancer cell to therapeutic intervention and, therefore its knowledge, will allow to predict response to different therapeutic approaches. Here we review the current state-of-the-art technologies that have been developed to decipher epigenetic patterns on the genomic level and discuss how these methods are potentially useful for precision oncology.",32822861,,10.1016/j.semcancer.2020.08.004,3,Seminars in cancer biology,9010218,17.012,0.5004935264587402,0.23745819397993312,0.9364548494983278,0.5350787245708963
Epigenetics in Asthma,"Purpose of review:Asthma is one of the most common chronic respiratory diseases linked with increased morbidity and healthcare utilization. The underlying pathophysiological processes and causal relationships of asthma with epigenetic mechanisms are partially understood. Here we review human studies of epigenetic mechanisms in asthma, with a special focus on DNA methylation.Recent findings:Epigenetic studies of childhood asthma have identified specific methylation signatures associated with allergic inflammation in the airway and immune cells, demonstrating a regulatory role for methylation in asthma pathogenesis. Despite these novel findings, additional research in the role of epigenetic mechanisms underlying asthma endotypes is needed. Similarly, studies of histone modifications are also lacking in asthma. Future studies of epigenetic mechanisms in asthma will benefit from data integration in well phenotyped cohorts.

Epigenetics in Non-tumor Immune-Mediated Skin Diseases,"Epigenetics is the study of the mechanisms that regulate gene expression without modifying DNA sequences. Knowledge of and evidence about how epigenetics plays a causative role in the pathogenesis of many skin diseases is increasing. Since the epigenetic changes present in tumor diseases have been thoroughly reviewed, we believe that knowledge of the new epigenetic findings in non-tumor immune-mediated dermatological diseases should be of interest to the general dermatologist. Hence, the purpose of this review is to summarize the recent literature on epigenetics in most non-tumor dermatological pathologies, focusing on psoriasis. Hyper- and hypomethylation of DNA methyltransferases and methyl-DNA binding domain proteins are the most common and studied methylation mechanisms. The acetylation and methylation of histones H3 and H4 are the most frequent and well-characterized histone modifications and may be associated with disease severity parameters and serve as therapeutic response markers. Many specific microRNAs dysregulated in non-tumor dermatological disease have been reviewed. Deepening the study of how epigenetic mechanisms influence non-tumor immune-mediated dermatological diseases might help us better understand the role of interactions between the environment and the genome in the physiopathogenesis of these diseases.",33646564,,10.1007/s40291-020-00507-1,3,Molecular diagnosis & therapy,101264260,4.476,0.4990052878856659,0.2408026755852843,0.38127090301003347,0.4238178884504631
Post-translational modifications talk and crosstalk to class IIa histone deacetylases,"Epigenetic modifications, such as histone or DNA modifications are key regulators of gene transcription and changes are often associated with maladaptive processes underlying cardiovascular disease. Epigenetic regulators therefore likely play a crucial role in cardiomyocyte homeostasis and facilitate the cellular adaption to various internal and external stimuli, responding to different intercellular and extracellular cues. Class IIa histone deacetylases are a class of epigenetic regulators that possess a myriad of post-transcriptional modification sites that modulate their activity in response to oxidative stress, altered catecholamine signalling or changes in the cellular metabolism. This review summaries the known reversible, post-translational modifications (PTMs) of class IIa histone deacetylases (HDACs) that ultimately drive transcriptional changes in homeostasis and disease. We also highlight the idea of a crosstalk of various PTMs on class IIa HDACs potentially leading to compensatory or synergistic effects on the class IIa HDAC-regulated cell behavior.",34416247,,10.1016/j.yjmcc.2021.08.007,2,Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology,262322,5.763,0.4989185035228729,0.18394648829431437,0.5518394648829431,0.44650829274917525
Modern epigenetics methods in biological research,"The definition of epigenetics refers that molecular modifications on DNA that can regulate gene activity are independent of DNA sequence and mitotically stable. Notably, epigenetics studies have grown exponentially in the past few years. Recent progresses that lead to exciting discoveries and groundbreaking nature of this area demand thorough methodologies and advanced technologies to move epigenetics to the forefront of molecular biology. The most recognized epigenetic regulations are DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). This review will discuss the modern techniques that are available to detect locus-specific and genome-wide changes for all epigenetic codes. Furthermore, updated analysis of technologies, newly developed methods, recent breakthroughs and bioinformatics pipelines in epigenetic analysis will be presented. These methods, as well as many others presented in this specific issue, provide comprehensive guidelines in the area of epigenetics that facilitate further developments in this promising and rapidly developing field.",32645449,PMC7785612,10.1016/j.ymeth.2020.06.022,62,"Methods (San Diego, Calif.)",9426302,4.647,0.49858659505844116,0.9130434782608695,0.4214046822742475,0.5660415891420881
Epigenetic cell memory: The gene's inner chromatin modification circuit,"Epigenetic cell memory allows distinct gene expression patterns to persist in different cell types despite a common genotype. Although different patterns can be maintained by the concerted action of transcription factors (TFs), it was proposed that long-term persistence hinges on chromatin state. Here, we study how the dynamics of chromatin state affect memory, and focus on a biologically motivated circuit motif, among histones and DNA modifications, that mediates the action of TFs on gene expression. Memory arises from time-scale separation among three circuit's constituent processes: basal erasure, auto and cross-catalysis, and recruited erasure of modifications. When the two latter processes are sufficiently faster than the former, the circuit exhibits bistability and hysteresis, allowing active and repressed gene states to coexist and persist after TF stimulus removal. The duration of memory is stochastic with a mean value that increases as time-scale separation increases, but more so for the repressed state. This asymmetry stems from the cross-catalysis between repressive histone modifications and DNA methylation and is enhanced by the relatively slower decay rate of the latter. Nevertheless, TF-mediated positive autoregulation can rebalance this asymmetry and even confers robustness of active states to repressive stimuli. More generally, by wiring positively autoregulated chromatin modification circuits under time scale separation, long-term distinct gene expression patterns arise, which are also robust to failure in the regulatory links.",35385468,PMC8985953,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009961,13,PLoS computational biology,101238922,4.779,0.498230904340744,0.6086956521739131,0.45484949832775917,0.5116475727047809
Epigenetics/epigenomics and prevention by curcumin of early stages of inflammatory-driven colon cancer,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality in the US and worldwide. CRC is the second most common cancer-related death in both men and women globally. Chronic inflammation has been identified as one of the major risk factors of CRC. It may drive genetic and epigenetic/epigenomic alterations, such as DNA methylation, histone modification, and non-coding RNA regulation. Current prevention modalities for CRC are limited and some treatment regimens such as use the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug aspirin may have severe side effects, namely gastrointestinal ulceration and bleeding. Therefore, there is an urgent need of developing alternative strategies. Recently, increasing evidence suggests that several dietary cancer chemopreventive phytochemicals possess anti-inflammation and antioxidative stress activities, and may prevent cancers including CRC. Curcumin (CUR) is the yellow pigment that is found in the rhizomes of turmeric (Curcuma longa). Many studies have demonstrated that CUR exhibit strong anticancer, antioxidative stress, and anti-inflammatory activities by regulating signaling pathways, such as nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2, nuclear factor-ÎºB, and epigenetics/epigenomics pathways of histones modifications, and DNA methylation. In this review, we will discuss the latest evidence in epigenetics/epigenomics alterations by CUR in CRC and their potential contribution in the prevention of CRC.",31820492,PMC6946865,10.1002/mc.23146,34,Molecular carcinogenesis,8811105,5.139,0.4981413185596466,0.8160535117056856,0.5083612040133779,0.5637677342796007
Loss of KMT2C reprograms the epigenomic landscape in hPSCs resulting in NODAL overexpression and a failure of hemogenic endothelium specification,"Germline or somatic variation in the family of KMT2 lysine methyltransferases have been associated with a variety of congenital disorders and cancers. Notably,KMT2A-fusions are prevalent in 70% of infant leukaemias but fail to phenocopy short latency leukaemogenesis in mammalian models, suggesting additional factors are necessary for transformation. Given the lack of additional somatic mutation, the role of epigenetic regulation in cell specification, and our prior results of germlineKMT2Cvariation in infant leukaemia patients, we hypothesized that germline dysfunction of KMT2C altered haematopoietic specification. In isogenicKMT2CKO hPSCs, we found genome-wide differences in histone modifications at active and poised enhancers, leading to gene expression profiles akin to mesendoderm rather than mesoderm highlighted by a significant increase in NODAL expression and WNT inhibition, ultimately resulting in a lack ofin vitrohemogenic endothelium specification. These unbiased multi-omic results provide new evidence for germline mechanisms increasing risk of early leukaemogenesis.",34304711,PMC8865227,10.1080/15592294.2021.1954780,6,Epigenetics,101265293,4.861,0.497222900390625,0.3879598662207358,0.4682274247491639,0.46957119842835493
Metabolic-associated Fatty Liver Disease Regulation through Nutri Epigenetic Methylation,"Metabolically associated fatty liver disease, formerly called nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, is the most common liver disease globally, representing the third cause of liver transplantation. Metabolically associated fatty liver disease is defined as having more than 5% lipid droplets in hepatocytes without other concomitant liver diseases. Various stimuli such as the secretion of inflammatory cytokines, mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum dysfunction due to oxidative stress, alteration of the intestine-liver axis, bacterial dysbiosis, as well as genetic and epigenetic factors can modify the progression of metabolically associated fatty liver disease to fibrosis, cirrhosis, and may reach hepatocellular carcinoma. Epigenetics is responsible for a highly sophisticated regulatory system that controls many cellular processes in response to multiple environmental factors as an adaptive mechanism unrelated to alterations in the primary deoxyribonucleic acid sequence, including gene expression, microRNAs, DNA methylation, modifications in histones, and DNA-protein interactions. Several studies have shown that epigenetic changes are associated with various diseases, including metabolically associated fatty liver disease. Nutri epigenomics is the interaction between nutrition and components at the transcriptional or post-transcriptional level. Methylation processes involve micronutrients that regulate epigenetic states in a physiological and pathological context. Micronutrients such as methionine, folate, and choline are the main components of one-carbon metabolism, functioning as methyl group donors, and their deficiency predisposes to various pathologies such as metabolically associated fatty liver disease. Understanding of epigenetic modifiers leads us to develop new therapeutic therapies for patients with metabolically associated fatty liver disease.",36718062,,10.2174/1389557523666230130093512,0,Mini reviews in medicinal chemistry,101094212,3.737,0.49588024616241455,0.06688963210702341,0.26755852842809363,0.36441777980447215
Using epigenomics data to predict gene expression in lung cancer,"Background:Epigenetic alterations are known to correlate with changes in gene expression among various diseases including cancers. However, quantitative models that accurately predict the up or down regulation of gene expression are currently lacking.Methods:A new machine learning-based method of gene expression prediction is developed in the context of lung cancer. This method uses the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450K Beadchip CpG methylation array data from paired lung cancer and adjacent normal tissues in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and histone modification marker CHIP-Seq data from the ENCODE project, to predict the differential expression of RNA-Seq data in TCGA lung cancers. It considers a comprehensive list of 1424 features spanning the four categories of CpG methylation, histone H3 methylation modification, nucleotide composition, and conservation. Various feature selection and classification methods are compared to select the best model over 10-fold cross-validation in the training data set.Results:A best model comprising 67 features is chosen by ReliefF based feature selection and random forest classification method, with AUC = 0.864 from the 10-fold cross-validation of the training set and AUC = 0.836 from the testing set. The selected features cover all four data types, with histone H3 methylation modification (32 features) and CpG methylation (15 features) being most abundant. Among the dropping-off tests of individual data-type based features, removal of CpG methylation feature leads to the most reduction in model performance. In the best model, 19 selected features are from the promoter regions (TSS200 and TSS1500), highest among all locations relative to transcripts. Sequential dropping-off of CpG methylation features relative to different regions on the protein coding transcripts shows that promoter regions contribute most significantly to the accurate prediction of gene expression.Conclusions:By considering a comprehensive list of epigenomic and genomic features, we have constructed an accurate model to predict transcriptomic differential expression, exemplified in lung cancer.",25861082,PMC4402699,10.1186/1471-2105-16-S5-S10,20,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,3.307,0.4945833384990692,0.6989966555183946,0.1705685618729097,0.47066304657770236
Epigenetics and pulmonary diseases in the horizon of precision medicine: a review,"Epigenetic mechanisms represent potential molecular routes which could bridge the gap between genetic background and environmental risk factors contributing to the pathogenesis of pulmonary diseases. In patients with COPD, asthma and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), there is emerging evidence of aberrant epigenetic marks, mainly including DNA methylation and histone modifications which directly mediate reversible modifications to the DNA without affecting the genomic sequence. Post-translational events and microRNAs can be also regulated epigenetically and potentially participate in disease pathogenesis. Thus, novel pathogenic mechanisms and putative biomarkers may be detectable in peripheral blood, sputum, nasal and buccal swabs or lung tissue. Besides, DNA methylation plays an important role during the early phases of fetal development and may be impacted by environmental exposures, ultimately influencing an individual's susceptibility to COPD, asthma and PAH later in life. With the advances in omics platforms and the application of computational biology tools, modelling the epigenetic variability in a network framework, rather than as single molecular defects, provides insights into the possible molecular pathways underlying the pathogenesis of COPD, asthma and PAH. Epigenetic modifications may have clinical applications as noninvasive biomarkers of pulmonary diseases. Moreover, combining molecular assays with network analysis of epigenomic data may aid in clarifying the multistage transition from a ""pre-disease"" to ""disease"" state, with the goal of improving primary prevention of lung diseases and its subsequent clinical management.We describe epigenetic mechanisms known to be associated with pulmonary diseases and discuss how network analysis could improve our understanding of lung diseases.",33214212,,10.1183/13993003.03406-2020,28,The European respiratory journal,8803460,33.795,0.494426965713501,0.7859531772575251,0.9765886287625418,0.649164540632114
Epigenetics and developmental plasticity in orthopteroid insects,"Developmental plasticity is a key driver of the extraordinary ecological success of insects. Epigenetic mechanisms provide an important link between the external stimuli that initiate polyphenisms, and the stable changes in gene expression that govern alternative insect morphs. We review the epigenetics of orthopteroid insects, focussing on recent research on locusts and termites, two groups which display high levels of phenotypic plasticity, and for which genome sequences have become available in recent years. We examine research on the potential role of DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNAs in the regulation of gene expression in these insects. DNA methylation patterns in orthopteroids share a number of characteristics with those of hymenopteran insects, although methylation levels are much higher, and extend to introns and repeat elements. Future examinations of epigenetic mechanisms in these insects will benefit from comparison of tissues from aged-matched individuals from alternative morphs, and adequate biological replication.",29602359,,10.1016/j.cois.2017.11.003,6,Current opinion in insect science,101635599,5.254,0.4935078024864197,0.391304347826087,0.5217391304347826,0.47871337714402573
Detection of epigenetic aberrations in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most common cause of cancer death worldwide. Hepatocarcinogenesis is a complex, multistep process. It is now recognized that HCC is a both genetic and epigenetic disease; genetic and epigenetic components cooperate at all stages of hepatocarcinogenesis. Epigenetic changes involve aberrant DNA methylation, posttranslational histone modifications and aberrant expression of microRNAs all of which can affect the expression of oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes and other tumor-related genes and alter the pathways in cancer development. Several risk factors for HCC, including hepatitis B and C virus infections and exposure to the chemical carcinogen aflatoxin B1 have been found to influence epigenetic changes. Their interactions could play an important role in the initiation and progression of HCC. Discovery and detection of biomarkers for epigenetic changes is a promising area for early diagnosis and risk prediction of HCC.",25421688,,10.1007/978-1-4939-1804-1_37,16,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,0.0,0.4930577278137207,0.6622073578595318,0.0802675585284281,0.4443296199658244
Single-base resolution analysis of DNA epigenome via high-throughput sequencing,"Epigenetic changes caused by DNA methylation and histone modifications play important roles in the regulation of various cellular processes and development. Recent discoveries of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) oxidation derivatives including 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), 5-formylcytsine (5fC) and 5-carboxycytosine (5caC) in mammalian genome further expand our understanding of the epigenetic regulation. Analysis of DNA modification patterns relies increasingly on sequencing-based profiling methods. A number of different approaches have been established to map the DNA epigenomes with single-base resolution, as represented by the bisulfite-based methods, such as classical bisulfite sequencing (BS-seq), TAB-seq (TET-assisted bisulfite sequencing), oxBS-seq (oxidative bisulfite sequencing) and etc. These methods have been used to generate base-resolution maps of 5mC and its oxidation derivatives in genomic samples. The focus of this review will be to discuss the chemical methodologies that have been developed to detect the cytosine derivatives in the genomic DNA.",26825949,,10.1007/s11427-016-5013-x,3,Science China.

"Epigenetics in Lewy Body Diseases: Impact on Gene Expression, Utility as a Biomarker, and Possibilities for Therapy","Lewy body disorders (LBD) include Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). They are synucleinopathies with a heterogeneous clinical manifestation. As a cause of neuropathological overlap with other neurodegenerative diseases, the establishment of a correct clinical diagnosis is still challenging, and clinical management may be difficult. The combination of genetic variation and epigenetic changes comprising gene expression-modulating DNA methylation and histone alterations modifies the phenotype, disease course, and susceptibility to disease. In this review, we summarize the results achieved in the deciphering of the LBD epigenome. To provide an appropriate context, first LBD genetics is briefly outlined. Afterwards, a detailed review of epigenetic modifications identified for LBD in human cells, postmortem, and peripheral tissues is provided. We also focus on the difficulty of identifying epigenome-related biomarker candidates and discuss the results obtained so far. Additionally, epigenetic changes as therapeutic targets, as well as different epigenome-based treatments, are revised. The number of studies focusing on PD is relatively limited and practically inexistent for DLB. There is a lack of replication studies, and some results are even contradictory, probably due to differences in sample collection and analytical techniques. In summary, we show the current achievements and directions for future research.",32630630,PMC7369933,10.3390/ijms21134718,9,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,6.208,0.492348313331604,0.4916387959866221,0.6354515050167224,0.5208270481996313
Epigenetics in Human Obesity and Type 2 Diabetes,"Epigenetic mechanisms control gene activity and the development of an organism. The epigenome includes DNA methylation, histone modifications, and RNA-mediated processes, and disruption of this balance may cause several pathologies and contribute to obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D). This Review summarizes epigenetic signatures obtained from human tissues of relevance for metabolism-i.e., adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, pancreatic islets, liver, and blood-in relation to obesity and T2D. Although this research field is still young, these comprehensive data support not only a role for epigenetics in disease development, but also epigenetic alterations as a response to disease. Genetic predisposition, as well as aging, contribute to epigenetic variability, and several environmental factors, including exercise and diet, further interact with the human epigenome.

Harnessing targeted DNA methylation and demethylation using dCas9,"DNA methylation is an essential DNA modification that plays a crucial role in genome regulation during differentiation and development, and is disrupted in a range of disease states. The recent development of CRISPR/catalytically dead CRISPR/Cas9 (dCas9)-based targeted DNA methylation editing tools has enabled new insights into the roles and functional relevance of this modification, including its importance at regulatory regions and the role of aberrant methylation in various diseases. However, while these tools are advancing our ability to understand and manipulate this regulatory layer of the genome, they still possess a variety of limitations in efficacy, implementation, and targeting specificity. Effective targeted DNA methylation editing will continue to advance our fundamental understanding of the role of this modification in different genomic and cellular contexts, and further improvements may enable more accurate disease modeling and possible future treatments.

Methylome analysis reveals an important role for epigenetic changes in the regulation of the Arabidopsis response to phosphate starvation,"Phosphate (Pi) availability is a significant limiting factor for plant growth and productivity in both natural and agricultural systems. To cope with such limiting conditions, plants have evolved a myriad of developmental and biochemical strategies to enhance the efficiency of Pi acquisition and assimilation to avoid nutrient starvation. In the past decade, these responses have been studied in detail at the level of gene expression; however, the possible epigenetic components modulating plant Pi starvation responses have not been thoroughly investigated. Here, we report that an extensive remodeling of global DNA methylation occurs in Arabidopsis plants exposed to low Pi availability, and in many instances, this effect is related to changes in gene expression. Modifications in methylation patterns within genic regions were often associated with transcriptional activation or repression, revealing the important role of dynamic methylation changes in modulating the expression of genes in response to Pi starvation. Moreover, Arabidopsis mutants affected in DNA methylation showed that changes in DNA methylation patterns are required for the accurate regulation of a number of Pi-starvation-responsive genes and that DNA methylation is necessary to establish proper morphological and physiological phosphate starvation responses.",26668375,PMC4702951,10.1073/pnas.1522301112,86,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,12.779,0.49128812551498413,0.9431438127090301,0.8729096989966555,0.6579835776501276
Mapping chromatin accessibility and active regulatory elements reveals pathological mechanisms in human gliomas,"Chromatin structure and accessibility, and combinatorial binding of transcription factors to regulatory elements in genomic DNA control transcription. Genetic variations in genes encoding histones, epigenetics-related enzymes or modifiers affect chromatin structure/dynamics and result in alterations in gene expression contributing to cancer development or progression. Gliomas are brain tumors frequently associated with epigenetics-related gene deregulation. We perform whole-genome mapping of chromatin accessibility, histone modifications, DNA methylation patterns and transcriptome analysis simultaneously in multiple tumor samples to unravel epigenetic dysfunctions driving gliomagenesis.

A Molecular Perspective on Procedures and Outcomes with Assisted Reproductive Technologies,"The emerging association of assisted reproductive technologies with adverse perinatal outcomes has prompted the in-depth examination of clinical and laboratory protocols and procedures and their possible effects on epigenetic regulatory mechanism(s). The application of various approaches to study epigenetic regulation to problems in reproductive medicine has the potential to identify relative risk indicators for particular conditions, diagnostic biomarkers of disease state, and prognostic indicators of outcome. Moreover, when applied genome-wide, these techniques are likely to find novel pathways of disease pathogenesis and identify new targets for intervention. The analysis of DNA methylation, histone modifications, transcription factors, enhancer binding and other chromatin proteins, DNase-hypersensitivity and, micro- and other noncoding RNAs all provide overlapping and often complementary snapshots of chromatin structure and resultant ""gene activity."" In terms of clinical application, the predictive power and utility of epigenetic information will depend on the power of individual techniques to discriminate normal levels of interindividual variation from variation linked to a disease state.

The Epigenetic Reprogramming Roadmap in Generation of iPSCs from Somatic Cells,"Reprogramming of somatic cells to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) is a comprehensive epigenetic process involving genome-wide modifications of histones and DNA methylation. This process is often incomplete, which subsequently affects iPSC reprogramming, pluripotency, and differentiation capacity. Here, we review the epigenetic changes with a focus on histone modification (methylation and acetylation) and DNA modification (methylation) during iPSC induction.

Mitochondrial Epigenetics and Environmental Health: Making a Case for Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals,"Recent studies implicate mitochondrial dysfunction in the development and progression of numerous chronic diseases, which may be partially due to modifications in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). There is also mounting evidence that epigenetic modifications to mtDNA may be an additional layer of regulation that controls mitochondrial biogenesis and function. Several environmental factors (eg, smoking, air pollution) have been associated with altered mtDNA methylation in a handful of mechanistic studies and in observational human studies. However, little is understood about other environmental contaminants that induce mtDNA epigenetic changes. Numerous environmental toxicants are classified as endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). Beyond their actions on hormonal pathways, EDC exposure is associated with elevated oxidative stress, which may occur through or result in mitochondrial dysfunction. Although only a few studies have assessed the impacts of EDCs on mtDNA methylation, the current review provides reasons to consider mtDNA epigenetic disruption as a mechanism of action of EDCs and reviews potential limitations related to currently available evidence. First, there is sufficient evidence that EDCs (including bisphenols and phthalates) directly target mitochondrial function, and more direct evidence is needed to connect this to mtDNA methylation. Second, these and other EDCs are potent modulators of nuclear DNA epigenetics, including DNA methylation and histone modifications. Finally, EDCs have been shown to disrupt several modulators of mtDNA methylation, including DNA methyltransferases and the mitochondrial transcription factor A/nuclear respiratory factor 1 pathway. Taken together, these studies highlight the need for future research evaluating mtDNA epigenetic disruption by EDCs and to detail specific mechanisms responsible for such disruptions.",32777053,PMC7818895,10.1093/toxsci/kfaa129,9,Toxicological sciences : an official journal of the Society of Toxicology,9805461,4.109,0.48729217052459717,0.49498327759197325,0.30434782608695654,0.45224152305054427

Diagnosis and treatment of lymphomas in the era of epigenetics,"Lymphomas represent a heterogeneous group of cancers characterized by clonal lymphoproliferation. Over the past decades, frequent epigenetic dysregulations have been identified in hematologic malignancies including lymphomas. Many of these impairments occur in genes with established roles and well-known functions in the regulation and maintenance of the epigenome. In hematopoietic cells, these dysfunctions can result in abnormal DNA methylation, erroneous chromatin state and/or altered miRNA expression, affecting many different cellular functions. Nowadays, it is evident that epigenetic dysregulations in lymphoid neoplasms are mainly caused by genetic alterations in genes encoding for enzymes responsible for histone or chromatin modifications.

Epigenetic Landscape Changes Due to Acupuncture Treatment: From Clinical to Basic Research,"Acupuncture has been widely used for treating diseases since the ancient days in China, but the mechanism by which acupuncture exerts such powerful roles is unclear. Epigenetics, including DNA methylation, histone modification, and post-transcriptional regulation of miRNAs, is the study of heritable changes in gene expression that do not include DNA sequence alterations. Epigenetics has become a new strategy for the basic and clinical research of acupuncture in the last decade. Some investigators have been trying to illustrate the mechanism of acupuncture from an epigenetics perspective, which has shed new lights on the mechanisms and applications of acupuncture. Moreover, the introduction of epigenetics into the regulatory mechanism in acupuncture treatment has provided more objective and scientific support for acupuncture theories and brought new opportunities for the improvement of acupuncture studies. In this paper, we reviewed the literatures that has demonstrated that acupuncture could directly or indirectly affect epigenetics, in order to highlight the progress of acupuncture studies correlated to epigenetic regulations.

Quantitative Analysis of the DNA Methylation Sensitivity of Transcription Factor Complexes,"Although DNA modifications play an important role in gene regulation, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. We developed EpiSELEX-seq to probe the sensitivity of transcription factor binding to DNA modification in vitro using massively parallel sequencing. Feature-based modeling quantifies the effect of cytosine methylation (5mC) on binding free energy in a position-specific manner. Application to the human bZIP proteins ATF4 and C/EBPÎ² and three different Pbx-Hox complexes shows that5mCpG can both increase and decrease affinity, depending on where the modification occurs within the protein-DNA interface. The TF paralogs tested vary in their methylation sensitivity, for which we provide a structural rationale. We show that5mCpG can also enhance in vitro p53 binding and provide evidence for increased in vivo p53 occupancy at methylated binding sites, correlating with primed enhancer histone marks.

Germ cell epigenome reprogramming is designed to allow cell totipotency and to prevent the transmission of epimutations via spermatozoa. At the end of these reprogramming events, the sperm epigenome has a very specific epigenetic pattern that is a footprint of past reprogramming events and has an influence on embryo development.Several data demonstrate that not all regions of the epigenome are erased during the reprogramming periods, suggesting the transmission of epigenetic information from fathers to offspring via spermatozoa. Moreover, it is becoming increasingly clear that the sperm epigenome is sensitive to environmental factors during the process of gamete differentiation, suggesting the plasticity of the sperm epigenetic signature according to the circumstances of the individual's life.In this chapter, we provided strong evidences about the association between variations of the sperm epigenome and the exposure to environmental factors. Moreover, we will present data about how epigenetic mechanisms are candidates for transferring paternal environmental information to offspring.",31301046,,10.1007/978-3-030-21664-1_4,11,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,121103,3.65,0.4854700565338135,0.5752508361204013,0.2508361204013378,0.45649942522463594
Lactylation: novel epigenetic regulatory and therapeutic opportunities,"Lactate, which is an end product of glycolysis, has traditionally been considered a metabolic waste. However, numerous studies have demonstrated that lactate serves metabolic and nonmetabolic functions in physiological processes and multiple diseases. Cancer and pulmonary arterial hypertension have been shown to undergo metabolic reprogramming, which is accompanied by increased lactate production. Metabolic reprogramming and epigenetic modifications have been extensively linked; furthermore, posttranslational modifications of histones caused by metabolites play a vital role in epigenetic alterations. In this paper, we reviewed recent research on lactate-induced histone modifications and provided a new vision about the metabolic effect of glycolysis. Based on our review, the cross talk between the metabolome and epigenome induced by glycolysis may indicate novel epigenetic regulatory and therapeutic opportunities. There is a magnificent progress in the interaction between metabolomics and epigenomics in recent decades, but many questions still remained to be investigated. Lactylation is found in different pathophysiological states and leads to diverse biological effects; however, only a few mechanisms of lactylation have been illustrated. Further research on lactylation would provide us with a better understanding of the cross talk between metabolomics and epigenomics.",36856188,,10.1152/ajpendo.00159.2022,4,American journal of physiology.

Epigenetics and obesity cardiomyopathy: From pathophysiology to prevention and management,"Uncorrected obesity has been associated with cardiac hypertrophy and contractile dysfunction. Several mechanisms for this cardiomyopathy have been identified, including oxidative stress, autophagy, adrenergic and renin-angiotensin aldosterone overflow. Another process that may regulate effects of obesity is epigenetics, which refers to the heritable alterations in gene expression or cellular phenotype that are not encoded on the DNA sequence. Advances in epigenome profiling have greatly improved the understanding of the epigenome in obesity, where environmental exposures during early life result in an increased health risk later on in life. Several mechanisms, including histone modification, DNA methylation and non-coding RNAs, have been reported in obesity and can cause transcriptional suppression or activation, depending on the location within the gene, contributing to obesity-induced complications. Through epigenetic modifications, the fetus may be prone to detrimental insults, leading to cardiac sequelae later in life. Important links between epigenetics and obesity include nutrition, exercise, adiposity, inflammation, insulin sensitivity and hepatic steatosis. Genome-wide studies have identified altered DNA methylation patterns in pancreatic islets, skeletal muscle and adipose tissues from obese subjects compared with non-obese controls. In addition, aging and intrauterine environment are associated with differential DNA methylation. Given the intense research on the molecular mechanisms of the etiology of obesity and its complications, this review will provide insights into the current understanding of epigenetics and pharmacological and non-pharmacological (such as exercise) interventions targeting epigenetics as they relate to treatment of obesity and its complications. Particular focus will be on DNA methylation, histone modification and non-coding RNAs.",27013344,,10.1016/j.pharmthera.2016.03.005,40,Pharmacology & therapeutics,7905840,13.4,0.4843190908432007,0.8461538461538461,0.8862876254180602,0.6370797488203017
Epigenomics in Hurthle Cell Neoplasms: Filling in the Gaps Towards Clinical Application,"It has been widely described that cancer genomes have frequent alterations to the epigenome, including epigenetic silencing of various tumor suppressor genes with functions in almost all cancer-relevant signalling pathways, such as apoptosis, cell proliferation, cell migration and DNA repair. Epigenetic alterations comprise DNA methylation, histone modification, and microRNAs dysregulated expression and they play a significant role in the differentiation and proliferation properties of TC. In this review, our group assessed the published evidence on the tumorigenic role of epigenomics in Hurthle cell neoplasms (HCN), highlighting the yet limited, heteregeneous and non-validated data preventing its current use in clinical practice, despite the well developed assessment techniques available. The identified evidence gaps call for a joint endeavour by the medical community towards a deeper and more systematic study of HCN, aiming at defining epigenetic markers in early diagnose, allowing for accurate stratification of maligancy and disease risk and for effective systemic treatment.",34108939,PMC8181423,10.3389/fendo.2021.674666,3,Frontiers in endocrinology,101555782,6.055,0.483648419380188,0.24749163879598662,0.5819397993311036,0.45607533925353083
Pan-cancer analysis of frequent DNA co-methylation patterns reveals consistent epigenetic landscape changes in multiple cancers,"Background:DNA methylation is the major form of epigenetic modifications through which the cell regulates the gene expression and silencing. There have been extensive studies on the roles of DNA methylation in cancers, and several cancer drugs were developed targeting this process. However, DNA co-methylation cluster has not been examined in depth, and co-methylation in multiple cancer types has never been studied previously.Results:In this study, we applied newly developed lmQCM algorithm to mine co-methylation clusters using methylome data from 11 cancer types in TCGA database, and found frequent co-methylated gene clusters exist in these cancer types. Among the four identified frequent clusters, two of them separate the tumor sample from normal sample in 10 out of 11 cancer types, which indicates that consistent epigenetic landscape changes exist in multiple cancer types.Conclusion:This discovery provides new insight on the epigenetic regulation in cancers and leads to potential new direction for epigenetic biomarker and cancer drug discovery. We also found that genes commonly believed to be silenced via hypermethylation in cancers may still display highly variable methylation levels among cancer cells, and should be considered while using them as epigenetic biomarkers.",28198667,PMC5310283,10.1186/s12864-016-3259-0,33,BMC genomics,100965258,4.547,0.4834807813167572,0.8093645484949833,0.4080267558528428,0.5335667296596196
Epigenetic modulation of dental pulp stem cells: implications for regenerative endodontics,"Dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) offer significant potential for use in regenerative endodontics, and therefore, identifying cellular regulators that control stem cell fate is critical to devising novel treatment strategies. Stem cell lineage commitment and differentiation are regulated by an intricate range of host and environmental factors of which epigenetic influence is considered vital. Epigenetic modification of DNA and DNA-associated histone proteins has been demonstrated to control cell phenotype and regulate the renewal and pluripotency of stem cell populations. The activities of the nuclear enzymes, histone deacetylases, are increasingly being recognized as potential targets for pharmacologically inducing stem cell differentiation and dedifferentiation. Depending on cell maturity and niche in vitro, low concentration histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) application can promote dedifferentiation of several post-natal and mouse embryonic stem cell populations and conversely increase differentiation and accelerate mineralization in DPSC populations, whilst animal studies have shown an HDACi-induced increase in stem cell marker expression during organ regeneration. Notably, both HDAC and DNA methyltransferase inhibitors have also been demonstrated to dramatically increase the reprogramming of somatic cells to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) for use in regenerative therapeutic procedures. As the regulation of cell fate will likely remain the subject of intense future research activity, this review aims to describe the current knowledge relating to stem cell epigenetic modification, focusing on the role of HDACi on alteration of DPSC phenotype, whilst presenting the potential for therapeutic application as part of regenerative endodontic regimens.",26011759,,10.1111/iej.12475,18,International endodontic journal,8004996,5.165,0.4831759035587311,0.6822742474916388,0.5150501672240803,0.5293704250783825
The epigenetic promise to improve prognosis of heart failure and heart transplantation,"Heart transplantation is still the only possible life-saving treatment for end-stage heart failure, the critical epilogue of several cardiac diseases. Epigenetic mechanisms are being intensively investigated because they could contribute to establishing innovative diagnostic and predictive biomarkers, as well as ground-breaking therapies both for heart failure and heart transplantation rejection. DNA methylation and histone modifications can modulate the innate and adaptive immune response by acting on the expression of immune-related genes that, in turn, are crucial determinants of transplantation outcome. Epigenetic drugs acting on methylation and histone-modification pathways may modulate Treg activity by acting as immunosuppressive agents. Moreover, the identification of non-invasive and reliable epigenetic biomarkers for the prediction of allograft rejection and for monitoring immunosuppressive therapies represents an attractive perspective in the management of transplanted patients. MiRNAs seem to fit particularly well to this purpose because they are differently expressed in patients at high and low risk of rejection and are detectable in biological fluids besides biopsies. Although increasing evidence supports the involvement of epigenetic tags in heart failure and transplantation, further short and long-term clinical studies are needed to translate the possible available findings into clinical setting.",28882368,,10.1016/j.trre.2017.08.004,10,"Transplantation reviews (Orlando, Fla.)",8804364,3.066,0.483053982257843,0.5484949832775919,0.15384615384615385,0.43030061677945497
Interactions between metabolism and chromatin in plant models,"Background:One of the fascinating aspects of epigenetic regulation is that it provides means to rapidly adapt to environmental change. This is particularly relevant in the plant kingdom, where most species are sessile and exposed to increasing habitat fluctuations due to global warming. Although the inheritance of epigenetically controlled traits acquired through environmental impact is a matter of debate, it is well documented that environmental cues lead to epigenetic changes, including chromatin modifications, that affect cell differentiation or are associated with plant acclimation and defense priming. Still, in most cases, the mechanisms involved are poorly understood. An emerging topic that promises to reveal new insights is the interaction between epigenetics and metabolism.Scope of review:This study reviews the links between metabolism and chromatin modification, in particular histone acetylation, histone methylation, and DNA methylation, in plants and compares them to examples from the mammalian field, where the relationship to human diseases has already generated a larger body of literature. This study particularly focuses on the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) in modulating metabolic pathways and gene activities that are involved in these chromatin modifications. As ROS and NO are hallmarks of stress responses, we predict that they are also pivotal in mediating chromatin dynamics during environmental responses.Major conclusions:Due to conservation of chromatin-modifying mechanisms, mammals and plants share a common dependence on metabolic intermediates that serve as cofactors for chromatin modifications. In addition, plant-specific non-CG methylation pathways are particularly sensitive to changes in folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism. Finally, reactive oxygen and nitrogen species may fine-tune epigenetic processes and include similar signaling mechanisms involved in environmental stress responses in plants as well as animals.",32199818,PMC7300381,10.1016/j.molmet.2020.01.015,22,Molecular metabolism,101605730,8.568,0.483053982257843,0.7357859531772575,0.7759197324414716,0.5921735264784516
Examination of Epigenetic and other Molecular Factors Associated with mda-9/Syntenin Dysregulation in Cancer Through Integrated Analyses of Public Genomic Datasets,"mda-9/Syntenin (melanoma differentiation-associated gene 9) is a PDZ domain containing, cancer invasion-related protein. In this study, we employed multiple integrated bioinformatic approaches to identify the probable epigenetic factors, molecular pathways, and functionalities associated with mda-9 dysregulation during cancer progression. Analyses of publicly available genomic data (e.g., expression, copy number, methylation) from TCGA, GEO, ENCODE, and Human Protein Atlas projects led to the following observations: (a) mda-9 expression correlates with both copy number and methylation level of an intronic CpG site (cg1719774) located downstream of the CpG island, (b) cg1719774 methylation is a likely prognostic marker in glioma, (c) among 22 cancer types, melanoma exhibits the highest mda-9 level, and lowest level of methylation at cg1719774, (d) cg1719774 hypomethylation is also associated with histone modifications (at the mda-9 locus) indicative of more active transcription, (e) using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), and the Virtual Gene Overexpression or Repression (VIGOR) analytical scheme, we were able to predict mda-9's association with extracellular matrix organization (e.g., MMPs, collagen, integrins), IGFBP2 and NF-ÎºB signaling pathways, phospholipid metabolism, cytokines (e.g., interleukins), CTLA-4, and components of complement cascade pathways. Indeed, previous publications have shown that many of the aforementioned genes and pathways are associated with mda-9's functionality.",26093898,PMC4985442,10.1016/bs.acr.2015.04.006,13,Advances in cancer research,370416,5.767,0.4830234944820404,0.6153846153846154,0.5585284280936454,0.5245967053848763
Analyzing DNA Methylation Patterns During Tumor Evolution,"Epigenetic modifications play a key role in cellular development and tumorigenesis. Recent large-scale genomic studies have shown that mutations in players of the epigenetic machinery and concomitant perturbation of epigenomic patterning are frequent events in tumors. Among epigenetic marks, DNA methylation is one of the best studied. Hyper- and hypo-methylation events of specific regulatory elements (such as promoters and enhancers) are sometimes thought to be correlated with expression of nearby genes. High-throughput bisulfite converted sequencing is currently the technology of choice for studying DNA methylation in base-pair resolution and on whole-genome scale. Such broad and high-resolution coverage investigations of the epigenome provide unprecedented opportunities to analyze DNA methylation patterns, which are correlated with tumorigenesis, tumor evolution, and tumor progression. However, few computational pipelines are available to the public to perform systematic DNA methylation analysis. Utilizing open source tools, we here describe a comprehensive computational methodology to thoroughly analyze DNA methylation patterns during tumor evolution based on bisulfite converted sequencing data, including intra-tumor methylation heterogeneity.",29344884,PMC6545902,10.1007/978-1-4939-7493-1_3,1,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,0.0,0.4824596047401428,0.13377926421404682,0.08361204013377926,0.3329540237136509
Nutrition and epigenetic programming,"Purpose of review:The aim of this study is to highlight the epigenomic programming properties of nutritional molecules and their metabolites in human tissues and cell types.Recent findings:Chromatin is the physical expression of the epigenome and has a memory function on the level of DNA methylation, histone modification and 3-dimensional (3D) organization. This epigenetic memory does not only affect transient gene expression but also represents long-lasting decisions on cellular fate. The memory is based on an epigenetic programming process, which is directed by extracellular and intracellular signals that are sensed by transcription factors and chromatin modifiers. Many dietary molecules and their intermediary metabolites serve as such signals, that is they contribute to epigenetic programming and memory. In this context, we will discuss about molecules of intermediary energy metabolism affecting chromatin modifier actions, nutrition-triggered epigenetic memory in pre- and postnatal phases of life; and epigenetic programming of immune cells by vitamin D. These mechanisms explain some of the susceptibility for complex diseases, such as the metabolic syndrome, cancer and immune disorders.Summary:The observation that nutritional molecules are able to modulate the epigenome initiated the new nutrigenomic subdiscipline nutritional epigenetics. The concept that epigenetic memory and programming is directed by our diet has numerous implications for the interpretation of disease risk including their prevention.",36728887,,10.1097/MCO.0000000000000900,4,Current opinion in clinical nutrition and metabolic care,9804399,3.62,0.482063353061676,0.3010033444816054,0.2040133779264214,0.390241356318611
Epigenetic signatures in gastric cancer: current knowledge and future perspectives,"Introduction:Gastric cancer (GC) is the fifth most common malignancy in the world and accounts for 7.7% of all cancer-related deaths. Early diagnosis of GC is critical in terms of prognosis, and aberrations at the molecular level, especially epigenetic alterations, manifest much earlier than histological findings. In recent years, there has been a great deal of research on the epigenomic profile of GC, and epigenetic alterations seem to play a more important role than genetic factors. With the introduction of epigenetic drugs into clinical use in the last decade, the importance of the epigenetic background of GC has increased considerably.Areas covered:In this review, we summarize the role of methylation changes, histone modifications, and non-coding RNAs in the pathogenesis of GC and how these signatures can be used as diagnostic and therapeutic targets in clinical management.Expert opinion:Epigenetic alterations take place before most genetic aberrations observed in GC and may have an initiating role in the pathogenesis of GC. They can be used as biomarkers in risk calculation, early diagnosis, and evaluation of prognosis of GC, as well as treatment targets.",36522183,,10.1080/14737159.2022.2159381,3,Expert review of molecular diagnostics,101120777,5.67,0.48169761896133423,0.2508361204013378,0.5384615384615384,0.44687810314937576
Genome-Wide Epigenetic Studies in Human Disease: A Primer on -Omic Technologies,"Epigenetic information encoded in covalent modifications of DNA and histone proteins regulates fundamental biological processes through the action of chromatin regulators, transcription factors, and noncoding RNA species. Epigenetic plasticity enables an organism to respond to developmental and environmental signals without genetic changes. However, aberrant epigenetic control plays a key role in pathogenesis of disease. Normal epigenetic states could be disrupted by detrimental mutations and expression alteration of chromatin regulators or by environmental factors. In this primer, we briefly review the epigenetic basis of human disease and discuss how recent discoveries in this field could be translated into clinical diagnosis, prevention, and treatment. We introduce platforms for mapping genome-wide chromatin accessibility, nucleosome occupancy, DNA-binding proteins, and DNA methylation, primarily focusing on the integration of DNA methylation and chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing technologies into disease association studies. We highlight practical considerations in applying high-throughput epigenetic assays and formulating analytical strategies. Finally, we summarize current challenges in sample acquisition, experimental procedures, data analysis, and interpretation and make recommendations on further refinement in these areas. Incorporating epigenomic testing into the clinical research arsenal will greatly facilitate our understanding of the epigenetic basis of disease and help identify novel therapeutic targets.",26721890,PMC4706679,10.1093/aje/kwv187,12,American journal of epidemiology,7910653,5.363,0.4812862277030945,0.5986622073578596,0.5284280936454849,0.5141897968225256
"Exercise, redox homeostasis and the epigenetic landscape","Physical exercise represents one of the strongest physiological stimuli capable to induce functional and structural modifications in all biological systems. Indeed, beside the traditional genetic mechanisms, physical exercise can modulate gene expression through epigenetic modifications, namely DNA methylation, post-translational histone modification and non-coding RNA transcripts. Initially considered as merely damaging molecules, it is now well recognized that both reactive oxygen (ROS) and nitrogen species (RNS) produced under voluntary exercise play an important role as regulatory mediators in signaling processes. While robust scientific evidences highlight the role of exercise-associated redox modifications in modulating gene expression through the genetic machinery, the understanding of their specific impact on epigenomic profile is still at an early stage. This review will provide an overview of the role of ROS and RNS in modulating the epigenetic landscape in the context of exercise-related adaptations.",32127290,PMC7284912,10.1016/j.redox.2020.101477,21,Redox biology,101605639,10.787,0.4806157648563385,0.7090301003344481,0.862876254180602,0.6027507298168131
"Epigenetic regulation of alternative promoters and enhancers in progenitor, immature, and mature gonadotrope cell lines","Gonadotrope cell identity genes emerge in a stepwise process during mouse pituitary development. Cga, encoding for the Î±-subunit of TSH, LH, and FSH, is initially detected at E11.5 followed by Gnrhr and steroidogenic factor Sf1 at E13.5, specifying cells engaged in a gonadotrope cell fate. Lhb and Fshb appear at E16.5 and 17.5, respectively, typifying differentiated gonadotrope cells. Using the Î±T1-1, Î±T3-1 and LÎ²T2 cell lines recapitulating these stages of gonadotrope differentiation, DNA methylation at Gnrhr and Sf1 was investigated. Regulatory regions were found hypermethylated in progenitor Î±T1-1 cells and hypomethylated in differentiated LÎ²T2 cells. Abundance of RNA polymerase II together with active histone modifications including H3K4me1, H3K4me3, and H3K27ac were strictly correlated with DNA hypomethylation. Analyses of epigenomic modifications and chromatin accessibility were further extended to Isl1, Lhx3, Gata2, and Pitx2, highlighting alternative usages of specific regulatory gene domains in progenitor Î±T1-1, immature Î±T3-1, and mature LÎ²T2 gonadotrope cells.",27402603,,10.1016/j.mce.2016.07.010,10,Molecular and cellular endocrinology,7500844,4.369,0.48037204146385193,0.5518394648829431,0.3712374581939799,0.4728386094936957
Epigenetic Mechanisms of Opioid Addiction,"Opioid use kills tens of thousands of Americans each year, devastates families and entire communities, and cripples the health care system. Exposure to opioids causes long-term changes to brain regions involved in reward processing and motivation, leading vulnerable individuals to engage in pathological drug seeking and drug taking that can remain a lifelong struggle. The persistence of these neuroadaptations is mediated in part by epigenetic remodeling of gene expression programs in discrete brain regions. Although the majority of work examining how epigenetic modifications contribute to addiction has focused on psychostimulants such as cocaine, research into opioid-induced changes to the epigenetic landscape is emerging. This review summarizes our knowledge of opioid-induced epigenetic modifications and their consequential changes to gene expression. Current evidence points toward opioids promoting higher levels of permissive histone acetylation and lower levels of repressive histone methylation as well as alterations to DNA methylation patterns and noncoding RNA expression throughout the brain's reward circuitry. Additionally, studies manipulating epigenetic enzymes in specific brain regions are beginning to build causal links between these epigenetic modifications and changes in addiction-related behavior. Moving forward, studies must leverage advanced chromatin analysis and next-generation sequencing approaches combined with bioinformatics pipelines to identify novel gene networks regulated by particular epigenetic modifications. Improved translational relevance also requires increased focus on volitional drug-intake models and standardization of opioid exposure paradigms. Such work will significantly advance our understanding of how opioids cause persistent changes to brain function and will provide a platform on which to develop interventions for treating opioid addiction.",31477236,PMC6898774,10.1016/j.biopsych.2019.06.027,88,Biological psychiatry,213264,12.81,0.4802044630050659,0.9464882943143813,0.8762541806020067,0.6526711727863171
Epigenetics of Immunoglobulin G Glycosylation,"Alternative glycosylation of immunoglobulin G (IgG) affects its effector functions during the immune response. IgG glycosylation is altered in many diseases, but also during a healthy life of an individual. Currently, there is limited knowledge of factors that alter IgG glycosylation in the healthy state and factors involved in specific IgG glycosylation patterns associated with pathophysiology. Genetic background plays an important role, but epigenetic mechanisms also contribute to the alteration of IgG glycosylation patterns in healthy life and in disease. It is known that the expression of many glycosyltransferases is regulated by DNA methylation and by microRNA (miRNA) molecules, but the involvement of other epigenetic mechanisms, such as histone modifications, in the regulation of glycosylation-related genes (glycogenes) is still poorly understood. Recent studies have identified several differentially methylated loci associated with IgG glycosylation, but the mechanisms involved in the formation of specific IgG glycosylation patterns remain poorly understood.",34687014,,10.1007/978-3-030-76912-3_9,4,Experientia supplementum (2012),101738007,0.0,0.48011302947998047,0.30434782608695654,0.08695652173913043,0.36632868725320566
Epigenomic Characterization of Lymphoid Neoplasms,"Lymphoid neoplasms represent a heterogeneous group of disease entities and subtypes with markedly different molecular and clinical features. Beyond genetic alterations, lymphoid tumors also show widespread epigenomic changes. These severely affect the levels and distribution of DNA methylation, histone modifications, chromatin accessibility, and three-dimensional genome interactions. DNA methylation stands out as a tracer of cell identity and memory, as B cell neoplasms show epigenetic imprints of their cellular origin and proliferative history, which can be quantified by an epigenetic mitotic clock. Chromatin-associated marks are informative to uncover altered regulatory regions and transcription factor networks contributing to the development of distinct lymphoid tumors. Tumor-intrinsic epigenetic and genetic aberrations cooperate and interact with microenvironmental cells to shape the transcriptome at different phases of lymphoma evolution, and intraclonal heterogeneity can now be characterized by single-cell profiling. Finally, epigenetics offers multiple clinical applications, including powerful diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers as well as therapeutic targets.",37832942,,10.1146/annurev-pathmechdis-051122-100856,1,Annual review of pathology,101275111,32.35,0.4800063967704773,0.13712374581939799,0.9732441471571907,0.5100774166576041
Exploring epigenomic mechanisms of neural tube defects using multi-omics methods and data,"Neural tube defects (NTDs) are a heterogeneous set of malformations attributed to disruption in normal neural tube closure during early embryogenesis. An in-depth understanding of NTD etiology and mechanisms remains elusive, however. Among the proposed mechanisms, epigenetic changes are thought to play an important role in the formation of NTDs. Epigenomics covers a wide spectrum of genomic DNA sequence modifications that can be investigated via high-throughput techniques. Recent advances in epigenomic technologies have enabled epigenetic studies of congenital malformations and facilitated the integration of big data into the understanding of NTDs. Herein, we review clinical epigenomic data that focuses on DNA methylation, histone modification, and miRNA alterations in human neural tissues, placental tissues, and leukocytes to explore potential mechanisms by which candidate genes affect human NTD pathogenesis. We discuss the links between epigenomics and gene regulatory mechanisms, and the effects of epigenetic alterations in human tissues on neural tube closure.",35666948,,10.1111/nyas.14802,0,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,7506858,6.499,0.4797626733779907,0.07023411371237458,0.6488294314381271,0.4316703130568948
An Overview of Epigenetics in Obesity: The Role of Lifestyle and Therapeutic Interventions,"Obesity has become a global epidemic that has a negative impact on population health and the economy of nations. Genetic predispositions have been demonstrated to have a substantial role in the unbalanced energy metabolism seen in obesity. However, these genetic variations cannot entirely explain the massive growth in obesity over the last few decades. Accumulating evidence suggests that modern lifestyle characteristics such as the intake of energy-dense foods, adopting sedentary behavior, or exposure to environmental factors such as industrial endocrine disruptors all contribute to the rising obesity epidemic. Recent advances in the study of DNA and its alterations have considerably increased our understanding of the function of epigenetics in regulating energy metabolism and expenditure in obesity and metabolic diseases. These epigenetic modifications influence how DNA is transcribed without altering its sequence. They are dynamic, reflecting the interplay between the body and its surroundings. Notably, these epigenetic changes are reversible, making them appealing targets for therapeutic and corrective interventions. In this review, I discuss how these epigenetic modifications contribute to the disordered energy metabolism in obesity and to what degree lifestyle and weight reduction strategies and pharmacological drugs can restore energy balance by restoring normal epigenetic profiles.",35163268,PMC8836029,10.3390/ijms23031341,34,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,6.208,0.4757270812988281,0.8193979933110368,0.6387959866220736,0.577075044765919
[Chromatin and Polycomb: Biology and bioinformatics],"All cells of a multicellular eukaryotic organism carry almost the same genome, still they obviously demonstrate phenotypes of very divergent kinds. The most probable explanation of the divergence is that different groups of genes are expressed in cells of different types. Expression is regulated at all steps between DNA and a protein, but transcription regulation is the most common regulatory mechanism. Transcription factors, which bind to specific areas of chromatin, can mediate the regulation. Their binding depends on the chromatin structure, which drastically differs among cell types. The key role in the structural organization is played by covalent histone modifications in chromatin. A combination of particular modifications in a chromatin region determines its structure and, consequently, its accessibility for enzymes. The best studied histone modifications are described in the review. Each modification has its specific mechanism that the cell uses to establish or to eliminate it. Activity of various Polycomb complexes is a key mechanism that represses chromatin and plays a central role, for example, in cell differentiation. The compositions and functionality of Polycomb complexes in various species are considered. Owing to modern experimental techniques, ample data are currently available for histone modifications and other epigenomic features of chromatin in various tissues and organisms, allowing bioinformatic investigation of the epigenome. Many computational and visualization methods have been developed for such studies, and the main of them are covered in the review.",28251962,,10.7868/S0026898416060124,0,Molekuliarnaia biologiia,105454,0.0,0.4748290479183197,0.07357859531772576,0.0903010033444816,0.31767334848343326
Epigenetic Alterations in Colorectal Cancer: Emerging Biomarkers,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. One of the fundamental processes driving the initiation and progression of CRC is the accumulation of a variety of genetic and epigenetic changes in colonic epithelial cells. Over the past decade, major advances have been made in our understanding of cancer epigenetics, particularly regarding aberrant DNA methylation, microRNA (miRNA) and noncoding RNA deregulation, and alterations in histone modification states. Assessment of the colon cancer ""epigenome"" has revealed that virtually all CRCs have aberrantly methylated genes and altered miRNA expression. The average CRC methylome has hundreds to thousands of abnormally methylated genes and dozens of altered miRNAs. As with gene mutations in the cancer genome, a subset of these epigenetic alterations, called driver events, are presumed to have a functional role in CRC. In addition, the advances in our understanding of epigenetic alterations in CRC have led to these alterations being developed as clinical biomarkers for diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic applications. Progress in this field suggests that these epigenetic alterations will be commonly used in the near future to direct the prevention and treatment of CRC.",26216839,PMC4589488,10.1053/j.gastro.2015.07.011,358,Gastroenterology,374630,33.883,0.47460073232650757,1.0,0.979933110367893,0.6807470614694832
Inflammation-Related Epigenetic Modification: The Bridge Between Immune and Metabolism in Type 2 Diabetes,"T2DM, as a typical metabolic inflammatory disease, is under the joint regulation of environmental factors and genetics, combining with a variety of epigenetic changes. Apart from epigenetic changes of islet Î² cells and glycometabolic tissues or organs, the inflammation-related epigenetics is also the core pathomechanism leading to Î²-cell dysfunction and insulin resistance. In this review, we focus on the epigenetic modification of immune cells' proliferation, recruitment, differentiation and function, providing an overview of the key genes which regulated by DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNA in the respect of T2DM. Meanwhile, we further summarize the present situation of T2DM epigenetic research and elucidate its prospect in T2DM clinical diagnosis and treatment.",35603204,PMC9120428,10.3389/fimmu.2022.883410,11,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,8.786,0.47344422340393066,0.5785953177257525,0.7993311036789298,0.5596518183232948
The Design and Optimization of DNA Methylation Pyrosequencing Assays Targeting Region-Specific Repeat Elements,"Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation, can contribute to gene regulation and chromosomal stability. There are several methods and techniques available for methylation analysis, ranging from global methylation to gene-specific targeted regions. Bisulfite conversion enables numerous methodologies to be used for downstream applications, including pyrosequencing which measures DNA methylation at an individual CpG site level. This allows specific regions of interest to be targeted for DNA methylation analysis. Designing and optimizing pyrosequencing assays correctly is vital for the interpretation of results.Dysregulation of DNA methylation has been implicated in human diseases, with regions such as repeat elements commonly altered. Human population studies investigating these tend to use consensus sequences to target repeat elements. However, these elements have high mutational rates, particularly Alu sequences, which could lead to assay bias and masking of changes at a regional level. Therefore, it may be more beneficial to target specific repeat elements depending upon their chromosomal location, rather than analyzing overall methylation levels.",26246355,,10.1007/7651_2015_285,2,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,0.0,0.4731094539165497,0.19063545150501673,0.09364548494983277,0.34072185964089974
Epigenetic changes and their relationship to somaclonal variation: a need to monitor the micropropagation of plantation crops,"Chromatin modulation plays important roles in gene expression regulation and genome activities. In plants, epigenetic changes, including variations in histone modification and DNA methylation, are linked to alterations in gene expression. Despite the significance and potential of in vitro cell and tissue culture systems in fundamental research and marketable applications, these systems threaten the genetic and epigenetic networks of intact plant organs and tissues. Cell and tissue culture applications can lead to DNA variations, methylation alterations, transposon activation, and finally, somaclonal variations. In this review, we discuss the status of the current understanding of epigenomic changes that occur under in vitro conditions in plantation crops, including coconut, oil palm, rubber, cotton, coffee and tea. It is hoped that comprehensive knowledge of the molecular basis of these epigenomic variations will help researchers develop strategies to enhance the totipotent and embryogenic capabilities of tissue culture systems for plantation crops.",32349860,,10.1071/FP19077,9,Functional plant biology : FPB,101154361,2.812,0.4723031222820282,0.4983277591973244,0.14715719063545152,0.41247886333577205
Editing the Epigenome to Tackle Brain Disorders,"Genetic studies of epigenetic modifiers such as DNA methyltransferases and histone acetyltransferases have revealed a critical role for epigenetic regulation during brain development and function. Alteration of epigenetic modifications have been documented in a variety of brain disorders, including neurodevelopmental, psychiatric, and neurodegenerative diseases. Development of epigenome editing tools enables a functional dissection of the link between altered epigenetic changes and disease outcomes. Here, we review the development of epigenome editing tools, summarize proof of concept applications focusing on brain disease-associated genes, and discuss the promising application and challenges of epigenome editing to tackle brain disorders.",31706628,,10.1016/j.tins.2019.10.003,21,Trends in neurosciences,7808616,16.978,0.47017401456832886,0.7123745819397993,0.9163879598662207,0.6078569171022012
Identification of Epigenetic Biomarkers of Lung Adenocarcinoma through Multi-Omics Data Analysis,"Epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation or histone modifications are essential for the regulation of gene expression and development of tissues. Alteration of epigenetic modifications can be used as an epigenetic biomarker for diagnosis and as promising targets for epigenetic therapy. A recent study explored cancer-cell specific epigenetic biomarkers by examining different types of epigenetic modifications simultaneously. However, it was based on microarrays and reported biomarkers that were also present in normal cells at a low frequency. Here, we first analyzed multi-omics data (including ChIP-Seq data of six types of histone modifications: H3K27ac, H3K4me1, H3K9me3, H3K36me3, H3K27me3, and H3K4me3) obtained from 26 lung adenocarcinoma cell lines and a normal cell line. We identified six genes with both H3K27ac and H3K4me3 histone modifications in their promoter regions, which were not present in the normal cell line, but present in â¥85% (22 out of 26) and â¤96% (25 out of 26) of the lung adenocarcinoma cell lines. Of these genes, NUP210 (encoding a main component of the nuclear pore complex) was the only gene in which the two modifications were not detected in another normal cell line. RNA-Seq analysis revealed that NUP210 was aberrantly overexpressed among the 26 lung adenocarcinoma cell lines, although the frequency of NUP210 overexpression was lower (19.3%) in 57 lung adenocarcinoma tissue samples studied and stored in another database. This study provides a basis to discover epigenetic biomarkers highly specific to a certain cancer, based on multi-omics data at the cell population level.",27042856,PMC4820141,10.1371/journal.pone.0152918,9,PloS one,101285081,3.752,0.4699307680130005,0.5016722408026756,0.2709030100334448,0.4364735109750244
Endocrine-disrupting chemicals and epigenetic reprogramming in developmental origin of uterine fibroids,"Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are a class of exogenous substances that mimic the effects of hormones in the body, inducing hormonal dysregulation and contributing to various disorders. Epigenome regulation has emerged as an important mechanism for maintaining organ function in health and disease. Dissecting epigenomic and resultant gene expression changes provides unprecedented insight into the chromatin state, which underlines disease development and shapes risk and phenotypic plasticity in response to the environment and internal cues. The cutting-edge, high throughput technologies provide new routes to understanding the etiology of disease and new footholds on the promising path to better treatment and disease prevention. We have recently revealed that myometrial stem cells (MMSCs), the cell origin of UFs, are the target of developmental EDC exposure. The EDC-induced epigenetic changes in MMSCs identified by multi-omics approaches include DNA methylation and histone modification modulated by DNA methyltransferases and MLL1, which characterized the molecular mechanism underlying EDC-related risk in hormone-dependent UFs. Future studies are needed to determine the link between real-life exposures to EDCs and their impact on the development of human diseases and transgenerational epigenetic inheritance, which can help explore strategies that may prevent adverse outcomes linked to EDC exposure.",38189295,PMC10775733,10.1177/00368504231215601,0,Science progress,411361,1.512,0.46965712308883667,0.07692307692307693,0.11036789297658862,0.3192524678332351
Making headway towards understanding how epigenetic mechanisms contribute to early-life effects,"It has become clear that in addition to the DNA sequence there is another layer of information, termed epigenetic modifications, that can influence phenotypes and traits. In particular, environmental epigenomics, which addresses the effect of the environment on the epigenome and human health, is becoming an area of great interest for many researchers working in different scientific fields. In this review, we will consider the current evidence that early-life environmental signals can have long-term effects on the epigenome. We will further evaluate how recent technological advances may enable us to unravel the molecular mechanisms underlying these phenomena, which will be crucial for understanding heritability in health and disease.

The role of epigenetics in the reproductive toxicity of environmental endocrine disruptors,"Environmental endocrine disruptors (EEDs) seriously endanger human health by interfering with the normal function of reproductive systems. In males, EEDs can affect sperm formation and semen quality as well spermatogenesis, ultimately reducing fertility. In females, EEDs can affect uterine development and the expression levels of reproduction-related genes, ultimately reducing female fertility and the normal development of the fetus. There are a large number of putative mechanisms by which EEDs can induce reproductive toxicity, and many studies have shown the involvement of epigenetics. In this review, we summarize the role of DNA methylation, noncoding RNAs, genomic imprinting, chromatin remodeling and histone modification in the reproductive toxicity of EEDs.",33217042,,10.1002/em.22414,6,Environmental and molecular mutagenesis,8800109,3.579,0.46912506222724915,0.3979933110367893,0.20066889632107024,0.40120747880792135

DNA Methylation Analysis,"DNA methylation is a process by which methyl groups are added to cytosine or adenine. DNA methylation can change the activity of the DNA molecule without changing the sequence. Methylation of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) is widespread in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes, and it is a very important epigenetic modification event, which can regulate gene activity and influence a number of key processes such as genomic imprinting, cell differentiation, transcriptional regulation, and chromatin remodeling. Profiling DNA methylation across the genome is critical to understanding the influence of methylation in normal biology and diseases including cancer. Recent discoveries of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) oxidation derivatives including 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), 5-formylcytsine (5fC), and 5-carboxycytosine (5caC) in mammalian genome further expand our understanding of the methylation regulation. Genome-wide analyses such as microarrays and next-generation sequencing technologies have been used to assess large fractions of the methylome. A number of different quantitative approaches have also been established to map the DNA epigenomes with single-base resolution, as represented by the bisulfite-based methods, such as classical bisulfite sequencing, pyrosequencing etc. These methods have been used to generate base-resolution maps of 5mC and its oxidation derivatives in genomic samples. The focus of this chapter is to provide the methodologies that have been developed to detect the cytosine derivatives in the genomic DNA.",30547463,,10.1007/978-1-4939-8916-4_12,21,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,0.0,0.46860820055007935,0.7157190635451505,0.09698996655518395,0.44370672635011454
"Epigenetic programming, early life nutrition and the risk of metabolic disease","Time separates the past from the present, during this period memory are formed - written in code and decoded to be read while other memories are erased - but when it comes to the epigenome some memories are harder to forget than others. Recent studies show chemical information is written in the context of the epigenome and codified on histone and non-histone proteins to regulate nuclear processes such as gene transcription. The genome is also subject to modification in the form of 5-methylcytosine, which has been implicated in metabolic memory. In this review, we examine some of the chemical modifications that signal early life events and explore epigenetic changes that underlie the diabetic vasculature. The fine balance between past and present is discussed, as it pertains to gestational diabetes and obesity in context to the Barker hypothesis. We also examine emerging experimental evidence suggesting the hypothalamus as a central regulator of obesity risk and explore current genomic medicine. As for how cells recall specific chemical information, we examine the experimental evidence implicating chemical cues on the epigenome, providing examples of diet during pregnancy and the increased risk of disease in offspring.",28950165,,10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2017.09.003,43,Atherosclerosis,242543,6.847,0.4685474932193756,0.8595317725752508,0.6789297658862876,0.5888208036239331
Metabolic recoding of epigenetics in cancer,"Dysregulation of metabolism allows tumor cells to generate needed building blocks as well as to modulate epigenetic marks to support cancer initiation and progression. Cancer-induced metabolic changes alter the epigenetic landscape, especially modifications on histones and DNA, thereby promoting malignant transformation, adaptation to inadequate nutrition, and metastasis. Recent advances in cancer metabolism shed light on how aberrations in metabolites and metabolic enzymes modify epigenetic programs. The metabolism-induced recoding of epigenetics in cancer depends strongly on nutrient availability for tumor cells. In this review, we focus on metabolic remodeling of epigenetics in cancer and examine potential mechanisms by which cancer cells integrate nutritional inputs into epigenetic modification.",29784032,PMC5993135,10.1186/s40880-018-0302-3,49,"Cancer communications (London, England)",101723675,15.283,0.46809151768684387,0.882943143812709,0.9096989966555183,0.6393833387057517
Epigenetics for anthropologists: An introduction to methods,"The study of epigenetics, or chemical modifications to the genome that may alter gene expression, is a growing area of interest for social scientists. Anthropologists and human biologists are interested in epigenetics specifically, as it provides a potential link between the environment and the genome, as well as a new layer of complexity for the study of human biological variation. In pace with the rapid increase in interest in epigenetic research, the range of methods has greatly expanded over the past decade. The primary objective of this article is to provide an overview of the current methods for assaying DNA methylation, the most commonly studied epigenetic modification. We will address considerations for all steps required to plan and conduct an analysis of DNA methylation, from appropriate sample collection, to the most commonly used methods for laboratory analyses of locus-specific and genome-wide approaches, and recommendations for statistical analyses. Key challenges in the study of DNA methylation are also discussed, including tissue specificity, the stability of measures, timing of sample collection, statistical considerations, batch effects, and challenges related to analysis and interpretation of data.

Zinc and Its Transporters in Epigenetics,"Epigenetic events like DNA methylation and histone modification can alter heritable phenotypes. Zinc is required for the activity of various epigenetic enzymes, such as DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), histone acetyltransferases (HATs), histone deacetylases (HDACs), and histone demethylases, which possess several zinc binding sites. Thus, the dysregulation of zinc homeostasis can lead to epigenetic alterations. Zinc homeostasis is regulated by Zinc Transporters (ZnTs), Zrt- and Irt-like proteins (ZIPs), and the zinc storage protein metallothionein (MT). Recent advances revealed that ZIPs modulate epigenetics. ZIP10 deficiency was found to result in reduced HATs, confirming its involvement in histone acetylation for rigid skin barrier formation. ZIP13 deficiency, which is associated with Spondylocheirodysplastic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (SCD-EDS), increases DNMT activity, leading to dysgenesis of dermis via improper gene expressions. However, the precise molecular mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Future molecular studies investigating the involvement of zinc and its transporters in epigenetics are warranted.",32274919,PMC7191051,10.14348/molcells.2020.0026,19,Molecules and cells,9610936,4.25,0.46666330099105835,0.6889632107023411,0.3277591973244147,0.4833424621999862
Retrospective and perspective of plant epigenetics in China,"Epigenetics refers to the study of heritable changes in gene function that do not involve changes in the DNA sequence. Such effects on cellular and physiological phenotypic traits may result from external or environmental factors or be part of normal developmental program. In eukaryotes, DNA wraps on a histone octamer (two copies of H2A, H2B, H3 and H4) to form nucleosome, the fundamental unit of chromatin. The structure of chromatin is subjected to a dynamic regulation through multiple epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation, histone posttranslational modifications (PTMs), chromatin remodeling and noncoding RNAs. As conserved regulatory mechanisms in gene expression, epigenetic mechanisms participate in almost all the important biological processes ranging from basal development to environmental response. Importantly, all of the major epigenetic mechanisms in mammalians also occur in plants. Plant studies have provided numerous important contributions to the epigenetic research. For example, gene imprinting, a mechanism of parental allele-specific gene expression, was firstly observed in maize; evidence of paramutation, an epigenetic phenomenon that one allele acts in a single locus to induce a heritable change in the other allele, was firstly reported in maize and tomato. Moreover, some unique epigenetic mechanisms have been evolved in plants. For example, the 24-nt siRNA-involved RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway is plant-specific because of the involvements of two plant-specific DNA-dependent RNA polymerases, Pol IV and Pol V. A thorough study of epigenetic mechanisms is of great significance to improve crop agronomic traits and environmental adaptability. In this review, we make a brief summary of important progress achieved in plant epigenetics field in China over the past several decades and give a brief outlook on future research prospects. We focus our review on DNA methylation and histone PTMs, the two most important aspects of epigenetic mechanisms.",30455036,,10.1016/j.jgg.2018.09.004,24,Journal of genetics and genomics = Yi chuan xue bao,101304616,5.723,0.4665417969226837,0.7658862876254181,0.5484949832775919,0.5428013323342122
Epigenomic mechanism regulating the quality and ripeness of apple fruit with differing harvest maturity,"Harvest maturity significantly affects the quality of apple fruit in post-harvest storage process. Although the regulatory mechanisms underlying fruit ripening have been studied, the associated epigenetic modifications remain unclear. Thus, we compared the DNA methylation changes and the transcriptional responses of mature fruit (MF) and immature fruit (NF). There were significant correlations between DNA methylation and gene expression. Moreover, the sugar contents (sucrose, glucose, and fructose) were higher in MF than in NF, whereas the opposite pattern was detected for the starch content. The expression-level differences were due to DNA methylations and ultimately resulted in diverse fruit textures and ripeness. Furthermore, the higher ethylene, auxin, and abscisic acid levels in MF than in NF, which influenced the fruit texture and ripening, were associated with multiple differentially expressed genes in hormone synthesis, signaling, and response pathways (ACS, ACO, ZEP, NCED, and ABA2) that were regulated by DNA methylations. Multiple transcription factor genes involved in regulating fruit ripening and quality via changes in DNA methylation were identified, including MIKCC-type MADS-box genes and fruit ripening-related genes (NAP, SPL, WRKY, and NAC genes). These findings reflect the diversity in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression and may be relevant for elucidating the epigenetic regulatory mechanism underlying the ripening and quality of apple fruit with differing harvest maturity.",38644530,,10.1111/ppl.14278,1,Physiologia plantarum,1256322,5.081,0.46556970477104187,0.14381270903010032,0.5050167224080268,0.4091077091502505
Insights from multidimensional analyses of the pan-cancer DNA methylome heterogeneity and the uncanonical CpG-gene associations,"Although the DNA methylome profiles have been available in large cancer cohorts such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), integrative analysis of the DNA methylome architectures in a pan-cancer manner remains limited. In the present study, we aimed to systematically dissect the insightful features related to the inter-tumoral DNA methylome heterogeneity in a pan-cancer context of 21 cancers in TCGA. First, pan-cancer clustering of the DNA methylomes revealed convergence of cancers and, meanwhile, new classifications of cancer subtypes, which are often associated to prognostic differences. Next, within each type of cancer, we showed that the transcription factor (TF) genes tend to bear more dynamic promoter DNA methylation profiles than the other genes, which serves as a potential source of the transcriptome heterogeneity in cancers. Finally, we found unanticipated significant numbers of the non-canonical promoter CpG sites that are positively correlated with the gene expression. Distribution patterns of these CpG sites in the CpG islands, ChIP-seq, DNaseI-seq, PMD regions and histone modification landscapes suggested against a pervasive mechanism of transcriptional activation due to mCpG-dependent binding of TFs, which is not in complete agreement with previous hypothesis. In summary, our deep mining of the highly heterogeneous DNA methylome data in a pan-cancer context generated novel insights into the architecture of cancer epigenetics and provided a series of resources for further investigations in the related fields of cancer genomics and epigenetics.",30121964,,10.1002/ijc.31810,7,International journal of cancer,42124,7.316,0.46526598930358887,0.42474916387959866,0.7424749163879598,0.512604409635665
