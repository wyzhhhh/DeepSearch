27249758,Biomarkers for Immunotherapy: Current Developments and Challenges.,10.1200/EDBK_160766,"Immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer therapy and has been named the cancer        advance of the year for 2016. Checkpoint inhibitors have demonstrated        unprecedented rates of durable responses in some of the most difficult-to-treat        cancers; however, many treated patients do not respond, and the potential for        serious side effects exists. There is a growing need to identify biomarkers that        will improve the selection of patients who will best respond to therapy, further        elucidate drug mechanisms of action, and help tailor therapy regimens. Biomarkers        are being explored at the soluble, cellular, and genomic levels, and examples in        immunotherapy include serum proteins, tumor-specific receptor expression        patterns, factors in the tumor microenvironment, circulating immune and tumor        cells, and host genomic factors. The search for reliable biomarkers is limited by        our incomplete understanding of how immunotherapies modify the already complex        immune response to cancer, as well as the contribution of immuno-editing to a        dynamic and inducible tumor microenvironment and immune milieu. Furthermore,        there has been little extension of any candidate assay into large, prospective        studies, and the lack of standardization in measurement and interpretation        restricts their validity. Both tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and PD-L1        expression within the tumor microenvironment have been recognized as having both        prognostic and predictive value for patients treated with immunotherapy.        Alternately, a larger panel of gene signatures, chemokines, and other factors        that correlate with response has been proposed. In this article, we will explore        the status of current biomarker candidates.",,American Society of Clinical Oncology educational book. American Society of,101233985

However, the benefits of        immunotherapy are limited to specific patient subsets, posing challenges for        broader application. To improve its effectiveness, identifying biomarkers that        can predict patient response is crucial. Machine learning (ML) play a pivotal        role in harnessing multi-omic cancer datasets and unlocking new insights into        immunotherapy. This review provides an overview of cutting-edge ML models applied        in omics data for immunotherapy analysis, including immunotherapy response        prediction and immunotherapy-relevant tumor microenvironment identification. We        elucidate how ML leverages diverse data types to identify significant biomarkers,        enhance our understanding of immunotherapy mechanisms, and optimize        decision-making process. Additionally, we discuss current limitations and        challenges of ML in this rapidly evolving field. Finally, we outline future        directions aimed at overcoming these barriers and improving the efficiency of ML        in immunotherapy research.",PMC10940614,NPJ digital medicine,101731738

However, HCC lacks sensitive and specific biomarkers to predict        prognosis, monitor for minimal residual disease after locoregional therapy, and        predict treatment response. In this review, we aim to summarize the best        supporting evidence for refining existing, and development of novel biomarkers        for staging, prognosis, determination of minimal residual disease and monitoring        treatment response in HCC, focusing on those with evidence in clinical trials.        METHODS: PubMed and Embase databases were searched using the keywords;        hepatocellular carcinoma, biomarker, minimal residual disease, surveillance,        prognosis, staging, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), liquid biopsy, treatment response,        adjuvant, immunotherapy. Relevant clinical studies were included. KEY CONTENT AND        FINDINGS: AFP remains the major workhorse as the most widely used biomarker in        HCC, however, its lack of wide applicability due to the high proportion of        patients with HCC who are AFP negative, limits its value throughout all stages of        HCC management. Significant work has been done to combine AFP with other clinical        and serologic factors to increase its accuracy and utility as a biomarkers.        However, it is likely that other more novel biomarkers such as those obtained        through liquid biopsy will provide the prognostic power necessary for        applications such as detecting recurrence and predicting treatment response.        Liquid biopsy provides not only a wealth of potential biomarkers including        circulating tumor cells and cell-free RNA/DNA, but also the ability to examine        the mutational characteristics of the tumor with next generation sequencing.        While early evidence supports the potential impact of many new biomarkers,        validation in large clinical trials is lacking. CONCLUSIONS: This review        highlights the paucity of sensitive and specific, widely applicable biomarkers,        throughout all phases of management of HCC and summarizes evidence on biomarkers        currently in use, as well as those in development and validation. Inclusion of        biomarker analysis through clinical trials in HCC is critical to development of        optimal therapeutic regimens, and improve patient outcomes.",PMC10839735,Hepatobiliary surgery and nutrition,101600750
38067312,"Homologous Recombination Repair Gene Alterations Are Associated with Tumor        Mutational Burden and Survival of Immunotherapy.",10.3390/cancers15235608,"BACKGROUND: Comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) has become generally accepted        practice in cancer care since CGP has become reimbursed by national healthcare        insurance in Japan in 2019. However, its usefulness for cancer patients is        insufficient for several reasons. METHODS: In an observational clinical study of        FoundationOne(Â®) CDx, potential biomarkers were explored and the cause of testing        failure was investigated. A total of 220 cancer patients were enrolled in the        study during the period from 2018 to 2019 at Kyushu University Hospital. RESULTS:        The primary tumor sites of the 220 cases were breast (115), colon (29), stomach        (19), and pancreas (20). The present dataset suggested that homologous        recombination repair (HRR) gene alterations were positively associated with tumor        mutational burden-high (TMB-high) (p = 0.0099). A public dataset confirmed that        patients with HRR gene alterations had a higher TMB and showed significantly        longer survival of immunotherapy. In the present study, 18 cases failed        sequencing. A lower percentage of tumor cell nuclei was the most common reason        for testing failures (p = 0.037). Cases that received neoadjuvant chemotherapy        before sampling tended to fail testing. CONCLUSIONS: HRR gene alterations can be        a potential biomarker predicting TMB-high and a good response to immunotherapy.        For successful sequencing, samples with lower percentages of tumor cell nuclei        and previous neoadjuvant chemotherapy should be avoided.",PMC10705153,Cancers,101526829

The outcome of patients with LGG differs greatly.        Recently, more and more studies have suggested that infiltrating inflammation        cells and inflammation-related genes (IRGs) play an essential role in        tumorigenesis, prognosis, and treatment responses. Nevertheless, the role of IRGs        in LGG remains unclear. In The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort, we conducted a        thorough examination of the predictive significance of IRGs and identified 245        IRGs that correlated with the clinical prognosis of individuals diagnosed with        LGG. Based on unsupervised cluster analysis, we identified two        inflammation-associated molecular clusters, which presented different tumor        immune microenvironments, tumorigenesis scores, and tumor stemness indices.        Furthermore, a prognostic risk model including ten prognostic IRGs (ADRB2, CD274,        CXCL12, IL12B, NFE2L2, PRF1, SFTPC, TBX21, TNFRSF11B, and TTR) was constructed.        The survival analysis indicated that the IRGs risk model independently predicted        the prognosis of patients with LGG, which was validated in an independent LGG        cohort. Moreover, the risk model significantly correlated with the infiltrative        level of immune cells, tumor mutation burden, expression of HLA and immune        checkpoint genes, tumorigenesis scores, and tumor stemness indices in LGG.        Additionally, we found that our risk model could predict the chemotherapy        response of some drugs in patients with LGG.

37880184,"PD-1-expressing macrophages and CD8 T cells are independent predictors of        clinical benefit from PD-1 inhibition in advanced mesothelioma.",10.1136/jitc-2023-007585,"BACKGROUND: Few tissue biomarkers exist to date that could enrich patient with        cancer populations to benefit from immune checkpoint blockade by programmed cell        death protein 1/ligand-1 (PD-/L-1) inhibitors. PD-L1 expression has value in this        context in some tumor types but is an imperfect predictor of clinical benefit. In        malignant pleural mesothelioma, PD-L1 expression is not predictive of the benefit        from PD-1 blockade. We aimed to identify novel markers in malignant pleural        mesothelioma to select patients better. METHODS: We performed a multiplex-immune        histochemistry analysis of tumor samples from the phase III PROMISE-meso study,        which randomized 144 pretreated patients to receive either pembrolizumab or        standard second-line chemotherapy. Our panel focused on CD8+Tâcell,        CD68+macrophages, and the expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 on these and cancer cells.        We analyzed single and double positive cells within cancer tissues (infiltrating        immune cells) and in the stroma. In addition, we performed cell neighborhood        analysis. The cell counts were compared with clinical outcomes, including        responses, progression-free and overall survivals. RESULTS: We confirmed the        absence of predictive value for PD-L1 in this cohort of patients. Furthermore,        total CD8 T cells, CD68+macrophages, or inflammatory subtypes (desert, excluded,        inflamed) did not predict outcomes. In contrast, PD-1-expressing CD8+T cells        (exhausted T cells) and PD-1-expressing CD68+macrophages were both independent        predictors of progression-free survival benefit from pembrolizumab. Patients with        tumors simultaneously harboring PD1+T cells and PD-1+macrophages benefited the        most from immune therapy. CONCLUSION: We analyzed a large cohort of patients        within a phase III study and found that not only PD-1+CD8âT cells but also        PD-1+CD68+ macrophages are predictive. This data provides evidence for the first        time for the existence of PD-1+macrophages in mesothelioma and their clinical        relevance for immune checkpoint blockade.",PMC10603330,Journal for immunotherapy of cancer,101620585

Nevertheless, tissue biopsy remains the gold standard for molecular        evaluation of solid tumors whereas liquid biopsy is a complementary tool in many        different clinical settings, such as treatment selection, monitoring treatment        response, cancer clonal evolution, prognostic evaluation, as well as the        detection of early disease and minimal residual disease (MRD).

We demonstrate a sensing methodology that        allows to evaluate the protein mass adsorbed to the gold's surface from the Rabi        gap, which is a direct consequence of the strong light-matter interaction between        surface plasmon polariton and dye exciton of labeled protein.

It remains        imperative to identify reliable and convenient biomarkers to predict both the        efficacy and toxicity of immunotherapy, and tumor-associated autoantibodies        (TAAbs) are recognized as one of the promising candidates for this. PATIENTS AND        METHODS: This study enrolled 97 advanced NSCLC patients with ICI-based        immunotherapy treatment, who were divided into a training cohort (nÂ =Â 48) and a        validation cohort (nÂ =Â 49), and measured for the serum level of 35 TAAbs.        According to the statistical association between the serum positivity and        clinical outcome of each TAAb in the training cohort, a TAAb panel was developed        to predict the progression-free survival (PFS), and further examined in the        validation cohort andÂ in different subgroups. Similarly, another TAAb panel was        derived to predict the occurrence of immune-related adverse events (irAEs).        RESULTS: In the training cohort, a 7-TAAb panel composed of p53, CAGE, MAGEA4,        GAGE7, UTP14A, IMP2, and PSMC1 TAAbs was derived to predict PFS (median PFS        [mPFS] 9.9 vs. 4.3Â months, pÂ =Â 0.043).

However, the pathophysiological function of        CXXC5 has not been clearly established. Herein, we found that CXXC5 interacts        with the CRL4B and NuRD complexes. Screening of transcriptional targets        downstream of the CXXC5-CRL4B-NuRD complex by next-generation sequencing        (chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing) revealed that the complex regulates        the transcriptional repression process of a cohort of genes, including TSC1        (tuberous sclerosis complex subunit 1), which play important roles in cell growth        and mammalian target of rapamycin signaling pathway regulation, and whose        abnormal regulation results in the activation of programmed cell death-ligand        protein 1 (PD-L1). Intriguingly, CXXC5 expression increased after stimulation        with vitamin B2 but decreased after vitamin D treatment. We also found that the        CXXC5-CRL4B-NuRD complex promotes the proliferation of tumor cells inÂ vitro and        accelerates the growth of breast cancer inÂ vivo. The expression of CXXC5, CUL4B,        and MTA1 increased during the occurrence and development of breast cancer, and        correspondingly, TSC1 expression decreased. Meanwhile, a high expression of CXXC5        was positively correlated with the histological grade of high malignancy and poor        survival of patients. In conclusion, our study revealed that CXXC5-mediated TSC1        suppression activates the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway, reduces        autophagic cell death, induces PD-L1-mediated immune suppression, and results in        tumor development, shedding light on the mechanism of the pathophysiological        function of CXXC5.",PMC9860500,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R

In this study,        we try to find out the key factors in the heterogeneous tumor-associated        monocyte/macrophage (TAMM) that could regulate immune responses and predict the        validity of ICB on HNSCC. Experimental Design: To explore the correlation of the        TAMM heterogeneity with the immune properties and prognosis of HNSCC, we        established the differentiation trajectory of TAMM by analyzing the single-cell        RNA-seq data of HNSCC, by which the HNSCC patients were divided into different        sub-populations. Then, we exploited the topology of the network to screen out the        genes critical for immune hot phenotype of HNSCC, as well as their roles in TAMM        differentiation, tumor immune cycle, and progression. Finally, these key genes        were used to construct a neural net model via deep-learning framework to predict        the validity of treatment with anti-PD-1/PDL-1 Results: According to the        differentiation trajectory, the genes involved in TAMM differentiation were        categorized into early and later groups. Then, the early group genes divided the        HNSCC patients into sub-populations with more detailed immune properties. Through        network topology, CXCL9, 10, 11, and CLL5 related to TAMM differentiation in the        TME were identified as the key genes initiating and maintaining the immune hot        phenotype in HNSCC by remarkably strengthening immune responses and infiltration.        Genome wide, CASP8 mutations were found to be key to triggering immune responses        in the immune hot phenotype. On the other hand, in the immune cold phenotype, the        evident changes in CNV resulted in immune evasion by disrupting immune balance.        Finally, based on the framework of CXCL9-11, CLL5, CD8(+), CD4(+) T cells, and        Macrophage M1, the neural network model could predict the validity of PD-1/PDL-1        therapy with 75% of AUC in the test cohort.

METHODS: The mRNA expression profiles of MIBC samples from seven discovery        datasets (GSE13507, GSE31684, GSE32548, GSE32894, GSE48075, GSE48276, and        GSE69795) were analyzed to identify TME subtypes. The identified TME subtypes        were then validated by an independent dataset (TCGA-MIBC). The subtype-related        biomarkers were discovered using computational analyses and then utilized to        establish a random forest predictive model. The associations of TME subtypes with        immunotherapy therapeutic responses were investigated in a group of patients who        had been treated with immunotherapy. A prognostic index model was constructed        using the subtype-related biomarkers. Two nomograms were built by the        subtype-related biomarkers or the clinical parameters. RESULTS: Two TME subtypes,        including ECM-enriched class (EC) and immune-enriched class (IC), were found. EC        was associated with greater extracellular matrix (ECM) pathways, and IC was        correlated with immune pathways, respectively. Overall survival was significantly        greater for tumors classified as IC, whereas the EC subtype had a worse        prognosis. A total of nine genes (AKAP12, APOL3, CXCL13, CXCL9, GBP4, LRIG1,        PEG3, PODN, and PTPRD) were selected by computational analyses to construct the        random forest model. The area under the curve (AUC) values for this model were        0.827 and 0.767 in the testing and external validation datasets, respectively.        Therapeutic response rates were greater in IC patients than in EC patients (28        percent vs. 18 percent). Patients with a high prognostic index had a poorer        prognosis than those with a low prognostic index. The nomogram constructed from        nine genes and stage achieved a C-index of 0.71. CONCLUSION: The present        investigation defined two distinct TME subtypes and developed models to assess        immunotherapeutic treatment outcomes.",PMC9170513,Journal of immunology research,101627166

METHODS: Three hundred and thirty-five TNBC samples from four datasets        were retrieved and analyzed. In order to determine the CAF subtype by combining        gene expression profiles, an unsupervised clustering analysis was adopted. The        prognosis, enriched pathways, immune cells, immune scores, and tumor purity were        compared between CAF subtypes. The genes with the highest importance were        selected by bioinformatics analysis. The machine learning model was built to        predict the TNBC CAF subtype by these selected genes. RESULTS: TNBC samples were        classified into two CAF subtypes (CAF+ and CAF-). The CAF- subtype of TNBC was        linked to the longer overall survival and more immune cells than the CAF+        subtype. CAF- and CAF+ were enriched in immune-related pathways and extracellular        matrix pathways, respectively.

However, the        relationships among RIMKLB expression, survival outcomes, and tumor-infiltrating        immune cells (TIICs) in colorectal cancer (CRC) are still unknown. Therefore, we        analyzed RIMKLB expression levels in CRC and normal tissues and investigated the        correlations between RIMKLB and TIICs as well as the impact of RIMKLB expression        on clinical prognosis in CRC using multiple databases, including the Tumor Immune        Estimation Resource (TIMER), Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis        (GEPIA), PrognoScan, and UALCAN databases. Enrichment analysis was conducted with        the cluster Profiler package in R software to explore the RIMKLB-related        biological processes involved in CRC. The RIMKLB expression was significantly        decreased in CRC compared to normal tissues, and correlated with histology,        stage, lymphatic metastasis, and tumor status (p < 0.05). Patients with CRC with        high expression of RIMKLB showed poorer overall survival (OS) (HR = 2.5,p =        0.00,042), and inferior disease-free survival (DFS) (HR = 1.9,p = 0.19) than        those with low expression of RIMKLB. TIMER analysis indicated that RIMKLB        transcription was closely related with several TIICs, including CD4(+) and CD8(+)        T cells, B cells, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), monocytes, neutrophils,        natural killer cells, dendritic cells, and subsets of T cells. Moreover, the        expression of RIMKLB showed significant positive correlations with infiltrating        levels of PD1 (r = 0.223, p = 1.31e-06; r = 0.249, p = 1.25e-03), PDL1 (r =        0.223, p = 6.03e-07; r = 0.41, p = 5.45e-08), and CTLA4 (r = 0.325, p = 9.68e-13;        r = 0.41, p = 5.45e-08) in colon and rectum cancer, respectively. Enrichment        analysis showed that the RIMKLB expression was positively related to        extracellular matrix and immune inflammation-related pathways. In conclusion,        RIMKLB expression is associated with survival outcomes and TIICs levels in        patients with CRC, and therefore, might be a potential novel prognostic biomarker        that reflects the immune infiltration status.",PMC9015428,Frontiers in genetics,101560621

Immunotherapy, especially anti-PD-1, is becoming a        pillar of ccRCC treatment. However, precise biomarkers and robust models are        needed to select the proper patients for immunotherapy. METHODS: A total of 831        ccRCC transcriptomic profiles were obtained from 6 datasets. Unsupervised        clustering was performed to identify the immune subtypes among ccRCC samples        based on immune cell enrichment scores. Weighted correlation network analysis        (WGCNA) was used to identify hub genes distinguishing subtypes and related to        prognosis. A machine learning model was established by a random forest (RF)        algorithm and used on an open and free online website to predict the immune        subtype. RESULTS: In the identified immune subtypes, subtype2 was enriched in        immune cell enrichment scores and immunotherapy biomarkers. WGCNA analysis        identified four hub genes related to immune subtypes, CTLA4, FOXP3, IFNG, and        CD19. The RF model was constructed by mRNA expression of these four hub genes,        and the value of area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was        0.78. Subtype2 patients in the independent validation cohort had a better drug        response and prognosis for immunotherapy treatment.

To date, PD-L1 expression on tumor and immune        cells, tumor mutation burden (TMB), and microsatellite instability (MSI) are the        only validated predictive factors used for the qualification of cancer patients        for immunotherapy. However, they are not the ideal predictive factors. No        response to immunotherapy could be observed in patients with high PD-L1        expression, TMB, or MSI. On the other hand, the effectiveness of this treatment        method also may occur in patients without PD-L1 expression or with low TMB and        with microsatellite stability. When considering the best predictive factor, we        should remember that the effectiveness of immunotherapy relies on an overly        complex process depending on many factors. To specifically stimulate lymphocytes,        not only should their activity in the tumor microenvironment be unlocked, but        above all, they should recognize tumor antigens. The proper functioning of the        anticancer immune system requires the proper interaction of many elements of the        specific and non-specific responses. For these reasons, a multi-parameter        analysis of the immune system at its different activity levels is considered a        very future-oriented predictive marker. Such complex immunological analysis is        performed using modern molecular biology techniques.

Over        the course of an immune response, cells may be chronically stimulated, with some        proportion becoming exhausted; an enormous number of molecules are involved in        this process. There remain a number of questions about the process, namely: (1)        what degree of heterogeneity and plasticity do T-cells exhibit during        stimulation? (2) how many unique cell states define chronic stimulation? and (3)        what markers discriminate activated from exhausted cells? We addressed these        questions by performing single-cell multiomic analysis to simultaneously measure        expression of 38 proteins and 399 genes in human T cells expanded in vitro. This        approach allowed us to study -with unprecedented depth-how T cells change over        the course of chronic stimulation. Comprehensive immunophenotypic and        transcriptomic analysis at day 0 enabled a refined characterization of T-cell        maturational states and the identification of a donor-specific subset of        terminally differentiated T-cells that would have been otherwise overlooked using        canonical cell classification schema. As expected, activation downregulated        naÃ¯ve-cell markers and upregulated effector molecules, proliferation regulators,        co-inhibitory and co-stimulatory receptors. Our deep kinetic analysis further        revealed clusters of proteins and genes identifying unique states of activation,        defined by markers temporarily expressed upon 3âdays of stimulation (PD-1, CD69,        LTA), markers constitutively expressed throughout chronic activation (CD25, GITR,        LGALS1), and markers uniquely up-regulated upon 14âdays of stimulation (CD39,        ENTPD1, TNFDF10); expression of these markers could be associated with the        emergence of short-lived cell types. Notably, different ratios of cells        expressing activation or exhaustion markers were measured at each time point.        These data reveal the high heterogeneity and plasticity of chronically stimulated        T cells.

Pembrolizumab and atezolizumab were        registered in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of metastatic        NSCLC, while durvalumab found its application in consolidation therapy after        successful chemoradiotherapy in patients with locally advanced NSCLC.        Exceptionally attractive, due to their relatively low toxicity and high        effectiveness, are treatment approaches in which a combination of two different        immunotherapy methods is applied.

The increased percentage of transduced        PMN-MDSCs on the 10th day was associated with diminished immunosuppressive        activity of tumor-derived myeloid cells and an elevated ratio of cytotoxic T        lymphocytes to M-MDSCs.

Invasive        tumors are associated with poor prognosis, even with surgical treatment and        chemotherapy. Some studies have found that an increase in the number of mast        cells in TCC is related to the tumor grade and its aggressiveness. This study        investigated the relationship between mast cell density (MCD) and features of TCC        (tumor stage, grade, prognosis, and recurrence). METHODS: Fifty-one cases with        TCC were selected, and MCD was determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and        Giemsa staining. Mortality rate and tumor recurrence were recorded. RESULTS: The        MCD mean was higher in high-grade tumors than in low-grade tumors (in IHC method:        9.127 vs 5.296; in Giemsa method: 5.512 vs 2.608). Also, the MCD mean in dead        patients was higher than in survived patients (in IHC method: 11.390 vs 6.211; in        Giemsa method: 7.460 vs 3.35).

CONCLUSION: Using mast cell tryptase and Giemsa, MCD may        be associated with a positive correlation with tumor grade in TCC.

Here we have studied        various ways to model ex vivo T cell function in order to compare the impact of        the clinically utilised anti-PD-1 antibody, pembrolizumab (Keytruda) on the        activation of human T cells: focussing on the release of pro-inflammatory IFNÎ³        and anti-inflammatory IL-10 to assess functionality. Firstly, we investigated the        actions of pembrolizumab in an acute model of T-cell activation with either        immature or mature allogeneic dendritic cells (DCs); pembrolizumab enhanced IFNÎ³        and IL-10 release from purified CD4+ T-cells in the majority of donors with a        bias towards pro-inflammatory cytokine release. Next, we modelled the impact of        pembrolizumab in settings of more chronic T-cell activation. In a 7-day        antigen-specific response to EBV peptides, the presence of pembrolizumab resulted        in a relatively modest increase in both IFNÎ³ and IL-10 release. Where        pembrolizumab was assessed against long-term stimulated CD4+ cells that had        up-regulated the exhaustion markers TIM-3 and PD-1, there was a highly effective        enhancement of the otherwise exhausted response to allogeneic DCs with respect to        IFNÎ³ production. By contrast, the restoration of IL-10 production was        considerably more limited. Finally, to assess a direct clinical relevance we        investigated the consequence of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade in the disease setting of        dissociated cells from lung and colon carcinomas responding to allogeneic DCs:        here, pembrolizumab once more enhanced IFNÎ³ production from the majority of        tumour preparations whereas, again, the increase in IL-10 release was modest at        best. In conclusion, we have shown that the contribution of PD-1-revealed by        using a canonical blocking antibody to interrupt its interaction with PD-L1-to        the production of an exemplar pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine, respectively,        depends in magnitude and ratio on the particular stimulation setting and        activation status of the target T cell. We have identified a number of in vitro        assays with response profiles that mimic features of dissociated cell populations        from primary tumours thereby indicating these represent disease-relevant        functional assays for the screening of immune checkpoint inhibitors in current        and future development. Such in vitro assays may also support patient        stratification of those likely to respond to immuno-oncology therapies in the        wider population.",PMC7889918,Scientific reports,101563288

However, the objective response        rates (ORR) are relatively low due to the lack of precise biomarkers to select        patients. Herein, the molecular subtype, tumor mutation burden (TMB), and CD8+ T        cells were calculated by the gene expression and mutation profiles of MIBC        patients. MIBC immunotypes were constructed using clustering analysis based on        tumor mutation burden, CD8+ T cells, and molecular subtypes. Mutated genes,        enriched functional KEGG pathways and GO terms, and co-expressed network-specific        hub genes have been identified. We demonstrated that ORR of immunotype A patients        identified by molecular subtype, CD8+ T cells, and TMB is about 36% predictable.        PIK3CA, RB1, FGFR3, KMT2C, MACF1, RYR2, and EP300 are differentially mutated        among three immunotypes. Pathways such as ECM-receptor interaction, PI3K-Akt        signaling pathway, and TGF-beta signaling pathway are top-ranked in enrichment        analysis. Low expression of ACTA2 was associated with the MIBC survival benefit.        The current study constructs a model that could identify suitable MIBC patients        for immunotherapy, and it is an important step forward to the personalized        treatment of bladder cancers.",PMC7778803,Hereditas,0374654

The effectiveness of both groups of antibodies has been proven in many        clinical trials, which translates into positive immunotherapeutic registrations        for cancer patients. Regarding the predictive factor, PD-L1 expression on cancer        cells is the only biomarker validated in prospective clinical trials used for        qualification to immunotherapy in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)        patients. However, it is not an ideal one. Unfortunately, no clinical benefits        could be noted in patients with high PD-L1 expression on tumor cells against the        effectiveness of immunotherapy that may be observed in patients without PD-L1        expression. Furthermore, the mechanism of antitumor immune response is extremely        complex, multistage, and depends on many factors. Cancer cells could be        recognized by the immune system, provided tumor-specific antigen presentation,        and these arise as a result of somatic mutations in tumor cells. Based on novel        immunotherapy registration, high tumor mutation burden (TMB) has become an        important predictive factor. The intensity of lymphocyte infiltration in tumor        tissue may be another predictive factor. The effectiveness of anti-PD-L1        immunotherapy is observed in patients with high expression of genes associated        with the effector function of T lymphocytes (i.e., their ability to produce        IFN-gamma). This does not end the list of potential factors that become useful in        qualification of cancer patients for immunotherapy.

However, the TMB alone is not sufficient to accurately predict        immunotherapy benefit. Additional biomarkers are needed for better stratification        of immunotherapy-sensitive patients. In the present study, mutation data and        survival information of patients with melanoma were collected from several        immunotherapy studies, and tumor heterogeneity was estimated using mutant-allele        tumor heterogeneity (MATH). The benefit score was defined as the ratio between        the TMB and tumor heterogeneity, and optimal critical values were selected to        group patients and evaluate their response to ICI treatment. The benefit score        significantly improved the performance of stratifying the overall survival of        patients compared with the TMB alone as a predictor in two independent cohorts (p        = 0.0068 vs. p = 0.1 and p = 0.045 vs. p = 0.13), in which patients were treated        with Ipilimumab and Nivolumab, respectively. In another cohort of patients with        melanoma receiving mixed ICI treatment, the benefit score was also positively        associated with higher overall survival (p = 0.022) and outperformed the TMB        alone, with a significance of p = 0.089. The benefit score showed a positive        correlation with clonal TMB, a reported immunotherapy marker, and exceeded it in        immunotherapy response prediction. Besides, a high benefit score was found to be        associated with higher proportions of natural killer cells, lower proportions of        M2 macrophages and elevated CD8 T cells, all of which favor ICI therapy. In        summary, tumor heterogeneity combined with the TMB showed superior efficacy in        predicting the response to ICI therapy.

To address this        issue, we examined the expression of CD8, PD-L1 and the EMT markers E-cadherin        and vimentin in a cohort of 74 papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) patients and        investigated the association of these with clinicopathologic characteristics and        disease-free survival (DFS). The relationship between PD-L1 and EMT was further        examined in three thyroid cancer cell lines via Western blot and live cell        imaging. In order to expand our in vitro findings, the normalised gene expression        profiles of 516 thyroid cancer patients were retrieved and analysed from The        Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). PD-L1 positivity was significantly higher in PTC        patients exhibiting a mesenchymal phenotype (P = 0.012). Kaplan-Meier analysis        revealed that PD-L1 (P = 0.045), CD8 (P = 0.038) and EMT status (P = 0.038) were        all significant predictors for DFS. Sub-analysis confirmed that the poorest DFS        was evident in PD-L1 positive patients with EMT features and negative CD8        expression (P < 0.0001). IFN-Î³ treatment induced upregulation of PD-L1 and        significantly promoted an EMT phenotype in two thyroid cancer cell lines.

Numerous        complete blood count parameters (CBC) have been described as easily accessible        biomarkers that might predict response to immunotherapy. However, to date, no        comprehensive study has been performed on the longitudinal changes of these        parameters during cancer progression. METHODS: The clinicopathological variables        and CBC parameters of 986 advanced stage lung cancer patients were        retrospectively analyzed. Blood tests were performed as part of the routine        checkup and the results were recorded at the time of the diagnosis of the primary        tumor, the diagnosis of brain or bone metastases, and also during the last        available follow-up. RESULTS: In the experimental subcohort, 352 and 466 patients        were diagnosed with brain and bone metastases, respectively. The control group        consisted of 168 patients without clinically detectable or other distant organ        metastases. In our longitudinal analyses, we found significantly decreasing        absolute lymphocyte count (ALC: Pâ<â0.001), and significantly increasing absolute        neutrophil count (ANC: Pâ<â0.001) levels in all patient subgroups, irrespective        of histopathological type and metastatic site. Interestingly, patients with brain        metastases had significantly descending-ascending platelet count (PLT) trendlines        (Pâ<â0.001), while the bone metastatic subgroup exhibited significantly        ascending-descending trendlines (P = 0.043). CONCLUSIONS: Significantly        decreasing ALC, significantly increasing ANC and fluctuating PLT levels may be        found in brain and bone metastatic lung cancer patients during disease        progression. Our findings might contribute to improve personalized healthcare in        this devastating malignancy.

Mutations in the BAP1 gene commonly result in a number of aggressive        cancers; predominantly uveal melanoma, malignant mesothelioma, renal cell        carcinoma, and cutaneous melanoma. Importantly, germline mutations in the BAP1        gene have been established as a novel tumor predisposition syndrome, conferring        an increased risk of hereditary, early-onset cancers. Current treatment options        for cancers with BAP1 alterations are limited to standard therapies. However,        several therapeutic avenues have been proposed to specifically target BAP1        alterations in cancer. Molecularly targeted approaches include histone        deacetylase inhibitors and EZH2 inhibitors to target the role of BAP1 in        chromatin modification and transcriptional regulation, respectively. PARP        inhibitors and platinum chemotherapy agents have the potential to target        BAP1-altered tumors, due to the role of BAP1 in DNA damage repair.

Therefore, we investigated the        influence of immune checkpoint inhibitors on LAA-specific immune responses by CTL        against leukemic myeloid blasts and colony-forming cells including leukemic        progenitor cells (CFC/LPC). In functional immunoassays like CFU/CFI        (colony-forming units/immunoassays) and ELISpot analysis, we detected specific        LAA-directed immune responses against CFC/LPC that are postulated to be the        source population of relapse of the disease. The addition of nivolumab        (anti-PD-1) significantly increases LAA-directed immune responses against        CFC/LPC, no effect is seen when ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4) is added. The        combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab does not improve the effect compared to        nivolumab alone. The anti-PD1-directed immune response correlates to PD-L1        expression on progenitor cells. Our data suggest that immunotherapeutic        approaches have the potential to target malignant CFC/LPC and anti-PD-1        antibodies could be an immunotherapeutic approach in AML.

Clinicopathological features provide        insufficient information to guide optimal individual treatment and cannot predict        prognosis completely. Recently, an increasing amount of studies indicate that the        tumor microenvironment plays a pivotal role in tumor malignancy and treatment        responses. However, studies focusing on the tumor microenvironment (TME) of LrGG        are still limited. In this study, taking advantage of the currently popular        computational methods for estimating the infiltration of tumor-associated normal        cells in tumor samples and using weighted gene co-expression network analysis, we        screened the co-expressed gene modules associated with the TME and further        identified the prognostic hub genes in these modules. Furthermore, eight        prognostic hub genes (ARHGDIB, CLIC1, OAS3, PDIA4, PARP9, STAT1, TAP2, and        TAGLN2) were selected to construct a prognostic risk score model using the least        absolute shrinkage and selection operator method. Univariate and multivariate Cox        regression analysis demonstrated that the risk score was an independent        prognostic factor for LrGG. Moreover, time-dependent ROC curves indicated that        our model had favorable efficiency in predicting both short- and long-term        prognosis in LrGG patients, and the stratified survival analysis demonstrated        that our model had prognostic value for different subgroups of LrGG patients.        Additionally, our model had potential value for predicting the sensitivity of        LrGG patients to radio- and chemotherapy.

Multiple studies have demonstrated a        link between cancer development/progression and circadian disruption; however,        the complex role of tumor-autonomous molecular clocks remains poorly understood.        With that in mind, we investigated the pathophysiological relevance of clock        genes expression in metastatic melanoma. METHODS: We analyzed gene expression,        somatic mutation, and clinical data from 340 metastatic melanomas from The Cancer        Genome Atlas, as well as gene expression data from 234 normal skin samples from        genotype-tissue expression. Findings were confirmed in independent datasets.        RESULTS: In melanomas, the expression of most clock genes was remarkably reduced        and displayed a disrupted pattern of co-expression compared to the normal skins,        indicating a dysfunctional circadian clock. Importantly, we demonstrate that the        expression of the clock gene aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like        protein 1 (BMAL1) positively correlates with patient overall survival and with        the expression of T-cell activity and exhaustion markers in the tumor bulk.        Accordingly, high BMAL1 expression in pretreatment samples was significantly        associated with clinical benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors.

Molecular diversity has been shown to occur        within specific histological subtypes of epithelial ovarian cancer, between        different tumors of an individual patient, as well as within individual tumors.        Recent advances in the molecular characterization of epithelial ovarian cancer        tumors have provided the basis for a simplified classification scheme in which        these cancers are classified as either type I or type II tumors, and these two        categories have implications regarding disease pathogenesis and prognosis.        Molecular analyses, primarily based on next-generation sequencing, otherwise        known as high-throughput sequencing, are allowing for further refinement of        ovarian cancer classification, facilitating the elucidation of the site(s) of        precursor lesions of high-grade serous ovarian cancer, and providing insight into        the processes of clonal selection and evolution that may be associated with        development of chemoresistance. Potential therapeutic targets have been        identified from recent molecular profiling studies of these tumors, and the        effectiveness and safety of a number of specific targeted therapies have been        evaluated or are currently being studied for the treatment of women with this        disease.",PMC5187913,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791

As chemotherapy and targeted therapies such as trastuzumab and        ramucirumab result in modest improvements in survival but not long-term cure for        such patients, development of alternative treatment approaches is warranted.        Novel immunotherapy drugs such as checkpoint inhibitors have been paradigm        changing in melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer and urothelial cancers. In this        review, we assess the early evidence for efficacy of immunotherapy in patients        with gastroesophageal cancer in addition to considering biomarkers associated        with response to these treatments. Early results of Anti- Programmed Cell Death        Protein-1 (anti-PD-1), anti-PD-L1 and anti-Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte assosciated        protein-4 (anti-CTLA4) trials are examined, and we conclude with a discussion on        the future direction for immunotherapy for gastroesophageal cancer patients.",PMC5086586,Journal of clinical medicine,101606588
27602763,"Expressions of CD8+TILs, PD-L1 and Foxp3+TILs in stage I NSCLC guiding adjuvant        chemotherapy decisions.",10.18632/oncotarget.11793,"PURPOSE: Currently, adjuvant chemotherapy is recommended for patients with high        risk stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, identifying high risk        patients remains a challenge. This study aims to identify the patient cohorts        more likely to benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy based on the tumor micro-immune        environment. RESULTS: CD8+TILs significantly associated with disease-free        survival (DFS) and overall survial (OS) (p=0.002; 0.040). Patients with high risk        factors may also predict shorter DFS (P=0.056). When compared together, patients        with high-CD8+TILs showed better DFS than patients with low-CD8+TILs, no matter        their risk factors status. There's no correlation between PD-L1 expressions and        survival. PD-L1 was highly expressed in men, squamous and well differentiated        carcinoma. In addition, Foxp3+TILs alone didn't show any prognostic effects, but        low-Foxp3/high-CD8+TILs were associated with prolonged DFS (p=0.031). METHODS: A        total of 126 patients with surgically resected stage I NSCLC were included to        perform immunohistochemistry of CD8+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs),        programmed death ligand-1(PD-L1) and forkhead box P3 (Foxp3)+TILs. CONCLUSION:        CD8+TILs are effective prognostic predictors. Patients with surgically resected        stage I NSCLC showing low CD8+TILs could be considered for adjuvant chemotherapy,        even if they have no high risk features.",PMC5325445,Oncotarget,101532965
