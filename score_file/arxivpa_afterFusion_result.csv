ARAMIS: From systematic errors of NGS long reads to accurate assemblies,"NGS long-reads sequencing technologies (or third generation) such as Pacific BioSciences (PacBio) have revolutionized the sequencing field over the last decade improving multiple genomic applications like de novo genome assemblies. However, their error rate, mostly involving insertions and deletions (indels), is currently an important concern that requires special attention to be solved. Multiple algorithms are available to fix these sequencing errors using short reads (such as Illumina), although they require long processing times and some errors may persist. Here, we present Accurate long-Reads Assembly correction Method for Indel errorS (ARAMIS), the first NGS long-reads indels correction pipeline that combines several correction software in just one step using accurate short reads. As a proof OF concept, six organisms were selected based on their different GC content, size and genome complexity, and their PacBio-assembled genomes were corrected thoroughly by this pipeline. We found that the presence of systematic sequencing errors in long-reads PacBio sequences affecting homopolymeric regions, and that the type of indel error introduced during PacBio sequencing are related to the GC content of the organism. The lack of knowledge of this fact leads to the existence of numerous published studies where such errors have been found and should be resolved since they may contain incorrect biological information. ARAMIS yields better results with less computational resources needed than other correction tools and gives the possibility of detecting the nature of the found indel errors found and its distribution along the genome. The source code of ARAMIS is available at https://github.com/genomics-ngsCBMSO/ARAMIS.git.",34013348,PMC8574707,10.1093/bib/bbab170,6
"Comparison of Illumina and Oxford Nanopore Technology for genome analysis of Francisella tularensis, Bacillus anthracis, and Brucella suis","Background:Bacterial epidemiology needs to understand the spread and dissemination of strains in a One Health context. This is important for highly pathogenic bacteria such as Bacillus anthracis, Brucella species, and Francisella tularensis. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) has paved the way for genetic marker detection and high-resolution genotyping. While such tasks are established for Illumina short-read sequencing, Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) long-read sequencing has yet to be evaluated for such highly pathogenic bacteria with little genomic variations between strains. In this study, three independent sequencing runs were performed using Illumina, ONT flow cell version 9.4.1, and 10.4 for six strains of each of Ba. anthracis, Br. suis and F. tularensis. Data from ONT sequencing alone, Illumina sequencing alone and two hybrid assembly approaches were compared.Results:As previously shown, ONT produces ultra-long reads, while Illumina produces short reads with higher sequencing accuracy. Flow cell version 10.4 improved sequencing accuracy over version 9.4.1. The correct (sub-)species were inferred from all tested technologies, individually. Moreover, the sets of genetic markers for virulence, were almost identical for the respective species. The long reads of ONT allowed to assemble not only chromosomes of all species to near closure, but also virulence plasmids of Ba. anthracis. Assemblies based on nanopore data alone, Illumina data alone, and both hybrid assemblies correctly detected canonical (sub-)clades for Ba. anthracis and F. tularensis as well as multilocus sequence types for Br. suis. For F. tularensis, high-resolution genotyping using core-genome MLST (cgMLST) and core-genome Single-Nucleotide-Polymorphism (cgSNP) typing produced highly comparable results between data from Illumina and both ONT flow cell versions. For Ba. anthracis, only data from flow cell version 10.4 produced similar results to Illumina for both high-resolution typing methods. However, for Br. suis, high-resolution genotyping yielded larger differences comparing Illumina data to data from both ONT flow cell versions.Conclusions:In summary, combining data from ONT and Illumina for high-resolution genotyping might be feasible for F. tularensis and Ba. anthracis, but not yet for Br. suis. The ongoing improvement of nanopore technology and subsequent data analysis may facilitate high-resolution genotyping for all bacteria with highly stable genomes in future.",37173617,PMC10182678,10.1186/s12864-023-09343-z,4
"Challenges facing repeat expansion identification, characterisation, and the pathway to discovery","Tandem repeat DNA sequences constitute a significant proportion of the human genome. While previously considered to be functionally inert, these sequences are now broadly accepted as important contributors to genetic diversity. However, the polymorphic nature of these sequences can lead to expansion beyond a gene-specific threshold, causing disease. More than 50 pathogenic repeat expansions have been identified to date, many of which have been discovered in the last decade as a result of advances in sequencing technologies and associated bioinformatic tools. Commonly utilised diagnostic platforms including Sanger sequencing, capillary array electrophoresis, and Southern blot are generally low throughput and are often unable to accurately determine repeat size, composition, and epigenetic signature, which are important when characterising repeat expansions. The rapid advances in bioinformatic tools designed specifically to interrogate short-read sequencing and the development of long-read single molecule sequencing is enabling a new generation of high throughput testing for repeat expansion disorders. In this review, we discuss some of the challenges surrounding the identification and characterisation of disease-causing repeat expansions and the technological advances that are poised to translate the promise of genomic medicine to individuals and families affected by these disorders.",37888797,PMC10754332,10.1042/ETLS20230019,1
A recurrence-based approach for validating structural variation using long-read sequencing technology,"Although numerous algorithms have been developed to identify structural variations (SVs) in genomic sequences, there is a dearth of approaches that can be used to evaluate their results. This is significant as the accurate identification of structural variation is still an outstanding but important problem in genomics. The emergence of new sequencing technologies that generate longer sequence reads can, in theory, provide direct evidence for all types of SVs regardless of the length of the region through which it spans. However, current efforts to use these data in this manner require the use of large computational resources to assemble these sequences as well as visual inspection of each region. Here we present VaPoR, a highly efficient algorithm that autonomously validates large SV sets using long-read sequencing data. We assessed the performance of VaPoR on SVs in both simulated and real genomes and report a high-fidelity rate for overall accuracy across different levels of sequence depths. We show that VaPoR can interrogate a much larger range of SVs while still matching existing methods in terms of false positive validations and providing additional features considering breakpoint precision and predicted genotype. We further show that VaPoR can run quickly and efficiency without requiring a large processing or assembly pipeline. VaPoR provides a long read-based validation approach for genomic SVs that requires relatively low read depth and computing resources and thus will provide utility with targeted or low-pass sequencing coverage for accurate SV assessment. The VaPoR Software is available at: https://github.com/mills-lab/vapor.",28873962,PMC5737365,10.1093/gigascience/gix061,16
A survey on computational strategies for genome-resolved gut metagenomics,"Recovering high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (HQ-MAGs) is critical for exploring microbial compositions and microbe-phenotype associations. However, multiple sequencing platforms and computational tools for this purpose may confuse researchers and thus call for extensive evaluation. Here, we systematically evaluated a total of 40 combinations of popular computational tools and sequencing platforms (i.e. strategies), involving eight assemblers, eight metagenomic binners and four sequencing technologies, including short-, long-read and metaHiC sequencing. We identified the best tools for the individual tasks (e.g. the assembly and binning) and combinations (e.g. generating more HQ-MAGs) depending on the availability of the sequencing data. We found that the combination of the hybrid assemblies and metaHiC-based binning performed best, followed by the hybrid and long-read assemblies. More importantly, both long-read and metaHiC sequencings link more mobile elements and antibiotic resistance genes to bacterial hosts and improve the quality of public human gut reference genomes with 32% (34/105) HQ-MAGs that were either of better quality than those in the Unified Human Gastrointestinal Genome catalog version 2 or novel.",37114640,,10.1093/bib/bbad162,3
Approaches to Whole Mitochondrial Genome Sequencing on the Oxford Nanopore MinION,"Traditional approaches for interrogating the mitochondrial genome often involve laborious extraction and enrichment protocols followed by Sanger sequencing. Although preparation techniques are still demanding, the advent of next-generation or massively parallel sequencing has made it possible to routinely obtain nucleotide-level data with relative ease. These short-read sequencing platforms offer deep coverage with unparalleled read accuracy in high-complexity genomic regions but encounter numerous difficulties in the low-complexity homopolymeric sequences characteristic of the mitochondrial genome. The inability to discern identical units within monomeric repeats and resolve copy-number variations for heteroplasmy detection results in suboptimal genome assemblies that ultimately complicate downstream data analysis and interpretation of biological significance. Oxford Nanopore Technologies offers the ability to generate long-read sequencing data on a pocket-sized device known as the MinION. Nanopore-based sequencing is scalable, portable, and theoretically capable of sequencing the entire mitochondrial genome in a single contig. Furthermore, the recent development of a nanopore protein with dual reader heads allows for clear identification of nucleotides within homopolymeric stretches, significantly increasing resolution throughout these regions. The unrestricted read lengths, superior homopolymeric resolution, and affordability of the MinION device make it an attractive alternative to the labor-intensive, time-consuming, and costly mainstay deep-sequencing platforms. This article describes three approaches to extract, prepare, and sequence mitochondrial DNA on the Oxford Nanopore MinION device. Two of the workflows include enrichment of mitochondrial DNA prior to sequencing, whereas the other relies on direct sequencing of native genomic DNA to allow for simultaneous assessment of the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. © 2019 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Basic Protocol: Enrichment-free mitochondrial DNA sequencing Alternate Protocol 1: Mitochondrial DNA sequencing following enrichment with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) Alternate Protocol 2: Mitochondrial DNA sequencing following enrichment with PCR-free hybridization capture Support Protocol 1: DNA quantification and quality assessment using the Agilent 4200 TapeStation System Support Protocol 2: AMPure XP bead clean-up Support Protocol 3: Suggested data analysis pipeline.",31743587,,10.1002/cphg.94,9
Benchmarking second and third-generation sequencing platforms for microbial metagenomics,"Shotgun metagenomic sequencing is a common approach for studying the taxonomic diversity and metabolic potential of complex microbial communities. Current methods primarily use second generation short read sequencing, yet advances in third generation long read technologies provide opportunities to overcome some of the limitations of short read sequencing. Here, we compared seven platforms, encompassing second generation sequencers (Illumina HiSeq 300, MGI DNBSEQ-G400 and DNBSEQ-T7, ThermoFisher Ion GeneStudio S5 and Ion Proton P1) and third generation sequencers (Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION R9 and Pacific Biosciences Sequel II). We constructed three uneven synthetic microbial communities composed of up to 87 genomic microbial strains DNAs per mock, spanning 29 bacterial and archaeal phyla, and representing the most complex and diverse synthetic communities used for sequencing technology comparisons. Our results demonstrate that third generation sequencing have advantages over second generation platforms in analyzing complex microbial communities, but require careful sequencing library preparation for optimal quantitative metagenomic analysis. Our sequencing data also provides a valuable resource for testing and benchmarking bioinformatics software for metagenomics.",36369227,PMC9652401,10.1038/s41597-022-01762-z,13
Sensitive alignment using paralogous sequence variants improves long-read mapping and variant calling in segmental duplications,"The ability to characterize repetitive regions of the human genome is limited by the read lengths of short-read sequencing technologies. Although long-read sequencing technologies such as Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and Oxford Nanopore Technologies can potentially overcome this limitation, long segmental duplications with high sequence identity pose challenges for long-read mapping. We describe a probabilistic method, DuploMap, designed to improve the accuracy of long-read mapping in segmental duplications. It analyzes reads mapped to segmental duplications using existing long-read aligners and leverages paralogous sequence variants (PSVs)-sequence differences between paralogous sequences-to distinguish between multiple alignment locations. On simulated datasets, DuploMap increased the percentage of correctly mapped reads with high confidence for multiple long-read aligners including Minimap2 (74.3-90.6%) and BLASR (82.9-90.7%) while maintaining high precision. Across multiple whole-genome long-read datasets, DuploMap aligned an additional 8-21% of the reads in segmental duplications with high confidence relative to Minimap2. Using DuploMap-aligned PacBio circular consensus sequencing reads, an additional 8.9 Mb of DNA sequence was mappable, variant calling achieved a higher F1 score and 14 713 additional variants supported by linked-read data were identified. Finally, we demonstrate that a significant fraction of PSVs in segmental duplications overlaps with variants and adversely impacts short-read variant calling.",33035301,PMC7641771,10.1093/nar/gkaa829,9
Highly-multiplexed and efficient long-amplicon PacBio and Nanopore sequencing of hundreds of full mitochondrial genomes,"Background:Mitochondrial genome sequences have become critical to the study of biodiversity. Genome skimming and other short-read based methods are the most common approaches, but they are not well-suited to scale up to multiplexing hundreds of samples. Here, we report on a new approach to sequence hundreds to thousands of complete mitochondrial genomes in parallel using long-amplicon sequencing. We amplified the mitochondrial genome of 677 specimens in two partially overlapping amplicons and implemented an asymmetric PCR-based indexing approach to multiplex 1,159 long amplicons together on a single PacBio SMRT Sequel II cell. We also tested this method on Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) MinION R9.4 to assess if this method could be applied to other long-read technologies. We implemented several optimizations that make this method significantly more efficient than alternative mitochondrial genome sequencing methods.Results:With the PacBio sequencing data we recovered at least one of the two fragments for 96% of samples (~ 80-90%) with mean coverage ~ 1,500x. The ONT data recovered less than 50% of input fragments likely due to low throughput and the design of the Barcoded Universal Primers which were optimized for PacBio sequencing. We compared a single mitochondrial gene alignment to half and full mitochondrial genomes and found, as expected, increased tree support with longer alignments, though whole mitochondrial genomes were not significantly better than half mitochondrial genomes.Conclusions:This method can effectively capture thousands of long amplicons in a single run and be used to build more robust phylogenies quickly and effectively. We provide several recommendations for future users depending on the evolutionary scale of their system. A natural extension of this method is to collect multi-locus datasets consisting of mitochondrial genomes and several long nuclear loci at once.",37131128,PMC10155392,10.1186/s12864-023-09277-6,0
An efficient genotyper and star-allele caller for pharmacogenomics,"High-throughput sequencing provides sufficient means for determining genotypes of clinically important pharmacogenes that can be used to tailor medical decisions to individual patients. However, pharmacogene genotyping, also known as star-allele calling, is a challenging problem that requires accurate copy number calling, structural variation identification, variant calling, and phasing within each pharmacogene copy present in the sample. Here we introduce Aldy 4, a fast and efficient tool for genotyping pharmacogenes that uses combinatorial optimization for accurate star-allele calling across different sequencing technologies. Aldy 4 adds support for long reads and uses a novel phasing model and improved copy number and variant calling models. We compare Aldy 4 against the current state-of-the-art star-allele callers on a large and diverse set of samples and genes sequenced by various sequencing technologies, such as whole-genome and targeted Illumina sequencing, barcoded 10x Genomics, and Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) HiFi. We show that Aldy 4 is the most accurate star-allele caller with near-perfect accuracy in all evaluated contexts, and hope that Aldy remains an invaluable tool in the clinical toolbox even with the advent of long-read sequencing technologies.",36657977,PMC9977157,10.1101/gr.277075.122,7
Combined use of Oxford Nanopore and Illumina sequencing yields insights into soybean structural variation biology,"Background:Structural variants (SVs), including deletions, insertions, duplications, and inversions, are relatively long genomic variations implicated in a diverse range of processes from human disease to ecology and evolution. Given their complex signatures, tendency to occur in repeated regions, and large size, discovering SVs based on short reads is challenging compared to single-nucleotide variants. The increasing availability of long-read technologies has greatly facilitated SV discovery; however, these technologies remain too costly to apply routinely to population-level studies. Here, we combined short-read and long-read sequencing technologies to provide a comprehensive population-scale assessment of structural variation in a panel of Canadian soybean cultivars.Results:We used Oxford Nanopore long-read sequencing data (~12× mean coverage) for 17 samples to both benchmark SV calls made from Illumina short-read data and predict SVs that were subsequently genotyped in a population of 102 samples using Illumina data. Benchmarking results show that variants discovered using Oxford Nanopore can be accurately genotyped from the Illumina data. We first use the genotyped deletions and insertions for population genetics analyses and show that results are comparable to those based on single-nucleotide variants. We observe that the population frequency and distribution within the genome of deletions and insertions are constrained by the location of genes. Gene Ontology and PFAM domain enrichment analyses also confirm previous reports that genes harboring high-frequency deletions and insertions are enriched for functions in defense response. Finally, we discover polymorphic transposable elements from the deletions and insertions and report evidence of the recent activity of a Stowaway MITE.Conclusions:We show that structural variants discovered using Oxford Nanopore data can be genotyped with high accuracy from Illumina data. Our results demonstrate that long-read and short-read sequencing technologies can be efficiently combined to enhance SV analysis in large populations, providing a reusable framework for their study in a wider range of samples and non-model species.",35197050,PMC8867729,10.1186/s12915-022-01255-w,3
Portable sequencing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis for clinical and epidemiological applications,"With >1 million associated deaths in 2020, human tuberculosis (TB) caused by the bacteria Mycobacterium tuberculosis remains one of the deadliest infectious diseases. A plethora of genomic tools and bioinformatics pipelines have become available in recent years to assist the whole genome sequencing of M. tuberculosis. The Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) portable sequencer is a promising platform for cost-effective application in clinics, including personalizing treatment through detection of drug resistance-associated mutations, or in the field, to assist epidemiological and transmission investigations. In this study, we performed a comparison of 10 clinical isolates with DNA sequenced on both long-read ONT and (gold standard) short-read Illumina HiSeq platforms. Our analysis demonstrates the robustness of the ONT variant calling for single nucleotide polymorphisms, despite the high error rate. Moreover, because of improved coverage in repetitive regions where short sequencing reads fail to align accurately, ONT data analysis can incorporate additional regions of the genome usually excluded (e.g. pe/ppe genes). The resulting extra resolution can improve the characterization of transmission clusters and dynamics based on inferring closely related isolates. High concordance in variants in loci associated with drug resistance supports its use for the rapid detection of resistant mutations. Overall, ONT sequencing is a promising tool for TB genomic investigations, particularly to inform clinical and surveillance decision-making to reduce the disease burden.",35894606,PMC9487601,10.1093/bib/bbac256,6
Linear time complexity de novo long read genome assembly with GoldRush,"Current state-of-the-art de novo long read genome assemblers follow the Overlap-Layout-Consensus paradigm. While read-to-read overlap - its most costly step - was improved in modern long read genome assemblers, these tools still often require excessive RAM when assembling a typical human dataset. Our work departs from this paradigm, foregoing all-vs-all sequence alignments in favor of a dynamic data structure implemented in GoldRush, a de novo long read genome assembly algorithm with linear time complexity. We tested GoldRush on Oxford Nanopore Technologies long sequencing read datasets with different base error profiles sourced from three human cell lines, rice, and tomato. Here, we show that GoldRush achieves assembly scaffold NGA50 lengths of 18.3-22.2, 0.3 and 2.6 Mbp, for the genomes of human, rice, and tomato, respectively, and assembles each genome within a day, using at most 54.5 GB of random-access memory, demonstrating the scalability of our genome assembly paradigm and its implementation.",37217507,PMC10202940,10.1038/s41467-023-38716-x,4
Freddie: annotation-independent detection and discovery of transcriptomic alternative splicing isoforms using long-read sequencing,"Alternative splicing (AS) is an important mechanism in the development of many cancers, as novel or aberrant AS patterns play an important role as an independent onco-driver. In addition, cancer-specific AS is potentially an effective target of personalized cancer therapeutics. However, detecting AS events remains a challenging task, especially if these AS events are novel. This is exacerbated by the fact that existing transcriptome annotation databases are far from being comprehensive, especially with regard to cancer-specific AS. Additionally, traditional sequencing technologies are severely limited by the short length of the generated reads, which rarely spans more than a single splice junction site. Given these challenges, transcriptomic long-read (LR) sequencing presents a promising potential for the detection and discovery of AS. We present Freddie, a computational annotation-independent isoform discovery and detection tool. Freddie takes as input transcriptomic LR sequencing of a sample alongside its genomic split alignment and computes a set of isoforms for the given sample. It then partitions the input reads into sets that can be processed independently and in parallel. For each partition, Freddie segments the genomic alignment of the reads into canonical exon segments. The goal of this segmentation is to be able to represent any potential isoform as a subset of these canonical exons. This segmentation is formulated as an optimization problem and is solved with a dynamic programming algorithm. Then, Freddie reconstructs the isoforms by jointly clustering and error-correcting the reads using the canonical segmentation as a succinct representation. The clustering and error-correcting step is formulated as an optimization problem-the Minimum Error Clustering into Isoforms (MErCi) problem-and is solved using integer linear programming (ILP). We compare the performance of Freddie on simulated datasets with other isoform detection tools with varying dependence on annotation databases. We show that Freddie outperforms the other tools in its accuracy, including those given the complete ground truth annotation. We also run Freddie on a transcriptomic LR dataset generated in-house from a prostate cancer cell line with a matched short-read RNA-seq dataset. Freddie results in isoforms with a higher short-read cross-validation rate than the other tested tools. Freddie is open source and available at https://github.com/vpc-ccg/freddie/.",36478271,PMC9881145,10.1093/nar/gkac1112,3
Long-read sequencing of the coffee bean transcriptome reveals the diversity of full-length transcripts,"Polyploidization contributes to the complexity of gene expression, resulting in numerous related but different transcripts. This study explored the transcriptome diversity and complexity of the tetraploid Arabica coffee (Coffea arabica) bean. Long-read sequencing (LRS) by Pacbio Isoform sequencing (Iso-seq) was used to obtain full-length transcripts without the difficulty and uncertainty of assembly required for reads from short-read technologies. The tetraploid transcriptome was annotated and compared with data from the sub-genome progenitors. Caffeine and sucrose genes were targeted for case analysis. An isoform-level tetraploid coffee bean reference transcriptome with 95 995 distinct transcripts (average 3236 bp) was obtained. A total of 88 715 sequences (92.42%) were annotated with BLASTx against NCBI non-redundant plant proteins, including 34 719 high-quality annotations. Further BLASTn analysis against NCBI non-redundant nucleotide sequences, Coffea canephora coding sequences with UTR, C. arabica ESTs, and Rfam resulted in 1213 sequences without hits, were potential novel genes in coffee. Longer UTRs were captured, especially in the 5΄UTRs, facilitating the identification of upstream open reading frames. The LRS also revealed more and longer transcript variants in key caffeine and sucrose metabolism genes from this polyploid genome. Long sequences (>10 kilo base) were poorly annotated. LRS technology shows the limitation of previous studies. It provides an important tool to produce a reference transcriptome including more of the diversity of full-length transcripts to help understand the biology and support the genetic improvement of polyploid species such as coffee.",29048540,PMC5737654,10.1093/gigascience/gix086,43
Weighted minimizer sampling improves long read mapping,"Motivation:In this era of exponential data growth, minimizer sampling has become a standard algorithmic technique for rapid genome sequence comparison. This technique yields a sub-linear representation of sequences, enabling their comparison in reduced space and time. A key property of the minimizer technique is that if two sequences share a substring of a specified length, then they can be guaranteed to have a matching minimizer. However, because the k-mer distribution in eukaryotic genomes is highly uneven, minimizer-based tools (e.g. Minimap2, Mashmap) opt to discard the most frequently occurring minimizers from the genome to avoid excessive false positives. By doing so, the underlying guarantee is lost and accuracy is reduced in repetitive genomic regions.Results:We introduce a novel weighted-minimizer sampling algorithm. A unique feature of the proposed algorithm is that it performs minimizer sampling while considering a weight for each k-mer; i.e. the higher the weight of a k-mer, the more likely it is to be selected. By down-weighting frequently occurring k-mers, we are able to meet both objectives: (i) avoid excessive false-positive matches and (ii) maintain the minimizer match guarantee. We tested our algorithm, Winnowmap, using both simulated and real long-read data and compared it to a state-of-the-art long read mapper, Minimap2. Our results demonstrate a reduction in the mapping error-rate from 0.14% to 0.06% in the recently finished human X chromosome (154.3 Mbp), and from 3.6% to 0% within the highly repetitive X centromere (3.1 Mbp). Winnowmap improves mapping accuracy within repeats and achieves these results with sparser sampling, leading to better index compression and competitive runtimes.Availability and implementation:Winnowmap is built on top of the Minimap2 codebase and is available at https://github.com/marbl/winnowmap.",32657365,PMC7355284,10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa435,70
"De Novo Clustering of Long-Read Transcriptome Data Using a Greedy, Quality Value-Based Algorithm","Long-read sequencing of transcripts with Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) Iso-Seq and Oxford Nanopore Technologies has proven to be central to the study of complex isoform landscapes in many organisms. However, current de novo transcript reconstruction algorithms from long-read data are limited, leaving the potential of these technologies unfulfilled. A common bottleneck is the dearth of scalable and accurate algorithms for clustering long reads according to their gene family of origin. To address this challenge, we develop isONclust, a clustering algorithm that is greedy (to scale) and makes use of quality values (to handle variable error rates). We test isONclust on three simulated and five biological data sets, across a breadth of organisms, technologies, and read depths. Our results demonstrate that isONclust is a substantial improvement over previous approaches, both in terms of overall accuracy and/or scalability to large data sets.",32181688,PMC8884114,10.1089/cmb.2019.0299,40
Testing assembly strategies of Francisella tularensis genomes to infer an evolutionary conservation analysis of genomic structures,"Background:We benchmarked sequencing technology and assembly strategies for short-read, long-read, and hybrid assemblers in respect to correctness, contiguity, and completeness of assemblies in genomes of Francisella tularensis. Benchmarking allowed in-depth analyses of genomic structures of the Francisella pathogenicity islands and insertion sequences. Five major high-throughput sequencing technologies were applied, including next-generation ""short-read"" and third-generation ""long-read"" sequencing methods.Results:We focused on short-read assemblers, hybrid assemblers, and analysis of the genomic structure with particular emphasis on insertion sequences and the Francisella pathogenicity island. The A5-miseq pipeline performed best for MiSeq data, Mira for Ion Torrent data, and ABySS for HiSeq data from eight short-read assembly methods. Two approaches were applied to benchmark long-read and hybrid assembly strategies: long-read-first assembly followed by correction with short reads (Canu/Pilon, Flye/Pilon) and short-read-first assembly along with scaffolding based on long reads (Unicyler, SPAdes). Hybrid assembly can resolve large repetitive regions best with a ""long-read first"" approach.Conclusions:Genomic structures of the Francisella pathogenicity islands frequently showed misassembly. Insertion sequences (IS) could be used to perform an evolutionary conservation analysis. A phylogenetic structure of insertion sequences and the evolution within the clades elucidated the clade structure of the highly conservative F. tularensis.",34773979,PMC8590783,10.1186/s12864-021-08115-x,2
Sequencing and phasing cancer mutations in lung cancers using a long-read portable sequencer,"Here, we employed cDNA amplicon sequencing using a long-read portable sequencer, MinION, to characterize various types of mutations in cancer-related genes, namely, EGFR, KRAS, NRAS and NF1. For homozygous SNVs, the precision and recall rates were 87.5% and 91.3%, respectively. For previously reported hotspot mutations, the precision and recall rates reached 100%. The precise junctions of EML4-ALK, CCDC6-RET and five other gene fusions were also detected. Taking advantages of long-read sequencing, we conducted phasing of EGFR mutations and elucidated the mutational allelic backgrounds of anti-tumor drug-sensitive and resistant mutations, which could provide useful information for selecting therapeutic approaches. In the H1975 cells, 72% of the reads harbored both L858R and T790M mutations, and 22% of the reads harbored neither mutation. To ensure that the clinical requirements can be met in potentially low cancer cell populations, we further conducted a serial dilution analysis of the template for EGFR mutations. Several percent of the mutant alleles could be detected depending on the yield and quality of the sequencing data. Finally, we characterized the mutation genotypes in eight clinical samples. This method could be a convenient long-read sequencing-based analytical approach and thus may change the current approaches used for cancer genome sequencing.",29117310,PMC5726485,10.1093/dnares/dsx027,30
Minerva: an alignment- and reference-free approach to deconvolve Linked-Reads for metagenomics,"Emerging Linked-Read technologies (aka read cloud or barcoded short-reads) have revived interest in short-read technology as a viable approach to understand large-scale structures in genomes and metagenomes. Linked-Read technologies, such as the 10x Chromium system, use a microfluidic system and a specialized set of 3' barcodes (aka UIDs) to tag short DNA reads sourced from the same long fragment of DNA; subsequently, the tagged reads are sequenced on standard short-read platforms. This approach results in interesting compromises. Each long fragment of DNA is only sparsely covered by reads, no information about the ordering of reads from the same fragment is preserved, and 3' barcodes match reads from roughly 2-20 long fragments of DNA. However, compared to long-read technologies, the cost per base to sequence is far lower, far less input DNA is required, and the per base error rate is that of Illumina short-reads. In this paper, we formally describe a particular algorithmic issue common to Linked-Read technology: the deconvolution of reads with a single 3' barcode into clusters that represent single long fragments of DNA. We introduce Minerva, a graph-based algorithm that approximately solves the barcode deconvolution problem for metagenomic data (where reference genomes may be incomplete or unavailable). Additionally, we develop two demonstrations where the deconvolution of barcoded reads improves downstream results, improving the specificity of taxonomic assignments and ofk-mer-based clustering. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to address the problem of barcode deconvolution in metagenomics.",30523036,PMC6314158,10.1101/gr.235499.118,11
Comparison of multiple algorithms to reliably detect structural variants in pears,"Background:Structural variations (SVs) have been reported to play an important role in genetic diversity and trait regulation. Many computer algorithms detecting SVs have recently been developed, but the use of multiple algorithms to detect high-confidence SVs has not been studied. The most suitable sequencing depth for detecting SVs in pear is also not known.Results:In this study, a pipeline to detect SVs using next-generation and long-read sequencing data was constructed. The performances of seven types of SV detection software using next-generation sequencing (NGS) data and two types of software using long-read sequencing data (SVIM and Sniffles), which are based on different algorithms, were compared. Of the nine software packages evaluated, SVIM identified the most SVs, and Sniffles detected SVs with the highest accuracy (> 90%). When the results from multiple SV detection tools were combined, the SVs identified by both MetaSV and IMR/DENOM, which use NGS data, were more accurate than those identified by both SVIM and Sniffles, with mean accuracies of 98.7 and 96.5%, respectively. The software packages using long-read sequencing data required fewer CPU cores and less memory and ran faster than those using NGS data. In addition, according to the performances of assembly-based algorithms using NGS data, we found that a sequencing depth of 50× is appropriate for detecting SVs in the pear genome.Conclusion:This study provides strong evidence that more than one SV detection software package, each based on a different algorithm, should be used to detect SVs with higher confidence, and that long-read sequencing data are better than NGS data for SV detection. The SV detection pipeline that we have established will facilitate the study of diversity in other crops.",31959124,PMC6972009,10.1186/s12864-020-6455-x,10
HapCUT2: robust and accurate haplotype assembly for diverse sequencing technologies,"Many tools have been developed for haplotype assembly-the reconstruction of individual haplotypes using reads mapped to a reference genome sequence. Due to increasing interest in obtaining haplotype-resolved human genomes, a range of new sequencing protocols and technologies have been developed to enable the reconstruction of whole-genome haplotypes. However, existing computational methods designed to handle specific technologies do not scale well on data from different protocols. We describe a new algorithm, HapCUT2, that extends our previous method (HapCUT) to handle multiple sequencing technologies. Using simulations and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data from multiple different data types-dilution pool sequencing, linked-read sequencing, single molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing, and proximity ligation (Hi-C) sequencing-we show that HapCUT2 rapidly assembles haplotypes with best-in-class accuracy for all data types. In particular, HapCUT2 scales well for high sequencing coverage and rapidly assembled haplotypes for two long-read WGS data sets on which other methods struggled. Further, HapCUT2 directly models Hi-C specific error modalities, resulting in significant improvements in error rates compared to HapCUT, the only other method that could assemble haplotypes from Hi-C data. Using HapCUT2, haplotype assembly from a 90× coverage whole-genome Hi-C data set yielded high-resolution haplotypes (78.6% of variants phased in a single block) with high pairwise phasing accuracy (∼98% across chromosomes). Our results demonstrate that HapCUT2 is a robust tool for haplotype assembly applicable to data from diverse sequencing technologies.",27940952,PMC5411775,10.1101/gr.213462.116,161
Quantification of Genetic Heterogeneity Using Long-Read Targeted Individual DNA Molecule Sequencing,"Understanding genetic heterogeneity is of paramount importance in unraveling the intricate functioning of biological systems, as it contributes to the diversity of phenotypes of gene-environment interactions. We have developed a method termed targeted Individual DNA Molecule Sequencing (IDMseq) to accurately quantify genetic heterogeneity within cell populations, even those with rare variants present at low frequencies. IDMseq ensures that each original DNA molecule is distinctively represented by one unique molecule identifier (UMI) group, preventing false UMI groups and enabling precise quantification of allele frequency within the original population. IDMseq is a versatile sequencing technique that combines error correction and long-read sequencing, enabling sensitive detection of various genetic variants, including single nucleotide variants and large structural variants in both basic and clinical research settings. This protocol provides a comprehensive, step-by-step guide to preparing samples and performing IDMseq to determine genetic variations. © 2023 The Authors.

Comparison of spermatozoal RNA extraction methods in goats,"RNA sequencing (RNAseq) has divulged newer role of spermatozoal RNA in male fertility. This study aimed to evaluate different sperm purification and RNA extraction methods for long-read RNA sequencing of poly(A) transcriptome in goat spermatozoa. Sperm samples were purified by swim-up separation using different purification medium. Spermatozoal RNA was extracted by seven different methods with additional supplementation of reducing agents in lysis buffer. poly(A) selected RNA was used for cDNA library preparation and long-read RNAseq in Nanopore sequencer. Sperm purification by 1 h swim-up resulted in higher recovery (89.20 ± 1.15%), motility (82.33 ± 1.53%), viability (88.10 ± 5.03%) and plasma membrane integrity (71.33 ± 4.51%) in sperm TALP (sp-TL) medium. A monophasic solution of GITC with phenol and DTT resulted in the highest yield of large sized RNAs (3.89 ± 0.46 ng/million cells) suitable for long-read RNAseq of poly(A) transcripts. RNAseq resulted in reads of length, ranging from 500bp to 2 Kb. A total of 123 transcripts were identified in goat spermatozoa by de novo assembly and included sperm-specific transcripts such as CATSPERG, PRM2, CYLC2, SPATA6, PLCZ1 etc. This study is the first report of long-read RNAseq of poly(A) transcriptome in goat spermatozoa.",33285124,,10.1016/j.ab.2020.114059,5
Comparison of R9.4.1/Kit10 and R10/Kit12 Oxford Nanopore flowcells and chemistries in bacterial genome reconstruction,"Complete, accurate, cost-effective, and high-throughput reconstruction of bacterial genomes for large-scale genomic epidemiological studies is currently only possible with hybrid assembly, combining long- (typically using nanopore sequencing) and short-read (Illumina) datasets. Being able to use nanopore-only data would be a significant advance. Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) have recently released a new flowcell (R10.4) and chemistry (Kit12), which reportedly generate per-read accuracies rivalling those of Illumina data. To evaluate this, we sequenced DNA extracts from four commonly studied bacterial pathogens, namelyEscherichia coli,Klebsiella pneumoniae,Pseudomonas aeruginosaandStaphylococcus aureus, using Illumina and ONT's R9.4.1/Kit10, R10.3/Kit12, R10.4/Kit12 flowcells/chemistries. We compared raw read accuracy and assembly accuracy for each modality, considering the impact of different nanopore basecalling models, commonly used assemblers, sequencing depth, and the use of duplex versus simplex reads. 'Super accuracy' (sup) basecalled R10.4 reads - in particular duplex reads - have high per-read accuracies and could be used to robustly reconstruct bacterial genomes without the use of Illumina data. However, the per-run yield of duplex reads generated in our hands with standard sequencing protocols was low (typically <10 %), with substantial implications for cost and throughput if relying on nanopore data only to enable bacterial genome reconstruction. In addition, recovery of small plasmids with the best-performing long-read assembler (Flye) was inconsistent. R10.4/Kit12 combined with sup basecalling holds promise as a singular sequencing technology in the reconstruction of commonly studied bacterial genomes, but hybrid assembly (Illumina+R9.4.1 hac) currently remains the highest throughput, most robust, and cost-effective approach to fully reconstruct these bacterial genomes.",36748454,PMC9973852,10.1099/mgen.0.000910,25
1D Genome Sequencing on the Oxford Nanopore MinION,"Today's short-read sequencing instruments can generate read lengths between 50 bp and 700 bp depending on the specific instrument. These high-throughput sequencing approaches have revolutionized genomic science, allowing hundreds of thousands of full genomes to be sequenced, and have become indispensable tools for many researchers. With greater insight has come the revelation that many genomes are much more complicated than originally thought and include many rearrangements and copy-number variations. Unfortunately, short-read sequencing technologies are not well suited for identifying many of these types of events. Long-read sequencing technologies can read contiguous fragments of DNA in excess of 10 kb and are much better suited for detecting large structural events. The newest long-read sequencing instrument is the MinION device from Oxford Nanopore. The rapid sequencing speed and low upfront instrument cost are features drawing interest in this device from the genomics community. This unit provides a representative protocol for carrying out human genome sequencing on the Oxford Nanopore MinION. © 2017 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",28696556,,10.1002/cphg.39,2
A new method for long-read sequencing of animal mitochondrial genomes: application to the identification of equine mitochondrial DNA variants,"Background:Mitochondrial DNA is remarkably polymorphic. This is why animal geneticists survey mitochondrial genomes variations for fundamental and applied purposes. We present here an approach to sequence whole mitochondrial genomes using nanopore long-read sequencing. Our method relies on the selective elimination of nuclear DNA using an exonuclease treatment and on the amplification of circular mitochondrial DNA using a multiple displacement amplification step.Results:We optimized each preparative step to obtain a 100 million-fold enrichment of horse mitochondrial DNA relative to nuclear DNA. We sequenced these amplified mitochondrial DNA using nanopore sequencing technology and obtained mitochondrial DNA reads that represented up to half of the sequencing output. The sequence reads were 2.3 kb of mean length and provided an even coverage of the mitochondrial genome. Long-reads spanning half or more of the whole mtDNA provided a coverage that varied between 118X and 488X. We evaluated SNPs identified using these long-reads by Sanger sequencing as ground truth and found a precision of 100.0%; a recall of 93.1% and a F1-score of 0.964 using the Twilight horse mtDNA reference. The choice of the mtDNA reference impacted variant calling efficiency with F1-scores varying between 0.947 and 0.964.Conclusions:Our method to amplify mtDNA and to sequence it using the nanopore technology is usable for mitochondrial DNA variant analysis. With minor modifications, this approach could easily be applied to other large circular DNA molecules.",33176683,PMC7661214,10.1186/s12864-020-07183-9,7
NanoSim: nanopore sequence read simulator based on statistical characterization,"Background:The MinION sequencing instrument from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) produces long read lengths from single-molecule sequencing - valuable features for detailed genome characterization. To realize the potential of this platform, a number of groups are developing bioinformatics tools tuned for the unique characteristics of its data. We note that these development efforts would benefit from a simulator software, the output of which could be used to benchmark analysis tools.Results:Here, we introduce NanoSim, a fast and scalable read simulator that captures the technology-specific features of ONT data and allows for adjustments upon improvement of nanopore sequencing technology. The first step of NanoSim is read characterization, which provides a comprehensive alignment-based analysis and generates a set of read profiles serving as the input to the next step, the simulation stage. The simulation stage uses the model built in the previous step to produce in silico reads for a given reference genome. NanoSim is written in Python and R. The source files and manual are available at the Genome Sciences Centre website: http://www.bcgsc.ca/platform/bioinfo/software/nanosim.Conclusion:In this work, we model the base-calling errors of ONT reads to inform the simulation of sequences with similar characteristics. We showcase the performance of NanoSim on publicly available datasets generated using the R7 and R7.3 chemistries and different sequencing kits and compare the resulting synthetic reads to those of other long-sequence simulators and experimental ONT reads. We expect NanoSim to have an enabling role in the field and benefit the development of scalable next-generation sequencing technologies for the long nanopore reads, including genome assembly, mutation detection, and even metagenomic analysis software.",28327957,PMC5530317,10.1093/gigascience/gix010,103
MetaBCC-LR: metagenomics binning by coverage and composition for long reads,"Motivation:Metagenomics studies have provided key insights into the composition and structure of microbial communities found in different environments. Among the techniques used to analyse metagenomic data, binning is considered a crucial step to characterize the different species of micro-organisms present. The use of short-read data in most binning tools poses several limitations, such as insufficient species-specific signal, and the emergence of long-read sequencing technologies offers us opportunities to surmount them. However, most current metagenomic binning tools have been developed for short reads. The few tools that can process long reads either do not scale with increasing input size or require a database with reference genomes that are often unknown. In this article, we present MetaBCC-LR, a scalable reference-free binning method which clusters long reads directly based on their k-mer coverage histograms and oligonucleotide composition.Results:We evaluate MetaBCC-LR on multiple simulated and real metagenomic long-read datasets with varying coverages and error rates. Our experiments demonstrate that MetaBCC-LR substantially outperforms state-of-the-art reference-free binning tools, achieving ∼13% improvement in F1-score and ∼30% improvement in ARI compared to the best previous tools. Moreover, we show that using MetaBCC-LR before long-read assembly helps to enhance the assembly quality while significantly reducing the assembly cost in terms of time and memory usage. The efficiency and accuracy of MetaBCC-LR pave the way for more effective long-read-based metagenomics analyses to support a wide range of applications.Availability and implementation:The source code is freely available at: https://github.com/anuradhawick/MetaBCC-LR.Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",32657364,PMC7355282,10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa441,13
Benchmarking datasets for assembly-based variant calling using high-fidelity long reads,"Background:Recent advances in long-read sequencing technologies have enabled accurate identification of all genetic variants in individuals or cells; this procedure is known as variant calling. However, benchmarking studies on variant calling using different long-read sequencing technologies are still lacking.Results:We used two Caenorhabditis elegans strains to measure several variant calling metrics. These two strains shared true-positive genetic variants that were introduced during strain generation. In addition, both strains contained common and distinguishable variants induced by DNA damage, possibly leading to false-positive estimation. We obtained accurate and noisy long reads from both strains using high-fidelity (HiFi) and continuous long-read (CLR) sequencing platforms, and compared the variant calling performance of the two platforms. HiFi identified a 1.65-fold higher number of true-positive variants on average, with 60% fewer false-positive variants, than CLR did. We also compared read-based and assembly-based variant calling methods in combination with subsampling of various sequencing depths and demonstrated that variant calling after genome assembly was particularly effective for detection of large insertions, even with 10 × sequencing depth of accurate long-read sequencing data.Conclusions:By directly comparing the two long-read sequencing technologies, we demonstrated that variant calling after genome assembly with 10 × or more depth of accurate long-read sequencing data allowed reliable detection of true-positive variants. Considering the high cost of HiFi sequencing, we herein propose appropriate methodologies for performing cost-effective and high-quality variant calling: 10 × assembly-based variant calling. The results of the present study may facilitate the development of methods for identifying all genetic variants at the population level.",36973656,PMC10045170,10.1186/s12864-023-09255-y,3
Correcting palindromes in long reads after whole-genome amplification,"Background:Next-generation sequencing requires sufficient DNA to be available. If limited, whole-genome amplification is applied to generate additional amounts of DNA. Such amplification often results in many chimeric DNA fragments, in particular artificial palindromic sequences, which limit the usefulness of long sequencing reads.Results:Here, we present Pacasus, a tool for correcting such errors. Two datasets show that it markedly improves read mapping and de novo assembly, yielding results similar to these that would be obtained with non-amplified DNA.Conclusions:With Pacasus long-read technologies become available for sequencing targets with very small amounts of DNA, such as single cells or even single chromosomes.",30400848,PMC6218980,10.1186/s12864-018-5164-1,13
It's more than stamp collecting: how genome sequencing can unify biological research,"The availability of reference genome sequences, especially the human reference, has revolutionized the study of biology. However, while the genomes of some species have been fully sequenced, a wide range of biological problems still cannot be effectively studied for lack of genome sequence information. Here, I identify neglected areas of biology and describe how both targeted species sequencing and more broad taxonomic surveys of the tree of life can address important biological questions. I enumerate the significant benefits that would accrue from sequencing a broader range of taxa, as well as discuss the technical advances in sequencing and assembly methods that would allow for wide-ranging application of whole-genome analysis. Finally, I suggest that in addition to 'big science' survey initiatives to sequence the tree of life, a modified infrastructure-funding paradigm would better support reference genome sequence generation for research communities most in need.",26003218,PMC4490122,10.1016/j.tig.2015.04.007,15
Comparative analysis of targeted long read sequencing approaches for characterization of a plant's immune receptor repertoire,"Background:The Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION™ sequencer is a small, portable, low cost device that is accessible to labs of all sizes and attractive for in-the-field sequencing experiments. Selective breeding of crops has led to a reduction in genetic diversity, and wild relatives are a key source of new genetic resistance to pathogens, usually via NLR immune receptor-encoding genes. Recent studies have demonstrated how crop NLR repertoires can be targeted for sequencing on Illumina or PacBio (RenSeq) and the specific gene conveying pathogen resistance identified.Results:Sequence yields per MinION run are lower than Illumina, making targeted resequencing an efficient approach. While MinION generates long reads similar to PacBio it doesn't generate the highly accurate multipass consensus reads, which presents downstream bioinformatics challenges. Here we demonstrate how MinION data can be used for RenSeq achieving similar results to the PacBio and how novel NLR gene fusions can be identified via a Nanopore RenSeq pipeline.Conclusion:The described library preparation and bioinformatics methods should be applicable to other gene families or any targeted long DNA fragment nanopore sequencing project.",28747151,PMC5530509,10.1186/s12864-017-3936-7,23
NanoPipe-a web server for nanopore MinION sequencing data analysis,"Background:The fast-moving progress of the third-generation long-read sequencing technologies will soon bring the biological and medical sciences to a new era of research. Altogether, the technique and experimental procedures are becoming more straightforward and available to biologists from diverse fields, even without any profound experience in DNA sequencing. Thus, the introduction of the MinION device by Oxford Nanopore Technologies promises to ""bring sequencing technology to the masses"" and also allows quick and operative analysis in field studies. However, the convenience of this sequencing technology dramatically contrasts with the available analysis tools, which may significantly reduce enthusiasm of a ""regular"" user. To really bring the sequencing technology to every biologist, we need a set of user-friendly tools that can perform a powerful analysis in an automatic manner.Findings:NanoPipe was developed in consideration of the specifics of the MinION sequencing technologies, providing accordingly adjusted alignment parameters. The range of the target species/sequences for the alignment is not limited, and the descriptive usage page of NanoPipe helps a user to succeed with NanoPipe analysis. The results contain alignment statistics, consensus sequence, polymorphisms data, and visualization of the alignment. Several test cases are used to demonstrate the efficiency of the tool.Conclusions:Freely available NanoPipe software allows effortless and reliable analysis of MinION sequencing data for experienced bioinformaticians, as well for wet-lab biologists with minimum bioinformatics knowledge. Moreover, for the latter group, we describe the basic algorithm necessary for MinION sequencing analysis from the first to last step.",30689855,PMC6377397,10.1093/gigascience/giy169,15
Direct Sequencing of RNA and RNA Modification Identification Using Nanopore,"Direct RNA sequencing (dRNA-seq) simultaneously enables the detection of RNA modifications and characterization of full-length transcripts. In principle, full-length native RNA molecule is translocated through the nanopore by a motor protein while a sensor measures ionic current shifts. Then, the current shifts are interpreted by an algorithm that turn out to RNA sequence. Currently, the standard protocol of dRNA-seq provided by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) allows to directly ligate and sequence only polyadenylated RNA (poly(A) RNA). Here, we describe a method of dRNA-seq that can be applied for both poly(A) RNA and non-poly(A) tailed-RNA.",35524112,PMC10619517,10.1007/978-1-0716-2257-5_5,1
Impact of short-read sequencing on the misassembly of a plant genome,"Background:Availability of plant genome sequences has led to significant advances. However, with few exceptions, the great majority of existing genome assemblies are derived from short read sequencing technologies with highly uneven read coverages indicative of sequencing and assembly issues that could significantly impact any downstream analysis of plant genomes. In tomato for example, 0.6% (5.1 Mb) and 9.7% (79.6 Mb) of short-read based assembly had significantly higher and lower coverage compared to background, respectively.Results:To understand what the causes may be for such uneven coverage, we first established machine learning models capable of predicting genomic regions with variable coverages and found that high coverage regions tend to have higher simple sequence repeat and tandem gene densities compared to background regions. To determine if the high coverage regions were misassembled, we examined a recently available tomato long-read based assembly and found that 27.8% (1.41 Mb) of high coverage regions were potentially misassembled of duplicate sequences, compared to 1.4% in background regions. In addition, using a predictive model that can distinguish correctly and incorrectly assembled high coverage regions, we found that misassembled, high coverage regions tend to be flanked by simple sequence repeats, pseudogenes, and transposon elements.Conclusions:Our study provides insights on the causes of variable coverage regions and a quantitative assessment of factors contributing to plant genome misassembly when using short reads and the generality of these causes and factors should be tested further in other species.",33530937,PMC7852129,10.1186/s12864-021-07397-5,6
BleTIES: annotation of natural genome editing in ciliates using long read sequencing,"Summary:Ciliates are single-celled eukaryotes that eliminate specific, interspersed DNA sequences (internally eliminated sequences, IESs) from their genomes during development. These are challenging to annotate and assemble because IES-containing sequences are typically much less abundant in the cell than those without, and IES sequences themselves often contain repetitive and low-complexity sequences. Long-read sequencing technologies from Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore have the potential to reconstruct longer IESs than has been possible with short reads but require a different assembly strategy. Here we present BleTIES, a software toolkit for detecting, assembling, and analyzing IESs using mapped long reads.Availability and implementation:BleTIES is implemented in Python 3. Source code is available at https://github.com/Swart-lab/bleties (MIT license) and also distributed via Bioconda.Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",34487139,,10.1093/bioinformatics/btab613,3
Advancing genomic technologies and clinical awareness accelerates discovery of disease-associated tandem repeat sequences,"Expansions of gene-specific DNA tandem repeats (TRs), first described in 1991 as a disease-causing mutation in humans, are now known to cause >60 phenotypes, not just disease, and not only in humans. TRs are a common form of genetic variation with biological consequences, observed, so far, in humans, dogs, plants, oysters, and yeast. Repeat diseases show atypical clinical features, genetic anticipation, and multiple and partially penetrant phenotypes among family members. Discovery of disease-causing repeat expansion loci accelerated through technological advances in DNA sequencing and computational analyses. Between 2019 and 2021, 17 new disease-causing TR expansions were reported, totaling 63 TR loci (>69 diseases), with a likelihood of more discoveries, and in more organisms. Recent and historical lessons reveal that properly assessed clinical presentations, coupled with genetic and biological awareness, can guide discovery of disease-causing unstable TRs. We highlight critical but underrecognized aspects of TR mutations. Repeat motifs may not be present in current reference genomes but will be in forthcoming gapless long-read references. Repeat motif size can be a single nucleotide to kilobases/unit. At a given locus, repeat motif sequence purity can vary with consequence. Pathogenic repeats can be ""insertions"" within nonpathogenic TRs. Expansions, contractions, and somatic length variations of TRs can have clinical/biological consequences. TR instabilities occur in humans and other organisms. TRs can be epigenetically modified and/or chromosomal fragile sites. We discuss the expanding field of disease-associated TR instabilities, highlighting prospects, clinical and genetic clues, tools, and challenges for further discoveries of disease-causing TR instabilities and understanding their biological and pathological impacts-a vista that is about to expand.",34965938,PMC8744678,10.1101/gr.269530.120,17
A hybrid and poly-polish workflow for the complete and accurate assembly of phage genomes: a case study of ten przondoviruses,"Bacteriophages (phages) within the genusPrzondovirusare T7-like podoviruses belonging to the subfamilyStudiervirinae, within the familyAutographiviridae,and have a highly conserved genome organisation. The genomes of these phages range from 37 to 42 kb in size, encode 50-60 genes and are characterised by the presence of direct terminal repeats (DTRs) flanking the linear chromosome. These DTRs are often deleted during short-read-only and hybrid assemblies. Moreover, long-read-only assemblies are often littered with sequencing and/or assembly errors and require additional curation. Here, we present the isolation and characterisation of ten novel przondoviruses targetingKlebsiellaspp. We describe HYPPA, a HYbrid and Poly-polish Phage Assembly workflow, which utilises long-read assemblies in combination with short-read sequencing to resolve phage DTRs and correcting errors, negating the need for laborious primer walking and Sanger sequencing validation. Our assembly workflow utilised Oxford Nanopore Technologies for long-read sequencing for its accessibility, making it the more relevant long-read sequencing technology at this time, and Illumina DNA Prep for short-read sequencing, representing the most commonly used technologies globally. Our data demonstrate the importance of careful curation of phage assemblies before publication, and prior to using them for comparative genomics.",37463032,PMC10438801,10.1099/mgen.0.001065,3
Longshot enables accurate variant calling in diploid genomes from single-molecule long read sequencing,"Whole-genome sequencing using sequencing technologies such as Illumina enables the accurate detection of small-scale variants but provides limited information about haplotypes and variants in repetitive regions of the human genome. Single-molecule sequencing (SMS) technologies such as Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore generate long reads that can potentially address the limitations of short-read sequencing. However, the high error rate of SMS reads makes it challenging to detect small-scale variants in diploid genomes. We introduce a variant calling method, Longshot, which leverages the haplotype information present in SMS reads to accurately detect and phase single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) in diploid genomes. We demonstrate that Longshot achieves very high accuracy for SNV detection using whole-genome Pacific Biosciences data, outperforms existing variant calling methods, and enables variant detection in duplicated regions of the genome that cannot be mapped using short reads.",31604920,PMC6788989,10.1038/s41467-019-12493-y,92
Subtyping Evaluation ofSalmonellaEnteritidis Using Single Nucleotide Polymorphism and Core Genome Multilocus Sequence Typing with Nanopore Reads,"Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) for public health surveillance and epidemiological investigation of foodborne pathogens predominantly relies on sequencing platforms that generate short reads. Continuous improvement of long-read nanopore sequencing, such as Oxford nanopore technologies (ONT), presents a potential for leveraging multiple advantages of the technology in public health and food industry settings, including rapid turnaround and onsite applicability in addition to superior read length. Using an established cohort of Salmonella Enteritidis isolates for subtyping evaluation, we assessed the technical readiness of nanopore long read sequencing for single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis and core-genome multilocus sequence typing (cgMLST) of a major foodborne pathogen. By multiplexing three isolates per flow cell, we generated sufficient sequencing depths in <7 h of sequencing for robust subtyping. SNP calls by ONT and Illumina reads were highly concordant despite homopolymer errors in ONT reads (R9.4.1 chemistry).In silicocorrection of such errors allowed accurate allelic calling for cgMLST and allelic difference measurements to facilitate heuristic detection of outbreak isolates.IMPORTANCEEvaluation, standardization, and implementation of the ONT approach to WGS-based, strain-level subtyping is challenging, in part due to its relatively high base-calling error rates and frequent iterations of sequencing chemistry and bioinformatic analytics. Our study established a baseline for the continuously evolving nanopore technology as a viable solution to high-quality subtyping of Salmonella, delivering comparable subtyping performance when used standalone or together with short-read platforms. This study paves the way for evaluating and optimizing the logistics of implementing the ONT approach for foodborne pathogen surveillance in specific settings.",35867567,PMC9361833,10.1128/aem.00785-22,2
SVIM: structural variant identification using mapped long reads,"Motivation:Structural variants are defined as genomic variants larger than 50 bp. They have been shown to affect more bases in any given genome than single-nucleotide polymorphisms or small insertions and deletions. Additionally, they have great impact on human phenotype and diversity and have been linked to numerous diseases. Due to their size and association with repeats, they are difficult to detect by shotgun sequencing, especially when based on short reads. Long read, single-molecule sequencing technologies like those offered by Pacific Biosciences or Oxford Nanopore Technologies produce reads with a length of several thousand base pairs. Despite the higher error rate and sequencing cost, long-read sequencing offers many advantages for the detection of structural variants. Yet, available software tools still do not fully exploit the possibilities.Results:We present SVIM, a tool for the sensitive detection and precise characterization of structural variants from long-read data. SVIM consists of three components for the collection, clustering and combination of structural variant signatures from read alignments. It discriminates five different variant classes including similar types, such as tandem and interspersed duplications and novel element insertions. SVIM is unique in its capability of extracting both the genomic origin and destination of duplications. It compares favorably with existing tools in evaluations on simulated data and real datasets from Pacific Biosciences and Nanopore sequencing machines.Availability and implementation:The source code and executables of SVIM are available on Github: github.com/eldariont/svim. SVIM has been implemented in Python 3 and published on bioconda and the Python Package Index.Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",30668829,PMC6735718,10.1093/bioinformatics/btz041,130
Versatile genome assembly evaluation with QUAST-LG,"Motivation:The emergence of high-throughput sequencing technologies revolutionized genomics in early 2000s. The next revolution came with the era of long-read sequencing. These technological advances along with novel computational approaches became the next step towards the automatic pipelines capable to assemble nearly complete mammalian-size genomes.Results:In this manuscript, we demonstrate performance of the state-of-the-art genome assembly software on six eukaryotic datasets sequenced using different technologies. To evaluate the results, we developed QUAST-LG-a tool that compares large genomic de novo assemblies against reference sequences and computes relevant quality metrics. Since genomes generally cannot be reconstructed completely due to complex repeat patterns and low coverage regions, we introduce a concept of upper bound assembly for a given genome and set of reads, and compute theoretical limits on assembly correctness and completeness. Using QUAST-LG, we show how close the assemblies are to the theoretical optimum, and how far this optimum is from the finished reference.Availability and implementation:http://cab.spbu.ru/software/quast-lg.Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",29949969,PMC6022658,10.1093/bioinformatics/bty266,449
Analysis of Tandem Repeat Expansions Using Long DNA Reads,"Abnormal expansion or shortening of tandem repeats can cause a variety of genetic diseases. The use of long DNA reads has facilitated the analysis of disease-causing repeats in the human genome. Long read sequencers enable us to directly analyze repeat length and sequence content by covering whole repeats; they are therefore considered suitable for the analysis of long tandem repeats.

CRAM 3.1: advances in the CRAM file format,"Motivation:CRAM has established itself as a high compression alternative to the BAM file format for DNA sequencing data. We describe updates to further improve this on modern sequencing instruments.Results:With Illumina data CRAM 3.1 is 7-15% smaller than the equivalent CRAM 3.0 file, and 50-70% smaller than the corresponding BAM file. Long-read technology shows more modest compression due to the presence of high-entropy signals.Availability and implementation:The CRAM 3.0 specification is freely available from https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/CRAMv3.pdf.

Highly accurate long reads are crucial for realizing the potential of biodiversity genomics,"Background:Generating the most contiguous, accurate genome assemblies given available sequencing technologies is a long-standing challenge in genome science. With the rise of long-read sequencing, assembly challenges have shifted from merely increasing contiguity to correctly assembling complex, repetitive regions of interest, ideally in a phased manner. At present, researchers largely choose between two types of long read data: longer, but less accurate sequences, or highly accurate, but shorter reads (i.e., >Q20 or 99% accurate). To better understand how these types of long-read data as well as scale of data (i.e., mean length and sequencing depth) influence genome assembly outcomes, we compared genome assemblies for a caddisfly, Hesperophylax magnus, generated with longer, but less accurate, Oxford Nanopore (ONT) R9.4.1 and highly accurate PacBio HiFi (HiFi) data. Next, we expanded this comparison to consider the influence of highly accurate long-read sequence data on genome assemblies across 6750 plant and animal genomes. For this broader comparison, we used HiFi data as a surrogate for highly accurate long-reads broadly as we could identify when they were used from GenBank metadata.Results:HiFi reads outperformed ONT reads in all assembly metrics tested for the caddisfly data set and allowed for accurate assembly of the repetitive ~ 20 Kb H-fibroin gene. Across plants and animals, genome assemblies that incorporated HiFi reads were also more contiguous. For plants, the average HiFi assembly was 501% more contiguous (mean contig N50 = 20.5 Mb) than those generated with any other long-read data (mean contig N50 = 4.1 Mb). For animals, HiFi assemblies were 226% more contiguous (mean contig N50 = 20.9 Mb) versus other long-read assemblies (mean contig N50 = 9.3 Mb). In plants, we also found limited evidence that HiFi may offer a unique solution for overcoming genomic complexity that scales with assembly size.Conclusions:Highly accurate long-reads generated with HiFi or analogous technologies represent a key tool for maximizing genome assembly quality for a wide swath of plants and animals. This finding is particularly important when resources only allow for one type of sequencing data to be generated. Ultimately, to realize the promise of biodiversity genomics, we call for greater uptake of highly accurate long-reads in future studies.",36927511,PMC10018877,10.1186/s12864-023-09193-9,4
Whole-genome sequencing with long reads reveals complex structure and origin of structural variation in human genetic variations and somatic mutations in cancer,"Background:Identification of germline variation and somatic mutations is a major issue in human genetics. However, due to the limitations of DNA sequencing technologies and computational algorithms, our understanding of genetic variation and somatic mutations is far from complete.Methods:In the present study, we performed whole-genome sequencing using long-read sequencing technology (Oxford Nanopore) for 11 Japanese liver cancers and matched normal samples which were previously sequenced for the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC). We constructed an analysis pipeline for the long-read data and identified germline and somatic structural variations (SVs).Results:In polymorphic germline SVs, our analysis identified 8004 insertions, 6389 deletions, 27 inversions, and 32 intra-chromosomal translocations. By comparing to the chimpanzee genome, we correctly inferred events that caused insertions and deletions and found that most insertions were caused by transposons and Alu is the most predominant source, while other types of insertions, such as tandem duplications and processed pseudogenes, are rare. We inferred mechanisms of deletion generations and found that most non-allelic homolog recombination (NAHR) events were caused by recombination errors in SINEs. Analysis of somatic mutations in liver cancers showed that long reads could detect larger numbers of SVs than a previous short-read study and that mechanisms of cancer SV generation were different from that of germline deletions.Conclusions:Our analysis provides a comprehensive catalog of polymorphic and somatic SVs, as well as their possible causes. Our software are available at https://github.com/afujimoto/CAMPHOR and https://github.com/afujimoto/CAMPHORsomatic .",33910608,PMC8082928,10.1186/s13073-021-00883-1,31
Precise characterization of somatic complex structural variations from tumor/control paired long-read sequencing data with nanomonsv,"We present our novel software, nanomonsv, for detecting somatic structural variations (SVs) using tumor and matched control long-read sequencing data with a single-base resolution. The current version of nanomonsv includes two detection modules, Canonical SV module, and Single breakend SV module. Using tumor/control paired long-read sequencing data from three cancer and their matched lymphoblastoid lines, we demonstrate that Canonical SV module can identify somatic SVs that can be captured by short-read technologies with higher precision and recall than existing methods. In addition, we have developed a workflow to classify mobile element insertions while elucidating their in-depth properties, such as 5' truncations, internal inversions, as well as source sites for 3' transductions. Furthermore, Single breakend SV module enables the detection of complex SVs that can only be identified by long-reads, such as SVs involving highly-repetitive centromeric sequences, and LINE1- and virus-mediated rearrangements. In summary, our approaches applied to cancer long-read sequencing data can reveal various features of somatic SVs and will lead to a better understanding of mutational processes and functional consequences of somatic SVs.",37336583,PMC10415145,10.1093/nar/gkad526,12
Generating long-read sequences using Oxford Nanopore Technology from Diospyros celebica genomic DNA,"Objectives:Development of sequencing technology has opened up vast opportunities for tree genomic research in the tropics. One of the aforesaid technologies named ONT (Oxford Nanopore Technology) has attracted researchers in undertaking testings and experiments due to its affordability and accessibility. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no published reports on the use of ONT for genomic analysis of Indonesian tree species. This progress is promising for further improvement in order to acquire more genomic data for research purposes. Therefore, the present study was carried out to determine the effectiveness of ONT in generating long-read DNA sequences using DNA isolated from leaves and wood cores of Macassar ebony (Diospyros celebica Bakh.).Data description:Long-read sequences data of leaves and wood cores of Macassar ebony were generated by using the MinION device and MinKnow v3.6.5 (ONT). The obtained data, as the first long-read sequence dataset for Macassar ebony, is of great importance to conserve the genetic diversity, understanding the molecular mechanism, and sustainable use of plant genetic resources for downstream applications.",33640010,PMC7913452,10.1186/s13104-021-05484-0,1
Harnessing the MinION: An example of how to establish long-read sequencing in a laboratory using challenging plant tissue from Eucalyptus pauciflora,"Long-read sequencing technologies are transforming our ability to assemble highly complex genomes. Realizing their full potential is critically reliant on extracting high-quality, high-molecular-weight (HMW) DNA from the organisms of interest. This is especially the case for the portable MinION sequencer which enables all laboratories to undertake their own genome sequencing projects, due to its low entry cost and minimal spatial footprint. One challenge of the MinION is that each group has to independently establish effective protocols for using the instrument, which can be time-consuming and costly. Here, we present a workflow and protocols that enabled us to establish MinION sequencing in our own laboratories, based on optimizing DNA extraction from a challenging plant tissue as a case study. Following the workflow illustrated, we were able to reliably and repeatedly obtain >6.5 Gb of long-read sequencing data with a mean read length of 13 kb and an N50 of 26 kb. Our protocols are open source and can be performed in any laboratory without special equipment. We also illustrate some more elaborate workflows which can increase mean and average read lengths if this is desired. We envision that our workflow for establishing MinION sequencing, including the illustration of potential pitfalls and suggestions of how to adapt it to other tissue types, will be useful to others who plan to establish long-read sequencing in their own laboratories.",30118581,PMC7380007,10.1111/1755-0998.12938,30
Assessing the Resilience of Machine Learning Classification Algorithms on SARS-CoV-2 Genome Sequences Generated with Long-Read Specific Errors,"The emergence of third-generation single-molecule sequencing (TGS) technology has revolutionized the generation of long reads, which are essential for genome assembly and have been widely employed in sequencing the SARS-CoV-2 virus during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although long-read sequencing has been crucial in understanding the evolution and transmission of the virus, the high error rate associated with these reads can lead to inadequate genome assembly and downstream biological interpretation. In this study, we evaluate the accuracy and robustness of machine learning (ML) models using six different embedding techniques on SARS-CoV-2 error-incorporated genome sequences. Our analysis includes two types of error-incorporated genome sequences: those generated using simulation tools to emulate error profiles of long-read sequencing platforms and those generated by introducing random errors. We show that the spacedk-mers embedding method achieves high accuracy in classifying error-free SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences, and the spacedk-mers and weightedk-mers embedding methods are highly accurate in predicting error-incorporated sequences. The fixed-length vectors generated by these methods contribute to the high accuracy achieved. Our study provides valuable insights for researchers to effectively evaluate ML models and gain a better understanding of the approach for accurate identification of critical SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences.",37371514,PMC10296223,10.3390/biom13060934,0
Integration of hybrid and self-correction method improves the quality of long-read sequencing data,"Third-generation sequencing (TGS) technologies have revolutionized genome science in the past decade. However, the long-read data produced by TGS platforms suffer from a much higher error rate than that of the previous technologies, thus complicating the downstream analysis. Several error correction tools for long-read data have been developed; these tools can be categorized into hybrid and self-correction tools. So far, these two types of tools are separately investigated, and their interplay remains understudied. Here, we integrate hybrid and self-correction methods for high-quality error correction. Our procedure leverages the inter-similarity between long-read data and high-accuracy information from short reads. We compare the performance of our method and state-of-the-art error correction tools on Escherichia coli and Arabidopsis thaliana datasets. The result shows that the integration approach outperformed the existing error correction methods and holds promise for improving the quality of downstream analyses in genomic research.",37340778,,10.1093/bfgp/elad026,0
Lerna: transformer architectures for configuring error correction tools for short- and long-read genome sequencing,"Background:Sequencing technologies are prone to errors, making error correction (EC) necessary for downstream applications. EC tools need to be manually configured for optimal performance. We find that the optimal parameters (e.g., k-mer size) are both tool- and dataset-dependent. Moreover, evaluating the performance (i.e., Alignment-rate or Gain) of a given tool usually relies on a reference genome, but quality reference genomes are not always available. We introduce Lerna for the automated configuration of k-mer-based EC tools. Lerna first creates a language model (LM) of the uncorrected genomic reads, and then, based on this LM, calculates a metric called the perplexity metric to evaluate the corrected reads for different parameter choices. Next, it finds the one that produces the highest alignment rate without using a reference genome. The fundamental intuition of our approach is that the perplexity metric is inversely correlated with the quality of the assembly after error correction. Therefore, Lerna leverages the perplexity metric for automated tuning of k-mer sizes without needing a reference genome.Results:First, we show that the best k-mer value can vary for different datasets, even for the same EC tool. This motivates our design that automates k-mer size selection without using a reference genome. Second, we show the gains of our LM using its component attention-based transformers. We show the model's estimation of the perplexity metric before and after error correction. The lower the perplexity after correction, the better the k-mer size. We also show that the alignment rate and assembly quality computed for the corrected reads are strongly negatively correlated with the perplexity, enabling the automated selection of k-mer values for better error correction, and hence, improved assembly quality. We validate our approach on both short and long reads. Additionally, we show that our attention-based models have significant runtime improvement for the entire pipeline-18[Formula: see text] faster than previous works, due to parallelizing the attention mechanism and the use of JIT compilation for GPU inferencing.Conclusion:Lerna improves de novo genome assembly by optimizing EC tools. Our code is made available in a public repository at: https://github.com/icanforce/lerna-genomics .",34991450,PMC8734100,10.1186/s12859-021-04547-0,3
Improved assembly of noisy long reads by k-mer validation,"Genome assembly depends critically on read length. Two recent technologies, from Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and Oxford Nanopore, produce read lengths >20 kb, which yield de novo genome assemblies with vastly greater contiguity than those based on Sanger, Illumina, or other technologies. However, the very high error rates of these two new technologies (∼15% per base) makes assembly imprecise at repeats longer than the read length and computationally expensive. Here we show that the contiguity and quality of the assembly of these noisy long reads can be significantly improved at a minimal cost, by leveraging on the low error rate and low cost of Illumina short reads. Namely, k-mers from the PacBio raw reads that are not present in Illumina reads (which account for ∼95% of the distinct k-mers) are deemed sequencing errors and ignored at the seed alignment step. By focusing on the ∼5% of k-mers that are error free, read overlap sensitivity is dramatically increased. Of equal importance, the validation procedure can be extended to exclude repetitive k-mers, which prevents read miscorrection at repeats and further improves the resulting assemblies. We tested the k-mer validation procedure using one long-read technology (PacBio) and one assembler (MHAP/Celera Assembler), but it is very likely to yield analogous improvements with alternative long-read technologies and assemblers, such as Oxford Nanopore and BLASR/DALIGNER/Falcon, respectively.",27831497,PMC5131822,10.1101/gr.209247.116,13
Efficient iterative Hi-C scaffolder based on N-best neighbors,"Background:Efficient and effective genome scaffolding tools are still in high demand for generating reference-quality assemblies. While long read data itself is unlikely to create a chromosome-scale assembly for most eukaryotic species, the inexpensive Hi-C sequencing technology, capable of capturing the chromosomal profile of a genome, is now widely used to complete the task. However, the existing Hi-C based scaffolding tools either require a priori chromosome number as input, or lack the ability to build highly continuous scaffolds.Results:We design and develop a novel Hi-C based scaffolding tool, pin_hic, which takes advantage of contact information from Hi-C reads to construct a scaffolding graph iteratively based on N-best neighbors of contigs. Subsequent to scaffolding, it identifies potential misjoins and breaks them to keep the scaffolding accuracy. Through our tests on three long read based de novo assemblies from three different species, we demonstrate that pin_hic is more efficient than current standard state-of-art tools, and it can generate much more continuous scaffolds, while achieving a higher or comparable accuracy.Conclusions:Pin_hic is an efficient Hi-C based scaffolding tool, which can be useful for building chromosome-scale assemblies. As many sequencing projects have been launched in the recent years, we believe pin_hic has potential to be applied in these projects and makes a meaningful contribution.",34837944,PMC8627104,10.1186/s12859-021-04453-5,8
Long-read only assembly of Drechmeria coniospora genomes reveals widespread chromosome plasticity and illustrates the limitations of current nanopore methods,"Background:Long-read sequencing is increasingly being used to determine eukaryotic genomes. We used nanopore technology to generate chromosome-level assemblies for 3 different strains of Drechmeria coniospora, a nematophagous fungus used extensively in the study of innate immunity in Caenorhabditis elegans.Results:One natural geographical isolate demonstrated high stability over decades, whereas a second isolate not only had a profoundly altered genome structure but exhibited extensive instability. We conducted an in-depth analysis of sequence errors within the 3 genomes and established that even with state-of-the-art tools, nanopore methods alone are insufficient to generate eukaryotic genome sequences of sufficient accuracy to merit inclusion in public databases.Conclusions:Although nanopore long-read sequencing is not accurate enough to produce publishable eukaryotic genomes, in our case, it has revealed new information about genome plasticity in D. coniospora and provided a backbone that will permit future detailed study to characterize gene evolution in this important model fungal pathogen.",32947622,PMC7500977,10.1093/gigascience/giaa099,4

Assessment of low-coverage nanopore long read sequencing for SNP genotyping in doubled haploid canola (Brassica napus L.),"Despite the high accuracy of short read sequencing (SRS), there are still issues with attaining accurate single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotypes at low sequencing coverage and in highly duplicated genomes due to misalignment. Long read sequencing (LRS) systems, including the Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) minION, have become popular options for de novo genome assembly and structural variant characterisation. The current high error rate often requires substantial post-sequencing correction and would appear to prevent the adoption of this system for SNP genotyping, but nanopore sequencing errors are largely random. Using low coverage ONT minION sequencing for genotyping of pre-validated SNP loci was examined in 9 canola doubled haploids. The minION genotypes were compared to the Illumina sequences to determine the extent and nature of genotype discrepancies between the two systems. The significant increase in read length improved alignment to the genome and the absence of classical SRS biases results in a more even representation of the genome. Sequencing errors are present, primarily in the form of heterozygous genotypes, which can be removed in completely homozygous backgrounds but requires more advanced bioinformatics in heterozygous genomes. Developments in this technology are promising for routine genotyping in the future.",31213642,PMC6582154,10.1038/s41598-019-45131-0,9
Sequencing of mRNA from Whole Blood using Nanopore Sequencing,"Sequencing in remote locations and resource-poor settings presents unique challenges. Nanopore sequencing can be successfully used under such conditions, and was deployed to West Africa during the recent Ebola virus epidemic, highlighting this possibility. In addition to its practical advantages (low cost, ease of equipment transport and use), this technology also provides fundamental advantages over second-generation sequencing approaches, particularly the very long read length, ability to directly sequence RNA, and real-time availability of data. Raw read accuracy is lower than with other sequencing platforms, which represents the main limitation of this technology; however, this can be partially mitigated by the high read depth generated. Here, we present a field-compatible protocol for sequencing of the mRNAs encoding for Niemann-Pick C1, which is the cellular receptor for ebolaviruses. This protocol encompasses extraction of RNA from animal blood samples, followed by RT-PCR for target enrichment, barcoding, library preparation, and the sequencing run itself, and can be easily adapted for use with other DNA or RNA targets.",31205309,,10.3791/59377,2
Genome assembly using Nanopore-guided long and error-free DNA reads,"Background:Long-read sequencing technologies were launched a few years ago, and in contrast with short-read sequencing technologies, they offered a promise of solving assembly problems for large and complex genomes. Moreover by providing long-range information, it could also solve haplotype phasing. However, existing long-read technologies still have several limitations that complicate their use for most research laboratories, as well as in large and/or complex genome projects. In 2014, Oxford Nanopore released the MinION® device, a small and low-cost single-molecule nanopore sequencer, which offers the possibility of sequencing long DNA fragments.Results:The assembly of long reads generated using the Oxford Nanopore MinION® instrument is challenging as existing assemblers were not implemented to deal with long reads exhibiting close to 30% of errors. Here, we presented a hybrid approach developed to take advantage of data generated using MinION® device. We sequenced a well-known bacterium, Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1 and applied our method to obtain a highly contiguous (one single contig) and accurate genome assembly even in repetitive regions, in contrast to an Illumina-only assembly. Our hybrid strategy was able to generate NaS (Nanopore Synthetic-long) reads up to 60 kb that aligned entirely and with no error to the reference genome and that spanned highly conserved repetitive regions. The average accuracy of NaS reads reached 99.99% without losing the initial size of the input MinION® reads.Conclusions:We described NaS tool, a hybrid approach allowing the sequencing of microbial genomes using the MinION® device. Our method, based ideally on 20x and 50x of NaS and Illumina reads respectively, provides an efficient and cost-effective way of sequencing microbial or small eukaryotic genomes in a very short time even in small facilities. Moreover, we demonstrated that although the Oxford Nanopore technology is a relatively new sequencing technology, currently with a high error rate, it is already useful in the generation of high-quality genome assemblies.",25927464,PMC4460631,10.1186/s12864-015-1519-z,69
Recovery of small plasmid sequences via Oxford Nanopore sequencing,"Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing platforms currently offer two approaches to whole-genome native-DNA library preparation: ligation and rapid. In this study, we compared these two approaches for bacterial whole-genome sequencing, with a specific aim of assessing their ability to recover small plasmid sequences. To do so, we sequenced DNA from seven plasmid-rich bacterial isolates in three different ways: ONT ligation, ONT rapid and Illumina. Using the Illumina read depths to approximate true plasmid abundance, we found that small plasmids (<20 kbp) were underrepresented in ONT ligation read sets (by a mean factor of ~4) but were not underrepresented in ONT rapid read sets. This effect correlated with plasmid size, with the smallest plasmids being the most underrepresented in ONT ligation read sets. We also found lower rates of chimaeric reads in the rapid read sets relative to ligation read sets. These results show that when small plasmid recovery is important, ONT rapid library preparations are preferable to ligation-based protocols.",34431763,PMC8549360,10.1099/mgen.0.000631,37
The SEQC2 epigenomics quality control (EpiQC) study,"Background:Cytosine modifications in DNA such as 5-methylcytosine (5mC) underlie a broad range of developmental processes, maintain cellular lineage specification, and can define or stratify types of cancer and other diseases. However, the wide variety of approaches available to interrogate these modifications has created a need for harmonized materials, methods, and rigorous benchmarking to improve genome-wide methylome sequencing applications in clinical and basic research. Here, we present a multi-platform assessment and cross-validated resource for epigenetics research from the FDA's Epigenomics Quality Control Group.Results:Each sample is processed in multiple replicates by three whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) protocols (TruSeq DNA methylation, Accel-NGS MethylSeq, and SPLAT), oxidative bisulfite sequencing (TrueMethyl), enzymatic deamination method (EMSeq), targeted methylation sequencing (Illumina Methyl Capture EPIC), single-molecule long-read nanopore sequencing from Oxford Nanopore Technologies, and 850k Illumina methylation arrays. After rigorous quality assessment and comparison to Illumina EPIC methylation microarrays and testing on a range of algorithms (Bismark, BitmapperBS, bwa-meth, and BitMapperBS), we find overall high concordance between assays, but also differences in efficiency of read mapping, CpG capture, coverage, and platform performance, and variable performance across 26 microarray normalization algorithms.Conclusions:The data provided herein can guide the use of these DNA reference materials in epigenomics research, as well as provide best practices for experimental design in future studies. By leveraging seven human cell lines that are designated as publicly available reference materials, these data can be used as a baseline to advance epigenomics research.",34872606,PMC8650396,10.1186/s13059-021-02529-2,15
Era of gapless plant genomes: innovations in sequencing and mapping technologies revolutionize genomics and breeding,"Whole-genome sequencing and assembly have revolutionized plant genetics and molecular biology over the last two decades. However, significant shortcomings in first- and second-generation technology resulted in imperfect reference genomes: numerous and large gaps of low quality or undeterminable sequence in areas of highly repetitive DNA along with limited chromosomal phasing restricted the ability of researchers to characterize regulatory noncoding elements and genic regions that underwent recent duplication events. Recently, advances in long-read sequencing have resulted in the first gapless, telomere-to-telomere (T2T) assemblies of plant genomes. This leap forward has the potential to increase the speed and confidence of genomics and molecular experimentation while reducing costs for the research community.",36640454,PMC9899316,10.1016/j.copbio.2022.102886,6
Nanopore direct RNA sequencing detects DUX4-activated repeats and isoforms in human muscle cells,"Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is an inherited muscle disease caused by misexpression of the DUX4 gene in skeletal muscle. DUX4 is a transcription factor, which is normally expressed in the cleavage-stage embryo and regulates gene expression involved in early embryonic development. Recent studies revealed that DUX4 also activates the transcription of repetitive elements such as endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), mammalian apparent long terminal repeat (LTR)-retrotransposons and pericentromeric satellite repeats (Human Satellite II). DUX4-bound ERV sequences also create alternative promoters for genes or long non-coding RNAs, producing fusion transcripts. To further understand transcriptional regulation by DUX4, we performed nanopore long-read direct RNA sequencing (dRNA-seq) of human muscle cells induced by DUX4, because long reads show whole isoforms with greater confidence. We successfully detected differential expression of known DUX4-induced genes and discovered 61 differentially expressed repeat loci, which are near DUX4-ChIP peaks. We also identified 247 gene-ERV fusion transcripts, of which 216 were not reported previously. In addition, long-read dRNA-seq clearly shows that RNA splicing is a common event in DUX4-activated ERV transcripts. Long-read analysis showed non-LTR transposons including Alu elements are also transcribed from LTRs. Our findings revealed further complexity of DUX4-induced ERV transcripts. This catalogue of DUX4-activated repetitive elements may provide useful information to elucidate the pathology of FSHD. Also, our results indicate that nanopore dRNA-seq has complementary strengths to conventional short-read complementary DNA sequencing.",33693705,PMC8120133,10.1093/hmg/ddab063,11
lordFAST: sensitive and Fast Alignment Search Tool for LOng noisy Read sequencing Data,"Motivation:Recent advances in genomics and precision medicine have been made possible through the application of high throughput sequencing (HTS) to large collections of human genomes. Although HTS technologies have proven their use in cataloging human genome variation, computational analysis of the data they generate is still far from being perfect. The main limitation of Illumina and other popular sequencing technologies is their short read length relative to the lengths of (common) genomic repeats. Newer (single molecule sequencing - SMS) technologies such as Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore are producing longer reads, making it theoretically possible to overcome the difficulties imposed by repeat regions. Unfortunately, because of their high sequencing error rate, reads generated by these technologies are very difficult to work with and cannot be used in many of the standard downstream analysis pipelines. Note that it is not only difficult to find the correct mapping locations of such reads in a reference genome, but also to establish their correct alignment so as to differentiate sequencing errors from real genomic variants. Furthermore, especially since newer SMS instruments provide higher throughput, mapping and alignment need to be performed much faster than before, maintaining high sensitivity.Results:We introduce lordFAST, a novel long-read mapper that is specifically designed to align reads generated by PacBio and potentially other SMS technologies to a reference. lordFAST not only has higher sensitivity than the available alternatives, it is also among the fastest and has a very low memory footprint.Availability and implementation:lordFAST is implemented in C++ and supports multi-threading.

Analysis of the transgene insertion pattern in a transgenic mouse strain using long-read sequencing,"Transgene insertion patterns are critical for the analysis of transgenic animals because the influence of transgenes may change depending on the insertion pattern (such as copy numbers and orientations of concatenations) and the insertion position in the genome. We previously reported a genomic walking strategy to locate transgenes in the genomes of transgenic mice (Exp. Anim. 53: 103-111, 2004) and to analyze transgene insertion patterns (Exp. Anim. 55: 65-69, 2006). With such strategies, however, we could not determine the copy number of transgenes or global genome modification induced by transgene insertion due to read-length limitation. In this study, we used a long-read sequencer (MinION, Oxford Nanopore Technologies) to overcome this limitation. We obtained 922,210 reads using MinION with genomic DNA from a transgenic mouse strain (4C30, Proc. Jpn. Acad. Ser. B. Phys. Biol. Sci. 87: 550-562, 2011). Among the reads, we found one 21,457-bp read containing the transgene using a local BLAST search. Nucleotide dot plot analysis revealed that the transgene was inserted in the genome as a tandem concatemer with an almost entire construct (15-3,508 of 3,508 bp) and a partial fragment (4-660, 657 bp). Ensembl's BLAST search against the C57BL/6N genome revealed a 9,388-bp deletion at the insertion position in the intron of the Sgcd gene, confirming that mutations such as a large genomic deletion could occur at the time of transgene insertion. Thus, long-read sequencers are useful tools for the analysis of transgene insertion patterns.",32051389,PMC7445054,10.1538/expanim.19-0118,6
Genome assembly from synthetic long read clouds,"Motivation:Despite rapid progress in sequencing technology, assembling de novo the genomes of new species as well as reconstructing complex metagenomes remains major technological challenges. New synthetic long read (SLR) technologies promise significant advances towards these goals; however, their applicability is limited by high sequencing requirements and the inability of current assembly paradigms to cope with combinations of short and long reads.Results:Here, we introduce Architect, a new de novo scaffolder aimed at SLR technologies. Unlike previous assembly strategies, Architect does not require a costly subassembly step; instead it assembles genomes directly from the SLR's underlying short reads, which we refer to as read clouds This enables a 4- to 20-fold reduction in sequencing requirements and a 5-fold increase in assembly contiguity on both genomic and metagenomic datasets relative to state-of-the-art assembly strategies aimed directly at fully subassembled long reads.Availability and implementation:Our source code is freely available at https://github.com/kuleshov/architectContact:kuleshov@stanford.edu.",27307620,PMC4908351,10.1093/bioinformatics/btw267,16
Y chromosome sequence and epigenomic reconstruction across human populations,"Recent advances in long-read sequencing technologies have allowed the generation and curation of more complete genome assemblies, enabling the analysis of traditionally neglected chromosomes, such as the human Y chromosome (chrY). Native DNA was sequenced on a MinION Oxford Nanopore Technologies sequencing device to generate genome assemblies for seven major chrY human haplogroups. We analyzed and compared the chrY enrichment of sequencing data obtained using two different selective sequencing approaches: adaptive sampling and flow cytometry chromosome sorting. We show that adaptive sampling can produce data to create assemblies comparable to chromosome sorting while being a less expensive and time-consuming technique. We also assessed haplogroup-specific structural variants, which would be otherwise difficult to study using short-read sequencing data only. Finally, we took advantage of this technology to detect and profile epigenetic modifications among the considered haplogroups. Altogether, we provide a framework to study complex genomic regions with a simple, fast, and affordable methodology that could be applied to larger population genomics datasets.",37296226,PMC10256797,10.1038/s42003-023-05004-9,0
Multi-locus and long amplicon sequencing approach to study microbial diversity at species level using the MinION™ portable nanopore sequencer,"The miniaturized and portable DNA sequencer MinION™ has demonstrated great potential in different analyses such as genome-wide sequencing, pathogen outbreak detection and surveillance, human genome variability, and microbial diversity. In this study, we tested the ability of the MinION™ platform to perform long amplicon sequencing in order to design new approaches to study microbial diversity using a multi-locus approach. After compiling a robust database by parsing and extracting the rrn bacterial region from more than 67000 complete or draft bacterial genomes, we demonstrated that the data obtained during sequencing of the long amplicon in the MinION™ device using R9 and R9.4 chemistries were sufficient to study 2 mock microbial communities in a multiplex manner and to almost completely reconstruct the microbial diversity contained in the HM782D and D6305 mock communities. Although nanopore-based sequencing produces reads with lower per-base accuracy compared with other platforms, we presented a novel approach consisting of multi-locus and long amplicon sequencing using the MinION™ MkIb DNA sequencer and R9 and R9.4 chemistries that help to overcome the main disadvantage of this portable sequencing platform. Furthermore, the nanopore sequencing library, constructed with the last releases of pore chemistry (R9.4) and sequencing kit (SQK-LSK108), permitted the retrieval of the higher level of 1D read accuracy sufficient to characterize the microbial species present in each mock community analysed. Improvements in nanopore chemistry, such as minimizing base-calling errors and new library protocols able to produce rapid 1D libraries, will provide more reliable information in the near future. Such data will be useful for more comprehensive and faster specific detection of microbial species and strains in complex ecosystems.",28605506,PMC5534310,10.1093/gigascience/gix043,42
Technical note: overcoming host contamination in bovine vaginal metagenomic samples with nanopore adaptive sequencing,"Animal metagenomic studies, in which host-associated microbiomes are profiled, are an increasingly important contribution to our understanding of the physiological functions, health and susceptibility to diseases of livestock. One of the major challenges in these studies is host DNA contamination, which limits the sequencing capacity for metagenomic content and reduces the accuracy of metagenomic profiling. This is the first study comparing the effectiveness of different sequencing methods for profiling bovine vaginal metagenomic samples. We compared the new method of Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) adaptive sequencing, which can be used to target or eliminate defined genetic sequences, to standard ONT sequencing, Illumina 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing, and Illumina shotgun sequencing. The efficiency of each method in recovering the metagenomic data and recalling the metagenomic profiles was assessed. ONT adaptive sequencing yielded a higher amount of metagenomic data than the other methods per 1 Gb of sequence data. The increased sequencing efficiency of ONT adaptive sequencing consequently reduced the amount of raw data needed to provide sufficient coverage for the metagenomic samples with high host-to-microbe DNA ratio. Additionally, the long reads generated by ONT adaptive sequencing retained the continuity of read information, which benefited the in-depth annotations for both taxonomical and functional profiles of the metagenome. The different methods resulted in the identification of different taxa. Genera Clostridium, which was identified at low abundances and categorized under Order ""Unclassified Clostridiales"" when using the 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing method, was identified to be the dominant genera in the sample when sequenced with the three other methods. Additionally, higher numbers of annotated genes were identified with ONT adaptive sequencing, which also produced high coverage on most of the commonly annotated genes. This study illustrates the advantages of ONT adaptive sequencing in improving the amount of metagenomic data derived from microbiome samples with high host-to-microbe DNA ratio and the advantage of long reads in preserving intact information for accurate annotations.",34791313,PMC8722758,10.1093/jas/skab344,8
First record of a tandem-repeat region within the mitochondrial genome of Clonorchis sinensis using a long-read sequencing approach,"Background:Mitochondrial genomes provide useful genetic markers for systematic and population genetic studies of parasitic helminths. Although many such genome sequences have been published and deposited in public databases, there is evidence that some of them are incomplete relating to an inability of conventional techniques to reliably sequence non-coding (repetitive) regions. In the present study, we characterise the complete mitochondrial genome-including the long, non-coding region-of the carcinogenic Chinese liver fluke, Clonorchis sinensis, using long-read sequencing.Methods:The mitochondrial genome was sequenced from total high molecular-weight genomic DNA isolated from a pool of 100 adult worms of C. sinensis using the MinION sequencing platform (Oxford Nanopore Technologies), and assembled and annotated using an informatic approach.Results:From > 93,500 long-reads, we assembled a 18,304 bp-mitochondrial genome for C. sinensis. Within this genome we identified a novel non-coding region of 4,549 bp containing six tandem-repetitive units of 719-809 bp each. Given that genomic DNA from pooled worms was used for sequencing, some variability in length/sequence in this tandem-repetitive region was detectable, reflecting population variation.Conclusions:For C. sinensis, we report the complete mitochondrial genome, which includes a long (> 4.5 kb) tandem-repetitive region. The discovery of this non-coding region using a nanopore-sequencing/informatic approach now paves the way to investigating the nature and extent of length/sequence variation in this region within and among individual worms, both within and among C. sinensis populations, and to exploring whether this region has a functional role in the regulation of replication and transcription, akin to the mitochondrial control region in mammals. Although applied to C. sinensis, the technological approach established here should be broadly applicable to characterise complex tandem-repetitive or homo-polymeric regions in the mitochondrial genomes of a wide range of taxa.",32845881,PMC7449408,10.1371/journal.pntd.0008552,10
The Future of Livestock Management: A Review of Real-Time Portable Sequencing Applied to Livestock,"Oxford Nanopore Technologies' MinION has proven to be a valuable tool within human and microbial genetics. Its capacity to produce long reads in real time has opened up unique applications for portable sequencing. Examples include tracking the recent African swine fever outbreak in China and providing a diagnostic tool for disease in the cassava plant in Eastern Africa. Here we review the current applications of Oxford Nanopore sequencing in livestock, then focus on proposed applications in livestock agriculture for rapid diagnostics, base modification detection, reference genome assembly and genomic prediction. In particular, we propose a future application: 'crush-side genotyping' for real-time on-farm genotyping for extensive industries such as northern Australian beef production. An initial in silico experiment to assess the feasibility of crush-side genotyping demonstrated promising results. SNPs were called from simulated Nanopore data, that included the relatively high base call error rate that is characteristic of the data, and calling parameters were varied to understand the feasibility of SNP calling at low coverages in a heterozygous population. With optimised genotype calling parameters, over 85% of the 10,000 simulated SNPs were able to be correctly called with coverages as low as 6×. These results provide preliminary evidence that Oxford Nanopore sequencing has potential to be used for real-time SNP genotyping in extensive livestock operations.",33317066,PMC7763041,10.3390/genes11121478,7
Closing the gap: Oxford Nanopore Technologies R10 sequencing allows comparable results to Illumina sequencing for SNP-based outbreak investigation of bacterial pathogens,"Whole-genome sequencing has become the method of choice for bacterial outbreak investigation, with most clinical and public health laboratories currently routinely using short-read Illumina sequencing. Recently, long-read Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing has gained prominence and may offer advantages over short-read sequencing, particularly with the recent introduction of the R10 chemistry, which promises much lower error rates than the R9 chemistry. However, limited information is available on its performance for bacterial single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based outbreak investigation. We present an open-source workflow, Prokaryotic Awesome variant Calling Utility (PACU) (https://github.com/BioinformaticsPlatformWIV-ISP/PACU), for constructing SNP phylogenies using Illumina and/or ONT R9/R10 sequencing data. The workflow was evaluated using outbreak data sets of Shiga toxin-producingEscherichia coliandListeria monocytogenesby comparing ONT R9 and R10 with Illumina data. The performance of each sequencing technology was evaluated not only separately but also by integrating samples sequenced by different technologies/chemistries into the same phylogenomic analysis. Additionally, the minimum sequencing time required to obtain accurate phylogenetic results using nanopore sequencing was evaluated. PACU allowed accurate identification of outbreak clusters for both species using all technologies/chemistries, but ONT R9 results deviated slightly more from the Illumina results. ONT R10 results showed trends very similar to Illumina, and we found that integrating data sets sequenced by either Illumina or ONT R10 for different isolates into the same analysis produced stable and highly accurate phylogenomic results. The resulting phylogenies for these two outbreaks stabilized after ~20 hours of sequencing for ONT R9 and ~8 hours for ONT R10. This study provides a proof of concept for using ONT R10, either in isolation or in combination with Illumina, for rapid and accurate bacterial SNP-based outbreak investigation.",38441926,PMC11077942,10.1128/jcm.01576-23,1
MAECI: A pipeline for generating consensus sequence with nanopore sequencing long-read assembly and error correction,"Nanopore sequencing produces long reads and offers unique advantages over next-generation sequencing, especially for the assembly of draft bacterial genomes with improved completeness. However, assembly errors can occur due to data characteristics and assembly algorithms. To address these issues, we developed MAECI, a pipeline for generating consensus sequences from multiple assemblies of the same nanopore sequencing data and error correction. Systematic evaluation showed that MAECI is an efficient and effective pipeline to improve the accuracy and completeness of bacterial genome assemblies. The available codes and implementation are at https://github.com/langjidong/MAECI.",35594250,PMC9122195,10.1371/journal.pone.0267066,1
Nanopore and Illumina sequencing reveal different viral populations from human gut samples,"The advent of viral metagenomics, or viromics, has improved our knowledge and understanding of global viral diversity. High-throughput sequencing technologies enable explorations of the ecological roles, contributions to host metabolism, and the influence of viruses in various environments, including the human intestinal microbiome. However, bacterial metagenomic studies frequently have the advantage. The adoption of advanced technologies like long-read sequencing has the potential to be transformative in refining viromics and metagenomics. Here, we examined the effectiveness of long-read and hybrid sequencing by comparing Illumina short-read and Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) long-read sequencing technologies and different assembly strategies on recovering viral genomes from human faecal samples. Our findings showed that if a single sequencing technology is to be chosen for virome analysis, Illumina is preferable due to its superior ability to recover fully resolved viral genomes and minimise erroneous genomes. While ONT assemblies were effective in recovering viral diversity, the challenges related to input requirements and the necessity for amplification made it less ideal as a standalone solution. However, using a combined, hybrid approach enabled a more authentic representation of viral diversity to be obtained within samples.",38683195,PMC11092197,10.1099/mgen.0.001236,0
ECNano: A cost-effective workflow for target enrichment sequencing and accurate variant calling on 4800 clinically significant genes using a single MinION flowcell,"Background:The application of long-read sequencing using the Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) MinION sequencer is getting more diverse in the medical field. Having a high sequencing error of ONT and limited throughput from a single MinION flowcell, however, limits its applicability for accurate variant detection. Medical exome sequencing (MES) targets clinically significant exon regions, allowing rapid and comprehensive screening of pathogenic variants. By applying MES with MinION sequencing, the technology can achieve a more uniform capture of the target regions, shorter turnaround time, and lower sequencing cost per sample.Method:We introduced a cost-effective optimized workflow, ECNano, comprising a wet-lab protocol and bioinformatics analysis, for accurate variant detection at 4800 clinically important genes and regions using a single MinION flowcell. The ECNano wet-lab protocol was optimized to perform long-read target enrichment and ONT library preparation to stably generate high-quality MES data with adequate coverage. The subsequent variant-calling workflow, Clair-ensemble, adopted a fast RNN-based variant caller, Clair, and was optimized for target enrichment data. To evaluate its performance and practicality, ECNano was tested on both reference DNA samples and patient samples.Results:ECNano achieved deep on-target depth of coverage (DoC) at average > 100× and > 98% uniformity using one MinION flowcell. For accurate ONT variant calling, the generated reads sufficiently covered 98.9% of pathogenic positions listed in ClinVar, with 98.96% having at least 30× DoC. ECNano obtained an average read length of 1000 bp. The long reads of ECNano also covered the adjacent splice sites well, with 98.5% of positions having ≥ 30× DoC. Clair-ensemble achieved > 99% recall and accuracy for SNV calling. The whole workflow from wet-lab protocol to variant detection was completed within three days.Conclusion:We presented ECNano, an out-of-the-box workflow comprising (1) a wet-lab protocol for ONT target enrichment sequencing and (2) a downstream variant detection workflow, Clair-ensemble. The workflow is cost-effective, with a short turnaround time for high accuracy variant calling in 4800 clinically significant genes and regions using a single MinION flowcell. The long-read exon captured data has potential for further development, promoting the application of long-read sequencing in personalized disease treatment and risk prediction.",35246132,PMC8895767,10.1186/s12920-022-01190-3,5
Unicycler: Resolving bacterial genome assemblies from short and long sequencing reads,"The Illumina DNA sequencing platform generates accurate but short reads, which can be used to produce accurate but fragmented genome assemblies. Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore Technologies DNA sequencing platforms generate long reads that can produce complete genome assemblies, but the sequencing is more expensive and error-prone. There is significant interest in combining data from these complementary sequencing technologies to generate more accurate ""hybrid"" assemblies. However, few tools exist that truly leverage the benefits of both types of data, namely the accuracy of short reads and the structural resolving power of long reads. Here we present Unicycler, a new tool for assembling bacterial genomes from a combination of short and long reads, which produces assemblies that are accurate, complete and cost-effective. Unicycler builds an initial assembly graph from short reads using the de novo assembler SPAdes and then simplifies the graph using information from short and long reads. Unicycler uses a novel semi-global aligner to align long reads to the assembly graph. Tests on both synthetic and real reads show Unicycler can assemble larger contigs with fewer misassemblies than other hybrid assemblers, even when long-read depth and accuracy are low. Unicycler is open source (GPLv3) and available at github.com/rrwick/Unicycler.",28594827,PMC5481147,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005595,3212
DNA Modification Patterns Filtering and Analysis Using DNAModAnnot,"Mapping DNA modifications at the base resolution is now possible at the genome level thanks to advances in sequencing technologies. Long-read sequencing data can be used to identify modified base patterns. However, the downstream analysis of Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) or Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) data requires the integration of genomic annotation and comprehensive filtering to prevent the accumulation of artifact signals. We present in this chapter, a linear workflow to fully analyze modified base patterns using the DNA Modification Annotation (DNAModAnnot) package. This workflow includes a thorough filtering based on sequencing quality and false discovery rate estimation and provides tools for a global analysis of DNA modifications. Here, we provide an application example of this workflow with PacBio data and guide the user by explaining expected outputs via a fully integrated Rmarkdown script. This protocol is presented with tips showing how to adapt the provided code for annotating epigenomes of any organism according to the user needs.",36723811,,10.1007/978-1-0716-2962-8_7,0
Draft genome assemblies of the avian louse Brueelia nebulosa and its associates using long-read sequencing from an individual specimen,"Sequencing high molecular weight (HMW) DNA with long-read and linked-read technologies has promoted a major increase in more complete genome sequences for nonmodel organisms. Sequencing approaches that rely on HMW DNA have been limited to larger organisms or pools of multiple individuals, but recent advances have allowed for sequencing from individuals of small-bodied organisms. Here, we use HMW DNA sequencing with PacBio long reads and TELL-Seq linked reads to assemble and annotate the genome from a single individual feather louse (Brueelia nebulosa) from a European Starling (Sturnus vulgaris). We assembled a genome with a relatively high scaffold N50 (637 kb) and with BUSCO scores (96.1%) comparable to louse genomes assembled from pooled individuals. We annotated a number of genes (10,938) similar to the human louse (Pediculus humanus) genome. Additionally, calling phased variants revealed that the Brueelia genome is more heterozygous (∼1%) then expected for a highly obligate and dispersal-limited parasite. We also assembled and annotated the mitochondrial genome and primary endosymbiont (Sodalis) genome from the individual louse, which showed evidence for heteroplasmy in the mitogenome and a reduced genome size in the endosymbiont compared to its free-living relative. Our study is a valuable demonstration of the capability to obtain high-quality genomes from individual small, nonmodel organisms. Applying this approach to other organisms could greatly increase our understanding of the diversity and evolution of individual genomes.",36735822,PMC10085802,10.1093/g3journal/jkad030,2
ntJoin: Fast and lightweight assembly-guided scaffolding using minimizer graphs,"Summary:The ability to generate high-quality genome sequences is cornerstone to modern biological research. Even with recent advancements in sequencing technologies, many genome assemblies are still not achieving reference-grade. Here, we introduce ntJoin, a tool that leverages structural synteny between a draft assembly and reference sequence(s) to contiguate and correct the former with respect to the latter. Instead of alignments, ntJoin uses a lightweight mapping approach based on a graph data structure generated from ordered minimizer sketches. The tool can be used in a variety of different applications, including improving a draft assembly with a reference-grade genome, a short-read assembly with a draft long-read assembly and a draft assembly with an assembly from a closely related species. When scaffolding a human short-read assembly using the reference human genome or a long-read assembly, ntJoin improves the NGA50 length 23- and 13-fold, respectively, in under 13 m, using <11 GB of RAM. Compared to existing reference-guided scaffolders, ntJoin generates highly contiguous assemblies faster and using less memory.Availability and implementation:ntJoin is written in C++ and Python and is freely available at https://github.com/bcgsc/ntjoin.Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",32311025,PMC7320612,10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa253,13
Identifying and correcting repeat-calling errors in nanopore sequencing of telomeres,"Nanopore long-read sequencing is an emerging approach for studying genomes, including long repetitive elements like telomeres. Here, we report extensive basecalling induced errors at telomere repeats across nanopore datasets, sequencing platforms, basecallers, and basecalling models. We find that telomeres in many organisms are frequently miscalled. We demonstrate that tuning of nanopore basecalling models leads to improved recovery and analysis of telomeric regions, with minimal negative impact on other genomic regions. We highlight the importance of verifying nanopore basecalls in long, repetitive, and poorly defined regions, and showcase how artefacts can be resolved by improvements in nanopore basecalling models.",36028900,PMC9414165,10.1186/s13059-022-02751-6,21
Performance of neural network basecalling tools for Oxford Nanopore sequencing,"Background:Basecalling, the computational process of translating raw electrical signal to nucleotide sequence, is of critical importance to the sequencing platforms produced by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT). Here, we examine the performance of different basecalling tools, looking at accuracy at the level of bases within individual reads and at majority-rule consensus basecalls in an assembly. We also investigate some additional aspects of basecalling: training using a taxon-specific dataset, using a larger neural network model and improving consensus basecalls in an assembly by additional signal-level analysis with Nanopolish.Results:Training basecallers on taxon-specific data results in a significant boost in consensus accuracy, mostly due to the reduction of errors in methylation motifs. A larger neural network is able to improve both read and consensus accuracy, but at a cost to speed. Improving consensus sequences ('polishing') with Nanopolish somewhat negates the accuracy differences in basecallers, but pre-polish accuracy does have an effect on post-polish accuracy.Conclusions:Basecalling accuracy has seen significant improvements over the last 2 years. The current version of ONT's Guppy basecaller performs well overall, with good accuracy and fast performance. If higher accuracy is required, users should consider producing a custom model using a larger neural network and/or training data from the same species.",31234903,PMC6591954,10.1186/s13059-019-1727-y,506
Noise-cancelling repeat finder: uncovering tandem repeats in error-prone long-read sequencing data,"Summary:Tandem DNA repeats can be sequenced with long-read technologies, but cannot be accurately deciphered due to the lack of computational tools taking high error rates of these technologies into account. Here we introduce Noise-Cancelling Repeat Finder (NCRF) to uncover putative tandem repeats of specified motifs in noisy long reads produced by Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore sequencers. Using simulations, we validated the use of NCRF to locate tandem repeats with motifs of various lengths and demonstrated its superior performance as compared to two alternative tools. Using real human whole-genome sequencing data, NCRF identified long arrays of the (AATGG)n repeat involved in heat shock stress response.Availability and implementation:NCRF is implemented in C, supported by several python scripts, and is available in bioconda and at https://github.com/makovalab-psu/NoiseCancellingRepeatFinder.Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",31290946,PMC6853708,10.1093/bioinformatics/btz484,26
SPRING: a next-generation compressor for FASTQ data,"Motivation:High-Throughput Sequencing technologies produce huge amounts of data in the form of short genomic reads, associated quality values and read identifiers. Because of the significant structure present in these FASTQ datasets, general-purpose compressors are unable to completely exploit much of the inherent redundancy. Although there has been a lot of work on designing FASTQ compressors, most of them lack in support of one or more crucial properties, such as support for variable length reads, scalability to high coverage datasets, pairing-preserving compression and lossless compression.Results:In this work, we propose SPRING, a reference-free compressor for FASTQ files. SPRING supports a wide variety of compression modes and features, including lossless compression, pairing-preserving compression, lossy compression of quality values, long read compression and random access. SPRING achieves substantially better compression than existing tools, for example, SPRING compresses 195 GB of 25× whole genome human FASTQ from Illumina's NovaSeq sequencer to less than 7 GB, around 1.6× smaller than previous state-of-the-art FASTQ compressors. SPRING achieves this improvement while using comparable computational resources.Availability and implementation:SPRING can be downloaded from https://github.com/shubhamchandak94/SPRING.Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",30535063,PMC6662292,10.1093/bioinformatics/bty1015,14
BulkVis: a graphical viewer for Oxford nanopore bulk FAST5 files,"Motivation:The Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) MinION is used for sequencing a wide variety of sample types with diverse methods of sample extraction. Nanopore sequencers output FAST5 files containing signal data subsequently base called to FASTQ format. Optionally, ONT devices can collect data from all sequencing channels simultaneously in a bulk FAST5 file enabling inspection of signal in any channel at any point. We sought to visualize this signal to inspect challenging or difficult to sequence samples.Results:The BulkVis tool can load a bulk FAST5 file and overlays MinKNOW (the software that controls ONT sequencers) classifications on the signal trace and can show mappings to a reference. Users can navigate to a channel and time or, given a FASTQ header from a read, jump to its specific position. BulkVis can export regions as Nanopore base caller compatible reads. Using BulkVis, we find long reads can be incorrectly divided by MinKNOW resulting in single DNA molecules being split into two or more reads. The longest seen to date is 2 272 580 bases in length and reported in eleven consecutive reads. We provide helper scripts that identify and reconstruct split reads given a sequencing summary file and alignment to a reference. We note that incorrect read splitting appears to vary according to input sample type and is more common in 'ultra-long' read preparations.Availability and implementation:The software is available freely under an MIT license at https://github.com/LooseLab/bulkvis.Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",30462145,PMC6596899,10.1093/bioinformatics/bty841,137
Evaluation of Single-Molecule Sequencing Technologies for Structural Variant Detection in Two Swedish Human Genomes,"Long-read single molecule sequencing is increasingly used in human genomics research, as it allows to accurately detect large-scale DNA rearrangements such as structural variations (SVs) at high resolution. However, few studies have evaluated the performance of different single molecule sequencing platforms for SV detection in human samples. Here we performed Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) whole-genome sequencing of two Swedish human samples (average 32× coverage) and compared the results to previously generated Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) data for the same individuals (average 66× coverage). Our analysis inferred an average of 17k and 23k SVs from the ONT and PacBio data, respectively, with a majority of them overlapping with an available multi-platform SV dataset. When comparing the SV calls in the two Swedish individuals, we find a higher concordance between ONT and PacBio SVs detected in the same individual as compared to SVs detected by the same technology in different individuals. Downsampling of PacBio reads, performed to obtain similar coverage levels for all datasets, resulted in 17k SVs per individual and improved overlap with the ONT SVs. Our results suggest that ONT and PacBio have a similar performance for SV detection in human whole genome sequencing data, and that both technologies are feasible for population-scale studies.",33266238,PMC7760597,10.3390/genes11121444,2
Comparison of nine extraction methods for bacterial identification using the ONT MinION sequencer,"The Anthrax mailings bioterrorism attack in 2001 revealed the need for universal and rapid microbial forensic analyses on unknown biological evidence. However, the gold standard for bacterial identification includes culturing isolates, which is laborious. Molecular approaches for bacterial identification revolve around 16S ribosomal gene sequencing using Sanger or next generation sequencing (NGS) platforms, but these techniques are laboratory-based and can also be time-consuming. The Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) MinION sequencer can generate long read lengths that span the entire bacterial 16S rRNA gene and accurately identify the species level. This platform can be used in the field, allowing on-site evidence analysis. However, it requires higher quantities of pure DNA compared to other sequencing platforms; thus, the extraction method for bacterial DNA is critical for downstream analysis, which to date are tailored toward a priori knowledge of the species' taxonomic grouping. During an attack, the investigative team may not know what species they are handling; therefore, identifying an extraction method that can handle all bacterial groups and generate clean DNA for the MinION is useful for microbial forensic analysis. The purpose of this study was to identify a ""universal"" extraction method that can be coupled with ONT MinION sequencing for use in forensic situations for rapid identification. It also evaluated the cloud-based data analysis software provided by ONT, EPI2ME. No ""universal"" extraction method was identified as optimal for downstream MinION sequencing. However, the DNeasy PowerSoil Kit and Noda et al. Chelex-100 method gave comparable sequencing results and could be used as rapid extraction techniques. This study showed that the ONT 16S Barcoding Kit 1-24 coupled with the 16S FASTQ workflow might not be the best for use in forensic situations where species-level identification needs to be obtained, as most alignments were approximately 89% accurate. In all seven test organisms and nine extraction methods, accurate species identification was only obtained in 63% of the cases.",37775594,,10.1007/s00414-023-03092-0,0
"Resolution of dynamic MDR structures among the plasmidome of Salmonella using MinION single-molecule, long-read sequencing","Background:ISCR1 is an important mobile genetic element mediating the transfer of antibiotic resistance genes. Genetic diversity regarding distribution and copy numbers of ISCR1 within a bacterial population derived from an ancestral strain, which may reflect the degree of genetic plasticity conferred by such an element, has not been studied.Objectives:To investigate the plasmid heterogeneity in Salmonella conferred by ISCR1.Methods:Nanopore long-read and other sequencing technologies were used to resolve the structures harbouring different copies of ISCR1-qnrB6 from the perspective of single molecules.Results:Salmonella London Sa128 was positive for ISCR1-qnrB6 and harboured an MDR-encoding conjugative IncF plasmid, pSa128, containing a complex class 1 integron. The plasmid pSa128T from the transconjugant was larger compared with the original plasmid pSa128, presumably due to amplification of ISCR1-qnrB6. Single-molecule, long-read analysis indicated that both plasmids in the donor and transconjugant strains were in a heterogeneous state that contains variable numbers of ISCR1-qnrB6, with four and eight copies in single plasmids being the dominant types. This type of plasmid heterogeneity in populations of one strain can be regarded as an atypical plasmidome.Conclusions:This study highlights the importance of investigation of a single plasmid structure based on long-read sequencing technologies, with a focus on analysing the complex structures of the MDR region, which is expected to exhibit genetic polymorphism or plasmid heterogeneity in various MDR-encoding elements even among members of the same strain. The availability of a single-molecule sequencing technique represents a paradigm shift in the capability of performing population genetic analysis of antibiotic-resistant organisms.",29992309,,10.1093/jac/dky243,7
Analysis of transcripts and splice isoforms in Medicago sativa L. by single-molecule long-read sequencing,"The full-length transcriptome of alfalfa was analyzed with PacBio single-molecule long-read sequencing technology. The transcriptome data provided full-length sequences and gene isoforms of transcripts in alfalfa, which will improve genome annotation and enhance our understanding of the gene structure of alfalfa. As an important forage, alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) is world-wide planted. For its complexity of genome and unfinished whole genome sequencing, the sequences and complete structure of mRNA transcripts remain unclear in alfalfa. In this study, single-molecule long-read sequencing was applied to investigate the alfalfa transcriptome using the Pacific Biosciences platform, and a total of 113,321 transcripts were obtained from young, mature and senescent leaves. We identified 72,606 open reading frames including 46,616 full-length ORFs, 1670 transcription factors from 54 TF families and 44,040 simple sequence repeats from 30,797 sequences. A total of 7568 alternative splicing events was identified and the majority of alternative splicing events in alfalfa was intron retention. In addition, we identified 17,740 long non-coding RNAs. Our results show the feasibility of deep sequencing full-length RNA from alfalfa transcriptome on a single-molecule level.",30600412,,10.1007/s11103-018-0813-y,21
PBSIM2: a simulator for long-read sequencers with a novel generative model of quality scores,"Motivation:Recent advances in high-throughput long-read sequencers, such as PacBio and Oxford Nanopore sequencers, produce longer reads with more errors than short-read sequencers. In addition to the high error rates of reads, non-uniformity of errors leads to difficulties in various downstream analyses using long reads. Many useful simulators, which characterize long-read error patterns and simulate them, have been developed. However, there is still room for improvement in the simulation of the non-uniformity of errors.Results:To capture characteristics of errors in reads for long-read sequencers, here, we introduce a generative model for quality scores, in which a hidden Markov Model with a latest model selection method, called factorized information criteria, is utilized. We evaluated our developed simulator from various points, indicating that our simulator successfully simulates reads that are consistent with real reads.Availability and implementation:The source codes of PBSIM2 are freely available from https://github.com/yukiteruono/pbsim2.Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",32976553,PMC8097687,10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa835,40
Comparison of 6 DNA extraction methods for isolation of high yield of high molecular weight DNA suitable for shotgun metagenomics Nanopore sequencing to detect bacteria,"Background:Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) offers an accessible platform for long-read sequencing, which improves the reconstruction of genomes and helps to resolve complex genomic contexts, especially in the case of metagenome analysis. To take the best advantage of long-read sequencing, DNA extraction methods must be able to isolate pure high molecular weight (HMW) DNA from complex metagenomics samples, without introducing any bias. New methods released on the market, and protocols developed at the research level, were specifically designed for this application and need to be assessed.Results:In this study, with different bacterial cocktail mixes, analyzed as pure or spiked in a synthetic fecal matrix, we evaluated the performances of 6 DNA extraction methods using various cells lysis and purification techniques, from quick and easy, to more time-consuming and gentle protocols, including a portable method for on-site application. In addition to the comparison of the quality, quantity and purity of the extracted DNA, the performance obtained when doing Nanopore sequencing on a MinION flow cell was also tested. From the obtained results, the Quick-DNA HMW MagBead Kit (Zymo Research) was selected as producing the best yield of pure HMW DNA. Furthermore, this kit allowed an accurate detection, by Nanopore sequencing, of almost all the bacterial species present in a complex mock community.Conclusion:Amongst the 6 tested methods, the Quick-DNA HMW MagBead Kit (Zymo Research) was considered as the most suitable for Nanopore sequencing and would be recommended for bacterial metagenomics studies using this technology.",37537550,PMC10401787,10.1186/s12864-023-09537-5,3
"Sequencing Bait: Nuclear and Mitogenome Assembly of an Abundant Coastal Tropical and Subtropical Fish, Atherinomorus stipes","Genetic data from nonmodel species can inform ecology and physiology, giving insight into a species' distribution and abundance as well as their responses to changing environments, all of which are important for species conservation and management. Moreover, reduced sequencing costs and improved long-read sequencing technology allows researchers to readily generate genomic resources for nonmodel species. Here, we apply Oxford Nanopore long-read sequencing and low-coverage (∼1x) whole genome short-read sequencing technology (Illumina) to assemble a genome and examine population genetics of an abundant tropical and subtropical fish, the hardhead silverside (Atherinomorus stipes). These fish are found in shallow coastal waters and are frequently included in ecological models because they serve as abundant prey for commercially and ecologically important species. Despite their importance in sub-tropical and tropical ecosystems, little is known about their population connectivity and genetic diversity. Our A. stipes genome assembly is about 1.2 Gb with comparable repetitive element content (∼47%), number of protein duplication events, and DNA methylation patterns to other teleost fish species. Among five sampled populations spanning 43 km of South Florida and the Florida Keys, we find little population structure suggesting high population connectivity.",35866575,PMC9348626,10.1093/gbe/evac111,1
Assembly-free discovery of human novel sequences using long reads,"DNA sequences that are absent in the human reference genome are classified as novel sequences. The discovery of these missed sequences is crucial for exploring the genomic diversity of populations and understanding the genetic basis of human diseases. However, various DNA lengths of reads generated from different sequencing technologies can significantly affect the results of novel sequences. In this work, we designed an assembly-free novel sequence (AF-NS) approach to identify novel sequences from Oxford Nanopore Technology long reads. Among the newly detected sequences using AF-NS, more than 95% were omitted from those using long-read assemblers and 85% were not present in short reads of Illumina. We identified the common novel sequences among all the samples and revealed their association with the binding motifs of transcription factors. Regarding the placements of the novel sequences, we found about 70% enriched in repeat regions and generated 430 for one specific subpopulation that might be related to their evolution. Our study demonstrates the advance of the assembly-free approach to capture more novel sequences over other assembler based methods. Combining the long-read data with powerful analytical methods can be a robust way to improve the completeness of novel sequences.",36308393,PMC9700288,10.1093/dnares/dsac039,1
Highly efficient clustering of long-read transcriptomic data with GeLuster,"Motivation:The advancement of long-read RNA sequencing technologies leads to a bright future for transcriptome analysis, in which clustering long reads according to their gene family of origin is of great importance. However, existing de novo clustering algorithms require plenty of computing resources.Results:We developed a new algorithm GeLuster for clustering long RNA-seq reads. Based on our tests on one simulated dataset and nine real datasets, GeLuster exhibited superior performance. On the tested Nanopore datasets it ran 2.9-17.5 times as fast as the second-fastest method with less than one-seventh of memory consumption, while achieving higher clustering accuracy. And on the PacBio data, GeLuster also had a similar performance. It sets the stage for large-scale transcriptome study in future.Availability and implementation:GeLuster is freely available at https://github.com/yutingsdu/GeLuster.",38310330,PMC10881092,10.1093/bioinformatics/btae059,0
FLAS: fast and high-throughput algorithm for PacBio long-read self-correction,"Motivation:The third generation PacBio long reads have greatly facilitated sequencing projects with very large read lengths, but they contain about 15% sequencing errors and need error correction. For the projects with long reads only, it is challenging to make correction with fast speed, and also challenging to correct a sufficient amount of read bases, i.e. to achieve high-throughput self-correction. MECAT is currently among the fastest self-correction algorithms, but its throughput is relatively small (Xiao et al., 2017).Results:Here, we introduce FLAS, a wrapper algorithm of MECAT, to achieve high-throughput long-read self-correction while keeping MECAT's fast speed. FLAS finds additional alignments from MECAT prealigned long reads to improve the correction throughput, and removes misalignments for accuracy. In addition, FLAS also uses the corrected long-read regions to correct the uncorrected ones to further improve the throughput. In our performance tests on Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Arabidopsis thaliana and human long reads, FLAS can achieve 22.0-50.6% larger throughput than MECAT. FLAS is 2-13× faster compared to the self-correction algorithms other than MECAT, and its throughput is also 9.8-281.8% larger. The FLAS corrected long reads can be assembled into contigs of 13.1-29.8% larger N50 sizes than MECAT.Availability and implementation:The FLAS software can be downloaded for free from this site: https://github.com/baoe/flas.Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",30895306,,10.1093/bioinformatics/btz206,9
WarpSTR: determining tandem repeat lengths using raw nanopore signals,"Motivation:Short tandem repeats (STRs) are regions of a genome containing many consecutive copies of the same short motif, possibly with small variations. Analysis of STRs has many clinical uses but is limited by technology mainly due to STRs surpassing the used read length. Nanopore sequencing, as one of long-read sequencing technologies, produces very long reads, thus offering more possibilities to study and analyze STRs. Basecalling of nanopore reads is however particularly unreliable in repeating regions, and therefore direct analysis from raw nanopore data is required.Results:Here, we present WarpSTR, a novel method for characterizing both simple and complex tandem repeats directly from raw nanopore signals using a finite-state automaton and a search algorithm analogous to dynamic time warping. By applying this approach to determine the lengths of 241 STRs, we demonstrate that our approach decreases the mean absolute error of the STR length estimate compared to basecalling and STRique.Availability and implementation:WarpSTR is freely available at https://github.com/fmfi-compbio/warpstr.",37326967,PMC10307940,10.1093/bioinformatics/btad388,2
Oxford Nanopore and Bionano Genomics technologies evaluation for plant structural variation detection,"Background:Structural Variations (SVs) are genomic rearrangements derived from duplication, deletion, insertion, inversion, and translocation events. In the past, SVs detection was limited to cytological approaches, then to Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) short reads and partitioned assemblies. Nowadays, technologies such as DNA long read sequencing and optical mapping have revolutionized the understanding of SVs in genomes, due to the enhancement of the power of SVs detection. This study aims to investigate performance of two techniques, 1) long-read sequencing obtained with the MinION device (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) and 2) optical mapping obtained with Saphyr device (Bionano Genomics) to detect and characterize SVs in the genomes of the two ecotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana, Columbia-0 (Col-0) and Landsberg erecta 1 (Ler-1).Results:We described the SVs detected from the alignment of the best ONT assembly and DLE-1 optical maps of A. thaliana Ler-1 against the public reference genome Col-0 TAIR10.1. After filtering (SV > 1 kb), 1184 and 591 Ler-1 SVs were retained from ONT and Bionano technologies respectively. A total of 948 Ler-1 ONT SVs (80.1%) corresponded to 563 Bionano SVs (95.3%) leading to 563 common locations. The specific locations were scrutinized to assess improvement in SV detection by either technology. The ONT SVs were mostly detected near TE and gene features, and resistance genes seemed particularly impacted.Conclusions:Structural variations linked to ONT sequencing error were removed and false positives limited, with high quality Bionano SVs being conserved. When compared with the Col-0 TAIR10.1 reference genome, most of the detected SVs discovered by both technologies were found in the same locations. ONT assembly sequence leads to more specific SVs than Bionano one, the latter being more efficient to characterize large SVs. Even if both technologies are complementary approaches, ONT data appears to be more adapted to large scale populations studies, while Bionano performs better in improving assembly and describing specificity of a genome compared to a reference.",35448948,PMC9026655,10.1186/s12864-022-08499-4,1
GASOLINE: detecting germline and somatic structural variants from long-reads data,"Long-read sequencing allows analyses of single nucleic-acid molecules and produces sequences in the order of tens to hundreds kilobases. Its application to whole-genome analyses allows identification of complex genomic structural-variants (SVs) with unprecedented resolution. SV identification, however, requires complex computational methods, based on either read-depth or intra- and inter-alignment signatures approaches, which are limited by size or type of SVs. Moreover, most currently available tools only detect germline variants, thus requiring separate computation of sample pairs for comparative analyses. To overcome these limits, we developed a novel tool (Germline And SOmatic structuraL varIants detectioN and gEnotyping; GASOLINE) that groups SV signatures using a sophisticated clustering procedure based on a modified reciprocal overlap criterion, and is designed to identify germline SVs, from single samples, and somatic SVs from paired test and control samples. GASOLINE is a collection of Perl, R and Fortran codes, it analyzes aligned data in BAM format and produces VCF files with statistically significant somatic SVs. Germline or somatic analysis of 30[Formula: see text] sequencing coverage experiments requires 4-5 h with 20 threads. GASOLINE outperformed currently available methods in the detection of both germline and somatic SVs in synthetic and real long-reads datasets. Notably, when applied on a pair of metastatic melanoma and matched-normal sample, GASOLINE identified five genuine somatic SVs that were missed using five different sequencing technologies and state-of-the art SV calling approaches. Thus, GASOLINE identifies germline and somatic SVs with unprecedented accuracy and resolution, outperforming currently available state-of-the-art WGS long-reads computational methods.",38012350,PMC10682169,10.1038/s41598-023-48285-0,0
"Illumina Synthetic Long Read Sequencing Allows Recovery of Missing Sequences even in the ""Finished"" C. elegans Genome","Most next-generation sequencing platforms permit acquisition of high-throughput DNA sequences, but the relatively short read length limits their use in genome assembly or finishing. Illumina has recently released a technology called Synthetic Long-Read Sequencing that can produce reads of unusual length, i.e., predominately around 10 Kb. However, a systematic assessment of their use in genome finishing and assembly is still lacking. We evaluate the promise and deficiency of the long reads in these aspects using isogenic C. elegans genome with no gap. First, the reads are highly accurate and capable of recovering most types of repetitive sequences. However, the presence of tandem repetitive sequences prevents pre-assembly of long reads in the relevant genomic region. Second, the reads are able to reliably detect missing but not extra sequences in the C. elegans genome. Third, the reads of smaller size are more capable of recovering repetitive sequences than those of bigger size. Fourth, at least 40 Kbp missing genomic sequences are recovered in the C. elegans genome using the long reads. Finally, an N50 contig size of at least 86 Kbp can be achieved with 24 × reads but with substantial mis-assembly errors, highlighting a need for novel assembly algorithm for the long reads.",26039588,PMC4650653,10.1038/srep10814,29
Long-read direct RNA sequencing by 5'-Cap capturing reveals the impact of Piwi on the widespread exonization of transposable elements in locusts,"The large genome of the migratory locust (Locusta migratoria) genome accumulates massive amount of accumulated transposable elements (TEs), which show intrinsic transcriptional activities. Hampering the ability to precisely determine full-length RNA transcript sequences are exonized TEs, which produce numerous highly similar fragments that are difficult to resolve using short-read sequencing technology. Here, we applied a 5'-Cap capturing method using Nanopore long-read direct RNA sequencing to characterize full-length transcripts in their native RNA form and to analyze the TE exonization pattern in the locust transcriptome. Our results revealed the widespread establishment of TE exonization and a substantial contribution of TEs to RNA splicing in the locust transcriptome. The results of the transcriptomic spectrum influenced byPiwiexpression indicated that TE-derived sequences were the main targets ofPiwi-mediated repression. Furthermore, our study showed thatPiwiexpression regulates the length of RNA transcripts containing TE-derived sequences, creating an alternative UTR usage. Overall, our results reveal the transcriptomic characteristics of TE exonization in the species characterized by large and repetitive genomes.",30982421,PMC6546357,10.1080/15476286.2019.1602437,23
MinION™ nanopore sequencing of environmental metagenomes: a synthetic approach,"Environmental metagenomic analysis is typically accomplished by assigning taxonomy and/or function from whole genome sequencing or 16S amplicon sequences. Both of these approaches are limited, however, by read length, among other technical and biological factors. A nanopore-based sequencing platform, MinION™, produces reads that are ≥1 × 104 bp in length, potentially providing for more precise assignment, thereby alleviating some of the limitations inherent in determining metagenome composition from short reads. We tested the ability of sequence data produced by MinION (R7.3 flow cells) to correctly assign taxonomy in single bacterial species runs and in three types of low-complexity synthetic communities: a mixture of DNA using equal mass from four species, a community with one relatively rare (1%) and three abundant (33% each) components, and a mixture of genomic DNA from 20 bacterial strains of staggered representation. Taxonomic composition of the low-complexity communities was assessed by analyzing the MinION sequence data with three different bioinformatic approaches: Kraken, MG-RAST, and One Codex. Results: Long read sequences generated from libraries prepared from single strains using the version 5 kit and chemistry, run on the original MinION device, yielded as few as 224 to as many as 3497 bidirectional high-quality (2D) reads with an average overall study length of 6000 bp. For the single-strain analyses, assignment of reads to the correct genus by different methods ranged from 53.1% to 99.5%, assignment to the correct species ranged from 23.9% to 99.5%, and the majority of misassigned reads were to closely related organisms. A synthetic metagenome sequenced with the same setup yielded 714 high quality 2D reads of approximately 5500 bp that were up to 98% correctly assigned to the species level. Synthetic metagenome MinION libraries generated using version 6 kit and chemistry yielded from 899 to 3497 2D reads with lengths averaging 5700 bp with up to 98% assignment accuracy at the species level. The observed community proportions for “equal” and “rare” synthetic libraries were close to the known proportions, deviating from 0.1% to 10% across all tests. For a 20-species mock community with staggered contributions, a sequencing run detected all but 3 species (each included at <0.05% of DNA in the total mixture), 91% of reads were assigned to the correct species, 93% of reads were assigned to the correct genus, and >99% of reads were assigned to the correct family. Conclusions: At the current level of output and sequence quality (just under 4 × 103 2D reads for a synthetic metagenome), MinION sequencing followed by Kraken or One Codex analysis has the potential to provide rapid and accurate metagenomic analysis where the consortium is comprised of a limited number of taxa. Important considerations noted in this study included: high sensitivity of the MinION platform to the quality of input DNA, high variability of sequencing results across libraries and flow cells, and relatively small numbers of 2D reads per analysis limit. Together, these limited detection of very rare components of the microbial consortia, and would likely limit the utility of MinION for the sequencing of high-complexity metagenomic communities where thousands of taxa are expected. Furthermore, the limitations of the currently available data analysis tools suggest there is considerable room for improvement in the analytical approaches for the characterization of microbial communities using long reads. Nevertheless, the fact that the accurate taxonomic assignment of high-quality reads generated by MinION is approaching 99.5% and, in most cases, the inferred community structure mirrors the known proportions of a synthetic mixture warrants further exploration of practical application to environmental metagenomics as the platform continues to develop and improve. With further improvement in sequence throughput and error rate reduction, this platform shows great promise for precise real-time analysis of the composition and structure of more complex microbial communities.",28327976,PMC5467020,10.1093/gigascience/gix007,48
Assembly of chloroplast genomes with long- and short-read data: a comparison of approaches using Eucalyptus pauciflora as a test case,"Background:Chloroplasts are organelles that conduct photosynthesis in plant and algal cells. The information chloroplast genome contained is widely used in agriculture and studies of evolution and ecology. Correctly assembling chloroplast genomes can be challenging because the chloroplast genome contains a pair of long inverted repeats (10-30 kb). Typically, it is simply assumed that the gross structure of the chloroplast genome matches the most commonly observed structure of two single-copy regions separated by a pair of inverted repeats. The advent of long-read sequencing technologies should remove the need to make this assumption by providing sufficient information to completely span the inverted repeat regions. Yet, long-reads tend to have higher error rates than short-reads, and relatively little is known about the best way to combine long- and short-reads to obtain the most accurate chloroplast genome assemblies. Using Eucalyptus pauciflora, the snow gum, as a test case, we evaluated the effect of multiple parameters, such as different coverage of long-(Oxford nanopore) and short-(Illumina) reads, different long-read lengths, different assembly pipelines, with a view to determining the most accurate and efficient approach to chloroplast genome assembly.Results:Hybrid assemblies combining at least 20x coverage of both long-reads and short-reads generated a single contig spanning the entire chloroplast genome with few or no detectable errors. Short-read-only assemblies generated three contigs (the long single copy, short single copy and inverted repeat regions) of the chloroplast genome. These contigs contained few single-base errors but tended to exclude several bases at the beginning or end of each contig. Long-read-only assemblies tended to create multiple contigs with a much higher single-base error rate. The chloroplast genome of Eucalyptus pauciflora is 159,942 bp, contains 131 genes of known function.Conclusions:Our results suggest that very accurate assemblies of chloroplast genomes can be achieved using a combination of at least 20x coverage of long- and short-reads respectively, provided that the long-reads contain at least ~5x coverage of reads longer than the inverted repeat region. We show that further increases in coverage give little or no improvement in accuracy, and that hybrid assemblies are more accurate than long-read-only or short-read-only assemblies.",30594129,PMC6311037,10.1186/s12864-018-5348-8,36
rMETL: sensitive mobile element insertion detection with long read realignment,"Summary:Mobile element insertion (MEI) is a major category of structure variations (SVs). The rapid development of long read sequencing technologies provides the opportunity to detect MEIs sensitively. However, the signals of MEI implied by noisy long reads are highly complex due to the repetitiveness of mobile elements as well as the high sequencing error rates. Herein, we propose the Realignment-based Mobile Element insertion detection Tool for Long read (rMETL). Benchmarking results of simulated and real datasets demonstrate that rMETL enables to handle the complex signals to discover MEIs sensitively. It is suited to produce high-quality MEI callsets in many genomics studies.Availability and implementation:rMETL is available from https://github.com/hitbc/rMETL.Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",30759188,,10.1093/bioinformatics/btz106,6
cloudSPAdes: assembly of synthetic long reads using de Bruijn graphs,"Motivation:The recently developed barcoding-based synthetic long read (SLR) technologies have already found many applications in genome assembly and analysis. However, although some new barcoding protocols are emerging and the range of SLR applications is being expanded, the existing SLR assemblers are optimized for a narrow range of parameters and are not easily extendable to new barcoding technologies and new applications such as metagenomics or hybrid assembly.Results:We describe the algorithmic challenge of the SLR assembly and present a cloudSPAdes algorithm for SLR assembly that is based on analyzing the de Bruijn graph of SLRs. We benchmarked cloudSPAdes across various barcoding technologies/applications and demonstrated that it improves on the state-of-the-art SLR assemblers in accuracy and speed.Availability and implementation:Source code and installation manual for cloudSPAdes are available at https://github.com/ablab/spades/releases/tag/cloudspades-paper.Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",31510642,PMC6612831,10.1093/bioinformatics/btz349,13
Full-Length HLA Class I Genotyping with the MinION Nanopore Sequencer,"Nanopore sequencing, a paradigm change in sequencing technologies, offers a new cost-effective and scalable platform for HLA genotyping. Among the new generation of high-throughput sequencing technologies, the MinION nanopore sequencer is the first to offer a non-template-based direct DNA sensing sequencing technology. Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) introduced the first version of the MinION in 2014; since then, the platform has gone through multiple iterations resulting in higher throughput and sequencing accuracy. The ""what you put in is what you get"" nature of the platform enables molecules to be sequenced without fragmentation. This results in ultra-long read lengths in the order of tens of kilobases enabling entire genes to be characterized with fully phased sequence information. With release R9.5, the MinION platform has reached a quality that enables HLA genotyping with minor shortcomings in long homopolymer regions. Within this chapter, we describe a protocol for sequencing and genotyping HLA Class I alleles using the MinION.",29858807,,10.1007/978-1-4939-8546-3_10,10
Identifying the causes and consequences of assembly gaps using a multiplatform genome assembly of a bird-of-paradise,"Genome assemblies are currently being produced at an impressive rate by consortia and individual laboratories. The low costs and increasing efficiency of sequencing technologies now enable assembling genomes at unprecedented quality and contiguity. However, the difficulty in assembling repeat-rich and GC-rich regions (genomic ""dark matter"") limits insights into the evolution of genome structure and regulatory networks. Here, we compare the efficiency of currently available sequencing technologies (short/linked/long reads and proximity ligation maps) and combinations thereof in assembling genomic dark matter. By adopting different de novo assembly strategies, we compare individual draft assemblies to a curated multiplatform reference assembly and identify the genomic features that cause gaps within each assembly. We show that a multiplatform assembly implementing long-read, linked-read and proximity sequencing technologies performs best at recovering transposable elements, multicopy MHC genes, GC-rich microchromosomes and the repeat-rich W chromosome. Telomere-to-telomere assemblies are not a reality yet for most organisms, but by leveraging technology choice it is now possible to minimize genome assembly gaps for downstream analysis. We provide a roadmap to tailor sequencing projects for optimized completeness of both the coding and noncoding parts of nonmodel genomes.",32937018,PMC7757076,10.1111/1755-0998.13252,64
Long-read sequencing technology indicates genome-wide effects of non-B DNA on polymerization speed and error rate,"DNA conformation may deviate from the classical B-form in ∼13% of the human genome. Non-B DNA regulates many cellular processes; however, its effects on DNA polymerization speed and accuracy have not been investigated genome-wide. Such an inquiry is critical for understanding neurological diseases and cancer genome instability. Here, we present the first simultaneous examination of DNA polymerization kinetics and errors in the human genome sequenced with Single-Molecule Real-Time (SMRT) technology. We show that polymerization speed differs between non-B and B-DNA: It decelerates at G-quadruplexes and fluctuates periodically at disease-causing tandem repeats. Analyzing polymerization kinetics profiles, we predict and validate experimentally non-B DNA formation for a novel motif. We demonstrate that several non-B motifs affect sequencing errors (e.g., G-quadruplexes increase error rates), and that sequencing errors are positively associated with polymerase slowdown. Finally, we show that highly divergent G4 motifs have pronounced polymerization slowdown and high sequencing error rates, suggesting similar mechanisms for sequencing errors and germline mutations.",30401733,PMC6280752,10.1101/gr.241257.118,36
Rapid Nanopore Sequencing of Plasmids and Resistance Gene Detection in Clinical Isolates,"Recent advances in nanopore sequencing technology have led to a substantial increase in throughput and sequence quality. Together, these improvements may permit real-time benchtop genomic sequencing and antimicrobial resistance gene detection in clinical isolates. In this study, we evaluated workflows and turnaround times for a benchtop long-read sequencing approach in the clinical microbiology laboratory using the Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION sequencer. We performed genomic and plasmid sequencing of three clinical isolates with both MinION and Illumina MiSeq, using different library preparation methods (2D and rapid 1D) with the goal of antimicrobial resistance gene detection. We specifically evaluated the advantages of using plasmid DNA for sequencing and the value of supplementing MinION sequences with MiSeq reads for increasing assembly accuracy. Resequencing of three plasmids in a referenceKlebsiella pneumoniaeisolate demonstrated ∼99% accuracy of draft MinION-only assembly and >99.9% accuracy of assembly polished with MiSeq reads. Plasmid DNA sequencing of previously uncharacterized clinical extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producingEscherichia coliandK. pneumoniaeisolates using MinION allowed successful identification of antimicrobial resistance genes in the draft assembly corresponding to all classes of observed plasmid-based phenotypic resistance. Importantly, use of plasmid DNA enabled lower depth sequencing, and assemblies sufficient for full antimicrobial resistance gene annotation were obtained with as few as 2,000 to 5,000 reads, which could be acquired in 20 min of sequencing. With a MinION-only workflow that balances accuracy against turnaround time, full annotation of plasmid resistance gene content could be obtained in under 6 h from a subcultured isolate, less time than traditional phenotypic susceptibility testing.",29021151,PMC5703817,10.1128/JCM.01069-17,56
Complete sequence verification of plasmid DNA using the Oxford Nanopore Technologies' MinION device,"Background:Sequence verification is essential for plasmids used as critical reagents or therapeutic products. Typically, high-quality plasmid sequence is achieved through capillary-based Sanger sequencing, requiring customized sets of primers for each plasmid. This process can become expensive, particularly for applications where the validated sequence needs to be produced within a regulated and quality-controlled environment for downstream clinical research applications.Results:Here, we describe a cost-effective and accurate plasmid sequencing and consensus generation procedure using the Oxford Nanopore Technologies' MinION device as an alternative to capillary-based plasmid sequencing options. This procedure can verify the identity of a pure population of plasmid, either confirming it matches the known and expected sequence, or identifying mutations present in the plasmid if any exist. We use a full MinION flow cell per plasmid, maximizing available data and allowing for stringent quality filters. Pseudopairing reads for consensus base calling reduces read error rates from 5.3 to 0.53%, and our pileup consensus approach provides per-base counts and confidence scores, allowing for interpretation of the certainty of the resulting consensus sequences. For pure plasmid samples, we demonstrate 100% accuracy in the resulting consensus sequence, and the sensitivity to detect small mutations such as insertions, deletions, and single nucleotide variants. In test cases where the sequenced pool of plasmids contains subclonal templates, detection sensitivity is similar to that of traditional capillary sequencing.Conclusions:Our pipeline can provide significant cost savings compared to outsourcing clinical-grade sequencing of plasmids, making generation of high-quality plasmid sequence for clinical sequence verification more accessible. While other long-read-based methods offer higher-throughput and less cost, our pipeline produces complete and accurate sequence verification for cases where absolute sequence accuracy is required.",36964503,PMC10039527,10.1186/s12859-023-05226-y,6
Resolving the complex Bordetella pertussis genome using barcoded nanopore sequencing,"The genome of Bordetella pertussis is complex, with high G+C content and many repeats, each longer than 1000 bp. Long-read sequencing offers the opportunity to produce single-contig B. pertussis assemblies using sequencing reads which are longer than the repetitive sections, with the potential to reveal genomic features which were previously unobservable in multi-contig assemblies produced by short-read sequencing alone. We used an R9.4 MinION flow cell and barcoding to sequence five B. pertussis strains in a single sequencing run. We then trialled combinations of the many nanopore user community-built long-read analysis tools to establish the current optimal assembly pipeline for B. pertussis genome sequences. This pipeline produced closed genome sequences for four strains, allowing visualization of inter-strain genomic rearrangement. Read mapping to the Tohama I reference genome suggests that the remaining strain contains an ultra-long duplicated region (almost 200 kbp), which was not resolved by our pipeline; further investigation also revealed that a second strain that was seemingly resolved by our pipeline may contain an even longer duplication, albeit in a small subset of cells. We have therefore demonstrated the ability to resolve the structure of several B. pertussis strains per single barcoded nanopore flow cell, but the genomes with highest complexity (e.g. very large duplicated regions) remain only partially resolved using the standard library preparation and will require an alternative library preparation method. For full strain characterization, we recommend hybrid assembly of long and short reads together; for comparison of genome arrangement, assembly using long reads alone is sufficient.",30461375,PMC6321869,10.1099/mgen.0.000234,15
Genomic characterization of equine influenza A subtype H3N8 viruses by long read sequencing and functional analyses of the PB1-F2 virulence factor of A/equine/Paris/1/2018,"Equine influenza virus (EIV) remains a threat to horses, despite the availability of vaccines. Strategies to monitor the virus and prevent potential vaccine failure revolve around serological assays, RT-qPCR amplification, and sequencing the viral hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes. These approaches overlook the contribution of other viral proteins in driving virulence. This study assesses the potential of long-read nanopore sequencing for fast and precise sequencing of circulating equine influenza viruses. Therefore, two French Florida Clade 1 strains, including the one circulating in winter 2018-2019 exhibiting more pronounced pathogenicity than usual, as well as the two currently OIE-recommended vaccine strains, were sequenced. Our results demonstrated the reliability of this sequencing method in generating accurate sequences. Sequence analysis of HA revealed a subtle antigenic drift in the French EIV strains, with specific substitutions, such as T163I in A/equine/Paris/1/2018 and the N188T mutation in post-2015 strains; both substitutions were in antigenic site B. Antigenic site E exhibited modifications in post-2018 strains, with the N63D substitution. Segment 2 sequencing also revealed that the A/equine/Paris/1/2018 strain encodes a longer variant of the PB1-F2 protein when compared to other Florida clade 1 strains (90 amino acids long versus 81 amino acids long). Further biological and biochemistry assays demonstrated that this PB1-F2 variant has enhanced abilities to abolish the mitochondrial membrane potential ΔΨm and permeabilize synthetic membranes. Altogether, our results highlight the interest in rapidly characterizing the complete genome of circulating strains with next-generation sequencing technologies to adapt vaccines and identify specific virulence markers of EIV.",38520035,PMC10960481,10.1186/s13567-024-01289-8,0
Microfluidic isoform sequencing shows widespread splicing coordination in the human transcriptome,"Understanding transcriptome complexity is crucial for understanding human biology and disease. Technologies such as Synthetic long-read RNA sequencing (SLR-RNA-seq) delivered 5 million isoforms and allowed assessing splicing coordination. Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore increase throughput also but require high input amounts or amplification. Our new droplet-based method, sparse isoform sequencing (spISO-seq), sequences 100k-200k partitions of 10-200 molecules at a time, enabling analysis of 10-100 million RNA molecules. SpISO-seq requires less than 1 ng of input cDNA, limiting or removing the need for prior amplification with its associated biases. Adjusting the number of reads devoted to each molecule reduces sequencing lanes and cost, with little loss in detection power. The increased number of molecules expands our understanding of isoform complexity. In addition to confirming our previously published cases of splicing coordination (e.g.,BIN1), the greater depth reveals many new cases, such asMAPTCoordination of internal exons is found to be extensive among protein coding genes: 23.5%-59.3% (95% confidence interval) of highly expressed genes with distant alternative exons exhibit coordination, showcasing the need for long-read transcriptomics. However, coordination is less frequent for noncoding sequences, suggesting a larger role of splicing coordination in shaping proteins. Groups of genes with coordination are involved in protein-protein interactions with each other, raising the possibility that coordination facilitates complex formation and/or function. We also find new splicing coordination types, involving initial and terminal exons. Our results provide a more comprehensive understanding of the human transcriptome and a general, cost-effective method to analyze it.",29196558,PMC5793787,10.1101/gr.230516.117,38
Resolving the Complexity of Human Skin Metagenomes Using Single-Molecule Sequencing,"Deep metagenomic shotgun sequencing has emerged as a powerful tool to interrogate composition and function of complex microbial communities. Computational approaches to assemble genome fragments have been demonstrated to be an effective tool for de novo reconstruction of genomes from these communities. However, the resultant ""genomes"" are typically fragmented and incomplete due to the limited ability of short-read sequence data to assemble complex or low-coverage regions. Here, we use single-molecule, real-time (SMRT) sequencing to reconstruct a high-quality, closed genome of a previously uncharacterized Corynebacterium simulans and its companion bacteriophage from a skin metagenomic sample. Considerable improvement in assembly quality occurs in hybrid approaches incorporating short-read data, with even relatively small amounts of long-read data being sufficient to improve metagenome reconstruction. Using short-read data to evaluate strain variation of this C. simulans in its skin community at single-nucleotide resolution, we observed a dominant C. simulans strain with moderate allelic heterozygosity throughout the population. We demonstrate the utility of SMRT sequencing and hybrid approaches in metagenome quantitation, reconstruction, and annotation.Importance:The species comprising a microbial community are often difficult to deconvolute due to technical limitations inherent to most short-read sequencing technologies. Here, we leverage new advances in sequencing technology, single-molecule sequencing, to significantly improve reconstruction of a complex human skin microbial community. With this long-read technology, we were able to reconstruct and annotate a closed, high-quality genome of a previously uncharacterized skin species. We demonstrate that hybrid approaches with short-read technology are sufficiently powerful to reconstruct even single-nucleotide polymorphism level variation of species in this a community.",26861018,PMC4752602,10.1128/mBio.01948-15,43
Detection of simple and complex de novo mutations with multiple reference sequences,"The characterization of de novo mutations in regions of high sequence and structural diversity from whole-genome sequencing data remains highly challenging. Complex structural variants tend to arise in regions of high repetitiveness and low complexity, challenging both de novo assembly, in which short reads do not capture the long-range context required for resolution, and mapping approaches, in which improper alignment of reads to a reference genome that is highly diverged from that of the sample can lead to false or partial calls. Long-read technologies can potentially solve such problems but are currently unfeasible to use at scale. Here we present Corticall, a graph-based method that combines the advantages of multiple technologies and prior data sources to detect arbitrary classes of genetic variant. We construct multisample, colored de Bruijn graphs from short-read data for all samples, align long-read-derived haplotypes and multiple reference data sources to restore graph connectivity information, and call variants using graph path-finding algorithms and a model for simultaneous alignment and recombination. We validate and evaluate the approach using extensive simulations and use it to characterize the rate and spectrum of de novo mutation events in 119 progeny from fourPlasmodium falciparumexperimental crosses, using long-read data on the parents to inform reconstructions of the progeny and to detect several known and novel nonallelic homologous recombination events.",32817236,PMC7462078,10.1101/gr.255505.119,5
MinimapR: A parallel alignment tool for the analysis of large-scale third-generation sequencing data,"The development of third-generation sequencing technology has brought significant changes and influences on genomics. Compared to the second-generation sequencing methods, the third-generation technologies produce around 100 times longer reads to reveal new genomic variations that complete long-term gaps in the human reference genome. However, these reads' excessive length and high error rate severely increase the amount of data and alignment cost. The traditional data analysis platform and serial sequence alignment method can not effectively deal with large-scale long read alignment. There is a critical need for a novel data analysis platform that can deliver fast alignment of large-scale sequences to solve the problem of long read alignment. High-performance computing platforms and efficient, scalable algorithms based on these platforms have significant potential to impact sequence analysis approaches. This paper presented minimapR, a multi-level parallel long-read alignment tool based on minimap2, a popular third-generation read aligner. MinimapR is developed based on the new high-performance distributed framework Ray. Ray fully integrates with the Python environment and can be easily installed with pip. MinimapR can utilize the power of multiple computing nodes, significantly accelerating alignment speeds without sacrificing sensitivity. The minimapR tool was tested on 64 nodes and demonstrated a 50 fold increase in speed with 78 % parallel efficiency.

Microbial Community Profiling Protocol with Full-length 16S rRNA Sequences and Emu,"16S rRNA targeted amplicon sequencing is an established standard for elucidating microbial community composition. While high-throughput short-read sequencing can elicit only a portion of the 16S rRNA gene due to their limited read length, third generation sequencing can read the 16S rRNA gene in its entirety and thus provide more precise taxonomic classification. Here, we present a protocol for generating full-length 16S rRNA sequences with Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) and a microbial community profile with Emu. We select Emu for analyzing ONT sequences as it leverages information from the entire community to overcome errors due to incomplete reference databases and hardware limitations to ultimately obtain species-level resolution. This pipeline provides a low-cost solution for characterizing microbiome composition by exploiting real-time, long-read ONT sequencing and tailored software for accurate characterization of microbial communities. © 2024 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

"De novo yeast genome assemblies from MinION, PacBio and MiSeq platforms","Long-read sequencing technologies such as Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore MinION are capable of producing long sequencing reads with average fragment lengths of over 10,000 base-pairs and maximum lengths reaching 100,000 base- pairs. Compared with short reads, the assemblies obtained from long-read sequencing platforms have much higher contig continuity and genome completeness as long fragments are able to extend paths into problematic or repetitive regions. Many successful assembly applications of the Pacific Biosciences technology have been reported ranging from small bacterial genomes to large plant and animal genomes. Recently, genome assemblies using Oxford Nanopore MinION data have attracted much attention due to the portability and low cost of this novel sequencing instrument. In this paper, we re-sequenced a well characterized genome, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae S288C strain using three different platforms: MinION, PacBio and MiSeq. We present a comprehensive metric comparison of assemblies generated by various pipelines and discuss how the platform associated data characteristics affect the assembly quality. With a given read depth of 31X, the assemblies from both Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore MinION show excellent continuity and completeness for the 16 nuclear chromosomes, but not for the mitochondrial genome, whose reconstruction still represents a significant challenge.",28638050,PMC5479803,10.1038/s41598-017-03996-z,70
A transcriptome atlas of rabbit revealed by PacBio single-molecule long-read sequencing,"It is widely acknowledged that transcriptional diversity largely contributes to biological regulation in eukaryotes. Since the advent of second-generation sequencing technologies, a large number of RNA sequencing studies have considerably improved our understanding of transcriptome complexity. However, it still remains a huge challenge for obtaining full-length transcripts because of difficulties in the short read-based assembly. In the present study we employ PacBio single-molecule long-read sequencing technology for whole-transcriptome profiling in rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus). We totally obtain 36,186 high-confidence transcripts from 14,474 genic loci, among which more than 23% of genic loci and 66% of isoforms have not been annotated yet within the current reference genome. Furthermore, about 17% of transcripts are computationally revealed to be non-coding RNAs. Up to 24,797 alternative splicing (AS) and 11,184 alternative polyadenylation (APA) events are detected within this de novo constructed transcriptome, respectively. The results provide a comprehensive set of reference transcripts and hence contribute to the improved annotation of rabbit genome.",28794490,PMC5550469,10.1038/s41598-017-08138-z,50
"Two long read-based genome assembly and annotation of polyploidy woody plants, Hibiscus syriacus L. using PacBio and Nanopore platforms","Improvements in long read DNA sequencing and related techniques facilitated the generation of complex eukaryotic genomes. Despite these advances, the quality of constructed plant reference genomes remains relatively poor due to the large size of genomes, high content of repetitive sequences, and wide variety of ploidy. Here, we developed the de novo sequencing and assembly of high polyploid plant genome, Hibiscus syriacus, a flowering plant species of the Malvaceae family, using the Oxford Nanopore Technologies and Pacific Biosciences Sequel sequencing platforms. We investigated an efficient combination of high-quality and high-molecular-weight DNA isolation procedure and suitable assembler to achieve optimal results using long read sequencing data. We found that abundant ultra-long reads allow for large and complex polyploid plant genome assemblies with great recovery of repetitive sequences and error correction even at relatively low depth Nanopore sequencing data and polishing compared to previous studies. Collectively, our combination provides cost effective methods to improve genome continuity and quality compared to the previously reported reference genome by accessing highly repetitive regions. The application of this combination may enable genetic research and breeding of polyploid crops, thus leading to improvements in crop production.",37853021,PMC10584963,10.1038/s41597-023-02631-z,2
Multi-platform analysis reveals a complex transcriptome architecture of a circovirus,"In this study, we used Pacific Biosciences RS II long-read and Illumina HiScanSQ short-read sequencing technologies for the characterization of porcine circovirus type 1 (PCV-1) transcripts. Our aim was to identify novel RNA molecules and transcript isoforms, as well as to determine the exact 5'- and 3'-end sequences of previously described transcripts with single base-pair accuracy. We discovered a novel 3'-UTR length isoform of the Cap transcript, and a non-spliced Cap transcript variant. Additionally, our analysis has revealed a 3'-UTR isoform of Rep and two 5'-UTR isoforms of Rep' transcripts, and a novel splice variant of the longer Rep' transcript. We also explored two novel long transcripts, one with a previously identified splice site, and a formerly undetected mRNA of ORF3. Altogether, our methods have identified nine novel RNA molecules, doubling the size of PCV-1 transcriptome that had been known before. Additionally, our investigations revealed an intricate pattern of transcript overlapping, which might produce transcriptional interference between the transcriptional machineries of adjacent genes, and thereby may potentially play a role in the regulation of gene expression in circoviruses.",28549855,PMC5927800,10.1016/j.virusres.2017.05.010,19
NanoVar: accurate characterization of patients' genomic structural variants using low-depth nanopore sequencing,"The recent advent of third-generation sequencing technologies brings promise for better characterization of genomic structural variants by virtue of having longer reads. However, long-read applications are still constrained by their high sequencing error rates and low sequencing throughput. Here, we present NanoVar, an optimized structural variant caller utilizing low-depth (8X) whole-genome sequencing data generated by Oxford Nanopore Technologies. NanoVar exhibits higher structural variant calling accuracy when benchmarked against current tools using low-depth simulated datasets.

ntLink: A Toolkit for De Novo Genome Assembly Scaffolding and Mapping Using Long Reads,"With the increasing affordability and accessibility of genome sequencing data, de novo genome assembly is an important first step to a wide variety of downstream studies and analyses. Therefore, bioinformatics tools that enable the generation of high-quality genome assemblies in a computationally efficient manner are essential. Recent developments in long-read sequencing technologies have greatly benefited genome assembly work, including scaffolding, by providing long-range evidence that can aid in resolving the challenging repetitive regions of complex genomes. ntLink is a flexible and resource-efficient genome scaffolding tool that utilizes long-read sequencing data to improve upon draft genome assemblies built from any sequencing technologies, including the same long reads. Instead of using read alignments to identify candidate joins, ntLink utilizes minimizer-based mappings to infer how input sequences should be ordered and oriented into scaffolds. Recent improvements to ntLink have added important features such as overlap detection, gap-filling, and in-code scaffolding iterations. Here, we present three basic protocols demonstrating how to use each of these new features to yield highly contiguous genome assemblies, while still maintaining ntLink's proven computational efficiency. Further, as we illustrate in the alternate protocols, the lightweight minimizer-based mappings that enable ntLink scaffolding can also be utilized for other downstream applications, such as misassembly detection. With its modularity and multiple modes of execution, ntLink has broad benefit to the genomics community, from genome scaffolding and beyond. ntLink is an open-source project and is freely available from https://github.com/bcgsc/ntLink. © 2023 The Authors.

[End of a near-monopoly on DNA sequencing],"DNA sequencing costs have steadily decreased during the last decade, but the dominant technology (short-read sequencing, Illumina) has seen comparatively little competition after an initial flurry. This phase is now over, with serious competition involving both established and new companies as well as the growing importance of long-read sequencing.

A Sample-to-Report Solution for Taxonomic Identification of Cultured Bacteria in the Clinical Setting Based on Nanopore Sequencing,"Amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene is commonly used for the identification of bacterial isolates in diagnostic laboratories and mostly relies on the Sanger sequencing method. The latter, however, suffers from a number of limitations, with the most significant being the inability to resolve mixed amplicons when closely related species are coamplified from a mixed culture. This often leads to either increased turnaround time or absence of usable sequence data. Short-read next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies could solve the mixed amplicon issue but would lack both cost efficiency at low throughput and fast turnaround times. Nanopore sequencing developed by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) could solve those issues by enabling a flexible number of samples per run and an adjustable sequencing time. Here, we report on the development of a standardized laboratory workflow combined with a fully automated analysis pipelineLORCAN(long read consensus analysis), which together provide a sample-to-report solution for amplicon sequencing and taxonomic identification of the resulting consensus sequences. Validation of the approach was conducted on a panel of reference strains and on clinical samples consisting of single or mixed rRNA amplicons associated with various bacterial genera by direct comparison to the corresponding Sanger sequences. Additionally, simulated read and amplicon mixtures were used to assessLORCAN's behavior when dealing with samples with known cross-contamination levels. We demonstrate that by combining ONT amplicon sequencing results withLORCAN, the accuracy of Sanger sequencing can be closely matched (>99.6% sequence identity) and that mixed samples can be resolved at the single-base resolution level. The presented approach has the potential to significantly improve the flexibility, reliability, and availability of amplicon sequencing in diagnostic settings.",32229603,PMC7269405,10.1128/JCM.00060-20,8
High quality genome assemblies of Mycoplasma bovis using a taxon-specific Bonito basecaller for MinION and Flongle long-read nanopore sequencing,"Background:Implementation of Third-Generation Sequencing approaches for Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) all-in-one diagnostics in human and veterinary medicine, requires the rapid and accurate generation of consensus genomes. Over the last years, Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) released various new devices (e.g. the Flongle R9.4.1 flow cell) and bioinformatics tools (e.g. the in 2019-released Bonito basecaller), allowing cheap and user-friendly cost-efficient introduction in various NGS workflows. While single read, overall consensus accuracies, and completeness of genome sequences has been improved dramatically, further improvements are required when working with non-frequently sequenced organisms like Mycoplasma bovis. As an important primary respiratory pathogen in cattle, rapid M. bovis diagnostics is crucial to allow timely and targeted disease control and prevention. Current complete diagnostics (including identification, strain typing, and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) detection) require combined culture-based and molecular approaches, of which the first can take 1-2 weeks. At present, cheap and quick long read all-in-one WGS approaches can only be implemented if increased accuracies and genome completeness can be obtained.Results:Here, a taxon-specific custom-trained Bonito v.0.1.3 basecalling model (custom-pg45) was implemented in various WGS assembly bioinformatics pipelines. Using MinION sequencing data, we showed improved consensus accuracies up to Q45.2 and Q46.7 for reference-based and Canu de novo assembled M. bovis genomes, respectively. Furthermore, the custom-pg45 model resulted in mean consensus accuracies of Q45.0 and genome completeness of 94.6% for nine M. bovis field strains. Improvements were also observed for the single-use Flongle sequencer (mean Q36.0 accuracies and 80.3% genome completeness).Conclusions:These results implicate that taxon-specific basecalling of MinION and single-use Flongle Nanopore long reads are of great value to be implemented in rapid all-in-one WGS tools as evidenced for Mycoplasma bovis as an example.",33176691,PMC7661149,10.1186/s12859-020-03856-0,18
SpaRC: scalable sequence clustering using Apache Spark,"Motivation:Whole genome shotgun based next-generation transcriptomics and metagenomics studies often generate 100-1000 GB sequence data derived from tens of thousands of different genes or microbial species. Assembly of these data sets requires tradeoffs between scalability and accuracy. Current assembly methods optimized for scalability often sacrifice accuracy and vice versa. An ideal solution would both scale and produce optimal accuracy for individual genes or genomes.Results:Here we describe an Apache Spark-based scalable sequence clustering application, SparkReadClust (SpaRC), that partitions reads based on their molecule of origin to enable downstream assembly optimization. SpaRC produces high clustering performance on transcriptomes and metagenomes from both short and long read sequencing technologies. It achieves near-linear scalability with input data size and number of compute nodes. SpaRC can run on both cloud computing and HPC environments without modification while delivering similar performance. Our results demonstrate that SpaRC provides a scalable solution for clustering billions of reads from next-generation sequencing experiments, and Apache Spark represents a cost-effective solution with rapid development/deployment cycles for similar large-scale sequence data analysis problems.Availability and implementation:https://bitbucket.org/berkeleylab/jgi-sparc.",30816928,,10.1093/bioinformatics/bty733,5
Fast Short Read De-Novo Assembly Using Overlap-Layout-Consensus Approach,"The de-novo genome assembly is a challenging computational problem for which several pipelines have been developed. The advent of long-read sequencing technology has resulted in a new set of algorithmic approaches for the assembly process. In this work, we identify that one of these new and fast long-read assembly techniques (using Minimap2 and Miniasm) can be modified for the short-read assembly process. This possibility motivated us to customize a long-read assembly approach for applications in a short-read assembly scenario. Here, we compare and contrast our proposed de-novo assembly pipeline (MiniSR) with three other recently developed programs for the assembly of bacterial and small eukaryotic genomes. We have documented two trade-offs: one between speed and accuracy and the other between contiguity and base-calling errors. Our proposed assembly pipeline shows a good balance in these trade-offs. The resulting pipeline is 6 and 2.2 times faster than the short-read assemblers Spades and SGA, respectively. MiniSR generates assemblies of superior N50 and NGA50 to SGA, although assemblies are less complete and accurate than those from Spades. A third tool, SOAPdenovo2, is as fast as our proposed pipeline but had poorer assembly quality.",30307874,,10.1109/TCBB.2018.2875479,3
"A rapid, cost-effective tailed amplicon method for sequencing SARS-CoV-2","Background:The global COVID-19 pandemic has led to an urgent need for scalable methods for clinical diagnostics and viral tracking. Next generation sequencing technologies have enabled large-scale genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 as thousands of isolates are being sequenced around the world and deposited in public data repositories. A number of methods using both short- and long-read technologies are currently being applied for SARS-CoV-2 sequencing, including amplicon approaches, metagenomic methods, and sequence capture or enrichment methods. Given the small genome size, the ability to sequence SARS-CoV-2 at scale is limited by the cost and labor associated with making sequencing libraries.Results:Here we describe a low-cost, streamlined, all amplicon-based method for sequencing SARS-CoV-2, which bypasses costly and time-consuming library preparation steps. We benchmark this tailed amplicon method against both the ARTIC amplicon protocol and sequence capture approaches and show that an optimized tailed amplicon approach achieves comparable amplicon balance, coverage metrics, and variant calls to the ARTIC v3 approach.Conclusions:The tailed amplicon method we describe represents a cost-effective and highly scalable method for SARS-CoV-2 sequencing.",33276717,PMC7716288,10.1186/s12864-020-07283-6,48
MAMnet: detecting and genotyping deletions and insertions based on long reads and a deep learning approach,"Structural variations (SVs) play important roles in human genetic diversity; deletions and insertions are two common types of SVs that have been proven to be associated with genetic diseases. Hence, accurately detecting and genotyping SVs is significant for disease research. Despite the fact that long-read sequencing technologies have improved the field of SV detection and genotyping, there are still some challenges that prevent satisfactory results from being obtained. In this paper, we propose MAMnet, a fast and scalable SV detection and genotyping method based on long reads and a combination of convolutional neural network and long short-term network. MAMnet uses a deep neural network to implement sensitive SV detection with a novel prediction strategy. On real long-read sequencing datasets, we demonstrate that MAMnet outperforms Sniffles, SVIM, cuteSV and PBSV in terms of their F1 scores while achieving better scaling performance.

Genome-wide reconstruction of complex structural variants using read clouds,"In read cloud approaches, microfluidic partitioning of long genomic DNA fragments and barcoding of shorter fragments derived from these fragments retains long-range information in short sequencing reads. This combination of short reads with long-range information represents a powerful alternative to single-molecule long-read sequencing. We develop Genome-wide Reconstruction of Complex Structural Variants (GROC-SVs) for SV detection and assembly from read cloud data and apply this method to Illumina-sequenced 10x Genomics sarcoma and breast cancer data sets. Compared with short-fragment sequencing, GROC-SVs substantially improves the specificity of breakpoint detection at comparable sensitivity. This approach also performs sequence assembly across multiple breakpoints simultaneously, enabling the reconstruction of events exhibiting remarkable complexity. We show that chromothriptic rearrangements occurred before copy number amplifications, and that rates of single-nucleotide variants and SVs are not correlated. Our results support the use of read cloud approaches to advance the characterization of large and complex structural variation.",28714986,PMC5578891,10.1038/nmeth.4366,64
CoLoRMap: Correcting Long Reads by Mapping short reads,"Motivation:Second generation sequencing technologies paved the way to an exceptional increase in the number of sequenced genomes, both prokaryotic and eukaryotic. However, short reads are difficult to assemble and often lead to highly fragmented assemblies. The recent developments in long reads sequencing methods offer a promising way to address this issue. However, so far long reads are characterized by a high error rate, and assembling from long reads require a high depth of coverage. This motivates the development of hybrid approaches that leverage the high quality of short reads to correct errors in long reads.Results:We introduce CoLoRMap, a hybrid method for correcting noisy long reads, such as the ones produced by PacBio sequencing technology, using high-quality Illumina paired-end reads mapped onto the long reads. Our algorithm is based on two novel ideas: using a classical shortest path algorithm to find a sequence of overlapping short reads that minimizes the edit score to a long read and extending corrected regions by local assembly of unmapped mates of mapped short reads. Our results on bacterial, fungal and insect data sets show that CoLoRMap compares well with existing hybrid correction methods.Availability and implementation:The source code of CoLoRMap is freely available for non-commercial use at https://github.com/sfu-compbio/colormapContact:ehaghshe@sfu.ca or cedric.chauve@sfu.caSupplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",27587673,,10.1093/bioinformatics/btw463,21

The Guppy ""flip-flop"" base caller and tandem-genotypes tandem repeat caller are efficient for large-scale tandem repeat assessment, but base calling and alignment challenges persist. We present NanoSatellite, which analyzes tandem repeats directly on electric current data and improves calling of GC-rich tandem repeats, expanded alleles, and motif interruptions.",31727106,PMC6857246,10.1186/s13059-019-1856-3,39
Integrating Hi-C links with assembly graphs for chromosome-scale assembly,"Long-read sequencing and novel long-range assays have revolutionized de novo genome assembly by automating the reconstruction of reference-quality genomes. In particular, Hi-C sequencing is becoming an economical method for generating chromosome-scale scaffolds. Despite its increasing popularity, there are limited open-source tools available. Errors, particularly inversions and fusions across chromosomes, remain higher than alternate scaffolding technologies. We present a novel open-source Hi-C scaffolder that does not require an a priori estimate of chromosome number and minimizes errors by scaffolding with the assistance of an assembly graph. We demonstrate higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art methods across a variety of Hi-C library preparations and input assembly sizes.

Halcyon: an accurate basecaller exploiting an encoder-decoder model with monotonic attention,"Motivation:In recent years, nanopore sequencing technology has enabled inexpensive long-read sequencing, which promises reads longer than a few thousand bases. Such long-read sequences contribute to the precise detection of structural variations and accurate haplotype phasing. However, deciphering precise DNA sequences from noisy and complicated nanopore raw signals remains a crucial demand for downstream analyses based on higher-quality nanopore sequencing, although various basecallers have been introduced to date.Results:To address this need, we developed a novel basecaller, Halcyon, that incorporates neural-network techniques frequently used in the field of machine translation. Our model employs monotonic-attention mechanisms to learn semantic correspondences between nucleotides and signal levels without any pre-segmentation against input signals. We evaluated performance with a human whole-genome sequencing dataset and demonstrated that Halcyon outperformed existing third-party basecallers and achieved competitive performance against the latest Oxford Nanopore Technologies' basecallers.Availabilityand implementation:The source code (halcyon) can be found at https://github.com/relastle/halcyon.",33165508,PMC8189681,10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa953,7
Complete genome sequences of pooled genomic DNA from 10 marine bacteria using PacBio long-read sequencing,"Background:High-quality, completed genomes are important to understand the functions of marine bacteria. PacBio sequencing technology provides a powerful way to obtain high-quality completed genomes. However individual library production is currently still costly, limiting the utility of the PacBio system for high-throughput genomics. Here we investigate how to generate high-quality genomes from pooled marine bacterial genomes.Results:Pooled genomic DNA from 10 marine bacteria were subjected to a single library production and sequenced with eight SMRT cells on the PacBio RS II sequencing platform. In total, 7.35 Gbp of long-read data was generated, which is equivalent to an approximate 168× average coverage for the input genomes. Genome assembly showed that eight genomes with average nucleotide identities (ANI) lower than 91.4% can be assembled with high-quality and completion using standard assembly algorithms (e.g. HGAP or Canu). A reference-based reads phasing step was developed and incorporated to assemble the complete genomes of the remaining two marine bacteria that had an ANI > 97% and whose initial assemblies were highly fragmented.Conclusions:Ten complete high-quality genomes of marine bacteria were generated. The findings and developments made here, including the reference-based read phasing approach for the assembly of highly similar genomes, can be used in the future to design strategies to sequence pooled genomes using long-read sequencing.",31129166,,10.1016/j.margen.2019.05.002,4
"Combination of short-read, long-read, and optical mapping assemblies reveals large-scale tandem repeat arrays with population genetic implications","Accurate and contiguous genome assembly is key to a comprehensive understanding of the processes shaping genomic diversity and evolution. Yet, it is frequently constrained by constitutive heterochromatin, usually characterized by highly repetitive DNA. As a key feature of genome architecture associated with centromeric and subtelomeric regions, it locally influences meiotic recombination. In this study, we assess the impact of large tandem repeat arrays on the recombination rate landscape in an avian speciation model, the Eurasian crow. We assembled two high-quality genome references using single-molecule real-time sequencing (long-read assembly [LR]) and single-molecule optical maps (optical map assembly [OM]). A three-way comparison including the published short-read assembly (SR) constructed for the same individual allowed assessing assembly properties and pinpointing misassemblies. By combining information from all three assemblies, we characterized 36 previously unidentified large repetitive regions in the proximity of sequence assembly breakpoints, the majority of which contained complex arrays of a 14-kb satellite repeat or its 1.2-kb subunit. Using whole-genome population resequencing data, we estimated the population-scaled recombination rate (ρ) and found it to be significantly reduced in these regions. These findings are consistent with an effect of low recombination in regions adjacent to centromeric or subtelomeric heterochromatin and add to our understanding of the processes generating widespread heterogeneity in genetic diversity and differentiation along the genome. By combining three different technologies, our results highlight the importance of adding a layer of information on genome structure that is inaccessible to each approach independently.",28360231,PMC5411765,10.1101/gr.215095.116,36
MsPAC: a tool for haplotype-phased structural variant detection,"Summary:While next-generation sequencing (NGS) has dramatically increased the availability of genomic data, phased genome assembly and structural variant (SV) analyses are limited by NGS read lengths. Long-read sequencing from Pacific Biosciences and NGS barcoding from 10x Genomics hold the potential for far more comprehensive views of individual genomes. Here, we present MsPAC, a tool that combines both technologies to partition reads, assemble haplotypes (via existing software) and convert assemblies into high-quality, phased SV predictions. MsPAC represents a framework for haplotype-resolved SV calls that moves one step closer to fully resolved, diploid genomes.Availability and implementation:https://github.com/oscarlr/MsPAC.Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",31397844,PMC7523683,10.1093/bioinformatics/btz618,11
invMap: a sensitive mapping tool for long noisy reads with inversion structural variants,"Motivation:Longer reads produced by PacBio or Oxford Nanopore sequencers could more frequently span the breakpoints of structural variations (SVs) than shorter reads. Therefore, existing long-read mapping methods often generate wrong alignments and variant calls. Compared to deletions and insertions, inversion events are more difficult to be detected since the anchors in inversion regions are nonlinear to those in SV-free regions. To address this issue, this study presents a novel long-read mapping algorithm (named as invMap).Results:For each long noisy read, invMap first locates the aligned region with a specifically designed scoring method for chaining, then checks the remaining anchors in the aligned region to discover potential inversions. We benchmark invMap on simulated datasets across different genomes and sequencing coverages, experimental results demonstrate that invMap is more accurate to locate aligned regions and call SVs for inversions than the competing methods. The real human genome sequencing dataset of NA12878 illustrates that invMap can effectively find more candidate variant calls for inversions than the competing methods.Availability and implementation:The invMap software is available at https://github.com/zhang134/invMap.git.",38058196,,10.1093/bioinformatics/btad726,0
Nanopore-based single molecule sequencing of the D4Z4 array responsible for facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy,"Subtelomeric macrosatellite repeats are difficult to sequence using conventional sequencing methods owing to the high similarity among repeat units and high GC content. Sequencing these repetitive regions is challenging, even with recent improvements in sequencing technologies. Among these repeats, a haplotype carrying a particular sequence and shortening of the D4Z4 array on human chromosome 4q35 causes one of the most prevalent forms of muscular dystrophy with autosomal-dominant inheritance, facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD). Here, we applied a nanopore-based ultra-long read sequencer to sequence a BAC clone containing 13 D4Z4 repeats and flanking regions. We successfully obtained the whole D4Z4 repeat sequence, including the pathogenic gene DUX4 in the last D4Z4 repeat. The estimated sequence accuracy of the total repeat region was 99.8% based on a comparison with the reference sequence. Errors were typically observed between purine or between pyrimidine bases. Further, we analyzed the D4Z4 sequence from publicly available ultra-long whole human genome sequencing data obtained by nanopore sequencing. This technology may be a new tool for studying D4Z4 repeats and pathomechanism of FSHD in the future and has the potential to widen our understanding of subtelomeric regions.",29093467,PMC5665936,10.1038/s41598-017-13712-6,26
An improved genome assembly uncovers prolific tandem repeats in Atlantic cod,"Background:The first Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) genome assembly published in 2011 was one of the early genome assemblies exclusively based on high-throughput 454 pyrosequencing. Since then, rapid advances in sequencing technologies have led to a multitude of assemblies generated for complex genomes, although many of these are of a fragmented nature with a significant fraction of bases in gaps. The development of long-read sequencing and improved software now enable the generation of more contiguous genome assemblies.Results:By combining data from Illumina, 454 and the longer PacBio sequencing technologies, as well as integrating the results of multiple assembly programs, we have created a substantially improved version of the Atlantic cod genome assembly. The sequence contiguity of this assembly is increased fifty-fold and the proportion of gap-bases has been reduced fifteen-fold. Compared to other vertebrates, the assembly contains an unusual high density of tandem repeats (TRs). Indeed, retrospective analyses reveal that gaps in the first genome assembly were largely associated with these TRs. We show that 21% of the TRs across the assembly, 19% in the promoter regions and 12% in the coding sequences are heterozygous in the sequenced individual.Conclusions:The inclusion of PacBio reads combined with the use of multiple assembly programs drastically improved the Atlantic cod genome assembly by successfully resolving long TRs. The high frequency of heterozygous TRs within or in the vicinity of genes in the genome indicate a considerable standing genomic variation in Atlantic cod populations, which is likely of evolutionary importance.",28100185,PMC5241972,10.1186/s12864-016-3448-x,77
Assembling the perfect bacterial genome using Oxford Nanopore and Illumina sequencing,"A perfect bacterial genome assembly is one where the assembled sequence is an exact match for the organism's genome-each replicon sequence is complete and contains no errors. While this has been difficult to achieve in the past, improvements in long-read sequencing, assemblers, and polishers have brought perfect assemblies within reach. Here, we describe our recommended approach for assembling a bacterial genome to perfection using a combination of Oxford Nanopore Technologies long reads and Illumina short reads: Trycycler long-read assembly, Medaka long-read polishing, Polypolish short-read polishing, followed by other short-read polishing tools and manual curation. We also discuss potential pitfalls one might encounter when assembling challenging genomes, and we provide an online tutorial with sample data (github.com/rrwick/perfect-bacterial-genome-tutorial).",36862631,PMC9980784,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010905,26
Detection of single nucleotide and copy number variants in the Fabry disease-associated GLA gene using nanopore sequencing,"More than 900 variants have been described in the GLA gene. Some intronic variants and copy number variants in GLA can cause Fabry disease but will not be detected by classical Sanger sequence. We aimed to design and validate a method for sequencing the GLA gene using long-read Oxford Nanopore sequencing technology. Twelve Fabry patients were blindly analyzed, both by conventional Sanger sequence and by long-read sequencing of a 13 kb PCR amplicon. We used minimap2 to align the long-read data and Nanopolish and Sniffles to call variants. All the variants detected by Sanger (including a deep intronic variant) were also detected by long-read sequencing. One patient had a deletion that was not detected by Sanger sequencing but was detected by the new technology. Our long-read sequencing-based method was able to detect missense variants and an exonic deletion, with the added advantage of intronic analysis. It can be used as an efficient and cost-effective tool for screening and diagnosing Fabry disease.",34785703,PMC8595663,10.1038/s41598-021-01749-7,7
Microbial Genome Sequencing and Assembly Using Nanopore Sequencers,"Microbial genomes are typically several million base pairs in length and are relatively easy to sequence and assemble into a single chromosome, given the advances in long-read sequencing platforms such as that of Oxford Nanopore Technologies.

Identifying and removing haplotypic duplication in primary genome assemblies,"Motivation:Rapid development in long-read sequencing and scaffolding technologies is accelerating the production of reference-quality assemblies for large eukaryotic genomes. However, haplotype divergence in regions of high heterozygosity often results in assemblers creating two copies rather than one copy of a region, leading to breaks in contiguity and compromising downstream steps such as gene annotation. Several tools have been developed to resolve this problem. However, they either focus only on removing contained duplicate regions, also known as haplotigs, or fail to use all the relevant information and hence make errors.Results:Here we present a novel tool, purge_dups, that uses sequence similarity and read depth to automatically identify and remove both haplotigs and heterozygous overlaps. In comparison with current tools, we demonstrate that purge_dups can reduce heterozygous duplication and increase assembly continuity while maintaining completeness of the primary assembly. Moreover, purge_dups is fully automatic and can easily be integrated into assembly pipelines.Availability and implementation:The source code is written in C and is available at https://github.com/dfguan/purge_dups.Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",31971576,PMC7203741,10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa025,669
Time-course profiling of bovine alphaherpesvirus 1.1 transcriptome using multiplatform sequencing,"Long-read sequencing (LRS) has become a standard approach for transcriptome analysis in recent years. Bovine alphaherpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1) is an important pathogen of cattle worldwide. This study reports the profiling of the dynamic lytic transcriptome of BoHV-1 using two long-read sequencing (LRS) techniques, the Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION, and the LoopSeq synthetic LRS methods, using multiple library preparation protocols. In this work, we annotated viral mRNAs and non-coding transcripts, and a large number of transcript isoforms, including transcription start and end sites, as well as splice variants of BoHV-1. Our analysis demonstrated an extremely complex pattern of transcriptional overlaps.",33235226,PMC7686369,10.1038/s41598-020-77520-1,8
SMRT-Cappable-seq reveals complex operon variants in bacteria,"Current methods for genome-wide analysis of gene expression require fragmentation of original transcripts into small fragments for short-read sequencing. In bacteria, the resulting fragmented information hides operon complexity. Additionally, in vivo processing of transcripts confounds the accurate identification of the 5' and 3' ends of operons. Here we develop a methodology called SMRT-Cappable-seq that combines the isolation of un-fragmented primary transcripts with single-molecule long read sequencing. Applied to E. coli, this technology results in an accurate definition of the transcriptome with 34% of known operons from RegulonDB being extended by at least one gene. Furthermore, 40% of transcription termination sites have read-through that alters the gene content of the operons. As a result, most of the bacterial genes are present in multiple operon variants reminiscent of eukaryotic splicing. By providing such granularity in the operon structure, this study represents an important resource for the study of prokaryotic gene network and regulation.",30201986,PMC6131387,10.1038/s41467-018-05997-6,52
RODAN: a fully convolutional architecture for basecalling nanopore RNA sequencing data,"Background:Despite recent progress in basecalling of Oxford nanopore DNA sequencing data, its wide adoption is still being hampered by its relatively low accuracy compared to short read technologies. Furthermore, very little of the recent research was focused on basecalling of RNA data, which has different characteristics than its DNA counterpart.Results:We fill this gap by benchmarking a fully convolutional deep learning basecalling architecture with improved performance compared to Oxford nanopore's RNA basecallers.Availability:The source code for our basecaller is available at: https://github.com/biodlab/RODAN .",35443610,PMC9020074,10.1186/s12859-022-04686-y,5
Strain-level metagenomic assignment and compositional estimation for long reads with MetaMaps,"Metagenomic sequence classification should be fast, accurate and information-rich. Emerging long-read sequencing technologies promise to improve the balance between these factors but most existing methods were designed for short reads. MetaMaps is a new method, specifically developed for long reads, capable of mapping a long-read metagenome to a comprehensive RefSeq database with >12,000 genomes in <16 GB or RAM on a laptop computer. Integrating approximate mapping with probabilistic scoring and EM-based estimation of sample composition, MetaMaps achieves >94% accuracy for species-level read assignment and r2> 0.97 for the estimation of sample composition on both simulated and real data when the sample genomes or close relatives are present in the classification database. To address novel species and genera, which are comparatively harder to predict, MetaMaps outputs mapping locations and qualities for all classified reads, enabling functional studies (e.g. gene presence/absence) and detection of incongruities between sample and reference genomes.",31296857,PMC6624308,10.1038/s41467-019-10934-2,63
Plasmids Shaped the Recent Emergence of the Major Nosocomial Pathogen Enterococcus faecium,"Enterococcus faeciumis a gut commensal of humans and animals but is also listed on the WHO global priority list of multidrug-resistant pathogens. Many of its antibiotic resistance traits reside on plasmids and have the potential to be disseminated by horizontal gene transfer. Here, we present the first comprehensive population-wide analysis of the pan-plasmidome of a clinically important bacterium, by whole-genome sequence analysis of 1,644 isolates from hospital, commensal, and animal sources ofE. faeciumLong-read sequencing on a selection of isolates resulted in the completion of 305 plasmids that exhibited high levels of sequence modularity. We further investigated the entirety of all plasmids of each isolate (plasmidome) using a combination of short-read sequencing and machine-learning classifiers. Clustering of the plasmid sequences unraveled differentE. faeciumpopulations with a clear association with hospitalized patient isolates, suggesting different optimal configurations of plasmids in the hospital environment. The characterization of these populations allowed us to identify common mechanisms of plasmid stabilization such as toxin-antitoxin systems and genes exclusively present in particular plasmidome populations exemplified by copper resistance, phosphotransferase systems, or bacteriocin genes potentially involved in niche adaptation. Based on the distribution of k-mer distances between isolates, we concluded that plasmidomes rather than chromosomes are most informative for source specificity ofE. faeciumIMPORTANCEEnterococcus faeciumis one of the most frequent nosocomial pathogens of hospital-acquired infections.E. faeciumhas gained resistance against most commonly available antibiotics, most notably, against ampicillin, gentamicin, and vancomycin, which renders infections difficult to treat. Many antibiotic resistance traits, in particular, vancomycin resistance, can be encoded in autonomous and extrachromosomal elements called plasmids. These sequences can be disseminated to other isolates by horizontal gene transfer and confer novel mechanisms to source specificity. In our study, we elucidated the total plasmid content, referred to as the plasmidome, of 1,644E. faeciumisolates by using short- and long-read whole-genome technologies with the combination of a machine-learning classifier. This was fundamental to investigate the full collection of plasmid sequences present in our collection (pan-plasmidome) and to observe the potential transfer of plasmid sequences betweenE. faeciumhosts. We observed thatE. faeciumisolates from hospitalized patients carried a larger number of plasmid sequences compared to that from other sources, and they elucidated different configurations of plasmidome populations in the hospital environment. We assessed the contribution of different genomic components and observed that plasmid sequences have the highest contribution to source specificity. Our study suggests thatE. faeciumplasmids are regulated by complex ecological constraints rather than physical interaction between hosts.",32047136,PMC7018651,10.1128/mBio.03284-19,59
"Single-molecule DNA sequencing of widely varying GC-content using nucleotide release, capture and detection in microdroplets","Despite remarkable progress in DNA sequencing technologies there remains a trade-off between short-read platforms, having limited ability to sequence homopolymers, repeated motifs or long-range structural variation, and long-read platforms, which tend to have lower accuracy and/or throughput. Moreover, current methods do not allow direct readout of epigenetic modifications from a single read. With the aim of addressing these limitations, we have developed an optical electrowetting sequencing platform that uses step-wise nucleotide triphosphate (dNTP) release, capture and detection in microdroplets from single DNA molecules. Each microdroplet serves as a reaction vessel that identifies an individual dNTP based on a robust fluorescence signal, with the detection chemistry extended to enable detection of 5-methylcytosine. Our platform uses small reagent volumes and inexpensive equipment, paving the way to cost-effective single-molecule DNA sequencing, capable of handling widely varying GC-bias, and demonstrating direct detection of epigenetic modifications.",33152076,PMC7736801,10.1093/nar/gkaa987,1
New algorithms for accurate and efficient de novo genome assembly from long DNA sequencing reads,"Building de novo genome assemblies for complex genomes is possible thanks to long-read DNA sequencing technologies. However, maximizing the quality of assemblies based on long reads is a challenging task that requires the development of specialized data analysis techniques. We present new algorithms for assembling long DNA sequencing reads from haploid and diploid organisms. The assembly algorithm builds an undirected graph with two vertices for each read based on minimizers selected by a hash function derived from the k-mer distribution. Statistics collected during the graph construction are used as features to build layout paths by selecting edges, ranked by a likelihood function. For diploid samples, we integrated a reimplementation of the ReFHap algorithm to perform molecular phasing. We ran the implemented algorithms on PacBio HiFi and Nanopore sequencing data taken from haploid and diploid samples of different species. Our algorithms showed competitive accuracy and computational efficiency, compared with other currently used software. We expect that this new development will be useful for researchers building genome assemblies for different species.",36813568,PMC9946810,10.26508/lsa.202201719,2

"Comparison of MiSeq, MinION, and hybrid genome sequencing for analysis of Campylobacter jejuni","The sequencing, assembly, and analysis of bacterial genomes is central to tracking and characterizing foodborne pathogens. The bulk of bacterial genome sequencing at the US Food and Drug Administration is performed using short-read Illumina MiSeq technology, resulting in highly accurate but fragmented genomic sequences. The MinION sequencer from Oxford Nanopore is an evolving technology that produces long-read sequencing data with low equipment cost. The goal of this study was to compare Campylobacter genome assemblies generated from MiSeq and MinION data independently, as well as hybrid genome assemblies combining both data types. Two reference strains and two field isolates of C. jejuni were sequenced using MiSeq and MinION, and the sequence data were assembled using the software programs SPAdes and Canu, respectively. Hybrid genome assembly was performed using the program Unicycler. Comparison of the C. jejuni 81-176 and RM1221 genome assemblies to the PacBio reference genomes revealed that the SPAdes assemblies had the most accurate nucleotide identity, while the hybrid assemblies were the most contiguous. Assemblies generated only from MinION data using Canu were the least accurate, containing many indels and substitutions that affected downstream analyses. The hybrid sequencing approach was the most useful for detecting plasmids, large genome rearrangements, and repetitive elements such as rRNA and tRNA genes. The full genomes of both C. jejuni field isolates were completed and circularized using hybrid sequencing, and a plasmid was detected in one isolate. Continued development of nanopore sequencing technologies will likely enhance the accuracy of hybrid genome assemblies and enable public health laboratories to routinely generate complete circularized bacterial genome sequences.",33707610,PMC7952698,10.1038/s41598-021-84956-6,19
MEGAN-LR: new algorithms allow accurate binning and easy interactive exploration of metagenomic long reads and contigs,"Background:There are numerous computational tools for taxonomic or functional analysis of microbiome samples, optimized to run on hundreds of millions of short, high quality sequencing reads. Programs such as MEGAN allow the user to interactively navigate these large datasets. Long read sequencing technologies continue to improve and produce increasing numbers of longer reads (of varying lengths in the range of 10k-1M bps, say), but of low quality. There is an increasing interest in using long reads in microbiome sequencing, and there is a need to adapt short read tools to long read datasets.Methods:We describe a new LCA-based algorithm for taxonomic binning, and an interval-tree based algorithm for functional binning, that are explicitly designed for long reads and assembled contigs. We provide a new interactive tool for investigating the alignment of long reads against reference sequences. For taxonomic and functional binning, we propose to use LAST to compare long reads against the NCBI-nr protein reference database so as to obtain frame-shift aware alignments, and then to process the results using our new methods.Results:All presented methods are implemented in the open source edition of MEGAN, and we refer to this new extension as MEGAN-LR (MEGAN long read). We evaluate the LAST+MEGAN-LR approach in a simulation study, and on a number of mock community datasets consisting of Nanopore reads, PacBio reads and assembled PacBio reads. We also illustrate the practical application on a Nanopore dataset that we sequenced from an anammox bio-rector community.Reviewers:This article was reviewed by Nicola Segata together with Moreno Zolfo, Pete James Lockhart and Serghei Mangul.Conclusion:This work extends the applicability of the widely-used metagenomic analysis software MEGAN to long reads. Our study suggests that the presented LAST+MEGAN-LR pipeline is sufficiently fast and accurate.",29678199,PMC5910613,10.1186/s13062-018-0208-7,75
Duet: SNP-assisted structural variant calling and phasing using Oxford nanopore sequencing,"Background:Whole genome sequencing using the long-read Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) MinION sequencer provides a cost-effective option for structural variant (SV) detection in clinical applications. Despite the advantage of using long reads, however, accurate SV calling and phasing are still challenging.Results:We introduce Duet, an SV detection tool optimized for SV calling and phasing using ONT data. The tool uses novel features integrated from both SV signatures and single-nucleotide polymorphism signatures, which can accurately distinguish SV haplotype from a false signal. Duet was benchmarked against state-of-the-art tools on multiple ONT sequencing datasets of sequencing coverage ranging from 8× to 40×. At low sequencing coverage of 8×, Duet performs better than all other tools in SV calling, SV genotyping and SV phasing. When the sequencing coverage is higher (20× to 40×), the F1-score for SV phasing is further improved in comparison to the performance of other tools, while its performance of SV genotyping and SV calling remains higher than other tools.Conclusion:Duet can perform accurate SV calling, SV genotyping and SV phasing using low-coverage ONT data, making it very useful for low-coverage genomes. It has great performance when scaled to high-coverage genomes, which is adaptable to various clinical applications. Duet is open source and is available at https://github.com/yekaizhou/duet .",36344913,PMC9639287,10.1186/s12859-022-05025-x,3
High precision genome sequencing of engineered Gluconobacter oxydans 621H by combining long nanopore and short accurate Illumina reads,"State of the art and novel high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies enable fascinating opportunities and applications in the life sciences including microbial genomics. Short high-quality read data already enable not only microbial genome sequencing, yet can be inadequately to solve problems in genome assemblies and for the analysis of structural variants, especially in engineered microbial cell factories. Single-molecule real-time sequencing technologies generating long reads promise to solve such assembly problems. In our study, we wanted to increase the average read length of long nanopore reads with R9 chemistry and conducted a hybrid approach for the analysis of structural variants to check the genome stability of a recombinant Gluconobacter oxydans 621H strain (IK003.1) engineered for improved growth. Therefore we combined accurate Illumina sequencing technology and low-cost single-molecule nanopore sequencing using the MinION®device from Oxford Nanopore. In our hybrid approach with a modified library protocol we could increase the average size of nanopore 2D reads to about 18.9kb. Combining the long MinION nanopore reads with the high quality short Illumina reads enabled the assembly of the engineered chromosome into a single contig and comprehensive detection and clarification of 7 structural variants including all three known genetically engineered modifications. We found the genome of IK003.1 was stable over 70 generations of strain handling including 28h of process time in a bioreactor. The long read data revealed a novel 1420 bp transposon-flanked and ORF-containing sequence which was hitherto unknown in the G. oxydans 621H reference. Further analysis and genome sequencing showed that this region is already present in G. oxydans 621H wild-type strains. Our data of G. oxydans 621H wild-type DNA from different resources also revealed in 73 annotated coding sequences about 91 uniform nucleotide differences including InDels. Together, our results contribute to an improved high quality genome reference for G. oxydans 621H which is available via ENA accession PRJEB18739.",28433722,,10.1016/j.jbiotec.2017.04.016,17
Enrichment by hybridisation of long DNA fragments for Nanopore sequencing,"Enrichment of DNA by hybridisation is an important tool which enables users to gather target-focused next-generation sequence data in an economical fashion. Current in-solution methods capture short fragments of around 200-300 nt, potentially missing key structural information such as recombination or translocations often found in viral or bacterial pathogens. The increasing use of long-read third-generation sequencers requires methods and protocols to be adapted for their specific requirements. Here, we present a variation of the traditional bait-capture approach which can selectively enrich large fragments of DNA or cDNA from specific bacterial and viral pathogens, for sequencing on long-read sequencers. We enriched cDNA from cultured influenza virus A, human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and genomic DNA from two strains ofMycobacterium tuberculosis(M. tb) from a background of cell line or spiked human DNA. We sequenced the enriched samples on the Oxford Nanopore MinION™ and the Illumina MiSeq platform and present an evaluation of the method, together with analysis of the sequence data. We found that unenriched influenza A and HCMV samples had no reads matching the target organism due to the high background of DNA from the cell line used to culture the pathogen. In contrast, enriched samples sequenced on the MinION™ platform had 57 % and 99 % best-quality on-target reads respectively.",28785419,PMC5537632,10.1099/mgen.0.000087,22
Do we still need Illumina sequencing data? Evaluating Oxford Nanopore Technologies R10.4.1 flow cells and the Rapid v14 library prep kit for Gram negative bacteria whole genome assemblies,"The best whole genome assemblies are currently built from a combination of highly accurate short-read sequencing data and long-read sequencing data that can bridge repetitive and problematic regions. Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) produce long-read sequencing platforms and they are continually improving their technology to obtain higher quality read data that is approaching the quality obtained from short-read platforms such as Illumina. As these innovations continue, we evaluated how much ONT read coverage produced by the Rapid Barcoding Kit v14 (SQK-RBK114) is necessary to generate high-quality hybrid and long-read-only genome assemblies for a panel of carbapenemase-producingEnterobacteralesbacterial isolates. We found that 30× long-read coverage is sufficient if Illumina data are available, and that more (at least 100× long-read coverage is recommended for long-read-only assemblies. Illumina polishing is still improving single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and INDELs in long-read-only assemblies. We also examined if antimicrobial resistance genes could be accurately identified in long-read-only data, and found that Flye assemblies regardless of ONT coverage detected >96% of resistance genes at 100% identity and length. Overall, the Rapid Barcoding Kit v14 and long-read-only assemblies can be an optimal sequencing strategy (i.e., plasmid characterization and AMR detection) but finer-scale analyses (i.e., SNV) still benefit from short-read data.",38354391,,10.1139/cjm-2023-0175,1
Nanopanel2 calls phased low-frequency variants in Nanopore panel sequencing data,"Motivation:Clinical decision making is increasingly guided by accurate and recurrent determination of presence and frequency of (somatic) variants and their haplotype through panel sequencing of disease-relevant genomic regions. Haplotype calling (phasing), however, is difficult and error prone unless variants are located on the same read which limits the ability of short-read sequencing to detect, e.g. co-occurrence of drug-resistance variants. Long-read panel sequencing enables direct phasing of amplicon variants besides having multiple other benefits, however, high error rates of current technologies prevented their applicability in the past.Results:We have developed Nanopanel2, a variant caller for Nanopore panel sequencing data. Nanopanel2 works directly on base-called FAST5 files and uses allele probability distributions and several other filters to robustly separate true from false positive (FP) calls. It effectively calls SNVs and INDELs with variant allele frequencies as low as 1% and 5%, respectively, and produces only few low-frequency false-positive calls (∼1 FP call with VAF<5% per kb amplicon). Haplotype compositions are then determined by direct phasing. Nanopanel2 is the first somatic variant caller for Nanopore data, enabling accurate, fast (turnaround <48 h) and cheap (sequencing costs ∼10$/sample) diagnostic workflows.Availabilityand implementation:The data for this study have been deposited at zenodo.org under DOIs accession numbers 4110691 and 4110698. Nanopanel2 is open source and available at https://github.com/popitsch/nanopanel2.Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",34270680,,10.1093/bioinformatics/btab526,1
Hybrid metagenomic assembly enables high-resolution analysis of resistance determinants and mobile elements in human microbiomes,"Characterization of microbiomes has been enabled by high-throughput metagenomic sequencing. However, existing methods are not designed to combine reads from short- and long-read technologies. We present a hybrid metagenomic assembler named OPERA-MS that integrates assembly-based metagenome clustering with repeat-aware, exact scaffolding to accurately assemble complex communities. Evaluation using defined in vitro and virtual gut microbiomes revealed that OPERA-MS assembles metagenomes with greater base pair accuracy than long-read (>5×; Canu), higher contiguity than short-read (~10× NGA50; MEGAHIT, IDBA-UD, metaSPAdes) and fewer assembly errors than non-metagenomic hybrid assemblers (2×; hybridSPAdes). OPERA-MS provides strain-resolved assembly in the presence of multiple genomes of the same species, high-quality reference genomes for rare species (<1%) with ~9× long-read coverage and near-complete genomes with higher coverage. We used OPERA-MS to assemble 28 gut metagenomes of antibiotic-treated patients, and showed that the inclusion of long nanopore reads produces more contiguous assemblies (200× improvement over short-read assemblies), including more than 80 closed plasmid or phage sequences and a new 263 kbp jumbo phage. High-quality hybrid assemblies enable an exquisitely detailed view of the gut resistome in human patients.",31359005,,10.1038/s41587-019-0191-2,120
Reference Genome for the Highly TransformableSetaria viridisME034V,"Setaria viridis(green foxtail) is an important model system for improving cereal crops due to its diploid genome, ease of cultivation, and use of C4photosynthesis. TheS. viridisaccession ME034V is exceptionally transformable, but the lack of a sequenced genome for this accession has limited its utility. We present a 397 Mb highly contiguousde novoassembly of ME034V using ultra-long nanopore sequencing technology (read N50 = 41kb). We estimate that this genome is largely complete based on our updated k-mer based genome size estimate of 401 Mb forS. viridisGenome annotation identified 37,908 protein-coding genes and >300k repetitive elements comprising 46% of the genome. We compared the ME034V assembly with two other previously sequencedSetariagenomes as well as to a diversity panel of 235S. viridisaccessions. We found the genome assemblies to be largely syntenic, but numerous unique polymorphic structural variants were discovered. Several ME034V deletions may be associated with recent retrotransposition ofcopiaandgypsyLTR repeat families, as evidenced by their low genotype frequencies in the sampled population. Lastly, we performed a phylogenomic analysis to identify gene families that have expanded inSetaria, including those involved in specialized metabolism and plant defense response. The high continuity of the ME034V genome assembly validates the utility of ultra-long DNA sequencing to improve genetic resources for emerging model organisms. Structural variation present inSetariaillustrates the importance of obtaining the proper genome reference for genetic experiments. Thus, we anticipate that the ME034V genome will be of significant utility for theSetariaresearch community.",32694197,PMC7534418,10.1534/g3.120.401345,20
Transcriptional fates of human-specific segmental duplications in brain,"Despite the importance of duplicate genes for evolutionary adaptation, accurate gene annotation is often incomplete, incorrect, or lacking in regions of segmental duplication. We developed an approach combining long-read sequencing and hybridization capture to yield full-length transcript information and confidently distinguish between nearly identical genes/paralogs. We used biotinylated probes to enrich for full-length cDNA from duplicated regions, which were then amplified, size-fractionated, and sequenced using single-molecule, long-read sequencing technology, permitting us to distinguish between highly identical genes by virtue of multiple paralogous sequence variants. We examined 19 gene families as expressed in developing and adult human brain, selected for their high sequence identity (average >99%) and overlap with human-specific segmental duplications (SDs). We characterized the transcriptional differences between related paralogs to better understand the birth-death process of duplicate genes and particularly how the process leads to gene innovation. In 48% of the cases, we find that the expressed duplicates have changed substantially from their ancestral models due to novel sites of transcription initiation, splicing, and polyadenylation, as well as fusion transcripts that connect duplication-derived exons with neighboring genes. We detect unannotated open reading frames in genes currently annotated as pseudogenes, while relegating other duplicates to nonfunctional status. Our method significantly improves gene annotation, specifically defining full-length transcripts, isoforms, and open reading frames for new genes in highly identical SDs. The approach will be more broadly applicable to genes in structurally complex regions of other genomes where the duplication process creates novel genes important for adaptive traits.",30228200,PMC6169893,10.1101/gr.237610.118,34
"How complete are ""complete"" genome assemblies?-An avian perspective","The genomics revolution has led to the sequencing of a large variety of nonmodel organisms often referred to as ""whole"" or ""complete"" genome assemblies. But how complete are these, really? Here, we use birds as an example for nonmodel vertebrates and find that, although suitable in principle for genomic studies, the current standard of short-read assemblies misses a significant proportion of the expected genome size (7% to 42%; mean 20 ± 9%). In particular, regions with strongly deviating nucleotide composition (e.g., guanine-cytosine-[GC]-rich) and regions highly enriched in repetitive DNA (e.g., transposable elements and satellite DNA) are usually underrepresented in assemblies. However, long-read sequencing technologies successfully characterize many of these underrepresented GC-rich or repeat-rich regions in several bird genomes. For instance, only ~2% of the expected total base pairs are missing in the last chicken reference (galGal5). These assemblies still contain thousands of gaps (i.e., fragmented sequences) because some chromosomal structures (e.g., centromeres) likely contain arrays of repetitive DNA that are too long to bridge with currently available technologies. We discuss how to minimize the number of assembly gaps by combining the latest available technologies with complementary strengths. At last, we emphasize the importance of knowing the location, size and potential content of assembly gaps when making population genetic inferences about adjacent genomic regions.",30035372,,10.1111/1755-0998.12933,56
Flexible and Scalable Full-Length CYP2D6 Long Amplicon PacBio Sequencing,"Cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) is among the most important genes involved in drug metabolism. Specific variants are associated with changes in the enzyme's amount and activity. Multiple technologies exist to determine these variants, like the AmpliChip CYP450 test, Taqman qPCR, or Second-Generation Sequencing, however, sequence homology between cytochrome P450 genes and pseudogene CYP2D7 impairs reliable CYP2D6 genotyping, and variant phasing cannot accurately be determined using these assays. To circumvent this, we sequenced CYP2D6 using the Pacific Biosciences RSII and obtained high-quality, full-length, phased CYP2D6 sequences, enabling accurate variant calling and haplotyping of the entire gene-locus including exonic, intronic, and upstream and downstream regions. Unphased diplotypes (Roche AmpliChip CYP450 test) were confirmed for 24 of the 25 samples, including gene duplications. Cases with gene deletions required additional specific assays to resolve. In total, 61 unique variants were detected, including variants that had not previously been associated with specific haplotypes. To further aid genomic analysis using standard reference sequences, we have established an LOVD-powered CYP2D6 gene-variant database, and added all reference haplotypes and data reported here. We conclude that our CYP2D6 genotyping approach produces reliable CYP2D6 diplotypes and reveals information about additional variants, including phasing and copy-number variation.",28044414,PMC5324676,10.1002/humu.23166,31
"Metagenomics workflow for hybrid assembly, differential coverage binning, metatranscriptomics and pathway analysis (MUFFIN)","Metagenomics has redefined many areas of microbiology. However, metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) are often fragmented, primarily when sequencing was performed with short reads. Recent long-read sequencing technologies promise to improve genome reconstruction. However, the integration of two different sequencing modalities makes downstream analyses complex. We, therefore, developed MUFFIN, a complete metagenomic workflow that uses short and long reads to produce high-quality bins and their annotations. The workflow is written by using Nextflow, a workflow orchestration software, to achieve high reproducibility and fast and straightforward use. This workflow also produces the taxonomic classification and KEGG pathways of the bins and can be further used for quantification and annotation by providing RNA-Seq data (optionally). We tested the workflow using twenty biogas reactor samples and assessed the capacity of MUFFIN to process and output relevant files needed to analyze the microbial community and their function. MUFFIN produces functional pathway predictions and, if provided de novo metatranscript annotations across the metagenomic sample and for each bin. MUFFIN is available on github under GNUv3 licence: https://github.com/RVanDamme/MUFFIN.",33561126,PMC7899367,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008716,10
A hybrid and scalable error correction algorithm for indel and substitution errors of long reads,"Background:Long-read sequencing has shown the promises to overcome the short length limitations of second-generation sequencing by providing more complete assembly. However, the computation of the long sequencing reads is challenged by their higher error rates (e.g., 13% vs. 1%) and higher cost ($0.3 vs. $0.03 per Mbp) compared to the short reads.Methods:In this paper, we present a new hybrid error correction tool, called ParLECH (Parallel Long-read Error Correction using Hybrid methodology). The error correction algorithm of ParLECH is distributed in nature and efficiently utilizes the k-mer coverage information of high throughput Illumina short-read sequences to rectify the PacBio long-read sequences.ParLECH first constructs a de Bruijn graph from the short reads, and then replaces the indel error regions of the long reads with their corresponding widest path (or maximum min-coverage path) in the short read-based de Bruijn graph. ParLECH then utilizes the k-mer coverage information of the short reads to divide each long read into a sequence of low and high coverage regions, followed by a majority voting to rectify each substituted error base.Results:ParLECH outperforms latest state-of-the-art hybrid error correction methods on real PacBio datasets. Our experimental evaluation results demonstrate that ParLECH can correct large-scale real-world datasets in an accurate and scalable manner. ParLECH can correct the indel errors of human genome PacBio long reads (312 GB) with Illumina short reads (452 GB) in less than 29 h using 128 compute nodes. ParLECH can align more than 92% bases of an E. coli PacBio dataset with the reference genome, proving its accuracy.Conclusion:ParLECH can scale to over terabytes of sequencing data using hundreds of computing nodes. The proposed hybrid error correction methodology is novel and rectifies both indel and substitution errors present in the original long reads or newly introduced by the short reads.",31856721,PMC6923905,10.1186/s12864-019-6286-9,4
BAUM: improving genome assembly by adaptive unique mapping and local overlap-layout-consensus approach,"Motivation:It is highly desirable to assemble genomes of high continuity and consistency at low cost. The current bottleneck of draft genome continuity using the second generation sequencing (SGS) reads is primarily caused by uncertainty among repetitive sequences. Even though the single-molecule real-time sequencing technology is very promising to overcome the uncertainty issue, its relatively high cost and error rate add burden on budget or computation. Many long-read assemblers take the overlap-layout-consensus (OLC) paradigm, which is less sensitive to sequencing errors, heterozygosity and variability of coverage. However, current assemblers of SGS data do not sufficiently take advantage of the OLC approach.Results:Aiming at minimizing uncertainty, the proposed method BAUM, breaks the whole genome into regions by adaptive unique mapping; then the local OLC is used to assemble each region in parallel. BAUM can (i) perform reference-assisted assembly based on the genome of a close species (ii) or improve the results of existing assemblies that are obtained based on short or long sequencing reads. The tests on two eukaryote genomes, a wild rice Oryza longistaminata and a parrot Melopsittacus undulatus, show that BAUM achieved substantial improvement on genome size and continuity. Besides, BAUM reconstructed a considerable amount of repetitive regions that failed to be assembled by existing short read assemblers. We also propose statistical approaches to control the uncertainty in different steps of BAUM.Availability and implementation:http://www.zhanyuwang.xin/wordpress/index.php/2017/07/21/baum.Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",29346504,,10.1093/bioinformatics/bty020,9
TideHunter: efficient and sensitive tandem repeat detection from noisy long-reads using seed-and-chain,"Motivation:Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing technologies can produce long-reads up to tens of kilobases, but with high error rates. In order to reduce sequencing error, Rolling Circle Amplification (RCA) has been used to improve library preparation by amplifying circularized template molecules. Linear products of the RCA contain multiple tandem copies of the template molecule. By integrating additional in silico processing steps, these tandem sequences can be collapsed into a consensus sequence with a higher accuracy than the original raw reads. Existing pipelines using alignment-based methods to discover the tandem repeat patterns from the long-reads are either inefficient or lack sensitivity.Results:We present a novel tandem repeat detection and consensus calling tool, TideHunter, to efficiently discover tandem repeat patterns and generate high-quality consensus sequences from amplified tandemly repeated long-read sequencing data. TideHunter works with noisy long-reads (PacBio and ONT) at error rates of up to 20% and does not have any limitation of the maximal repeat pattern size. We benchmarked TideHunter using simulated and real datasets with varying error rates and repeat pattern sizes. TideHunter is tens of times faster than state-of-the-art methods and has a higher sensitivity and accuracy.Availability and implementation:TideHunter is written in C, it is open source and is available at https://github.com/yangao07/TideHunter.",31510677,PMC6612900,10.1093/bioinformatics/btz376,15
Dual isoform sequencing reveals complex transcriptomic and epitranscriptomic landscapes of a prototype baculovirus,"In this study, two long-read sequencing (LRS) techniques, MinION from Oxford Nanopore Technologies and Sequel from the Pacific Biosciences, were used for the transcriptional characterization of a prototype baculovirus, Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus. LRS is able to read full-length RNA molecules, and thereby distinguish between transcript isoforms, mono- and polycistronic RNAs, and overlapping transcripts. Altogether, we detected 875 transcript species, of which 759 were novel and 116 were annotated previously. These RNA molecules include 41 novel putative protein coding transcripts [each containing 5'-truncated in-frame open reading frames (ORFs), 14 monocistronic transcripts, 99 polygenic RNAs, 101 non-coding RNAs, and 504 untranslated region isoforms. This work also identified novel replication origin-associated transcripts, upstream ORFs, cis-regulatory sequences and poly(A) sites. We also detected RNA methylation in 99 viral genes and RNA hyper-editing in the longer 5'-UTR transcript isoform of the canonical ORF 19 transcript.",35079129,PMC8789824,10.1038/s41598-022-05457-8,3
GMcloser: closing gaps in assemblies accurately with a likelihood-based selection of contig or long-read alignments,"Motivation:Genome assemblies generated with next-generation sequencing (NGS) reads usually contain a number of gaps. Several tools have recently been developed to close the gaps in these assemblies with NGS reads. Although these gap-closing tools efficiently close the gaps, they entail a high rate of misassembly at gap-closing sites.Results:We have found that the assembly error rates caused by these tools are 20-500-fold higher than the rate of errors introduced into contigs by de novo assemblers. We here describe GMcloser, a tool that accurately closes these gaps with a preassembled contig set or a long read set (i.e., error-corrected PacBio reads). GMcloser uses likelihood-based classifiers calculated from the alignment statistics between scaffolds, contigs and paired-end reads to correctly assign contigs or long reads to gap regions of scaffolds, thereby achieving accurate and efficient gap closure. We demonstrate with sequencing data from various organisms that the gap-closing accuracy of GMcloser is 3-100-fold higher than those of other available tools, with similar efficiency.Availability and implementation:GMcloser and an accompanying tool (GMvalue) for evaluating the assembly and correcting misassemblies except SNPs and short indels in the assembly are available at https://sourceforge.net/projects/gmcloser/.Contact:shunichi.kosugi@riken.jp.Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",26261222,,10.1093/bioinformatics/btv465,45
SMRT sequencing only de novo assembly of the sugar beet (Beta vulgaris) chloroplast genome,"Background:Third generation sequencing methods, like SMRT (Single Molecule, Real-Time) sequencing developed by Pacific Biosciences, offer much longer read length in comparison to Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) methods. Hence, they are well suited for de novo- or re-sequencing projects. Sequences generated for these purposes will not only contain reads originating from the nuclear genome, but also a significant amount of reads originating from the organelles of the target organism. These reads are usually discarded but they can also be used for an assembly of organellar replicons. The long read length supports resolution of repetitive regions and repeats within the organelles genome which might be problematic when just using short read data. Additionally, SMRT sequencing is less influenced by GC rich areas and by long stretches of the same base.Results:We describe a workflow for a de novo assembly of the sugar beet (Beta vulgaris ssp. vulgaris) chloroplast genome sequence only based on data originating from a SMRT sequencing dataset targeted on its nuclear genome. We show that the data obtained from such an experiment are sufficient to create a high quality assembly with a higher reliability than assemblies derived from e.g. Illumina reads only. The chloroplast genome is especially challenging for de novo assembling as it contains two large inverted repeat (IR) regions. We also describe some limitations that still apply even though long reads are used for the assembly.Conclusions:SMRT sequencing reads extracted from a dataset created for nuclear genome (re)sequencing can be used to obtain a high quality de novo assembly of the chloroplast of the sequenced organism. Even with a relatively small overall coverage for the nuclear genome it is possible to collect more than enough reads to generate a high quality assembly that outperforms short read based assemblies. However, even with long reads it is not always possible to clarify the order of elements of a chloroplast genome sequence reliantly which we could demonstrate with Fosmid End Sequences (FES) generated with Sanger technology. Nevertheless, this limitation also applies to short read sequencing data but is reached in this case at a much earlier stage during finishing.",26377912,PMC4573686,10.1186/s12859-015-0726-6,23
Using synthetic chromosome controls to evaluate the sequencing of difficult regions within the human genome,"Background:Next-generation sequencing (NGS) can identify mutations in the human genome that cause disease and has been widely adopted in clinical diagnosis. However, the human genome contains many polymorphic, low-complexity, and repetitive regions that are difficult to sequence and analyze. Despite their difficulty, these regions include many clinically important sequences that can inform the treatment of human diseases and improve the diagnostic yield of NGS.Results:To evaluate the accuracy by which these difficult regions are analyzed with NGS, we built an in silico decoy chromosome, along with corresponding synthetic DNA reference controls, that encode difficult and clinically important human genome regions, including repeats, microsatellites, HLA genes, and immune receptors. These controls provide a known ground-truth reference against which to measure the performance of diverse sequencing technologies, reagents, and bioinformatic tools. Using this approach, we provide a comprehensive evaluation of short- and long-read sequencing instruments, library preparation methods, and software tools and identify the errors and systematic bias that confound our resolution of these remaining difficult regions.Conclusions:This study provides an analytical validation of diagnosis using NGS in difficult regions of the human genome and highlights the challenges that remain to resolve these difficult regions.",35022065,PMC8753822,10.1186/s13059-021-02579-6,3
Adaptation of Oxford Nanopore technology for hepatitis C whole genome sequencing and identification of within-host viral variants,"Background:Hepatitis C (HCV) and many other RNA viruses exist as rapidly mutating quasi-species populations in a single infected host. High throughput characterization of full genome, within-host variants is still not possible despite advances in next generation sequencing. This limitation constrains viral genomic studies that depend on accurate identification of hemi-genome or whole genome, within-host variants, especially those occurring at low frequencies. With the advent of third generation long read sequencing technologies, including Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) and PacBio platforms, this problem is potentially surmountable. ONT is particularly attractive in this regard due to the portable nature of the MinION sequencer, which makes real-time sequencing in remote and resource-limited locations possible. However, this technology (termed here 'nanopore sequencing') has a comparatively high technical error rate. The present study aimed to assess the utility, accuracy and cost-effectiveness of nanopore sequencing for HCV genomes. We also introduce a new bioinformatics tool (Nano-Q) to differentiate within-host variants from nanopore sequencing.Results:The Nanopore platform, when the coverage exceeded 300 reads, generated comparable consensus sequences to Illumina sequencing. Using HCV Envelope plasmids (~ 1800 nt) mixed in known proportions, the capacity of nanopore sequencing to reliably identify variants with an abundance as low as 0.1% was demonstrated, provided the autologous reference sequence was available to identify the matching reads. Successful pooling and nanopore sequencing of 52 samples from patients with HCV infection demonstrated its cost effectiveness (AUD$ 43 per sample with nanopore sequencing versus $100 with paired-end short read technology). The Nano-Q tool successfully separated between-host sequences, including those from the same subtype, by bulk sorting and phylogenetic clustering without an autologous reference sequence (using only a subtype-specific generic reference). The pipeline also identified within-host viral variants and their abundance when the parameters were appropriately adjusted.Conclusion:Cost effective HCV whole genome sequencing and within-host variant identification without haplotype reconstruction are potential advantages of nanopore sequencing.",33653280,PMC7923462,10.1186/s12864-021-07460-1,9
TriPoly: haplotype estimation for polyploids using sequencing data of related individuals,"Motivation:Knowledge of haplotypes, i.e. phased and ordered marker alleles on a chromosome, is essential to answer many questions in genetics and genomics. By generating short pieces of DNA sequence, high-throughput modern sequencing technologies make estimation of haplotypes possible for single individuals. In polyploids, however, haplotype estimation methods usually require deep coverage to achieve sufficient accuracy. This often renders sequencing-based approaches too costly to be applied to large populations needed in studies of Quantitative Trait Loci.Results:We propose a novel haplotype estimation method for polyploids, TriPoly, that combines sequencing data with Mendelian inheritance rules to infer haplotypes in parent-offspring trios. Using realistic simulations of both short and long-read sequencing data for banana (Musa acuminata) and potato (Solanum tuberosum) trios, we show that TriPoly yields more accurate progeny haplotypes at low coverages compared to existing methods that work on single individuals. We also apply TriPoly to phase Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms on chromosome 5 for a family of tetraploid potato with 2 parents and 37 offspring sequenced with an RNA capture approach. We show that TriPoly haplotype estimates differ from those of the other methods mainly in regions with imperfect sequencing or mapping difficulties, as it does not rely solely on sequence reads and aims to avoid phasings that are not likely to have been passed from the parents to the offspring.Availability and implementation:TriPoly has been implemented in Python 3.5.2 (also compatible with Python 2.7.3 and higher) and can be freely downloaded at https://github.com/EhsanMotazedi/TriPoly.Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",29868858,,10.1093/bioinformatics/bty442,13
"HiCanu: accurate assembly of segmental duplications, satellites, and allelic variants from high-fidelity long reads","Complete and accurate genome assemblies form the basis of most downstream genomic analyses and are of critical importance. Recent genome assembly projects have relied on a combination of noisy long-read sequencing and accurate short-read sequencing, with the former offering greater assembly continuity and the latter providing higher consensus accuracy. The recently introduced Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) HiFi sequencing technology bridges this divide by delivering long reads (>10 kbp) with high per-base accuracy (>99.9%). Here we present HiCanu, a modification of the Canu assembler designed to leverage the full potential of HiFi reads via homopolymer compression, overlap-based error correction, and aggressive false overlap filtering. We benchmark HiCanu with a focus on the recovery of haplotype diversity, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) variants, satellite DNAs, and segmental duplications. For diploid human genomes sequenced to 30× HiFi coverage, HiCanu achieved superior accuracy and allele recovery compared to the current state of the art. On the effectively haploid CHM13 human cell line, HiCanu achieved an NG50 contig size of 77 Mbp with a per-base consensus accuracy of 99.999% (QV50), surpassing recent assemblies of high-coverage, ultralong Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) reads in terms of both accuracy and continuity. This HiCanu assembly correctly resolves 337 out of 341 validation BACs sampled from known segmental duplications and provides the first preliminary assemblies of nine complete human centromeric regions. Although gaps and errors still remain within the most challenging regions of the genome, these results represent a significant advance toward the complete assembly of human genomes.",32801147,PMC7545148,10.1101/gr.263566.120,263
Meta-aligner: long-read alignment based on genome statistics,"Background:Current development of sequencing technologies is towards generating longer and noisier reads. Evidently, accurate alignment of these reads play an important role in any downstream analysis. Similarly, reducing the overall cost of sequencing is related to the time consumption of the aligner. The tradeoff between accuracy and speed is the main challenge in designing long read aligners.Results:We propose Meta-aligner which aligns long and very long reads to the reference genome very efficiently and accurately. Meta-aligner incorporates available short/long aligners as subcomponents and uses statistics from the reference genome to increase the performance. Meta-aligner estimates statistics from reads and the reference genome automatically. Meta-aligner is implemented in C++ and runs in popular POSIX-like operating systems such as Linux.Conclusions:Meta-aligner achieves high recall rates and precisions especially for long reads and high error rates. Also, it improves performance of alignment in the case of PacBio long-reads in comparison with traditional schemes.",28231760,PMC5324271,10.1186/s12859-017-1518-y,5
Complete genome sequence and annotation of the laboratory reference strain Shigella flexneri serotype 5a M90T and genome-wide transcriptional start site determination,"Background:Shigella is a Gram-negative facultative intracellular bacterium that causes bacillary dysentery in humans. Shigella invades cells of the colonic mucosa owing to its virulence plasmid-encoded Type 3 Secretion System (T3SS), and multiplies in the target cell cytosol. Although the laboratory reference strain S. flexneri serotype 5a M90T has been extensively used to understand the molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis, its complete genome sequence is not available, thereby greatly limiting studies employing high-throughput sequencing and systems biology approaches.Results:We have sequenced, assembled, annotated and manually curated the full genome of S. flexneri 5a M90T. This yielded two complete circular contigs, the chromosome and the virulence plasmid (pWR100). To obtain the genome sequence, we have employed long-read PacBio DNA sequencing followed by polishing with Illumina RNA-seq data. This provides a new hybrid strategy to prepare gapless, highly accurate genome sequences, which also cover AT-rich tracks or repetitive sequences that are transcribed. Furthermore, we have performed genome-wide analysis of transcriptional start sites (TSS) and determined the length of 5' untranslated regions (5'-UTRs) at typical culture conditions for the inoculum of in vitro infection experiments. We identified 6723 primary TSS (pTSS) and 7328 secondary TSS (sTSS). The S. flexneri 5a M90T annotated genome sequence and the transcriptional start sites are integrated into RegulonDB (http://regulondb.ccg.unam.mx) and RSAT (http://embnet.ccg.unam.mx/rsat/) databases to use their analysis tools in the S. flexneri 5a M90T genome.Conclusions:We provide the first complete genome for S. flexneri serotype 5a, specifically the laboratory reference strain M90T. Our work opens the possibility of employing S. flexneri M90T in high-quality systems biology studies such as transcriptomic and differential expression analyses or in genome evolution studies. Moreover, the catalogue of TSS that we report here can be used in molecular pathogenesis studies as a resource to know which genes are transcribed before infection of host cells. The genome sequence, together with the analysis of transcriptional start sites, is also a valuable tool for precise genetic manipulation of S. flexneri 5a M90T. Further, we present a new hybrid strategy to prepare gapless, highly accurate genome sequences. Unlike currently used hybrid strategies combining long- and short-read DNA sequencing technologies to maximize accuracy, our workflow using long-read DNA sequencing and short-read RNA sequencing provides the added value of using non-redundant technologies, which yield distinct, exploitable datasets.",32252626,PMC7132871,10.1186/s12864-020-6565-5,7
INSERT-seq enables high-resolution mapping of genomically integrated DNA using Nanopore sequencing,"Comprehensive characterisation of genome engineering technologies is relevant for their development and safe use in human gene therapy. Short-read based methods can overlook insertion events in repetitive regions. We develop INSERT-seq, a method that combines targeted amplification of integrated DNA, UMI-based correction of PCR bias and Oxford Nanopore long-read sequencing for robust analysis of DNA integration. The experimental pipeline improves the number of mappable insertions at repetitive regions by 4.8-7.3% and larger repeats are processed with a computational peak calling pipeline. INSERT-seq is a simple, cheap and robust method to quantitatively characterise DNA integration in diverse ex vivo and in vivo samples.",36284361,PMC9594898,10.1186/s13059-022-02778-9,4
Nanopore sequencing enables near-complete de novo assembly of Saccharomyces cerevisiae reference strain CEN.PK113-7D,"The haploid Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain CEN.PK113-7D is a popular model system for metabolic engineering and systems biology research. Current genome assemblies are based on short-read sequencing data scaffolded based on homology to strain S288C. However, these assemblies contain large sequence gaps, particularly in subtelomeric regions, and the assumption of perfect homology to S288C for scaffolding introduces bias. In this study, we obtained a near-complete genome assembly of CEN.PK113-7D using only Oxford Nanopore Technology's MinION sequencing platform. Fifteen of the 16 chromosomes, the mitochondrial genome and the 2-μm plasmid are assembled in single contigs and all but one chromosome starts or ends in a telomere repeat. This improved genome assembly contains 770 Kbp of added sequence containing 248 gene annotations in comparison to the previous assembly of CEN.PK113-7D. Many of these genes encode functions determining fitness in specific growth conditions and are therefore highly relevant for various industrial applications. Furthermore, we discovered a translocation between chromosomes III and VIII that caused misidentification of a MAL locus in the previous CEN.PK113-7D assembly. This study demonstrates the power of long-read sequencing by providing a high-quality reference assembly and annotation of CEN.PK113-7D and places a caveat on assumed genome stability of microorganisms.",28961779,PMC5812507,10.1093/femsyr/fox074,41
A Comparison between Hi-C and 10X Genomics Linked Read Sequencing for Whole Genome Phasing in Hanwoo Cattle,"Until recently, genome-scale phasing was limited due to the short read sizes of sequence data. Though the use of long-read sequencing can overcome this limitation, they require extensive error correction. The emergence of technologies such as 10X genomics linked read sequencing and Hi-C which uses short-read sequencers along with library preparation protocols that facilitates long-read assemblies have greatly reduced the complexities of genome scale phasing. Moreover, it is possible to accurately assemble phased genome of individual samples using these methods. Therefore, in this study, we compared three phasing strategies which included two sample preparation methods along with the Long Ranger pipeline of 10X genomics and HapCut2 software, namely 10X-LG, 10X-HapCut2, and HiC-HapCut2 and assessed their performance and accuracy. We found that the 10X-LG had the best phasing performance amongst the method analyzed. They had the highest phasing rate (89.6%), longest adjusted N50 (1.24 Mb), and lowest switch error rate (0.07%). Moreover, the phasing accuracy and yield of the 10X-LG stayed over 90% for distances up to 4 Mb and 550 Kb respectively, which were considerably higher than 10X-HapCut2 and Hi-C Hapcut2. The results of this study will serve as a good reference for future benchmarking studies and also for reference-based imputation in Hanwoo.",32245072,PMC7140831,10.3390/genes11030332,0
Localized assembly for long reads enables genome-wide analysis of repetitive regions at single-base resolution in human genomes,"Background:Long-read sequencing technologies have the potential to overcome the limitations of short reads and provide a comprehensive picture of the human genome. However, the characterization of repetitive sequences by reconstructing genomic structures at high resolution solely from long reads remains difficult. Here, we developed a localized assembly method (LoMA) that constructs highly accurate consensus sequences (CSs) from long reads.Methods:We developed LoMA by combining minimap2, MAFFT, and our algorithm, which classifies diploid haplotypes based on structural variants and CSs. Using this tool, we analyzed two human samples (NA18943 and NA19240) sequenced with the Oxford Nanopore sequencer. We defined target regions in each genome based on mapping patterns and then constructed a high-quality catalog of the human insertion solely from the long-read data.Results:The assessment of LoMA showed a high accuracy of CSs (error rate < 0.3%) compared with raw data (error rate > 8%) and superiority to a previous study. The genome-wide analysis of NA18943 and NA19240 identified 5516 and 6542 insertions (≥ 100 bp), respectively. Most insertions (~ 80%) were derived from tandem repeats and transposable elements. We also detected processed pseudogenes, insertions in transposable elements, and long insertions (> 10 kbp). Finally, our analysis suggested that short tandem duplications are associated with gene expression and transposons.Conclusions:Our analysis showed that LoMA constructs high-quality sequences from long reads with substantial errors. This study revealed the true structures of the insertions with high accuracy and inferred the mechanisms for the insertions, thus contributing to future human genome studies. LoMA is available at our GitHub page: https://github.com/kolikem/loma .",36895025,PMC9996862,10.1186/s40246-023-00467-7,2
Fec: a fast error correction method based on two-rounds overlapping and caching,"The third-generation sequencing technology has advanced genome analysis with long-read length, but the reads need error correction due to the high error rate. Error correction is a time-consuming process especially when the sequencing coverage is high. Generally, for a pair of overlapping reads A and B, the existing error correction methods perform a base-level alignment from B to A when correcting the read A. And another base-level alignment from A to B is performed when correcting the read B. However, based on our observation, the base-level alignment information can be reused. In this article, we present a fast error correction tool Fec, using two-rounds overlapping and caching. Fec can be used independently or as an error correction step in an assembly pipeline. In the first round, Fec uses a large window size (20) to quickly find enough overlaps to correct most of the reads. In the second round, a small window size (5) is used to find more overlaps for the reads with insufficient overlaps in the first round. When performing base-level alignment, Fec searches the cache first. If the alignment exists in the cache, Fec takes this alignment out and deduces the second alignment from it. Otherwise, Fec performs base-level alignment and stores the alignment in the cache. We test Fec on nine datasets, and the results show that Fec has 1.24-38.56 times speed-up compared to MECAT, CANU and MINICNS on five PacBio datasets and 1.16-27.8 times speed-up compared to NECAT and CANU on four nanopore datasets.Availability and implementation:Fec is available at https://github.com/zhangjuncsu/Fec.Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",35977383,,10.1093/bioinformatics/btac565,0
MinION Sequencing of Yeast Mock Communities To Assess the Effect of Databases and ITS-LSU Markers on the Reliability of Metabarcoding Analysis,"Microbial communities play key roles both for humans and the environment. They are involved in ecosystem functions, maintaining their stability, and provide important services, such as carbon cycle and nitrogen cycle. Acting both as symbionts and as pathogens, description of the structure and composition of these communities is important. Metabarcoding uses ribosomal DNA (rDNA) (eukaryotic) or rRNA gene (prokaryotic) sequences for identification of species present in a site and measuring their abundance. This procedure requires several technical steps that could be source of bias producing a distorted view of the real community composition. In this work, we took advantage of an innovative ""long-read"" next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology (MinION) amplifying the DNA spanning from the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) to large subunit (LSU) that can be read simultaneously in this platform, providing more information than ""short-read"" systems. The experimental system consisted of six fungal mock communities composed of species present at various relative amounts to mimic natural situations characterized by predominant and low-frequency species. The influence of the sequencing platform (MinION and Illumina MiSeq) and the effect of different reference databases and marker sequences on metagenomic identification of species were evaluated. The results showed that the ITS-based database provided more accurate species identification than LSU. Furthermore, a procedure based on a preliminary identification with standard reference databases followed by the production of custom databases, including only the best outputs of the first step, is proposed. This additional step improved the estimate of species proportion of the mock communities and reduced the number of ghost species not really present in the simulated communities.IMPORTANCEMetagenomic analyses are fundamental in many research areas; therefore, improvement of methods and protocols for the description of microbial communities becomes more and more necessary. Long-read sequencing could be used for reducing biases due to the multicopy nature of rDNA sequences and short-read limitations. However, these novel technologies need to be assessed and standardized with controlled experiments, such as mock communities. The interest behind this work was to evaluate how long reads performed identification and quantification of species mixed in precise proportions and how the choice of database affects such analyses. Development of a pipeline that mitigates the effect of the barcoding sequences and the impact of the reference database on metagenomic analyses can help microbiome studies go one step further.",36519933,PMC9927109,10.1128/spectrum.01052-22,0
Improve homology search sensitivity of PacBio data by correcting frameshifts,"Motivation:Single-molecule, real-time sequencing (SMRT) developed by Pacific BioSciences produces longer reads than secondary generation sequencing technologies such as Illumina. The long read length enables PacBio sequencing to close gaps in genome assembly, reveal structural variations, and identify gene isoforms with higher accuracy in transcriptomic sequencing. However, PacBio data has high sequencing error rate and most of the errors are insertion or deletion errors. During alignment-based homology search, insertion or deletion errors in genes will cause frameshifts and may only lead to marginal alignment scores and short alignments. As a result, it is hard to distinguish true alignments from random alignments and the ambiguity will incur errors in structural and functional annotation. Existing frameshift correction tools are designed for data with much lower error rate and are not optimized for PacBio data. As an increasing number of groups are using SMRT, there is an urgent need for dedicated homology search tools for PacBio data.Results:In this work, we introduce Frame-Pro, a profile homology search tool for PacBio reads. Our tool corrects sequencing errors and also outputs the profile alignments of the corrected sequences against characterized protein families. We applied our tool to both simulated and real PacBio data. The results showed that our method enables more sensitive homology search, especially for PacBio data sets of low sequencing coverage. In addition, we can correct more errors when comparing with a popular error correction tool that does not rely on hybrid sequencing.Availability and implementation:The source code is freely available at https://sourceforge.net/projects/frame-pro/Contact:yannisun@msu.edu.",27587671,,10.1093/bioinformatics/btw458,9
Comparison of structural variant callers for massive whole-genome sequence data,"Background:Detecting structural variations (SVs) at the population level using next-generation sequencing (NGS) requires substantial computational resources and processing time. Here, we compared the performances of 11 SV callers: Delly, Manta, GridSS, Wham, Sniffles, Lumpy, SvABA, Canvas, CNVnator, MELT, and INSurVeyor. These SV callers have been recently published and have been widely employed for processing massive whole-genome sequencing datasets. We evaluated the accuracy, sequence depth, running time, and memory usage of the SV callers.Results:Notably, several callers exhibited better calling performance for deletions than for duplications, inversions, and insertions. Among the SV callers, Manta identified deletion SVs with better performance and efficient computing resources, and both Manta and MELT demonstrated relatively good precision regarding calling insertions. We confirmed that the copy number variation callers, Canvas and CNVnator, exhibited better performance in identifying long duplications as they employ the read-depth approach. Finally, we also verified the genotypes inferred from each SV caller using a phased long-read assembly dataset, and Manta showed the highest concordance in terms of the deletions and insertions.Conclusions:Our findings provide a comprehensive understanding of the accuracy and computational efficiency of SV callers, thereby facilitating integrative analysis of SV profiles in diverse large-scale genomic datasets.",38549092,PMC10976732,10.1186/s12864-024-10239-9,0
Identification of intermediate-sized deletions and inference of their impact on gene expression in a human population,"Background:Next-generation sequencing has allowed for the identification of different genetic variations, which are known to contribute to diseases. Of these, insertions and deletions are the second most abundant type of variations in the genome, but their biological importance or disease association is not well-studied, especially for deletions of intermediate sizes.Methods:We identified intermediate-sized deletions from whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data of Japanese samples (n = 174) with a novel deletion calling method which considered multiple samples. These deletions were used to construct a reference panel for use in imputation. Imputation was then conducted using the reference panel and data from 82 publically available Japanese samples with gene expression data. The accuracy of the deletion calling and imputation was examined with Nanopore long-read sequencing technology. We also conducted an expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) association analysis using the deletions to infer their functional impacts on genes, before characterizing the deletions causal for gene expression level changes.Results:We obtained a set of polymorphic 4378 high-confidence deletions and constructed a reference panel. The deletions were successfully imputed into the Japanese samples with high accuracy (97.3%). The eQTL analysis identified 181 deletions (4.1%) suggested as causal for gene expression level changes. The causal deletion candidates were significantly enriched in promoters, super-enhancers, and transcription elongation chromatin states. Generation of deletions in a cell line with the CRISPR-Cas9 system confirmed that they were indeed causative variants for gene expression change. Furthermore, one of the deletions was observed to affect the gene expression levels of a gene it was not located in.Conclusions:This paper reports an accurate deletion calling method for genotype imputation at the whole genome level and shows the importance of intermediate-sized deletions in the human population.",31340865,PMC6657090,10.1186/s13073-019-0656-4,7
Benchmarking long-read aligners and SV callers for structural variation detection in Oxford nanopore sequencing data,"Structural variants (SVs) are one of the significant types of DNA mutations and are typically defined as larger-than-50-bp genomic alterations that include insertions, deletions, duplications, inversions, and translocations. These modifications can profoundly impact the phenotypic characteristics and contribute to disorders like cancer, response to treatment, and infections. Four long-read aligners and five SV callers have been evaluated using three Oxford Nanopore NGS human genome datasets in terms of precision, recall, and F1-score statistical metrics, depth of coverage, and speed of analysis. The best SV caller regarding recall, precision, and F1-score when matched with different aligners at different coverage levels tend to vary depending on the dataset and the specific SV types being analyzed. However, based on our findings, Sniffles and CuteSV tend to perform well across different aligners and coverage levels, followed by SVIM, PBSV, and SVDSS in the last place. The CuteSV caller has the highest average F1-score (82.51%) and recall (78.50%), and Sniffles has the highest average precision value (94.33%). Minimap2 as an aligner and Sniffles as an SV caller act as a strong base for the pipeline of SV calling because of their high speed and reasonable accomplishment. PBSV has a lower average F1-score, precision, and recall and may generate more false positives and overlook some actual SVs. Our results are valuable in the comprehensive evaluation of popular SV callers and aligners as they provide insight into the performance of several long-read aligners and SV callers and serve as a reference for researchers in selecting the most suitable tools for SV detection.",38486064,PMC10940726,10.1038/s41598-024-56604-2,0
Comparison of the two up-to-date sequencing technologies for genome assembly: HiFi reads of Pacific Biosciences Sequel II system and ultralong reads of Oxford Nanopore,"Background:The availability of reference genomes has revolutionized the study of biology. Multiple competing technologies have been developed to improve the quality and robustness of genome assemblies during the past decade. The 2 widely used long-read sequencing providers-Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT)-have recently updated their platforms: PacBio enables high-throughput HiFi reads with base-level resolution of >99%, and ONT generated reads as long as 2 Mb. We applied the 2 up-to-date platforms to a single rice individual and then compared the 2 assemblies to investigate the advantages and limitations of each.Results:The results showed that ONT ultralong reads delivered higher contiguity, producing a total of 18 contigs of which 10 were assembled into a single chromosome compared to 394 contigs and 3 chromosome-level contigs for the PacBio assembly. The ONT ultralong reads also prevented assembly errors caused by long repetitive regions, for which we observed a total of 44 genes of false redundancies and 10 genes of false losses in the PacBio assembly, leading to over- or underestimation of the gene families in those long repetitive regions. We also noted that the PacBio HiFi reads generated assemblies with considerably fewer errors at the level of single nucleotides and small insertions and deletions than those of the ONT assembly, which generated an average 1.06 errors per kb and finally engendered 1,475 incorrect gene annotations via altered or truncated protein predictions.Conclusions:It shows that both PacBio HiFi reads and ONT ultralong reads had their own merits. Further genome reference constructions could leverage both techniques to lessen the impact of assembly errors and subsequent annotation mistakes rooted in each.",33319909,PMC7736813,10.1093/gigascience/giaa123,51
An improved assembly of the loblolly pine mega-genome using long-read single-molecule sequencing,"The 22-gigabase genome of loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) is one of the largest ever sequenced. The draft assembly published in 2014 was built entirely from short Illumina reads, with lengths ranging from 100 to 250 base pairs (bp). The assembly was quite fragmented, containing over 11 million contigs whose weighted average (N50) size was 8206 bp. To improve this result, we generated approximately 12-fold coverage in long reads using the Single Molecule Real Time sequencing technology developed at Pacific Biosciences. We assembled the long and short reads together using the MaSuRCA mega-reads assembly algorithm, which produced a substantially better assembly, P. taeda version 2.0. The new assembly has an N50 contig size of 25 361, more than three times as large as achieved in the original assembly, and an N50 scaffold size of 107 821, 61% larger than the previous assembly.",28369353,PMC5437942,10.1093/gigascience/giw016,43
Breakpoint mapping of a novel de novo translocation t(X;20)(q11.1;p13) by positional cloning and long read sequencing,Disease associated chromosomal rearrangements often have break points located within disease causing genes or in their vicinity. The purpose of this study is to characterize a balanced reciprocal translocation in a girl with intellectual disability and seizures by positional cloning and whole genome sequencing. The translocation was identification by G- banding and confirmed by WCP FISH. Fine mapping using BAC clones and whole genome sequencing using Oxford nanopore long read sequencing technology for a 1.46 X coverage of the genome was done. The positional cloning showed split signals with BAC RP11-943 J20. Long read sequencing analysis of chimeric reads carrying parts of chromosomes X and 20 helped to identify the breakpoints to be in intron 2 of ARHGEF9 gene on Xp11.1 and on 20p13 between RASSF2 and SLC23A2 genes. This is the first report of translocation which successfully delineated to single base resolution using Nanopore sequencing. The genotype-phenotype correlation is discussed.,30006036,,10.1016/j.ygeno.2018.07.005,18
Rapid Characterization of Complex Killer Cell Immunoglobulin-Like Receptor (KIR) Regions Using Cas9 Enrichment and Nanopore Sequencing,"Long-read sequencing approaches have considerably improved the quality and contiguity of genome assemblies. Such platforms bear the potential to resolve even extremely complex regions, such as multigenic immune families and repetitive stretches of DNA. Deep sequencing coverage, however, is required to overcome low nucleotide accuracy, especially in regions with high homopolymer density, copy number variation, and sequence similarity, such as theMHCandKIRgene clusters of the immune system. Therefore, we have adapted a targeted enrichment protocol in combination with long-read sequencing to efficiently annotate complexKIRgene regions. Using Cas9 endonuclease activity, segments of theKIRgene cluster were enriched and sequenced on an Oxford Nanopore Technologies platform. This provided sufficient coverage to accurately resolve and phase highly complexKIRhaplotypes. Our strategy eliminates PCR-induced amplification errors, facilitates rapid characterization of large and complex multigenic regions, including its epigenetic footprint, and is applicable in multiple species, even in the absence of a reference genome.",34594334,PMC8476923,10.3389/fimmu.2021.722181,8
Unfolding the Bacterial Transcriptome Landscape Using Oxford Nanopore Technology Direct RNA Sequencing,"Current genome annotation ignores important features of the transcriptome, such as untranslated regions and operon maps. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) helps in identifying such features; however, the fragmentation step of classical RNA-seq makes this task challenging. Long-read sequencing methods, such as that of Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), enable the sequencing of intact RNA molecules. Here, we present a method to annotate the full features of bacterial transcriptomes by combining a modified ONT direct RNA-seq method with our computational pipeline, UNAGI bacteria. The method reveals the full complexity of the bacterial transcriptome landscape, including transcription start sites, transcription termination sites, operon maps, and novel genes.",36781735,,10.1007/978-1-0716-2996-3_19,1
Critical assessment of bioinformatics methods for the characterization of pathological repeat expansions with single-molecule sequencing data,"A number of studies have reported the successful application of single-molecule sequencing technologies to the determination of the size and sequence of pathological expanded microsatellite repeats over the last 5 years. However, different custom bioinformatics pipelines were employed in each study, preventing meaningful comparisons and somewhat limiting the reproducibility of the results. In this review, we provide a brief summary of state-of-the-art methods for the characterization of expanded repeats alleles, along with a detailed comparison of bioinformatics tools for the determination of repeat length and sequence, using both real and simulated data. Our reanalysis of publicly available human genome sequencing data suggests a modest, but statistically significant, increase of the error rate of single-molecule sequencing technologies at genomic regions containing short tandem repeats. However, we observe that all the methods herein tested, irrespective of the strategy used for the analysis of the data (either based on the alignment or assembly of the reads), show high levels of sensitivity in both the detection of expanded tandem repeats and the estimation of the expansion size, suggesting that approaches based on single-molecule sequencing technologies are highly effective for the detection and quantification of tandem repeat expansions and contractions.",31792498,,10.1093/bib/bbz099,4
Using nanopore sequencing to identify fungi from clinical samples with high phylogenetic resolution,"The study of microbiota has been revolutionized by the development of DNA metabarcoding. This sequence-based approach enables the direct detection of microorganisms without the need for culture and isolation, which significantly reduces analysis time and offers more comprehensive taxonomic profiles across broad phylogenetic lineages. While there has been an accumulating number of researches on bacteria, molecular phylogenetic analysis of fungi still remains challenging due to the lack of standardized tools and the incompleteness of reference databases limiting the accurate and precise identification of fungal taxa. Here, we present a DNA metabarcoding workflow for characterizing fungal microbiota with high taxonomic resolution. This method involves amplifying longer stretches of ribosomal RNA operons and sequencing them using nanopore long-read sequencing technology. The resulting reads were error-polished to generate consensus sequences with 99.5-100% accuracy, which were then aligned against reference genome assemblies. The efficacy of this method was explored using a polymicrobial mock community and patient-derived specimens, demonstrating the marked potential of long-read sequencing combined with consensus calling for accurate taxonomic classification. Our approach offers a powerful tool for the rapid identification of pathogenic fungi and has the promise to significantly improve our understanding of the role of fungi in health and disease.",37328565,PMC10275880,10.1038/s41598-023-37016-0,4
tailfindr: alignment-free poly(A) length measurement for Oxford Nanopore RNA and DNA sequencing,"Polyadenylation at the 3'-end is a major regulator of messenger RNA and its length is known to affect nuclear export, stability, and translation, among others. Only recently have strategies emerged that allow for genome-wide poly(A) length assessment. These methods identify genes connected to poly(A) tail measurements indirectly by short-read alignment to genetic 3'-ends. Concurrently, Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) established full-length isoform-specific RNA sequencing containing the entire poly(A) tail. However, assessing poly(A) length through base-calling has so far not been possible due to the inability to resolve long homopolymeric stretches in ONT sequencing. Here we presenttailfindr, an R package to estimate poly(A) tail length on ONT long-read sequencing data.tailfindroperates on unaligned, base-called data. It measures poly(A) tail length from both native RNA and DNA sequencing, which makes poly(A) tail studies by full-length cDNA approaches possible for the first time. We assesstailfindr's performance across different poly(A) lengths, demonstrating thattailfindris a versatile tool providing poly(A) tail estimates across a wide range of sequencing conditions.",31266821,PMC6800471,10.1261/rna.071332.119,43
TruSPAdes: barcode assembly of TruSeq synthetic long reads,The recently introduced TruSeq synthetic long read (TSLR) technology generates long and accurate virtual reads from an assembly of barcoded pools of short reads. The TSLR method provides an attractive alternative to existing sequencing platforms that generate long but inaccurate reads. We describe the truSPAdes algorithm (http://bioinf.spbau.ru/spades) for TSLR assembly and show that it results in a dramatic improvement in the quality of metagenomics assemblies.,26828418,,10.1038/nmeth.3737,19
Evaluation of Oxford Nanopore's MinION Sequencing Device for Microbial Whole Genome Sequencing Applications,"The MinION sequencer (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) is a paradigm shifting device allowing rapid, real time long read sequencing of nucleic acids. Yet external benchmarking of this technologies' capabilities has not been extensively reported, nor has thorough evaluation of its utility for field-based analysis with sub-optimal sample types been described. The aim of this study was to evaluate the capability of the MinION sequencer for bacterial genomic and metagenomic applications, with specific emphasis placed on the quality, yield, and accuracy of generated sequence data. Two independent laboratories at the National Microbiology Laboratory (Public Health Agency of Canada), sequenced a set of microbes in replicate, using the currently available flowcells, sequencing chemistries, and software available at the time of the experiment. Overall sequencing yield and quality improved through the course of this set of experiments. Sequencing alignment accuracy was high reaching 97% for all 2D experiments, though was slightly lower for 1D sequencing (94%). 1D sequencing provided much longer sequences than 2D. Both sequencing chemistries performed equally well in constructing genomic assemblies. There was evidence of barcode cross-over using both the native and PCR barcoding methods. Despite the sub-optimal nature of samples sequenced in the field, sequences attributable to B. anthracis the target organism used in this scenario, could none-the-less be detected. Together, this report showcases the rapid advancement in this technology and its utility in the context of genomic sequencing of microbial isolates of importance to public health.",30026559,PMC6053456,10.1038/s41598-018-29334-5,110
TandemTools: mapping long reads and assessing/improving assembly quality in extra-long tandem repeats,"Motivation:Extra-long tandem repeats (ETRs) are widespread in eukaryotic genomes and play an important role in fundamental cellular processes, such as chromosome segregation. Although emerging long-read technologies have enabled ETR assemblies, the accuracy of such assemblies is difficult to evaluate since there are no tools for their quality assessment. Moreover, since the mapping of error-prone reads to ETRs remains an open problem, it is not clear how to polish draft ETR assemblies.Results:To address these problems, we developed the TandemTools software that includes the TandemMapper tool for mapping reads to ETRs and the TandemQUAST tool for polishing ETR assemblies and their quality assessment. We demonstrate that TandemTools not only reveals errors in ETR assemblies but also improves the recently generated assemblies of human centromeres.Availability and implementation:https://github.com/ablab/TandemTools.Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",32657355,PMC7355294,10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa440,31
Long-read sequencing of extrachromosomal circular DNA and genome assembly of a Solanum lycopersicum breeding line revealed active LTR retrotransposons originating from S. Peruvianum L. introgressions,"Transposable elements (TEs) are a major force in the evolution of plant genomes. Differences in the transposition activities and landscapes of TEs can vary substantially, even in closely related species. Interspecific hybridization, a widely employed technique in tomato breeding, results in the creation of novel combinations of TEs from distinct species. The implications of this process for TE transposition activity have not been studied in modern cultivars. In this study, we used nanopore sequencing of extrachromosomal circular DNA (eccDNA) and identified two highly active Ty1/Copia LTR retrotransposon families of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), called Salsa and Ketchup. Elements of these families produce thousands of eccDNAs under controlled conditions and epigenetic stress. EccDNA sequence analysis revealed that the major parts of eccDNA produced by Ketchup and Salsa exhibited low similarity to the S. lycopersicum genomic sequence. To trace the origin of these TEs, whole-genome nanopore sequencing and de novo genome assembly were performed. We found that these TEs occurred in a tomato breeding line via interspecific introgression from S. peruvianum. Our findings collectively show that interspecific introgressions can contribute to both genetic and phenotypic diversity not only by introducing novel genetic variants, but also by importing active transposable elements from other species.",38658857,PMC11044480,10.1186/s12864-024-10314-1,0
NextPolish: a fast and efficient genome polishing tool for long-read assembly,"Motivation:Although long-read sequencing technologies can produce genomes with long contiguity, they suffer from high error rates. Thus, we developed NextPolish, a tool that efficiently corrects sequence errors in genomes assembled with long reads. This new tool consists of two interlinked modules that are designed to score and count K-mers from high quality short reads, and to polish genome assemblies containing large numbers of base errors.Results:When evaluated for the speed and efficiency using human and a plant (Arabidopsis thaliana) genomes, NextPolish outperformed Pilon by correcting sequence errors faster, and with a higher correction accuracy.Availability and implementation:NextPolish is implemented in C and Python.

Read clouds uncover variation in complex regions of the human genome,"Although an increasing amount of human genetic variation is being identified and recorded, determining variants within repeated sequences of the human genome remains a challenge. Most population and genome-wide association studies have therefore been unable to consider variation in these regions. Core to the problem is the lack of a sequencing technology that produces reads with sufficient length and accuracy to enable unique mapping. Here, we present a novel methodology of using read clouds, obtained by accurate short-read sequencing of DNA derived from long fragment libraries, to confidently align short reads within repeat regions and enable accurate variant discovery. Our novel algorithm, Random Field Aligner (RFA), captures the relationships among the short reads governed by the long read process via a Markov Random Field. We utilized a modified version of the Illumina TruSeq synthetic long-read protocol, which yielded shallow-sequenced read clouds. We test RFA through extensive simulations and apply it to discover variants on the NA12878 human sample, for which shallow TruSeq read cloud sequencing data are available, and on an invasive breast carcinoma genome that we sequenced using the same method. We demonstrate that RFA facilitates accurate recovery of variation in 155 Mb of the human genome, including 94% of 67 Mb of segmental duplication sequence and 96% of 11 Mb of transcribed sequence, that are currently hidden from short-read technologies.",26286554,PMC4579342,10.1101/gr.191189.115,36

This review summarizes past, present, and future DNA sequencing techniques, which are realized by nanopore approaches such as those pursued by Oxford Nanopore Technologies.",25643284,,10.1088/0957-4484/26/7/074003,22
Novel algorithms for efficient subsequence searching and mapping in nanopore raw signals towards targeted sequencing,"Motivation:Genome diagnostics have gradually become a prevailing routine for human healthcare. With the advances in understanding the causal genes for many human diseases, targeted sequencing provides a rapid, cost-efficient and focused option for clinical applications, such as single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) detection and haplotype classification, in a specific genomic region. Although nanopore sequencing offers a perfect tool for targeted sequencing because of its mobility, PCR-freeness and long read properties, it poses a challenging computational problem of how to efficiently and accurately search and map genomic subsequences of interest in a pool of nanopore reads (or raw signals). Due to its relatively low sequencing accuracy, there is no reliable solution to this problem, especially at low sequencing coverage.Results:Here, we propose a brand new signal-based subsequence inquiry pipeline as well as two novel algorithms to tackle this problem. The proposed algorithms follow the principle of subsequence dynamic time warping and directly operate on the electrical current signals, without loss of information in base-calling. Therefore, the proposed algorithms can serve as a tool for sequence inquiry in targeted sequencing. Two novel criteria are offered for the consequent signal quality analysis and data classification. Comprehensive experiments on real-world nanopore datasets show the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. We further demonstrate the potential applications of the proposed algorithms in two typical tasks in nanopore-based targeted sequencing: SNP detection under low sequencing coverage, and haplotype classification under low sequencing accuracy.Availability and implementation:The project is accessible at https://github.com/icthrm/cwSDTWnano.git, and the presented bench data is available upon request.Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",31593235,,10.1093/bioinformatics/btz742,9
Flexiplex: a versatile demultiplexer and search tool for omics data,"Motivation:The process of analyzing high throughput sequencing data often requires the identification and extraction of specific target sequences. This could include tasks, such as identifying cellular barcodes and UMIs in single-cell data, and specific genetic variants for genotyping. However, existing tools, which perform these functions are often task-specific, such as only demultiplexing barcodes for a dedicated type of experiment, or are not tolerant to noise in the sequencing data.Results:To overcome these limitations, we developed Flexiplex, a versatile and fast sequence searching and demultiplexing tool for omics data, which is based on the Levenshtein distance and thus allows imperfect matches. We demonstrate Flexiplex's application on three use cases, identifying cell-line-specific sequences in Illumina short-read single-cell data, and discovering and demultiplexing cellular barcodes from noisy long-read single-cell RNA-seq data. We show that Flexiplex achieves an excellent balance of accuracy and computational efficiency compared to leading task-specific tools.Availability and implementation:Flexiplex is available at https://davidsongroup.github.io/flexiplex/.",38379414,PMC10914444,10.1093/bioinformatics/btae102,0
Optimized use of Oxford Nanopore flowcells for hybrid assemblies,"Hybrid assemblies are highly valuable for studies ofEnterobacteriaceaedue to their ability to fully resolve the structure of mobile genetic elements, such as plasmids, which are involved in the carriage of clinically important genes (e.g. those involved in antimicrobial resistance/virulence). The widespread application of this technique is currently primarily limited by cost. Recent data have suggested that non-inferior, and even superior, hybrid assemblies can be produced using a fraction of the total output from a multiplexed nanopore [Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT)] flowcell run. In this study we sought to determine the optimal minimal running time for flowcells when acquiring reads for hybrid assembly. We then evaluated whether the ONT wash kit might allow users to exploit shorter running times by sequencing multiple libraries per flowcell. After 24 h of sequencing, most chromosomes and plasmids had circularized and there was no benefit associated with longer running times. Quality was similar at 12 h, suggesting that shorter running times are likely to be acceptable for certain applications (e.g. plasmid genomics). The ONT wash kit was highly effective in removing DNA between libraries. Contamination between libraries did not appear to affect subsequent hybrid assemblies, even when the same barcodes were used successively on a single flowcell. Utilizing shorter run times in combination with between-library nuclease washes allows at least 36Enterobacteriaceaeisolates to be sequenced per flowcell, significantly reducing the per-isolate sequencing cost. Ultimately this will facilitate large-scale studies utilizing hybrid assembly, advancing our understanding of the genomics of key human pathogens.",33174830,PMC7725331,10.1099/mgen.0.000453,11
"HiFiAdapterFilt, a memory efficient read processing pipeline, prevents occurrence of adapter sequence in PacBio HiFi reads and their negative impacts on genome assembly","Background:Pacific Biosciences HiFi read technology is currently the industry standard for high accuracy long-read sequencing that has been widely adopted by large sequencing and assembly initiatives for generation of de novo assemblies in non-model organisms. Though adapter contamination filtering is routine in traditional short-read analysis pipelines, it has not been widely adopted for HiFi workflows.Results:Analysis of 55 publicly available HiFi datasets revealed that a read-sanitation step to remove sequence artifacts derived from PacBio library preparation from read pools is necessary as adapter sequences can be erroneously integrated into assemblies.Conclusions:Here we describe the nature of adapter contaminated reads, their consequences in assembly, and present HiFiAdapterFilt, a simple and memory efficient solution for removing adapter contaminated reads prior to assembly.",35193521,PMC8864876,10.1186/s12864-022-08375-1,54
Low biological fluctuation of mitochondrial CpG and non-CpG methylation at the single-molecule level,"Mammalian cytosine DNA methylation (5mC) is associated with the integrity of the genome and the transcriptional status of nuclear DNA. Due to technical limitations, it has been less clear if mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is methylated and whether 5mC has a regulatory role in this context. Here, we used bisulfite-independent single-molecule sequencing of native human and mouse DNA to study mitochondrial 5mC across different biological conditions. We first validated the ability of long-read nanopore sequencing to detect 5mC in CpG (5mCpG) and non-CpG (5mCpH) context in nuclear DNA at expected genomic locations (i.e. promoters, gene bodies, enhancers, and cell type-specific transcription factor binding sites). Next, using high coverage nanopore sequencing we found low levels of mtDNA CpG and CpH methylation (with several exceptions) and little variation across biological processes: differentiation, oxidative stress, and cancer. 5mCpG and 5mCpH were overall higher in tissues compared to cell lines, with small additional variation between cell lines of different origin. Despite general low levels, global and single-base differences were found in cancer tissues compared to their adjacent counterparts, in particular for 5mCpG. In conclusion, nanopore sequencing is a useful tool for the detection of modified DNA bases on mitochondria that avoid the biases introduced by bisulfite and PCR amplification. Enhanced nanopore basecalling models will provide further resolution on the small size effects detected here, as well as rule out the presence of other DNA modifications such as oxidized forms of 5mC.",33850190,PMC8044111,10.1038/s41598-021-87457-8,17
Full-length RNA sequencing reveals unique transcriptome composition in bermudagrass,"Bermudagrass [Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers.] is an important perennial warm-season turfgrass species with great economic value. However, the reference genome and transcriptome information are still deficient in bermudagrass, which severely impedes functional and molecular breeding studies. In this study, through analyzing a mixture sample of leaves, stolons, shoots, roots and flowers with single-molecule long-read sequencing technology from Pacific Biosciences (PacBio), we reported the first full-length transcriptome dataset of bermudagrass (C. dactylon cultivar Yangjiang) comprising 78,192 unigenes. Among the unigenes, 66,409 were functionally annotated, whereas 27,946 were found to have two or more isoforms. The annotated full-length unigenes provided many new insights into gene sequence characteristics and systematic phylogeny of bermudagrass. By comparison with transcriptome dataset in nine grass species, KEGG pathway analyses further revealed that C4photosynthesis-related genes, notably the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase and pyruvate, phosphate dikinase genes, are specifically enriched in bermudagrass. These results not only explained the possible reason why bermudagrass flourishes in warm areas but also provided a solid basis for future studies in this important turfgrass species.",30176433,,10.1016/j.plaphy.2018.08.039,22
Comparative sequencing data analysis of Ion Torrent and MinION sequencing platforms using a clinical diagnostic haematology panel,"Introduction:Currently, two second-generation sequencing platforms-Ion Torrent and Illumina are being widely used for clinical testing and reporting of human samples. However, third-generation long read platforms like single molecule (PacBio) or direct sequencing (Nanopore) are gaining widespread interest in clinical genomics.Aims and objectives:The current study attempts to analyse and compare MinION sequencing data with Ion Torrent data, using a haematology ampliseq panel, to shed light on its current standing in reporting of clinical diagnostic samples.Methodology:A custom targeted Next-generation sequencing ampliseq panel comprising of 33 genes related to detection of inherited bone marrow failure syndrome cases was used to sequence five samples on both Ion Torrent and Oxford MinION platforms. The resulting data were analysed for output, quality and variant metrics across both platforms independently.Results:Overall, MinION produced longer reads (range 108-7227 bp) than Ion Torrent (25-580 bp). Moreover, it generated more reads than Ion Torrent in high %GC content (P < .005) or repeat regions. But Ion Torrent had much lower error rate of 1.59% compared with MinION's 20.31%. Despite high error, MinION platform was able to identify and report the pathogenic variant in all samples.Discussion and conclusion:The extremely long read lengths of MinION sequencers and better coverage in difficult to sequence regions give it an edge in generating contig free whole-genome sequences. However, the pore technology and chemistry of MinION needs further tuning to reduce error rate before it can be incorporated for clinical testing and reporting of human samples.",32654382,,10.1111/ijlh.13286,2
Physical separation of haplotypes in dikaryons allows benchmarking of phasing accuracy in Nanopore and HiFi assemblies with Hi-C data,"Background:Most animals and plants have more than one set of chromosomes and package these haplotypes into a single nucleus within each cell. In contrast, many fungal species carry multiple haploid nuclei per cell. Rust fungi are such species with two nuclei (karyons) that contain a full set of haploid chromosomes each. The physical separation of haplotypes in dikaryons means that, unlike in diploids, Hi-C chromatin contacts between haplotypes are false-positive signals.Results:We generate the first chromosome-scale, fully-phased assembly for the dikaryotic leaf rust fungus Puccinia triticina and compare Nanopore MinION and PacBio HiFi sequence-based assemblies. We show that false-positive Hi-C contacts between haplotypes are predominantly caused by phase switches rather than by collapsed regions or Hi-C read mis-mappings. We introduce a method for phasing of dikaryotic genomes into the two haplotypes using Hi-C contact graphs, including a phase switch correction step. In the HiFi assembly, relatively few phase switches occur, and these are predominantly located at haplotig boundaries and can be readily corrected. In contrast, phase switches are widespread throughout the Nanopore assembly. We show that haploid genome read coverage of 30-40 times using HiFi sequencing is required for phasing of the leaf rust genome, with 0.7% heterozygosity, and that HiFi sequencing resolves genomic regions with low heterozygosity that are otherwise collapsed in the Nanopore assembly.Conclusions:This first Hi-C based phasing pipeline for dikaryons and comparison of long-read sequencing technologies will inform future genome assembly and haplotype phasing projects in other non-haploid organisms.",35337367,PMC8957140,10.1186/s13059-022-02658-2,19
capTEs enables locus-specific dissection of transcriptional outputs from reference and nonreference transposable elements,"Transposable elements (TEs) serve as both insertional mutagens and regulatory elements in cells, and their aberrant activity is increasingly being revealed to contribute to diseases and cancers. However, measuring the transcriptional consequences of nonreference and young TEs at individual loci remains challenging with current methods, primarily due to technical limitations, including short read lengths generated and insufficient coverage in target regions. Here, we introduce a long-read targeted RNA sequencing method, Cas9-assisted profiling TE expression sequencing (capTEs), for quantitative analysis of transcriptional outputs for individual TEs, including transcribed nonreference insertions, noncanonical transcripts from various transcription patterns and their correlations with expression changes in related genes. This method selectively identified TE-containing transcripts and outputted data with up to 90% TE reads, maintaining a comparable data yield to whole-transcriptome sequencing. We applied capTEs to human cancer cells and found that internal and inserted Alu elements may employ distinct regulatory mechanisms to upregulate gene expression. We expect that capTEs will be a critical tool for advancing our understanding of the biological functions of individual TEs at the locus level, revealing their roles as both mutagens and regulators in biological and pathogenic processes.",37741908,PMC10517987,10.1038/s42003-023-05349-1,0
phasebook: haplotype-aware de novo assembly of diploid genomes from long reads,"Haplotype-aware diploid genome assembly is crucial in genomics, precision medicine, and many other disciplines. Long-read sequencing technologies have greatly improved genome assembly. However, current long-read assemblers are either reference based, so introduce biases, or fail to capture the haplotype diversity of diploid genomes. We present phasebook, a de novo approach for reconstructing the haplotypes of diploid genomes from long reads. phasebook outperforms other approaches in terms of haplotype coverage by large margins, in addition to achieving competitive performance in terms of assembly errors and assembly contiguity.",34706745,PMC8549298,10.1186/s13059-021-02512-x,17
Evaluating approaches to find exon chains based on long reads,"Transcript prediction can be modeled as a graph problem where exons are modeled as nodes and reads spanning two or more exons are modeled as exon chains. Pacific Biosciences third-generation sequencing technology produces significantly longer reads than earlier second-generation sequencing technologies, which gives valuable information about longer exon chains in a graph. However, with the high error rates of third-generation sequencing, aligning long reads correctly around the splice sites is a challenging task. Incorrect alignments lead to spurious nodes and arcs in the graph, which in turn lead to incorrect transcript predictions. We survey several approaches to find the exon chains corresponding to long reads in a splicing graph, and experimentally study the performance of these methods using simulated data to allow for sensitivity/precision analysis. Our experiments show that short reads from second-generation sequencing can be used to significantly improve exon chain correctness either by error-correcting the long reads before splicing graph creation, or by using them to create a splicing graph on which the long-read alignments are then projected. We also study the memory and time consumption of various modules, and show that accurate exon chains lead to significantly increased transcript prediction accuracy.Availability:The simulated data and in-house scripts used for this article are available at http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/group/gsa/exon-chains/exon-chains-bib.tar.bz2.",28069635,PMC5952954,10.1093/bib/bbw137,4
Phased nanopore assembly with Shasta and modular graph phasing with GFAse,"Reference-free genome phasing is vital for understanding allele inheritance and the impact of single-molecule DNA variation on phenotypes. To achieve thorough phasing across homozygous or repetitive regions of the genome, long-read sequencing technologies are often used to perform phased de novo assembly. As a step toward reducing the cost and complexity of this type of analysis, we describe new methods for accurately phasing Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequence data with the Shasta genome assembler and a modular tool for extending phasing to the chromosome scale called GFAse. We test using new variants of ONT PromethION sequencing, including those using proximity ligation, and show that newer, higher accuracy ONT reads substantially improve assembly quality.",38627094,,10.1101/gr.278268.123,0
Deep repeat resolution-the assembly of the Drosophila Histone Complex,"Though the advent of long-read sequencing technologies has led to a leap in contiguity of de novo genome assemblies, current reference genomes of higher organisms still do not provide unbroken sequences of complete chromosomes. Despite reads in excess of 30 000 base pairs, there are still repetitive structures that cannot be resolved by current state-of-the-art assemblers. The most challenging of these structures are tandemly arrayed repeats, which occur in the genomes of all eukaryotes. Untangling tandem repeat clusters is exceptionally difficult, since the rare differences between repeat copies are obscured by the high error rate of long reads. Solving this problem would constitute a major step towards computing fully assembled genomes. Here, we demonstrate by example of the Drosophila Histone Complex that via machine learning algorithms, it is possible to exploit the underlying distinguishing patterns of single nucleotide variants of repeats from very noisy data to resolve a large and highly conserved repeat cluster. The ideas explored in this paper are a first step towards the automated assembly of complex repeat structures and promise to be applicable to a wide range of eukaryotic genomes.",30476267,PMC6380962,10.1093/nar/gky1194,15
ConcatSeq: A method for increasing throughput of single molecule sequencing by concatenating short DNA fragments,"Single molecule sequencing (SMS) platforms enable base sequences to be read directly from individual strands of DNA in real-time. Though capable of long read lengths, SMS platforms currently suffer from low throughput compared to competing short-read sequencing technologies. Here, we present a novel strategy for sequencing library preparation, dubbed ConcatSeq, which increases the throughput of SMS platforms by generating long concatenated templates from pools of short DNA molecules. We demonstrate adaptation of this technique to two target enrichment workflows, commonly used for oncology applications, and feasibility using PacBio single molecule real-time (SMRT) technology. Our approach is capable of increasing the sequencing throughput of the PacBio RSII platform by more than five-fold, while maintaining the ability to correctly call allele frequencies of known single nucleotide variants. ConcatSeq provides a versatile new sample preparation tool for long-read sequencing technologies.",28701704,PMC5507877,10.1038/s41598-017-05503-w,13
MetageNN: a memory-efficient neural network taxonomic classifier robust to sequencing errors and missing genomes,"Background:With the rapid increase in throughput of long-read sequencing technologies, recent studies have explored their potential for taxonomic classification by using alignment-based approaches to reduce the impact of higher sequencing error rates. While alignment-based methods are generally slower, k-mer-based taxonomic classifiers can overcome this limitation, potentially at the expense of lower sensitivity for strains and species that are not in the database.Results:We present MetageNN, a memory-efficient long-read taxonomic classifier that is robust to sequencing errors and missing genomes. MetageNN is a neural network model that uses short k-mer profiles of sequences to reduce the impact of distribution shifts on error-prone long reads. Benchmarking MetageNN against other machine learning approaches for taxonomic classification (GeNet) showed substantial improvements with long-read data (20% improvement in F1 score). By utilizing nanopore sequencing data, MetageNN exhibits improved sensitivity in situations where the reference database is incomplete. It surpasses the alignment-based MetaMaps and MEGAN-LR, as well as the k-mer-based Kraken2 tools, with improvements of 100%, 36%, and 23% respectively at the read-level analysis. Notably, at the community level, MetageNN consistently demonstrated higher sensitivities than the previously mentioned tools. Furthermore, MetageNN requires < 1/4th of the database storage used by Kraken2, MEGAN-LR and MMseqs2 and is > 7× faster than MetaMaps and GeNet and > 2× faster than MEGAN-LR and MMseqs2.Conclusion:This proof of concept work demonstrates the utility of machine-learning-based methods for taxonomic classification using long reads. MetageNN can be used on sequences not classified by conventional methods and offers an alternative approach for memory-efficient classifiers that can be optimized further.",38627615,PMC11022314,10.1186/s12859-024-05760-3,0
Efficient end-to-end long-read sequence mapping using minimap2-fpga integrated with hardware accelerated chaining,"minimap2 is the gold-standard software for reference-based sequence mapping in third-generation long-read sequencing. While minimap2 is relatively fast, further speedup is desirable, especially when processing a multitude of large datasets. In this work, we present minimap2-fpga, a hardware-accelerated version of minimap2 that speeds up the mapping process by integrating an FPGA kernel optimised for chaining. Integrating the FPGA kernel into minimap2 posed significant challenges that we solved by accurately predicting the processing time on hardware while considering data transfer overheads, mitigating hardware scheduling overheads in a multi-threaded environment, and optimizing memory management for processing large realistic datasets. We demonstrate speed-ups in end-to-end run-time for data from both Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) and Pacific Biosciences (PacBio). minimap2-fpga is up to 79% and 53% faster than minimap2 for [Formula: see text] ONT and [Formula: see text] PacBio datasets respectively, when mapping without base-level alignment. When mapping with base-level alignment, minimap2-fpga is up to 62% and 10% faster than minimap2 for [Formula: see text] ONT and [Formula: see text] PacBio datasets respectively. The accuracy is near-identical to that of original minimap2 for both ONT and PacBio data, when mapping both with and without base-level alignment. minimap2-fpga is supported on Intel FPGA-based systems (evaluations performed on an on-premise system) and Xilinx FPGA-based systems (evaluations performed on a cloud system). We also provide a well-documented library for the FPGA-accelerated chaining kernel to be used by future researchers developing sequence alignment software with limited hardware background.",37978244,PMC10656460,10.1038/s41598-023-47354-8,1
New telomere to telomere assembly of human chromosome 8 reveals a previous underestimation of G-quadruplex forming sequences and inverted repeats,"Taking advantage of evolving and improving sequencing methods, human chromosome 8 is now available as a gapless, end-to-end assembly. Thanks to advances in long-read sequencing technologies, its centromere, telomeres, duplicated gene families and repeat-rich regions are now fully sequenced. We were interested to assess if the new assembly altered our understanding of the potential impact of non-B DNA structures within this completed chromosome sequence. It has been shown that non-B secondary structures, such as G-quadruplexes, hairpins and cruciforms, have important regulatory functions and potential as targeted therapeutics. Therefore, we analysed the presence of putative G-quadruplex forming sequences and inverted repeats in the current human reference genome (GRCh38) and in the new end-to-end assembly of chromosome 8. The comparison revealed that the new assembly contains significantly more inverted repeats and G-quadruplex forming sequences compared to the current reference sequence. This observation can be explained by improved accuracy of the new sequencing methods, particularly in regions that contain extensive repeats of bases, as is preferred by many non-B DNA structures. These results show a significant underestimation of the prevalence of non-B DNA secondary structure in previous assembly versions of the human genome and point to their importance being not fully appreciated. We anticipate that similar observations will occur as the improved sequencing technologies fill in gaps across the genomes of humans and other organisms.",34737002,,10.1016/j.gene.2021.146058,2
A comparative evaluation of hybrid error correction methods for error-prone long reads,"Background:Third-generation sequencing technologies have advanced the progress of the biological research by generating reads that are substantially longer than second-generation sequencing technologies. However, their notorious high error rate impedes straightforward data analysis and limits their application. A handful of error correction methods for these error-prone long reads have been developed to date. The output data quality is very important for downstream analysis, whereas computing resources could limit the utility of some computing-intense tools. There is a lack of standardized assessments for these long-read error-correction methods.Results:Here, we present a comparative performance assessment of ten state-of-the-art error-correction methods for long reads. We established a common set of benchmarks for performance assessment, including sensitivity, accuracy, output rate, alignment rate, output read length, run time, and memory usage, as well as the effects of error correction on two downstream applications of long reads: de novo assembly and resolving haplotype sequences.Conclusions:Taking into account all of these metrics, we provide a suggestive guideline for method choice based on available data size, computing resources, and individual research goals.",30717772,PMC6362602,10.1186/s13059-018-1605-z,50
The effects of sequencing platforms on phylogenetic resolution in 16 S rRNA gene profiling of human feces,"High-quality and high-throughput sequencing technologies are required for therapeutic and diagnostic analyses of human gut microbiota. Here, we evaluated the advantages and disadvantages of the various commercial sequencing platforms for studying human gut microbiota. We generated fecal bacterial sequences from 170 Korean subjects using the GS FLX+ (V1-4), Illumina MiSeq (V1-3, V3-4 and V4), and PacBio (V1-9) systems. Comparative analyses revealed that the PacBio data showed the weakest relationship with the reference whole-metagenome shotgun datasets. The PacBio system generated sequences with a significantly higher level of deletions than datasets generated by other platforms, with an abnormally high proportion of sequences assigned to the phylum Proteobacteria. Low sequencing accuracy and low coverage of terminal regions in public 16 S rRNA databases deteriorate the advantages of long read length, resulting in low taxonomic resolution in amplicon sequencing of human gut microbiota.",29688220,PMC5914283,10.1038/sdata.2018.68,17
Conventional and Single-Molecule Targeted Sequencing Method for Specific Variant Detection in IKBKG while Bypassing the IKBKGP1 Pseudogene,"In addition to Sanger sequencing, next-generation sequencing of gene panels and exomes has emerged as a standard diagnostic tool in many laboratories. However, these captures can miss regions, have poor efficiency, or capture pseudogenes, which hamper proper diagnoses. One such example is the primary immunodeficiency-associated gene IKBKG. Its pseudogene IKBKGP1 makes traditional capture methods aspecific. We therefore developed a long-range PCR method to efficiently target IKBKG, as well as two associated genes (IRAK4 and MYD88), while bypassing the IKBKGP1 pseudogene. Sequencing accuracy was evaluated using both conventional short-read technology and a newer long-read, single-molecule sequencer. Different mapping and variant calling options were evaluated in their capability to bypass the pseudogene using both sequencing platforms. Based on these evaluations, we determined a robust diagnostic application for unambiguous sequencing and variant calling in IKBKG, IRAK4, and MYD88. This method allows rapid identification of selected primary immunodeficiency diseases in patients suffering from life-threatening invasive pyogenic bacterial infections.",29269280,,10.1016/j.jmoldx.2017.10.005,14
Illumina Library Preparation for Sequencing the GC-Rich Fraction of Heterogeneous Genomic DNA,"Standard Illumina libraries are biased toward sequences of intermediate GC-content. This results in an underrepresentation of GC-rich regions in sequencing projects of genomes with heterogeneous base composition, such as mammals and birds. We developed a simple, cost-effective protocol to enrich sheared genomic DNA in its GC-rich fraction by subtracting AT-rich DNA. This was achieved by heating DNA up to 90 °C before applying Illumina library preparation. We tested the new approach on chicken DNA and found that heated DNA increased average coverage in the GC-richest chromosomes by a factor up to six. Using a Taq polymerase supposedly appropriate for PCR amplification of GC-rich sequences had a much weaker effect. Our protocol should greatly facilitate sequencing and resequencing of the GC-richest regions of heterogeneous genomes, in combination with standard short-read and long-read technologies.",29385572,PMC5808798,10.1093/gbe/evy022,11
The hidden perils of read mapping as a quality assessment tool in genome sequencing,"This article provides a comparative analysis of the various methods of genome sequencing focusing on verification of the assembly quality. The results of a comparative assessment of various de novo assembly tools, as well as sequencing technologies, are presented using a recently completed sequence of the genome of Lactobacillus fermentum 3872. In particular, quality of assemblies is assessed by using CLC Genomics Workbench read mapping and Optical mapping developed by OpGen. Over-extension of contigs without prior knowledge of contig location can lead to misassembled contigs, even when commonly used quality indicators such as read mapping suggest that a contig is well assembled. Precautions must also be undertaken when using long read sequencing technology, which may also lead to misassembled contigs.",28225089,PMC5320493,10.1038/srep43149,6
"Improved assembly and variant detection of a haploid human genome using single-molecule, high-fidelity long reads","The sequence and assembly of human genomes using long-read sequencing technologies has revolutionized our understanding of structural variation and genome organization. We compared the accuracy, continuity, and gene annotation of genome assemblies generated from either high-fidelity (HiFi) or continuous long-read (CLR) datasets from the same complete hydatidiform mole human genome. We find that the HiFi sequence data assemble an additional 10% of duplicated regions and more accurately represent the structure of tandem repeats, as validated with orthogonal analyses. As a result, an additional 5 Mbp of pericentromeric sequences are recovered in the HiFi assembly, resulting in a 2.5-fold increase in the NG50 within 1 Mbp of the centromere (HiFi 480.6 kbp, CLR 191.5 kbp). Additionally, the HiFi genome assembly was generated in significantly less time with fewer computational resources than the CLR assembly. Although the HiFi assembly has significantly improved continuity and accuracy in many complex regions of the genome, it still falls short of the assembly of centromeric DNA and the largest regions of segmental duplication using existing assemblers. Despite these shortcomings, our results suggest that HiFi may be the most effective standalone technology for de novo assembly of human genomes.",31711268,PMC7015760,10.1111/ahg.12364,64
Resolving plasmid structures inEnterobacteriaceaeusing the MinION nanopore sequencer: assessment of MinION and MinION/Illumina hybrid data assembly approaches,"This study aimed to assess the feasibility of using the Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) MinION long-read sequencer in reconstructing fully closed plasmid sequences from eightEnterobacteriaceaeisolates of six different species with plasmid populations of varying complexity. Species represented wereEscherichia coli,Klebsiella pneumoniae,Citrobacter freundii,Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescensandKlebsiella oxytoca, with plasmid populations ranging from 1-11 plasmids with sizes of 2-330 kb. Isolates were sequenced using Illumina (short-read) and ONT's MinION (long-read) platforms, and compared with fully resolved PacBio (long-read) sequence assemblies for the same isolates. We compared the performance of different assembly approaches including SPAdes, plasmidSPAdes, hybridSPAdes, Canu, Canu+Pilon (canuPilon) and npScarf in recovering the plasmid structures of these isolates by comparing with the gold-standard PacBio reference sequences. Overall, canuPilon provided consistently good quality assemblies both in terms of assembly statistics (N50, number of contigs) and assembly accuracy [presence of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)/indels with respect to the reference sequence]. For plasmid reconstruction, Canu recovered 70 % of the plasmids in complete contigs, and combining three assembly approaches (Canu or canuPilon, hybridSPAdes and plasmidSPAdes) resulted in a total 78 % recovery rate for all the plasmids. The analysis demonstrated the potential of using MinION sequencing technology to resolve important plasmid structures inEnterobacteriaceaespecies independent of and in conjunction with Illumina sequencing data. A consensus assembly derived from several assembly approaches could present significant benefit in accurately resolving the greatest number of plasmid structures.",29026658,PMC5610714,10.1099/mgen.0.000118,52
Performance analysis of conventional and AI-based variant callers using short and long reads,"Background:The accurate detection of variants is essential for genomics-based studies. Currently, there are various tools designed to detect genomic variants, however, it has always been a challenge to decide which tool to use, especially when various major genome projects have chosen to use different tools. Thus far, most of the existing tools were mainly developed to work on short-read data (i.e., Illumina); however, other sequencing technologies (e.g. PacBio, and Oxford Nanopore) have recently shown that they can also be used for variant calling. In addition, with the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI)-based variant calling tools, there is a pressing need to compare these tools in terms of efficiency, accuracy, computational power, and ease of use.Results:In this study, we evaluated five of the most widely used conventional and AI-based variant calling tools (BCFTools, GATK4, Platypus, DNAscope, and DeepVariant) in terms of accuracy and computational cost using both short-read and long-read data derived from three different sequencing technologies (Illumina, PacBio HiFi, and ONT) for the same set of samples from the Genome In A Bottle project. The analysis showed that AI-based variant calling tools supersede conventional ones for calling SNVs and INDELs using both long and short reads in most aspects. In addition, we demonstrate the advantages and drawbacks of each tool while ranking them in each aspect of these comparisons.Conclusion:This study provides best practices for variant calling using AI-based and conventional variant callers with different types of sequencing data.",38097928,PMC10720095,10.1186/s12859-023-05596-3,2
A benchmark and an algorithm for detecting germline transposon insertions and measuring de novo transposon insertion frequencies,"Transposons are genomic parasites, and their new insertions can cause instability and spur the evolution of their host genomes. Rapid accumulation of short-read whole-genome sequencing data provides a great opportunity for studying new transposon insertions and their impacts on the host genome. Although many algorithms are available for detecting transposon insertions, the task remains challenging and existing tools are not designed for identifying de novo insertions. Here, we present a new benchmark fly dataset based on PacBio long-read sequencing and a new method TEMP2 for detecting germline insertions and measuring de novo 'singleton' insertion frequencies in eukaryotic genomes. TEMP2 achieves high sensitivity and precision for detecting germline insertions when compared with existing tools using both simulated data in fly and experimental data in fly and human. Furthermore, TEMP2 can accurately assess the frequencies of de novo transposon insertions even with high levels of chimeric reads in simulated datasets; such chimeric reads often occur during the construction of short-read sequencing libraries. By applying TEMP2 to published data on hybrid dysgenic flies inflicted by de-repressed P-elements, we confirmed the continuous new insertions of P-elements in dysgenic offspring before they regain piRNAs for P-element repression. TEMP2 is freely available at Github: https://github.com/weng-lab/TEMP2.",33511407,PMC8096211,10.1093/nar/gkab010,16
SLR: a scaffolding algorithm based on long reads and contig classification,"Background:Scaffolding is an important step in genome assembly that orders and orients the contigs produced by assemblers. However, repetitive regions in contigs usually prevent scaffolding from producing accurate results. How to solve the problem of repetitive regions has received a great deal of attention. In the past few years, long reads sequenced by third-generation sequencing technologies (Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore) have been demonstrated to be useful for sequencing repetitive regions in genomes. Although some stand-alone scaffolding algorithms based on long reads have been presented, scaffolding still requires a new strategy to take full advantage of the characteristics of long reads.Results:Here, we present a new scaffolding algorithm based on long reads and contig classification (SLR). Through the alignment information of long reads and contigs, SLR classifies the contigs into unique contigs and ambiguous contigs for addressing the problem of repetitive regions. Next, SLR uses only unique contigs to produce draft scaffolds. Then, SLR inserts the ambiguous contigs into the draft scaffolds and produces the final scaffolds. We compare SLR to three popular scaffolding tools by using long read datasets sequenced with Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore technologies. The experimental results show that SLR can produce better results in terms of accuracy and completeness. The open-source code of SLR is available at https://github.com/luojunwei/SLR.Conclusion:In this paper, we describes SLR, which is designed to scaffold contigs using long reads. We conclude that SLR can improve the completeness of genome assembly.",31666010,PMC6820941,10.1186/s12859-019-3114-9,8
Species-level bacterial community profiling of the healthy sinonasal microbiome using Pacific Biosciences sequencing of full-length 16S rRNA genes,"Background:Pan-bacterial 16S rRNA microbiome surveys performed with massively parallel DNA sequencing technologies have transformed community microbiological studies. Current 16S profiling methods, however, fail to provide sufficient taxonomic resolution and accuracy to adequately perform species-level associative studies for specific conditions. This is due to the amplification and sequencing of only short 16S rRNA gene regions, typically providing for only family- or genus-level taxonomy. Moreover, sequencing errors often inflate the number of taxa present. Pacific Biosciences' (PacBio's) long-read technology in particular suffers from high error rates per base. Herein, we present a microbiome analysis pipeline that takes advantage of PacBio circular consensus sequencing (CCS) technology to sequence and error correct full-length bacterial 16S rRNA genes, which provides high-fidelity species-level microbiome data.Results:Analysis of a mock community with 20 bacterial species demonstrated 100% specificity and sensitivity with regard to taxonomic classification. Examination of a 250-plus species mock community demonstrated correct species-level classification of > 90% of taxa, and relative abundances were accurately captured. The majority of the remaining taxa were demonstrated to be multiply, incorrectly, or incompletely classified. Using this methodology, we examined the microgeographic variation present among the microbiomes of six sinonasal sites, by both swab and biopsy, from the anterior nasal cavity to the sphenoid sinus from 12 subjects undergoing trans-sphenoidal hypophysectomy. We found greater variation among subjects than among sites within a subject, although significant within-individual differences were also observed. Propiniobacterium acnes (recently renamed Cutibacterium acnes) was the predominant species throughout, but was found at distinct relative abundances by site.Conclusions:Our microbial composition analysis pipeline for single-molecule real-time 16S rRNA gene sequencing (MCSMRT, https://github.com/jpearl01/mcsmrt ) overcomes deficits of standard marker gene-based microbiome analyses by using CCS of entire 16S rRNA genes to provide increased taxonomic and phylogenetic resolution. Extensions of this approach to other marker genes could help refine taxonomic assignments of microbial species and improve reference databases, as well as strengthen the specificity of associations between microbial communities and dysbiotic states.",30352611,PMC6199724,10.1186/s40168-018-0569-2,67
A Fast Approximate Algorithm for Mapping Long Reads to Large Reference Databases,"Emerging single-molecule sequencing technologies from Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore have revived interest in long-read mapping algorithms. Alignment-based seed-and-extend methods demonstrate good accuracy, but face limited scalability, while faster alignment-free methods typically trade decreased precision for efficiency. In this article, we combine a fast approximate read mapping algorithm based on minimizers with a novel MinHash identity estimation technique to achieve both scalability and precision. In contrast to prior methods, we develop a mathematical framework that defines the types of mapping targets we uncover, establish probabilistic estimates of p-value and sensitivity, and demonstrate tolerance for alignment error rates up to 20%. With this framework, our algorithm automatically adapts to different minimum length and identity requirements and provides both positional and identity estimates for each mapping reported. For mapping human PacBio reads to the hg38 reference, our method is 290 × faster than Burrows-Wheeler Aligner-MEM with a lower memory footprint and recall rate of 96%. We further demonstrate the scalability of our method by mapping noisy PacBio reads (each ≥5 kbp in length) to the complete NCBI RefSeq database containing 838 Gbp of sequence and >60,000 genomes.",29708767,PMC6067103,10.1089/cmb.2018.0036,43
Genome-wide survey of tandem repeats by nanopore sequencing shows that disease-associated repeats are more polymorphic in the general population,"Background:Tandem repeats are highly mutable and contribute to the development of human disease by a variety of mechanisms. It is difficult to predict which tandem repeats may cause a disease. One hypothesis is that changeable tandem repeats are the source of genetic diseases, because disease-causing repeats are polymorphic in healthy individuals. However, it is not clear whether disease-causing repeats are more polymorphic than other repeats.Methods:We performed a genome-wide survey of the millions of human tandem repeats using publicly available long read genome sequencing data from 21 humans. We measured tandem repeat copy number changes using tandem-genotypes. Length variation of known disease-associated repeats was compared to other repeat loci.Results:We found that known Mendelian disease-causing or disease-associated repeats, especially CAG and 5'UTR GGC repeats, are relatively long and polymorphic in the general population. We also show that repeat lengths of two disease-causing tandem repeats, in ATXN3 and GLS, are correlated with near-by GWAS SNP genotypes.Conclusions:We provide a catalog of polymorphic tandem repeats across a variety of repeat unit lengths and sequences, from long read sequencing data. This method especially if used in genome wide association study, may indicate possible new candidates of pathogenic or biologically important tandem repeats in human genomes.",33413375,PMC7791882,10.1186/s12920-020-00853-3,6
JASPER: A fast genome polishing tool that improves accuracy of genome assemblies,"Advances in long-read sequencing technologies have dramatically improved the contiguity and completeness of genome assemblies. Using the latest nanopore-based sequencers, we can generate enough data for the assembly of a human genome from a single flow cell. With the long-read data from these sequences, we can now routinely produce de novo genome assemblies in which half or more of a genome is contained in megabase-scale contigs. Assemblies produced from nanopore data alone, though, have relatively high error rates and can benefit from a process called polishing, in which more-accurate reads are used to correct errors in the consensus sequence. In this manuscript, we present a novel tool for genome polishing called JASPER (Jellyfish-based Assembly Sequence Polisher for Error Reduction). In contrast to many other polishing methods, JASPER gains efficiency by avoiding the alignment of reads to the assembly. Instead, JASPER uses a database of k-mer counts that it creates from the reads to detect and correct errors in the consensus. Our experiments demonstrate that JASPER is faster than alignment-based polishers, and both faster and more accurate than other k-mer based polishing methods. We also introduce the idea of using a polishing tool to create population-specific reference genomes, and illustrate this idea using sequence data from multiple individuals from Tokyo, Japan.",37000853,PMC10096238,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011032,2
De novo clustering of long reads by gene from transcriptomics data,"Long-read sequencing currently provides sequences of several thousand base pairs. It is therefore possible to obtain complete transcripts, offering an unprecedented vision of the cellular transcriptome. However the literature lacks tools for de novo clustering of such data, in particular for Oxford Nanopore Technologies reads, because of the inherent high error rate compared to short reads. Our goal is to process reads from whole transcriptome sequencing data accurately and without a reference genome in order to reliably group reads coming from the same gene. This de novo approach is therefore particularly suitable for non-model species, but can also serve as a useful pre-processing step to improve read mapping. Our contribution both proposes a new algorithm adapted to clustering of reads by gene and a practical and free access tool that allows to scale the complete processing of eukaryotic transcriptomes. We sequenced a mouse RNA sample using the MinION device. This dataset is used to compare our solution to other algorithms used in the context of biological clustering. We demonstrate that it is the best approach for transcriptomics long reads. When a reference is available to enable mapping, we show that it stands as an alternative method that predicts complementary clusters.",30260405,PMC6326815,10.1093/nar/gky834,18
Chromosome-level genome assembly and structural variant analysis of two laboratory yeast strains from the Peterhof Genetic Collection lineage,"Thousands of yeast genomes have been sequenced with both traditional and long-read technologies, and multiple observations about modes of genome evolution for both wild and laboratory strains have been drawn from these sequences. In our study, we applied Oxford Nanopore and Illumina technologies to assemble complete genomes of two widely used members of a distinct laboratory yeast lineage, the Peterhof Genetic Collection (PGC), and investigate the structural features of these genomes including transposable element content, copy number alterations, and structural rearrangements. We identified numerous notable structural differences between genomes of PGC strains and the reference S288C strain. We discovered a substantial enrichment of mid-length insertions and deletions within repetitive coding sequences, such as in the SCH9 gene or the NUP100 gene, with possible impact of these variants on protein amyloidogenicity. High contiguity of the final assemblies allowed us to trace back the history of reciprocal unbalanced translocations between chromosomes I, VIII, IX, XI, and XVI of the PGC strains. We show that formation of hybrid alleles of the FLO genes during such chromosomal rearrangements is likely responsible for the lack of invasive growth of yeast strains. Taken together, our results highlight important features of laboratory yeast strain evolution using the power of long-read sequencing.",33677552,PMC8759820,10.1093/g3journal/jkab029,6
A pipeline for complete characterization of complex germline rearrangements from long DNA reads,"Background:Many genetic/genomic disorders are caused by genomic rearrangements. Standard methods can often characterize these variations only partly, e.g., copy number changes or breakpoints. It is important to fully understand the order and orientation of rearranged fragments, with precise breakpoints, to know the pathogenicity of the rearrangements.Methods:We performed whole-genome-coverage nanopore sequencing of long DNA reads from four patients with chromosomal translocations. We identified rearrangements relative to a reference human genome, subtracted rearrangements shared by any of 33 control individuals, and determined the order and orientation of rearranged fragments, with our newly developed analysis pipeline.Results:We describe the full characterization of complex chromosomal rearrangements, by filtering out genomic rearrangements seen in controls without the same disease, reducing the number of loci per patient from a few thousand to a few dozen. Breakpoint detection was very accurate; we usually see ~ 0 ± 1 base difference from Sanger sequencing-confirmed breakpoints. For one patient with two reciprocal chromosomal translocations, we find that the translocation points have complex rearrangements of multiple DNA fragments involving 5 chromosomes, which we could order and orient by an automatic algorithm, thereby fully reconstructing the rearrangement. A rearrangement is more than the sum of its parts: some properties, such as sequence loss, can be inferred only after reconstructing the whole rearrangement. In this patient, the rearrangements were evidently caused by shattering of the chromosomes into multiple fragments, which rejoined in a different order and orientation with loss of some fragments.Conclusions:We developed an effective analytic pipeline to find chromosomal aberration in congenital diseases by filtering benign changes, only from long read sequencing. Our algorithm for reconstruction of complex rearrangements is useful to interpret rearrangements with many breakpoints, e.g., chromothripsis. Our approach promises to fully characterize many congenital germline rearrangements, provided they do not involve poorly understood loci such as centromeric repeats.",32731881,PMC7393826,10.1186/s13073-020-00762-1,18
"Serogroup-level resolution of the ""Super-7"" Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli using nanopore single-molecule DNA sequencing","DNA sequencing and other DNA-based methods are now broadly used for detection and identification of bacterial foodborne pathogens. For the identification of foodborne bacterial pathogens, taxonomic assignments must be made to the species or even subspecies level. Long-read DNA sequencing provides finer taxonomic resolution than short-read sequencing. Here, we demonstrate the potential of long-read shotgun sequencing obtained from the Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) MinION single-molecule sequencer, in combination with the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) with custom sequence databases, for foodborne pathogen identification. A library of mixed DNA from strains of the ""Super-7"" Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) serogroups (O26, O45, O103, O111, O121, O145, and O157[:H7]) was sequenced using the ONT MinION resulting in 44,245 long-read sequences. The ONT MinION sequences were compared to a custom database composed of the E. coli O-antigen gene clusters. A vast majority of the sequence reads were from outside of the O-antigen cluster and did not align to any sequences in the O-antigen database. However, 58 sequences (0.13% of the total sequence reads) did align to a specific Super-7 O-antigen gene cluster, with each O-antigen cluster aligning to at least four sequence reads. BLAST analysis against a custom whole-genome database revealed that 5096 (11.5%) of the MinION sequence reads aligned to one and only one sequence in the database, of which 99.6% aligned to a sequence from a ""Super-7"" STEC. These results demonstrate the ability of the method to resolve STEC to the serogroup level and the potential general utility of the MinION for the detection and typing of foodborne pathogens.",29374775,,10.1007/s00216-018-0877-1,3
Detection and assessment of copy number variation using PacBio long-read and Illumina sequencing in New Zealand dairy cattle,"Single nucleotide polymorphisms have been the DNA variant of choice for genomic prediction, largely because of the ease of single nucleotide polymorphism genotype collection. In contrast, structural variants (SV), which include copy number variants (CNV), translocations, insertions, and inversions, have eluded easy detection and characterization, particularly in nonhuman species. However, evidence increasingly shows that SV not only contribute a substantial proportion of genetic variation but also have significant influence on phenotypes. Here we present the discovery of CNV in a prominent New Zealand dairy bull using long-read PacBio (Pacific Biosciences, Menlo Park, CA) sequencing technology and the Sniffles SV discovery tool (version 0.0.1; https://github.com/fritzsedlazeck/Sniffles). The CNV identified from long reads were compared with CNV discovered in the same bull from Illumina sequencing using CNVnator (read depth-based tool; Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA) as a means of validation. Subsequently, further validation was undertaken using whole-genome Illumina sequencing of 556 cattle representing the wider New Zealand dairy cattle population. Very limited overlap was observed in CNV discovered from the 2 sequencing platforms, in part because of the differences in size of CNV detected. Only a few CNV were therefore able to be validated using this approach. However, the ability to use CNVnator to genotype the 557 cattle for copy number across all regions identified as putative CNV allowed a genome-wide assessment of transmission level of copy number based on pedigree. The more highly transmissible a putative CNV region was observed to be, the more likely the distribution of copy number was multimodal across the 557 sequenced animals. Furthermore, visual assessment of highly transmissible CNV regions provided evidence supporting the presence of CNV across the sequenced animals. This transmission-based approach was able to confirm a subset of CNV that segregates in the New Zealand dairy cattle population. Genome-wide identification and validation of CNV is an important step toward their inclusion in genomic selection strategies.",28456410,,10.3168/jds.2016-12199,13
Transcriptome annotation of 17 porcine tissues using nanopore sequencing technology,"The annotation of animal genomes plays an important role in elucidating molecular mechanisms behind the genetic control of economically important traits. Here, we employed long-read sequencing technology, Oxford Nanopore Technology, to annotate the pig transcriptome across 17 tissues from two Yorkshire littermate pigs. More than 9.8 million reads were obtained from a single flow cell, and 69 781 unique transcripts at 50 108 loci were identified. Of these transcripts, 16 255 were found to be novel isoforms, and 22 344 were found at loci that were novel and unannotated in the Ensembl (release 102) and NCBI (release 106) annotations. Novel transcripts were mostly expressed in cerebellum, followed by lung, liver, spleen, and hypothalamus. By comparing the unannotated transcripts to existing databases, there were 21 285 (95.3%) transcripts matched to the NT database (v5) and 13 676 (61.2%) matched to the NR database (v5). Moreover, there were 4324 (19.4%) transcripts matched to the SwissProt database (v5), corresponding to 11 356 proteins. Tissue-specific gene expression analyses showed that 9749 transcripts were highly tissue-specific, and cerebellum contained the most tissue-specific transcripts. As the same samples were used for the annotation of cis-regulatory elements in the pig genome, the transcriptome annotation generated by this study provides an additional and complementary annotation resource for the Functional Annotation of Animal Genomes effort to comprehensively annotate the pig genome.",36385508,,10.1111/age.13274,0
The first genome assembly of fungal pathogen Pyrenophora tritici-repentis race 1 isolate using Oxford Nanopore MinION sequencing,"Objectives:The assembly of fungal genomes using short-reads is challenged by long repetitive and low GC regions. However, long-read sequencing technologies, such as PacBio and Oxford Nanopore, are able to overcome many problematic regions, thereby providing an opportunity to improve fragmented genome assemblies derived from short reads only. Here, a necrotrophic fungal pathogen Pyrenophora tritici-repentis (Ptr) isolate 134 (Ptr134), which causes tan spot disease on wheat, was sequenced on a MinION using Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), to improve on a previous Illumina short-read genome assembly and provide a more complete genome resource for pan-genomic analyses of Ptr.Results:The genome of Ptr134 sequenced on a MinION using ONT was assembled into 28 contiguous sequences with a total length of 40.79 Mb and GC content of 50.81%. The long-read assembly provided 6.79 Mb of new sequence and 2846 extra annotated protein coding genes as compared to the previous short-read assembly. This improved genome sequence represents near complete chromosomes, an important resource for large scale and pan genomic comparative analyses.",34454585,PMC8403381,10.1186/s13104-021-05751-0,1

Genome Sequence Resource ofPhytophthora colocasiaefrom China Using Nanopore Sequencing Technology,"Phytophthora colocasiaeis a destructive oomycete pathogen of taro (Colocasia esculenta), which causes taro leaf blight. To date, only one highly fragmented Illumina short-read-based genome assembly is available for this species. To address this problem, we sequenced strain Lyd2019 from China using Oxford Nanopore Technologies long-read sequencing and Illumina short-read sequencing. We generated a 92.51-Mb genome assembly consisting of 105 contigs with an N50of 1.70 Mb and a maximum length of 4.17 Mb. In the genome assembly, we identified 52.78% repeats and 18,322 protein-coding genes, of which 12,782 genes were annotated. We also identified 191 candidate RXLR effectors and 1 candidate crinkling and necrosis effector. The updated near-chromosome genome assembly and annotation resources will provide a better understanding of the infection mechanisms ofP. colocasiae.",33983796,,10.1094/PDIS-11-20-2327-A,1
Effect of sequence depth and length in long-read assembly of the maize inbred NC358,"Improvements in long-read data and scaffolding technologies have enabled rapid generation of reference-quality assemblies for complex genomes. Still, an assessment of critical sequence depth and read length is important for allocating limited resources. To this end, we have generated eight assemblies for the complex genome of the maize inbred line NC358 using PacBio datasets ranging from 20 to 75 × genomic depth and with N50 subread lengths of 11-21 kb. Assemblies with ≤30 × depth and N50 subread length of 11 kb are highly fragmented, with even low-copy genic regions showing degradation at 20 × depth. Distinct sequence-quality thresholds are observed for complete assembly of genes, transposable elements, and highly repetitive genomic features such as telomeres, heterochromatic knobs, and centromeres. In addition, we show high-quality optical maps can dramatically improve contiguity in even our most fragmented base assembly. This study provides a useful resource allocation reference to the community as long-read technologies continue to mature.",32385271,PMC7211024,10.1038/s41467-020-16037-7,27
Twelve quick steps for genome assembly and annotation in the classroom,"Eukaryotic genome sequencing and de novo assembly, once the exclusive domain of well-funded international consortia, have become increasingly affordable, thus fitting the budgets of individual research groups. Third-generation long-read DNA sequencing technologies are increasingly used, providing extensive genomic toolkits that were once reserved for a few select model organisms. Generating high-quality genome assemblies and annotations for many aquatic species still presents significant challenges due to their large genome sizes, complexity, and high chromosome numbers. Indeed, selecting the most appropriate sequencing and software platforms and annotation pipelines for a new genome project can be daunting because tools often only work in limited contexts. In genomics, generating a high-quality genome assembly/annotation has become an indispensable tool for better understanding the biology of any species. Herein, we state 12 steps to help researchers get started in genome projects by presenting guidelines that are broadly applicable (to any species), sustainable over time, and cover all aspects of genome assembly and annotation projects from start to finish. We review some commonly used approaches, including practical methods to extract high-quality DNA and choices for the best sequencing platforms and library preparations. In addition, we discuss the range of potential bioinformatics pipelines, including structural and functional annotations (e.g., transposable elements and repetitive sequences). This paper also includes information on how to build a wide community for a genome project, the importance of data management, and how to make the data and results Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) by submitting them to a public repository and sharing them with the research community.",33180771,PMC7660529,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008325,16
Genomic and resistome analysis of Alcaligenes faecalis strain PGB1 by Nanopore MinION and Illumina Technologies,"Background:Drug-resistant bacteria are important carriers of antibiotic-resistant genes (ARGs). This fact is crucial for the development of precise clinical drug treatment strategies. Long-read sequencing platforms such as the Oxford Nanopore sequencer can improve genome assembly efficiency particularly when they are combined with short-read sequencing data.Results:Alcaligenes faecalis PGB1 was isolated and identified with resistance to penicillin and three other antibiotics. After being sequenced by Nanopore MinION and Illumina sequencer, its entire genome was hybrid-assembled. One chromosome and one plasmid was assembled and annotated with 4,433 genes (including 91 RNA genes). Function annotation and comparison between strains were performed. A phylogenetic analysis revealed that it was closest to A. faecalis ZD02. Resistome related sequences was explored, including ARGs, Insert sequence, phage. Two plasmid aminoglycoside genes were determined to be acquired ARGs. The main ARG category was antibiotic efflux resistance and β-lactamase (EC 3.5.2.6) of PGB1 was assigned to Class A, Subclass A1b, and Cluster LSBL3.Conclusions:The present study identified the newly isolated bacterium A. faecalis PGB1 and systematically annotated its genome sequence and ARGs.",35443609,PMC9022240,10.1186/s12864-022-08507-7,6
Nanopore sequencing reads improve assembly and gene annotation of the Parochlus steinenii genome,"Parochlus steinenii is a winged midge from King George Island. It is cold-tolerant and endures the harsh Antarctic winter. Previously, we reported the genome of this midge, but the genome assembly with short reads had limited contig contiguity, which reduced the completeness of the genome assembly and the annotated gene sets. Recently, assembly contiguity has been increased using nanopore technology. A number of methods for enhancing the low base quality of the assembly have been reported, including long-read (e.g. Nanopolish) or short-read (e.g. Pilon) based methods. Based on these advances, we used nanopore technologies to upgrade the draft genome sequence of P. steinenii. The final assembled genome was 145,366,448 bases in length. The contig number decreased from 9,132 to 162, and the N50 contig size increased from 36,946 to 1,989,550 bases. The BUSCO completeness of the assembly increased from 87.8 to 98.7%. Improved assembly statistics helped predict more genes from the draft genome of P. steinenii. The completeness of the predicted gene model increased from 79.5 to 92.1%, but the numbers and types of the predicted repeats were similar to those observed in the short read assembly, with the exception of long interspersed nuclear elements. In the present study, we markedly improved the P. steinenii genome assembly statistics using nanopore sequencing, but found that genome polishing with high-quality reads was essential for improving genome annotation. The number of genes predicted and the lengths of the genes were greater than before, and nanopore technology readily improved genome information.",30911035,PMC6434015,10.1038/s41598-019-41549-8,11
SVDSS: structural variation discovery in hard-to-call genomic regions using sample-specific strings from accurate long reads,"Structural variants (SVs) account for a large amount of sequence variability across genomes and play an important role in human genomics and precision medicine. Despite intense efforts over the years, the discovery of SVs in individuals remains challenging due to the diploid and highly repetitive structure of the human genome, and by the presence of SVs that vastly exceed sequencing read lengths. However, the recent introduction of low-error long-read sequencing technologies such as PacBio HiFi may finally enable these barriers to be overcome. Here we present SV discovery with sample-specific strings (SVDSS)-a method for discovery of SVs from long-read sequencing technologies (for example, PacBio HiFi) that combines and effectively leverages mapping-free, mapping-based and assembly-based methodologies for overall superior SV discovery performance. Our experiments on several human samples show that SVDSS outperforms state-of-the-art mapping-based methods for discovery of insertion and deletion SVs in PacBio HiFi reads and achieves notable improvements in calling SVs in repetitive regions of the genome.",36550274,,10.1038/s41592-022-01674-1,7
Nanopore sequencing and the Shasta toolkit enable efficient de novo assembly of eleven human genomes,"De novo assembly of a human genome using nanopore long-read sequences has been reported, but it used more than 150,000 CPU hours and weeks of wall-clock time. To enable rapid human genome assembly, we present Shasta, a de novo long-read assembler, and polishing algorithms named MarginPolish and HELEN. Using a single PromethION nanopore sequencer and our toolkit, we assembled 11 highly contiguous human genomes de novo in 9 d. We achieved roughly 63× coverage, 42-kb read N50 values and 6.5× coverage in reads >100 kb using three flow cells per sample. Shasta produced a complete haploid human genome assembly in under 6 h on a single commercial compute node. MarginPolish and HELEN polished haploid assemblies to more than 99.9% identity (Phred quality score QV = 30) with nanopore reads alone. Addition of proximity-ligation sequencing enabled near chromosome-level scaffolds for all 11 genomes. We compare our assembly performance to existing methods for diploid, haploid and trio-binned human samples and report superior accuracy and speed.",32686750,PMC7483855,10.1038/s41587-020-0503-6,208
A Sequence-Based Novel Approach for Quality Evaluation of Third-Generation Sequencing Reads,"The advent of third-generation sequencing (TGS) technologies, such as the Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and Oxford Nanopore machines, provides new possibilities for contig assembly, scaffolding, and high-performance computing in bioinformatics due to its long reads. However, the high error rate and poor quality of TGS reads provide new challenges for accurate genome assembly and long-read alignment. Efficient processing methods are in need to prioritize high-quality reads for improving the results of error correction and assembly. In this study, we proposed a novel Read Quality Evaluation and Selection Tool (REQUEST) for evaluating the quality of third-generation long reads. REQUEST generates training data of high-quality and low-quality reads which are characterized by their nucleotide combinations. A linear regression model was built to score the quality of reads. The method was tested on three datasets of different species. The results showed that the top-scored reads prioritized by REQUEST achieved higher alignment accuracies. The contig assembly results based on the top-scored reads also outperformed conventional approaches that use all reads. REQUEST is able to distinguish high-quality reads from low-quality ones without using reference genomes, making it a promising alternative sequence-quality evaluation method to alignment-based algorithms.",30646604,PMC6356754,10.3390/genes10010044,0
"A computational toolset for rapid identification of SARS-CoV-2, other viruses and microorganisms from sequencing data","In this paper, we present a toolset and related resources for rapid identification of viruses and microorganisms from short-read or long-read sequencing data. We present fastv as an ultra-fast tool to detect microbial sequences present in sequencing data, identify target microorganisms and visualize coverage of microbial genomes. This tool is based on the k-mer mapping and extension method. K-mer sets are generated by UniqueKMER, another tool provided in this toolset. UniqueKMER can generate complete sets of unique k-mers for each genome within a large set of viral or microbial genomes. For convenience, unique k-mers for microorganisms and common viruses that afflict humans have been generated and are provided with the tools. As a lightweight tool, fastv accepts FASTQ data as input and directly outputs the results in both HTML and JSON formats. Prior to the k-mer analysis, fastv automatically performs adapter trimming, quality pruning, base correction and other preprocessing to ensure the accuracy of k-mer analysis. Specifically, fastv provides built-in support for rapid severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) identification and typing. Experimental results showed that fastv achieved 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity for detecting SARS-CoV-2 from sequencing data; and can distinguish SARS-CoV-2 from SARS, Middle East respiratory syndrome and other coronaviruses. This toolset is available at: https://github.com/OpenGene/fastv.",33003197,PMC7543257,10.1093/bib/bbaa231,17
An improved reference of the grapevine genome reasserts the origin of the PN40024 highly homozygous genotype,"The genome sequence of the diploid and highly homozygous Vitis vinifera genotype PN40024 serves as the reference for many grapevine studies. Despite several improvements to the PN40024 genome assembly, its current version PN12X.v2 is quite fragmented and only represents the haploid state of the genome with mixed haplotypes. In fact, being nearly homozygous, this genome contains several heterozygous regions that are yet to be resolved. Taking the opportunity of improvements that long-read sequencing technologies offer to fully discriminate haplotype sequences, an improved version of the reference, called PN40024.v4, was generated. Through incorporating long genomic sequencing reads to the assembly, the continuity of the 12X.v2 scaffolds was highly increased with a total number decreasing from 2,059 to 640 and a reduction in N bases of 88%. Additionally, the full alternative haplotype sequence was built for the first time, the chromosome anchoring was improved and the number of unplaced scaffolds was reduced by half. To obtain a high-quality gene annotation that outperforms previous versions, a liftover approach was complemented with an optimized annotation workflow for Vitis. Integration of the gene reference catalogue and its manual curation have also assisted in improving the annotation, while defining the most reliable estimation of 35,230 genes to date. Finally, we demonstrated that PN40024 resulted from 9 selfings of cv. ""Helfensteiner"" (cross of cv. ""Pinot noir"" and ""Schiava grossa"") instead of a single ""Pinot noir"". These advances will help maintain the PN40024 genome as a gold-standard reference, also contributing toward the eventual elaboration of the grapevine pangenome.",36966465,PMC10151409,10.1093/g3journal/jkad067,9
Tandem-genotypes: robust detection of tandem repeat expansions from long DNA reads,"Tandemly repeated DNA is highly mutable and causes at least 31 diseases, but it is hard to detect pathogenic repeat expansions genome-wide. Here, we report robust detection of human repeat expansions from careful alignments of long but error-prone (PacBio and nanopore) reads to a reference genome. Our method is robust to systematic sequencing errors, inexact repeats with fuzzy boundaries, and low sequencing coverage. By comparing to healthy controls, we prioritize pathogenic expansions within the top 10 out of 700,000 tandem repeats in whole genome sequencing data. This may help to elucidate the many genetic diseases whose causes remain unknown.",30890163,PMC6425644,10.1186/s13059-019-1667-6,57
Detection of active transposable elements in Arabidopsis thaliana using Oxford Nanopore Sequencing technology,"Background:Transposables elements (TEs) contribute to both structural and functional dynamics of most eukaryotic genomes. Because of their propensity to densely populate plant and animal genomes, the precise estimation of the impact of transposition on genomic diversity has been considered as one of the main challenges of today's genomics. The recent development of NGS (next generation sequencing) technologies has open new perspectives in population genomics by providing new methods for high throughput detection of Transposable Elements-associated Structural Variants (TEASV). However, these have relied on Illumina platform that generates short reads (up to 350 nucleotides). This limitation in size of sequence reads can cause high false discovery rate (FDR) and therefore limit the power of detection of TEASVs, especially in the case of large, complex genomes. The newest sequencing technologies, such as Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) can generate kilobases-long reads thus representing a promising tool for TEASV detection in plant and animals.Results:We present the results of a pilot experiment for TEASV detection on the model plant species Arabidopsis thaliana using ONT sequencing and show that it can be used efficiently to detect TE movements. We generated a ~0.8X genome coverage of a met1-derived epigenetic recombinant inbred line (epiRIL) using a MinIon device with R7 chemistry. We were able to detect nine new copies of the LTR-retrotransposon Evadé (EVD). We also evidenced the activity of the DNA transposon CACTA, CAC1.Conclusions:Even at a low sequence coverage (0.8X), ONT sequencing allowed us to reliably detect several TE insertions in Arabidopsis thaliana genome. The long read length allowed a precise and un-ambiguous mapping of the structural variations caused by the activity of TEs. This suggests that the trade-off between read length and genome coverage for TEASV detection may be in favor of the former. Should the technology be further improved both in terms of lower error rate and operation costs, it could be efficiently used in diversity studies at population level.",28715998,PMC5513335,10.1186/s12864-017-3753-z,21
De novo assembly of middle-sized genome using MinION and Illumina sequencers,"Background:The plastid acquisition by secondary endosymbiosis is a driving force for the algal evolution, and the comparative genomics was required to examine the genomic change of symbiont. Therefore, we established a pipeline of a de novo assembly of middle-sized genomes at a low cost and with high quality using long and short reads.Results:We sequenced symbiotic algae Chlorella variabilis using Oxfofrd Nanopore MinION as the long-read sequencer and Illumina HiSeq 4000 as the short-read sequencer and then assembled the genomes under various conditions. Subsequently, we evaluated these assemblies by the gene model quality and RNA-seq mapping rate. We found that long-read only assembly could not be suitable for the comparative genomics studies, but with short reads, we could obtain the acceptable assembly. On the basis of this result, we established the pipeline of de novo assembly for middle-sized algal genome using MinION.Conclusions:The genomic change during the early stages of plastid acquisition can now be revealed by sequencing and comparing many algal genomes. Moreover, this pipeline offers a solution for the assembly of various middle-sized eukaryotic genomes with high-quality and ease.",30249180,PMC6154909,10.1186/s12864-018-5067-1,6
Full-length 16S rRNA gene sequencing by PacBio improves taxonomic resolution in human microbiome samples,"Background:Sequencing variable regions of the 16S rRNA gene (≃300 bp) with Illumina technology is commonly used to study the composition of human microbiota. Unfortunately, short reads are unable to differentiate between highly similar species. Considering that species from the same genus can be associated with health or disease it is important to identify them at the lowest possible taxonomic rank. Third-generation sequencing platforms such as PacBio SMRT, increase read lengths allowing to sequence the whole gene with the maximum taxonomic resolution. Despite its potential, full length 16S rRNA gene sequencing is not widely used yet. The aim of the current study was to compare the sequencing output and taxonomic annotation performance of the two approaches (Illumina short read sequencing and PacBio long read sequencing of 16S rRNA gene) in different human microbiome samples. DNA from saliva, oral biofilms (subgingival plaque) and faeces of 9 volunteers was isolated. Regions V3-V4 and V1-V9 were amplified and sequenced by Illumina Miseq and by PacBio Sequel II sequencers, respectively.Results:With both platforms, a similar percentage of reads was assigned to the genus level (94.79% and 95.06% respectively) but with PacBio a higher proportion of reads were further assigned to the species level (55.23% vs 74.14%). Regarding overall bacterial composition, samples clustered by niche and not by sequencing platform. In addition, all genera with > 0.1% abundance were detected in both platforms for all types of samples. Although some genera such as Streptococcus tended to be observed at higher frequency in PacBio than in Illumina (20.14% vs 14.12% in saliva, 10.63% vs 6.59% in subgingival plaque biofilm samples) none of the differences were statistically significant when correcting for multiple testing.Conclusions:The results presented in the current manuscript suggest that samples sequenced using Illumina and PacBio are mostly comparable. Considering that PacBio reads were assigned at the species level with higher accuracy than Illumina, our data support the use of PacBio technology for future microbiome studies, although a higher cost is currently required to obtain an equivalent number of reads per sample.",38528457,PMC10964587,10.1186/s12864-024-10213-5,1
Species-level resolution of 16S rRNA gene amplicons sequenced through the MinION™ portable nanopore sequencer,"Background:The miniaturised and portable DNA sequencer MinION™ has been released to the scientific community within the framework of an early access programme to evaluate its application for a wide variety of genetic approaches. This technology has demonstrated great potential, especially in genome-wide analyses. In this study, we tested the ability of the MinION™ system to perform amplicon sequencing in order to design new approaches to study microbial diversity using nearly full-length 16S rDNA sequences.Results:Using R7.3 chemistry, we generated more than 3.8 million events (nt) during a single sequencing run. These data were sufficient to reconstruct more than 90 % of the 16S rRNA gene sequences for 20 different species present in a mock reference community. After read mapping and 16S rRNA gene assembly, consensus sequences and 2d reads were recovered to assign taxonomic classification down to the species level. Additionally, we were able to measure the relative abundance of all the species present in a mock community and detected a biased species distribution originating from the PCR reaction using 'universal' primers.Conclusions:Although nanopore-based sequencing produces reads with lower per-base accuracy compared with other platforms, the MinION™ DNA sequencer is valuable for both high taxonomic resolution and microbial diversity analysis. Improvements in nanopore chemistry, such as minimising base-calling errors and the nucleotide bias reported here for 16S amplicon sequencing, will further deliver more reliable information that is useful for the specific detection of microbial species and strains in complex ecosystems.",26823973,PMC4730766,10.1186/s13742-016-0111-z,88
Chromosome-scale genome assembly of Japanese pear (Pyrus pyrifolia) variety 'Nijisseiki',"We analyzed the genome sequence of a Japanese pear (Pyrus pyrifolia) to facilitate its genetics and genomics as well as breeding programs, in which a variety 'Nijisseiki' with superior flesh texture has been used as a parent for most Japanese pear cultivars. De novo assembly of long sequence reads covered 136× of the Japanese pear genome and generated 503.9 Mb contigs consisting of 114 sequences with an N50 value of 7.6 Mb. Contigs were assigned to Japanese pear genetic maps to establish 17 chromosome-scale sequences. In total, 44,876 high-confidence protein-encoding genes were predicted, 84.3% of which were supported by predicted genes and transcriptome data from Japanese pear relatives. As expected, evidence of genome-wide duplication was observed, consistent with related species. This is the first chromosome-scale genome sequence analysis reported for Japanese pear, and this resource will support breeding programs and provide new insights into the physiology and evolutionary history of Japanese pear.",33638981,PMC8092371,10.1093/dnares/dsab001,14
Development of an Artificially Intelligent Nanopore for High-Throughput DNA Sequencing with a Machine-Learning-Aided Quantum-Tunneling Approach,"Solid-state nanopore-based single-molecule DNA sequencing with quantum tunneling technology poses formidable challenges to achieve long-read sequencing and high-throughput analysis. Here, we propose a method for developing an artificially intelligent (AI) nanopore that does not require extraction of the signature transmission function for each nucleotide of the whole DNA strand by integrating supervised machine learning (ML) and transverse quantum transport technology with a graphene nanopore. The optimized ML model can predict the transmission function of all other nucleotides after training with data sets of all the orientations of any nucleotide inside the nanopore with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of as low as 0.062. Further, up to 96.01% accuracy is achieved in classifying the unlabeled nucleotides with their transmission readouts. We envision that an AI nanopore can alleviate the experimental challenges of the quantum-tunneling method and pave the way for rapid and high-precision DNA sequencing by predicting their signature transmission functions.",36799480,,10.1021/acs.nanolett.2c04062,0
Structural and functional analysis of the finished genome of the recently isolated toxic Anabaena sp. WA102,"Background:Very few closed genomes of the cyanobacteria that commonly produce toxic blooms in lakes and reservoirs are available, limiting our understanding of the properties of these organisms. A new anatoxin-a-producing member of the Nostocaceae, Anabaena sp. WA102, was isolated from a freshwater lake in Washington State, USA, in 2013 and maintained in non-axenic culture.Results:The Anabaena sp. WA102 5.7 Mbp genome assembly has been closed with long-read, single-molecule sequencing and separately a draft genome assembly has been produced with short-read sequencing technology. The closed and draft genome assemblies are compared, showing a correlation between long repeats in the genome and the many gaps in the short-read assembly. Anabaena sp. WA102 encodes anatoxin-a biosynthetic genes, as does its close relative Anabaena sp. AL93 (also introduced in this study). These strains are distinguished by differences in the genes for light-harvesting phycobilins, with Anabaena sp. AL93 possessing a phycoerythrocyanin operon. Biologically relevant structural variants in the Anabaena sp. WA102 genome were detected only by long-read sequencing: a tandem triplication of the anaBCD promoter region in the anatoxin-a synthase gene cluster (not triplicated in Anabaena sp. AL93) and a 5-kbp deletion variant present in two-thirds of the population. The genome has a large number of mobile elements (160). Strikingly, there was no synteny with the genome of its nearest fully assembled relative, Anabaena sp. 90.Conclusion:Structural and functional genome analyses indicate that Anabaena sp. WA102 has a flexible genome. Genome closure, which can be readily achieved with long-read sequencing, reveals large scale (e.g., gene order) and local structural features that should be considered in understanding genome evolution and function.",27296936,PMC4907049,10.1186/s12864-016-2738-7,11
Remarkably High Repeat Content in the Genomes of Sparrows: The Importance of Genome Assembly Completeness for Transposable Element Discovery,"Transposable elements (TE) play critical roles in shaping genome evolution. Highly repetitive TE sequences are also a major source of assembly gaps making it difficult to fully understand the impact of these elements on host genomes. The increased capacity of long-read sequencing technologies to span highly repetitive regions promises to provide new insights into patterns of TE activity across diverse taxa. Here we report the generation of highly contiguous reference genomes using PacBio long-read and Omni-C technologies for three species of Passerellidae sparrow. We compared these assemblies to three chromosome-level sparrow assemblies and nine other sparrow assemblies generated using a variety of short- and long-read technologies. All long-read based assemblies were longer (range: 1.12 to 1.41 Gb) than short-read assemblies (0.91 to 1.08 Gb) and assembly length was strongly correlated with the amount of repeat content. Repeat content for Bell's sparrow (31.2% of genome) was the highest level ever reported within the order Passeriformes, which comprises over half of avian diversity. The highest levels of repeat content (79.2% to 93.7%) were found on the W chromosome relative to other regions of the genome. Finally, we show that proliferation of different TE classes varied even among species with similar levels of repeat content. These patterns support a dynamic model of TE expansion and contraction even in a clade where TEs were once thought to be fairly depauperate and static. Our work highlights how the resolution of difficult-to-assemble regions of the genome with new sequencing technologies promises to transform our understanding of avian genome evolution.",38566597,PMC11088854,10.1093/gbe/evae067,0
"Organelle_PBA, a pipeline for assembling chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes from PacBio DNA sequencing data","Background:The development of long-read sequencing technologies, such as single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing by PacBio, has produced a revolution in the sequencing of small genomes. Sequencing organelle genomes using PacBio long-read data is a cost effective, straightforward approach. Nevertheless, the availability of simple-to-use software to perform the assembly from raw reads is limited at present.Results:We present Organelle-PBA, a Perl program designed specifically for the assembly of chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes. For chloroplast genomes, the program selects the chloroplast reads from a whole genome sequencing pool, maps the reads to a reference sequence from a closely related species, and then performs read correction and de novo assembly using Sprai. Organelle-PBA completes the assembly process with the additional step of scaffolding by SSPACE-LongRead. The program then detects the chloroplast inverted repeats and reassembles and re-orients the assembly based on the organelle origin of the reference. We have evaluated the performance of the software using PacBio reads from different species, read coverage, and reference genomes. Finally, we present the assembly of two novel chloroplast genomes from the species Picea glauca (Pinaceae) and Sinningia speciosa (Gesneriaceae).Conclusion:Organelle-PBA is an easy-to-use Perl-based software pipeline that was written specifically to assemble mitochondrial and chloroplast genomes from whole genome PacBio reads. The program is available at https://github.com/aubombarely/Organelle_PBA .",28061749,PMC5219736,10.1186/s12864-016-3412-9,38
Extreme enrichment of VNTR-associated polymorphicity in human subtelomeres: genes with most VNTRs are predominantly expressed in the brain,"The human genome harbors numerous structural variants (SVs) which, due to their repetitive nature, are currently underexplored in short-read whole-genome sequencing approaches. Using single-molecule, real-time (SMRT) long-read sequencing technology in combination with FALCON-Unzip, we generated a de novo assembly of the diploid genome of a 115-year-old Dutch cognitively healthy woman. We combined this assembly with two previously published haploid assemblies (CHM1 and CHM13) and the GRCh38 reference genome to create a compendium of SVs that occur across five independent human haplotypes using the graph-based multi-genome aligner REVEAL. Across these five haplotypes, we detected 31,680 euchromatic SVs (>50 bp). Of these, ~62% were comprised of repetitive sequences with 'variable number tandem repeats' (VNTRs), ~10% were mobile elements (Alu, L1, and SVA), while the remaining variants were inversions and indels. We observed that VNTRs with GC-content >60% and repeat patterns longer than 15 bp were 21-fold enriched in the subtelomeric regions (within 5 Mb of the ends of chromosome arms). VNTR lengths can expand to exceed a critical length which is associated with impaired gene transcription. The genes that contained most VNTRs, of which PTPRN2 and DLGAP2 are the most prominent examples, were found to be predominantly expressed in the brain and associated with a wide variety of neurological disorders. Repeat-induced variation represents a sizeable fraction of the genetic variation in human genomes and should be included in investigations of genetic factors associated with phenotypic traits, specifically those associated with neurological disorders. We make available the long and short-read sequence data of the supercentenarian genome, and a compendium of SVs as identified across 5 human haplotypes.",33139705,PMC7608644,10.1038/s41398-020-01060-5,11
A preliminary study on the potential of Nanopore MinION and Illumina MiSeq 16S rRNA gene sequencing to characterize building-dust microbiomes,"There is a growing awareness of the importance of indoor microbiomes for human health. Given their complexity, these microbiomes can only be adequately surveyed using high throughput sequencing techniques. Oxford Nanopore's MinION is the newest third generation sequencing technology on the market. With its many advantages such as portability, user friendliness, simplicity, speed of sequencing and long read length, the technology is now an actual contender to established sequencing platforms. MinION's main disadvantage is a relatively low read accuracy compared to several other platforms, although this is constantly improving. The present study, which appears to be the first of its kind, provides the results of a preliminary analysis of the microbial communities in indoor environments based on 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, using both the Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) MinIOn and the Illumina MiSeq DNA sequencers. At the level of family and above, there was no significant difference between the microbial compositions as revealed by the two platforms. However, at the genus, and particularly at the species level, the ONT MinION reported greater taxonomic resolution than Illumina MiSeq.",32081924,PMC7035348,10.1038/s41598-020-59771-0,49
pYR4 From a Norwegian Isolate ofYersinia ruckeriIs a Putative Virulence Plasmid Encoding Both a Type IV Pilus and a Type IV Secretion System,"Enteric redmouth disease caused by the pathogenYersinia ruckeriis a significant problem for fish farming around the world. Despite its importance, only a few virulence factors ofY. ruckerihave been identified and studied in detail. Here, we report and analyze the complete DNA sequence of pYR4, a plasmid from a highly pathogenic NorwegianY. ruckeriisolate, sequenced using PacBio SMRT technology. Like the well-known pYV plasmid of human pathogenicYersiniae, pYR4 is a member of the IncFII family. Thirty-one percent of the pYR4 sequence is unique compared to otherY. ruckeriplasmids. The unique regions contain, among others genes, a large number of mobile genetic elements and two partitioning systems. The G+C content of pYR4 is higher than that of theY. ruckeriNVH_3758 genome, indicating its relatively recent horizontal acquisition. pYR4, as well as the related plasmid pYR3, comprises operons that encode for type IV pili and for a conjugation system (tra). In contrast to otherYersiniaplasmids, pYR4 cannot be cured at elevated temperatures. Our study highlights the power of PacBio sequencing technology for identifying mis-assembled segments of genomic sequences. Comparative analysis of pYR4 and otherY. ruckeriplasmids and genomes, which were sequenced by second and the third generation sequencing technologies, showed errors in second generation sequencing assemblies. Specifically, in theY. ruckeri150 andY. ruckeriATCC29473 genome assemblies, we mapped the entire pYR3 plasmid sequence. Placing plasmid sequences on the chromosome can result in erroneous biological conclusions. Thus, PacBio sequencing or similar long-read methods should always be preferred forde novogenome sequencing. As thetraoperons of pYR3, although misplaced on the chromosome during the genome assembly process, were demonstrated to have an effect on virulence, and type IV pili are virulence factors in many bacteria, we suggest that pYR4 directly contributes toY. ruckerivirulence.",30460204,PMC6232867,10.3389/fcimb.2018.00373,6
"OPERA-LG: efficient and exact scaffolding of large, repeat-rich eukaryotic genomes with performance guarantees","The assembly of large, repeat-rich eukaryotic genomes represents a significant challenge in genomics.

Shedding light on dark genes: enhanced targeted resequencing by optimizing the combination of enrichment technology and DNA fragment length,"The exome contains many obscure regions difficult to explore with current short-read sequencing methods. Repetitious genomic regions prevent the unique alignment of reads, which is essential for the identification of clinically-relevant genetic variants. Long-read technologies attempt to resolve multiple-mapping regions, but they still produce many sequencing errors. Thus, a new approach is required to enlighten the obscure regions of the genome and rescue variants that would be otherwise neglected. This work aims to improve the alignment of multiple-mapping reads through the extension of the standard DNA fragment size. As Illumina can sequence fragments up to 550 bp, we tested different DNA fragment lengths using four major commercial WES platforms and found that longer DNA fragments achieved a higher genotypability. This metric, which indicates base calling calculated by combining depth of coverage with the confidence of read alignment, increased from hundreds to thousands of genes, including several associated with clinical phenotypes. While depth of coverage has been considered crucial for the assessment of WES performance, we demonstrated that genotypability has a greater impact in revealing obscure regions, with ~1% increase in variant calling in respect to shorter DNA fragments. Results confirmed that this approach enlightened many regions previously not explored.",32523024,PMC7287100,10.1038/s41598-020-66331-z,5
Capture of complete ciliate chromosomes in single sequencing reads reveals widespread chromosome isoforms,"Background:Whole-genome shotgun sequencing, which stitches together millions of short sequencing reads into a single genome, ushered in the era of modern genomics and led to a rapid expansion of the number of genome sequences available. Nevertheless, assembly of short reads remains difficult, resulting in fragmented genome sequences. Ultimately, only a sequencing technology capable of capturing complete chromosomes in a single run could resolve all ambiguities. Even ""third generation"" sequencing technologies produce reads far shorter than most eukaryotic chromosomes. However, the ciliate Oxytricha trifallax has a somatic genome with thousands of chromosomes averaging only 3.2 kbp, making it an ideal candidate for exploring the benefits of sequencing whole chromosomes without assembly.Results:We used single-molecule real-time sequencing to capture thousands of complete chromosomes in single reads and to update the published Oxytricha trifallax JRB310 genome assembly. In this version, over 50% of the completed chromosomes with two telomeres derive from single reads. The improved assembly includes over 12,000 new chromosome isoforms, and demonstrates that somatic chromosomes derive from variable rearrangements between somatic segments encoded up to 191,000 base pairs away. However, while long reads reduce the need for assembly, a hybrid approach that supplements long-read sequencing with short reads for error correction produced the most complete and accurate assembly, overall.Conclusions:This assembly provides the first example of complete eukaryotic chromosomes captured by single sequencing reads and demonstrates that traditional approaches to genome assembly can mask considerable structural variation.",31888453,PMC6937825,10.1186/s12864-019-6189-9,9
The complete and fully assembled genome sequence of Aeromonas salmonicida subsp. pectinolytica and its comparative analysis with other Aeromonas species: investigation of the mobilome in environmental and pathogenic strains,"Background:Due to the predominant usage of short-read sequencing to date, most bacterial genome sequences reported in the last years remain at the draft level. This precludes certain types of analyses, such as the in-depth analysis of genome plasticity.Results:Here we report the finalized genome sequence of the environmental strain Aeromonas salmonicida subsp. pectinolytica 34mel, for which only a draft genome with 253 contigs is currently available. Successful completion of the transposon-rich genome critically depended on the PacBio long read sequencing technology. Using finalized genome sequences of A. salmonicida subsp. pectinolytica and other Aeromonads, we report the detailed analysis of the transposon composition of these bacterial species. Mobilome evolution is exemplified by a complex transposon, which has shifted from pathogenicity-related to environmental-related gene content in A. salmonicida subsp. pectinolytica 34mel.Conclusion:Obtaining the complete, circular genome of A. salmonicida subsp. pectinolytica allowed us to perform an in-depth analysis of its mobilome. We demonstrate the mobilome-dependent evolution of this strain's genetic profile from pathogenic to environmental.",29304740,PMC5756416,10.1186/s12864-017-4301-6,14
Nanopore sequencing reveals a structural alteration of mirror-image duplicated genes in a genome-editing mouse line,"CRISPR-Cas9 technology has been used in various studies; however, it has also been found to introduce unexpected structural alternations. In this study, we used nanopore sequencing to characterize an unexpected structural alteration of mirror-image duplicated genes in a mouse line, in which we aimed to delete a part of the duplicated genes using genome editing. We removed low-molecular-weight DNA fragments and increased the input, which led to improved sequence performance. With 14.9 Gb input for whole-genome analysis, we detected a complex structural alteration involving inversion and deletion, which appears to be difficult to characterize with short-read sequencers. Therefore, our study clearly showed the utility of nanopore sequencing for characterizing unexpected complex structural alterations caused by genome editing.",31837184,,10.1111/cga.12364,4
Metagenomic data for Halichondria panicea from Illumina and nanopore sequencing and preliminary genome assemblies for the sponge and two microbial symbionts,"Objectives:These data were collected to generate a novel reference metagenome for the sponge Halichondria panicea and its microbiome for subsequent differential expression analyses.Data description:These data include raw sequences from four separate sequencing runs of the metagenome of a single individual of Halichondria panicea-one Illumina MiSeq (2 × 300 bp, paired-end) run and three Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) long-read sequencing runs, generating 53.8 and 7.42 Gbp respectively. Comparing assemblies of Illumina, ONT and an Illumina-ONT hybrid revealed the hybrid to be the 'best' assembly, comprising 163 Mbp in 63,555 scaffolds (N50: 3084). This assembly, however, was still highly fragmented and only contained 52% of core metazoan genes (with 77.9% partial genes), so it was also not complete. However, this sponge is an emerging model species for field and laboratory work, and there is considerable interest in genomic sequencing of this species. Although the resultant assemblies from the data presented here are suboptimal, this data note can inform future studies by providing an estimated genome size and coverage requirements for future sequencing, sharing additional data to potentially improve other suboptimal assemblies of this species, and outlining potential limitations and pitfalls of the combined Illumina and ONT approach to novel genome sequencing.",35397610,PMC8994243,10.1186/s13104-022-06013-3,3
Evaluation of PCR conditions for characterizing bacterial communities with full-length 16S rRNA genes using a portable nanopore sequencer,"MinION (Oxford Nanopore Technologies), a portable nanopore sequencer, was introduced in 2014 as a new DNA sequencing technology. MinION is now widely used because of its low initial start-up costs relative to existing DNA sequencers, good portability, easy-handling, real-time analysis and long-read output. However, differences in the experimental conditions used for 16S rRNA-based PCR can bias bacterial community assessments in samples. Therefore, basic knowledge about reliable experimental conditions is needed to ensure the appropriate use of this technology. Our study concerns the reliability of techniques for obtaining accurate and quantitative full-length 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing data for bacterial community structure assessment using MinION. We compared five PCR conditions using three independent mock microbial community standard DNAs and established appropriate, standardized, better PCR conditions among the trials. We then sequenced two mock communities and six environmental samples using Illumina MiSeq for comparison. Modifying the PCR conditions improved the sequencing quality; the optimized conditions were 35 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1 min and 68 °C for 3 min. Our results provide important information for researchers to determine bacterial community using MinION accurately.",32724214,PMC7387495,10.1038/s41598-020-69450-9,19
Colib'read on galaxy: a tools suite dedicated to biological information extraction from raw NGS reads,"Background:With next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, the life sciences face a deluge of raw data. Classical analysis processes for such data often begin with an assembly step, needing large amounts of computing resources, and potentially removing or modifying parts of the biological information contained in the data. Our approach proposes to focus directly on biological questions, by considering raw unassembled NGS data, through a suite of six command-line tools.Findings:Dedicated to 'whole-genome assembly-free' treatments, the Colib'read tools suite uses optimized algorithms for various analyses of NGS datasets, such as variant calling or read set comparisons. Based on the use of a de Bruijn graph and bloom filter, such analyses can be performed in a few hours, using small amounts of memory. Applications using real data demonstrate the good accuracy of these tools compared to classical approaches. To facilitate data analysis and tools dissemination, we developed Galaxy tools and tool shed repositories.Conclusions:With the Colib'read Galaxy tools suite, we enable a broad range of life scientists to analyze raw NGS data. More importantly, our approach allows the maximum biological information to be retained in the data, and uses a very low memory footprint.",26870323,PMC4750246,10.1186/s13742-015-0105-2,1
Nanopore sequencing of complex genomic rearrangements in yeast reveals mechanisms of repeat-mediated double-strand break repair,"Improper DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair results in complex genomic rearrangements (CGRs) in many cancers and various congenital disorders in humans. Trinucleotide repeat sequences, such as (GAA)nrepeats in Friedreich's ataxia, (CTG)nrepeats in myotonic dystrophy, and (CGG)nrepeats in fragile X syndrome, are also subject to double-strand breaks within the repetitive tract followed by DNA repair. Mapping the outcomes of CGRs is important for understanding their causes and potential phenotypic effects. However, high-resolution mapping of CGRs has traditionally been a laborious and highly skilled process. Recent advances in long-read DNA sequencing technologies, specifically Nanopore sequencing, have made possible the rapid identification of CGRs with single base pair resolution. Here, we have used whole-genome Nanopore sequencing to characterize several CGRs that originated from naturally occurring DSBs at (GAA)nmicrosatellites inSaccharomyces cerevisiaeThese data gave us important insights into the mechanisms of DSB repair leading to CGRs.",29113982,PMC5741057,10.1101/gr.228148.117,28
A chromosome-scale assembly of the sorghum genome using nanopore sequencing and optical mapping,"Long-read sequencing technologies have greatly facilitated assemblies of large eukaryotic genomes. In this paper, Oxford Nanopore sequences generated on a MinION sequencer are combined with Bionano Genomics Direct Label and Stain (DLS) optical maps to generate a chromosome-scale de novo assembly of the repeat-rich Sorghum bicolor Tx430 genome. The final assembly consists of 29 scaffolds, encompassing in most cases entire chromosome arms. It has a scaffold N50of 33.28 Mbps and covers 90% of the expected genome length. A sequence accuracy of 99.85% is obtained after aligning the assembly against Illumina Tx430 data and 99.6% of the 34,211 public gene models align to the assembly. Comparisons of Tx430 and BTx623 DLS maps against the public BTx623 v3.0.1 genome assembly suggest substantial discrepancies whose origin remains to be determined. In summary, this study demonstrates that informative assemblies of complex plant genomes can be generated by combining nanopore sequencing with DLS optical maps.",30451840,PMC6242865,10.1038/s41467-018-07271-1,77
Deep mining of antibody phage-display selections using Oxford Nanopore Technologies and Dual Unique Molecular Identifiers,"Antibody phage-display technology identifies antibody-antigen interactions through multiple panning rounds, but traditional screening gives no information on enrichment or diversity throughout the process. This results in the loss of valuable binders. Next Generation Sequencing can overcome this problem. We introduce a high accuracy long-read sequencing method based on the recent Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) Q20 + chemistry in combination with dual unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) and an optimized bioinformatic analysis pipeline to monitor the selections. We identified binders from two single-domain antibody libraries selected against a model protein. Traditional colony-picking was compared with our ONT-UMI method. ONT-UMI enabled monitoring of diversity and enrichment before and after each selection round. By combining phage antibody selections with ONT-UMIs, deep mining of output selections is possible. The approach provides an alternative to traditional screening, enabling diversity quantification after each selection round and rare binder recovery, even when the dominating binder was > 99% abundant. Moreover, it can give insights on binding motifs for further affinity maturation and specificity optimizations. Our results demonstrate a platform for future data guided selection strategies.",38354946,,10.1016/j.nbt.2024.02.001,0
"Chromosome-level assembly of the mangrove plant Aegiceras corniculatum genome generated through Illumina, PacBio and Hi-C sequencing technologies","Aegiceras corniculatum is a major mangrove plant species adapted to waterlogging and saline conditions, grows in the coastal intertidal zone of tropical and subtropical regions. Here, we present a chromosome-level genome assembly of A. corniculatum by incorporating PacBio long-read sequencing and Hi-C technology. The results showed that the PacBio draft genome size is 906.63 Mb. Hi-C scaffolding anchored 885.06 Mb contigs (97.62% of draft assembly) onto 24 pseudochromosomes. The contig N50 and scaffold N50 were 7.1 Mb and 37.74 Mb, respectively. Out of 40,727 protein-coding genes predicted in the study, 89% have functional annotations in public databases. We also showed that of the 603.93 Mb repetitive sequences predicted in the assembled genome, long terminal repeat retrotransposons constitute 41.52%. The genome evolution analysis showed that the A. corniculatum genome experienced two whole-genome duplication events and shared the ancient γ whole-genome triplication event. A comparative genomic analysis revealed an incidence of expansion in 1,488 gene families associated with essential metabolism and biosynthetic pathways, including photosynthesis, oxidative phosphorylation, phenylalanine, glyoxylate, dicarboxylate metabolism, and DNA replication, which probably constitute adaptation traits that allow the A. corniculatum to survive in the intertidal zone. Also, the systematic characterization of genes associated with flavonoid biosynthesis pathway and the AcNHX gene family conducted in this study will provide insight into the adaptation mechanism of A. corniculatum to intertidal environments. The high-quality genome reported here can provide historical insights into genomic transformations that support the survival of A. corniculatum under harsh intertidal habitats.",33550674,,10.1111/1755-0998.13347,10
Evaluation of Automated Magnetic Bead-Based DNA Extraction for Detection of Short Tandem Repeat Expansions With Nanopore Sequencing,"Background:Long-read technologies such as nanopore sequencing provide new opportunities to detect short tandem repeat expansions. Therefore, a DNA extraction method is necessary that minimizes DNA fragmentation and hence allows the identification of large repeat expansions. In this study, an automated magnetic bead-based DNA extraction method and the required EDTA blood storage conditions as well as DNA and sequencing quality were evaluated for their suitability for repeat expansion detection with nanopore sequencing.Methods:DNA was extracted from EDTA blood, and subsequently, its concentration, purity, and integrity were assessed. DNA was then subjected to nanopore sequencing, and quality metrics of the obtained sequencing data were evaluated.Results:DNA extracted from fresh EDTA blood as well as from cooled or frozen EDTA blood revealed high DNA integrity whereas storage at room temperature over 7 days had detrimental effects. After nanopore sequencing, the read length N50 values of approximately 9 kb were obtained, and based on adaptive sampling of samples with a known repeat expansion, repeat expansions up to 10 kb could be detected.Conclusion:The automated magnetic bead-based DNA extraction was sufficient to detect short tandem repeat expansions, omitting the need for high-molecular-weight DNA extraction methods. Therefore, DNA should be extracted either from fresh blood or from blood stored in cooled or frozen conditions. Consequently, this study may help other laboratories to evaluate their DNA extraction method regarding the suitability for detecting repeat expansions with nanopore sequencing.",38506401,PMC10997813,10.1002/jcla.25029,0
"Full-length transcript sequencing accelerates the transcriptome research of Gymnocypris namensis, an iconic fish of the Tibetan Plateau","Gymnocypris namensis, the only commercial fish in Namtso Lake of Tibet in China, is rated as nearly threatened species in the Red List of China's Vertebrates. As one of the highest-altitude schizothorax fish in China, G. namensis has strong adaptability to the plateau harsh environment. Although being an indigenous economic fish with high value in research, the biological characterization, genetic diversity, and plateau adaptability of G. namensis are still unclear. Here, we used Pacific Biosciences single molecular real time long read sequencing technology to generate full-length transcripts of G. namensis. Sequences clustering analysis and error correction with Illumina-produced short reads to obtain 319,044 polished isoforms. After removing redundant reads, 125,396 non-redundant isoforms were obtained. Among all transcripts, 103,286 were annotated to public databases. Natural selection has acted on 42 genes for G. namensis, which were enriched on the functions of mismatch repair and Glutathione metabolism. Total 89,736 open reading frames, 95,947 microsatellites, and 21,360 long non-coding RNAs were identified across all transcripts. This is the first study of transcriptome in G. namensis by using PacBio Iso-seq. The acquisition of full-length transcript isoforms might accelerate the transcriptome research of G. namensis and provide basis for further research.",32541658,PMC7296019,10.1038/s41598-020-66582-w,8
Bacterial and viral identification and differentiation by amplicon sequencing on the MinION nanopore sequencer,"Background:The MinION™ nanopore sequencer was recently released to a community of alpha-testers for evaluation using a variety of sequencing applications. Recent reports have tested the ability of the MinION™ to act as a whole genome sequencer and have demonstrated that nanopore sequencing has tremendous potential utility. However, the current nanopore technology still has limitations with respect to error-rate, and this is problematic when attempting to assemble whole genomes without secondary rounds of sequencing to correct errors. In this study, we tested the ability of the MinION™ nanopore sequencer to accurately identify and differentiate bacterial and viral samples via directed sequencing of characteristic genes shared broadly across a target clade.Results:Using a 6 hour sequencing run time, sufficient data were generated to identify an E. coli sample down to the species level from 16S rDNA amplicons. Three poxviruses (cowpox, vaccinia-MVA, and vaccinia-Lister) were identified and differentiated down to the strain level, despite over 98% identity between the vaccinia strains. The ability to differentiate strains by amplicon sequencing on the MinION™ was accomplished despite an observed per-base error rate of approximately 30%.Conclusions:While nanopore sequencing, using the MinION™ platform from Oxford Nanopore in particular, continues to mature into a commercially available technology, practical uses are sought for the current versions of the technology. This study offers evidence of the utility of amplicon sequencing by demonstrating that the current versions of MinION™ technology can accurately identify and differentiate both viral and bacterial species present within biological samples via amplicon sequencing.",25815165,PMC4374364,10.1186/s13742-015-0051-z,68
Comparative genomics among cyst nematodes reveals distinct evolutionary histories among effector families and an irregular distribution of effector-associated promoter motifs,"Potato cyst nematodes (PCNs), an umbrella term used for two species, Globodera pallida and G. rostochiensis, belong worldwide to the most harmful pathogens of potato. Pathotype-specific host plant resistances are essential for PCN control. However, the poor delineation of G. pallida pathotypes has hampered the efficient use of available host plant resistances. Long-read sequencing technology allowed us to generate a new reference genome of G. pallida population D383 and, as compared to the current reference, the new genome assembly is 42 times less fragmented. For comparison of diversification patterns of six effector families between G. pallida and G. rostochiensis, an additional reference genome was generated for an outgroup, the beet cyst nematode Heterodera schachtii (IRS population). Large evolutionary contrasts in effector family topologies were observed. While VAPs (venom allergen-like proteins) diversified before the split between the three cyst nematode species, the families GLAND5 and GLAND13 only expanded in PCNs after their separation from the genus Heterodera. Although DNA motifs in the promoter regions thought to be involved in the orchestration of effector expression (""DOG boxes"") were present in all three cyst nematode species, their presence is not a necessity for dorsal gland-produced effectors. Notably, DOG box dosage was only loosely correlated with the expression level of individual effector variants. Comparison of the G. pallida genome with those of two other cyst nematodes underlined the fundamental differences in evolutionary history between effector families. Resequencing of PCN populations with different virulence characteristics will allow for the linking of these characteristics to the composition of the effector repertoire as well as for the mapping of PCN diversification patterns resulting from extreme anthropogenic range expansion.",35560992,PMC10946958,10.1111/mec.16505,4
Quantification of Poly(A) Tail Length and Terminal Modifications Using Direct RNA Sequencing,"Poly(A) tail metabolism is critical for various biological processes, including early embryogenesis and cell differentiation. While traditional biochemical methods to measure poly(A) tail length allow for the study of selected transcripts, the advent of long-read sequencing technologies enabled the development of simple and robust protocols to measure poly(A) tail length at the transcriptome level. Here, we describe a direct RNA sequencing protocol to capture poly(A) tail terminal additions based on the splint ligation of barcoded oligos compatible with terminal guanylation and uridylation. We cover how to prepare the libraries and perform the bioinformatics analysis to simultaneously determine the length of the transcripts' poly(A) tails and detect the presence of terminal guanylation and uridylation.",37824075,,10.1007/978-1-0716-3481-3_15,0
"De novo sequencing, diploid assembly, and annotation of the black carpenter ant, Camponotus pennsylvanicus, and its symbionts by one person for $1000, using nanopore sequencing","The black carpenter ant (Camponotus pennsylvanicus) is a pest species found widely throughout North America. From a single individual I used long-read nanopore sequencing to assemble a phased diploid genome of 306 Mb and 60X coverage, with quality assessed by a 97.0% BUSCO score, improving upon other ant assemblies. The mitochondrial genome reveals minor rearrangements from other ants. The reads also allowed assembly of parasitic and symbiont genomes. I include a complete Wolbachia bacterial assembly with a size of 1.2 Mb, as well as a commensal symbiont Blochmannia pennsylvanicus, at 791 kb. DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation were measured at base-pair resolution level from the same reads and confirmed extremely low levels seen in the Formicidae family. There was moderate heterozygosity, with 0.16% of bases being biallelic from the parental haplotypes. Protein prediction yielded 14 415 amino acid sequences with 95.8% BUSCO score and 86% matching to previously known proteins. All assemblies were derived from a single MinION flow cell generating 20 Gb of sequence for a cost of $1047 including consumable reagents. Adding fixed costs for equipment brings the total for an ant-sized genome to less than $5000. All analyses were performed in 1 week on a single desktop computer.",35724982,PMC9841434,10.1093/nar/gkac510,13
SMRT long reads and Direct Label and Stain optical maps allow the generation of a high-quality genome assembly for the European barn swallow (Hirundo rustica rustica),"Background:The barn swallow (Hirundo rustica) is a migratory bird that has been the focus of a large number of ecological, behavioral, and genetic studies. To facilitate further population genetics and genomic studies, we present a reference genome assembly for the European subspecies (H. r. rustica).Findings:As part of the Genome10K effort on generating high-quality vertebrate genomes (Vertebrate Genomes Project), we have assembled a highly contiguous genome assembly using single molecule real-time (SMRT) DNA sequencing and several Bionano optical map technologies. We compared and integrated optical maps derived from both the Nick, Label, Repair, and Stain technology and from the Direct Label and Stain (DLS) technology. As proposed by Bionano, DLS more than doubled the scaffold N50 with respect to the nickase. The dual enzyme hybrid scaffold led to a further marginal increase in scaffold N50 and an overall increase of confidence in the scaffolds. After removal of haplotigs, the final assembly is approximately 1.21 Gbp in size, with a scaffold N50 value of more than 25.95 Mbp.Conclusions:This high-quality genome assembly represents a valuable resource for future studies of population genetics and genomics in the barn swallow and for studies concerning the evolution of avian genomes. It also represents one of the very first genomes assembled by combining SMRT long-read sequencing with the new Bionano DLS technology for scaffolding. The quality of this assembly demonstrates the potential of this methodology to substantially increase the contiguity of genome assemblies.",30496513,PMC6324554,10.1093/gigascience/giy142,12
Complete genome sequences of Streptococcus pyogenes type strain reveal 100%-match between PacBio-solo and Illumina-Oxford Nanopore hybrid assemblies,"We present the first complete, closed genome sequences of Streptococcus pyogenes strains NCTC 8198Tand CCUG 4207T, the type strain of the type species of the genus Streptococcus and an important human pathogen that causes a wide range of infectious diseases. S. pyogenes NCTC 8198Tand CCUG 4207Tare derived from deposit of the same strain at two different culture collections. NCTC 8198Twas sequenced, using a PacBio platform; the genome sequence was assembled de novo, using HGAP. CCUG 4207Twas sequenced and a de novo hybrid assembly was generated, using SPAdes, combining Illumina and Oxford Nanopore sequence reads. Both strategies yielded closed genome sequences of 1,914,862 bp, identical in length and sequence identity. Combining short-read Illumina and long-read Oxford Nanopore sequence data circumvented the expected error rate of the nanopore sequencing technology, producing a genome sequence indistinguishable to the one determined with PacBio. Sequence analyses revealed five prophage regions, a CRISPR-Cas system, numerous virulence factors and no relevant antibiotic resistance genes. These two complete genome sequences of the type strain of S. pyogenes will effectively serve as valuable taxonomic and genomic references for infectious disease diagnostics, as well as references for future studies and applications within the genus Streptococcus.",32669560,PMC7363880,10.1038/s41598-020-68249-y,3
"Long Single-Molecule Reads Can Resolve the Complexity of the Influenza Virus Composed of Rare, Closely Related Mutant Variants","As a result of a high rate of mutations and recombination events, an RNA-virus exists as a heterogeneous ""swarm"" of mutant variants. The long read length offered by single-molecule sequencing technologies allows each mutant variant to be sequenced in a single pass. However, high error rate limits the ability to reconstruct heterogeneous viral population composed of rare, related mutant variants. In this article, we present two single-nucleotide variants (2SNV), a method able to tolerate the high error rate of the single-molecule protocol and reconstruct mutant variants. 2SNV uses linkage between single-nucleotide variations to efficiently distinguish them from read errors. To benchmark the sensitivity of 2SNV, we performed a single-molecule sequencing experiment on a sample containing a titrated level of known viral mutant variants. Our method is able to accurately reconstruct clone with frequency of 0.2% and distinguish clones that differed in only two nucleotides distantly located on the genome. 2SNV outperforms existing methods for full-length viral mutant reconstruction.",27901586,PMC5467126,10.1089/cmb.2016.0146,9
"Genome sequence of the barred knifejaw Oplegnathus fasciatus (Temminck & Schlegel, 1844): the first chromosome-level draft genome in the family Oplegnathidae","Background:The barred knifejaw (Oplegnathus fasciatus), a member of the Oplegnathidae family of the Centrarchiformes, is a commercially important rocky reef fish native to East Asia. Oplegnathus fasciatus has become an important fishery resource for offshore cage aquaculture and fish stocking of marine ranching in China, Japan, and Korea. Recently, sexual dimorphism in growth with neo-sex chromosome and widespread biotic diseases in O. fasciatus have been increasing concern in the industry. However, adequate genome resources for gaining insight into sex-determining mechanisms and establishing genetically resistant breeding systems for O. fasciatus are lacking. Here, we analyzed the entire genome of a female O. fasciatus fish using long-read sequencing and Hi-C data to generate chromosome-length scaffolds and a highly contiguous genome assembly.Findings:We assembled the O. fasciatus genome with a total of 245.0 Gb of raw reads that were generated using both Pacific Bioscience (PacBio) Sequel and Illumina HiSeq 2000 platforms. The final draft genome assembly was approximately 778.7 Mb, which reached a high level of continuity with a contig N50 of 2.1 Mb. The genome size was consistent with the estimated genome size (777.5 Mb) based on k-mer analysis. We combined Hi-C data with a draft genome assembly to generate chromosome-length scaffolds. Twenty-four scaffolds corresponding to the 24 chromosomes were assembled to a final size of 768.8 Mb with a contig N50 of 2.1 Mb and a scaffold N50 of 33.5 Mb using 1,372 contigs. The identified repeat sequences accounted for 33.9% of the entire genome, and 24 003 protein-coding genes with an average of 10.1 exons per gene were annotated using de novo methods, with RNA sequencing data and homologies to other teleosts. According to phylogenetic analysis using protein-coding genes, O. fasciatus is closely related to Larimichthys crocea, with O. fasciatus diverging from their common ancestor approximately 70.5-88.5 million years ago.Conclusions:We generated a high-quality draft genome for O. fasciatus using long-read PacBio sequencing technology, which represents the first chromosome-level reference genome for Oplegnathidae species. Assembly of this genome assists research into fish sex-determining mechanisms and can serve as a resource for accelerating genome-assisted improvements in resistant breeding systems.",30715332,PMC6423371,10.1093/gigascience/giz013,17
Towards a better understanding of the low recall of insertion variants with short-read based variant callers,"Background:Since 2009, numerous tools have been developed to detect structural variants using short read technologies. Insertions >50 bp are one of the hardest type to discover and are drastically underrepresented in gold standard variant callsets. The advent of long read technologies has completely changed the situation. In 2019, two independent cross technologies studies have published the most complete variant callsets with sequence resolved insertions in human individuals. Among the reported insertions, only 17 to 28% could be discovered with short-read based tools.Results:In this work, we performed an in-depth analysis of these unprecedented insertion callsets in order to investigate the causes of such failures. We have first established a precise classification of insertion variants according to four layers of characterization: the nature and size of the inserted sequence, the genomic context of the insertion site and the breakpoint junction complexity. Because these levels are intertwined, we then used simulations to characterize the impact of each complexity factor on the recall of several structural variant callers. We showed that most reported insertions exhibited characteristics that may interfere with their discovery: 63% were tandem repeat expansions, 38% contained homology larger than 10 bp within their breakpoint junctions and 70% were located in simple repeats. Consequently, the recall of short-read based variant callers was significantly lower for such insertions (6% for tandem repeats vs 56% for mobile element insertions). Simulations showed that the most impacting factor was the insertion type rather than the genomic context, with various difficulties being handled differently among the tested structural variant callers, and they highlighted the lack of sequence resolution for most insertion calls.Conclusions:Our results explain the low recall by pointing out several difficulty factors among the observed insertion features and provide avenues for improving SV caller algorithms and their combinations.",33148192,PMC7640490,10.1186/s12864-020-07125-5,7
"Chromosome-scale de novo genome assembly and annotation of three representative Casuarina species: C. equisetifolia, C. glauca, and C. cunninghamiana","Australian pine (Casuarina spp.) is extensively planted in tropical and subtropical regions for wood production, shelterbelts, environmental protection, and ecological restoration due to their superior biological characteristics, such as rapid growth, wind and salt tolerance, and nitrogen fixation. To analyze the genomic diversity of Casuarina, we sequenced the genomes and constructed de novo genome assemblies of the three most widely planted Casuarina species: C. equisetifolia, C. glauca, and C. cunninghamiana. We generated chromosome-scale genome sequences using both Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) Sequel sequencing and chromosome conformation capture technology (Hi-C). The total genome sizes for C. equisetifolia, C. glauca, and C. cunninghamiana are 268 942 579 bp, 296 631 783 bp, and 293 483 606 bp, respectively, of which 25.91, 27.15, and 27.74% were annotated as repetitive sequences. We annotated 23 162, 24 673, and 24 674 protein-coding genes in C. equisetifolia, C. glauca, and C. cunninghamiana, respectively. We then collected branchlets from male and female individuals for whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (BS-seq) to explore the epigenetic regulation of sex determination in these three species. Transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) revealed differential expression of phytohormone-related genes between male and female plants. In summary, we generated three chromosome-level genome assemblies and comprehensive DNA methylation and transcriptome datasets from both male and female material for three Casuarina species, providing a basis for the comprehensive investigation of genomic diversity and functional gene discovery of Casuarina in the future.",36971060,,10.1111/tpj.16201,2
Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence: Nanopore sequencing and complete assembly of the European lobster (Homarus gammarus) mitogenome uncovers the missing nad2 and a new major gene cluster duplication,"Background:The recently published complete mitogenome of the European lobster (Homarus gammarus) that was generated using long-range PCR exhibits unusual gene composition (missing nad2) and gene rearrangements among decapod crustaceans with strong implications in crustacean phylogenetics. Such atypical mitochondrial features will benefit greatly from validation with emerging long read sequencing technologies such as Oxford Nanopore that can more accurately identify structural variation.Results:We re-sequenced the H. gammarus mitogenome on an Oxford Nanopore Minion flowcell and performed a long-read only assembly, generating a complete mitogenome assembly for H. gammarus. In contrast to previous reporting, we found an intact mitochondrial nad2 gene in the H. gammarus mitogenome and showed that its gene organization is broadly similar to that of the American lobster (H. americanus) except for the presence of a large tandemly duplicated region with evidence of pseudogenization in one of each duplicated protein-coding genes.Conclusions:Using the European lobster as an example, we demonstrate the value of Oxford Nanopore long read technology in resolving problematic mitogenome assemblies. The increasing accessibility of Oxford Nanopore technology will make it an attractive and useful tool for evolutionary biologists to verify new and existing unusual mitochondrial gene rearrangements recovered using first and second generation sequencing technologies, particularly those used to make phylogenetic inferences of evolutionary scenarios.",31053062,PMC6500004,10.1186/s12864-019-5704-3,11
Determining antimicrobial resistance profiles and identifying novel mutations of Neisseria gonorrhoeae genomes obtained by multiplexed MinION sequencing,"Gonorrhea is one of the most common sexually transmitted diseases worldwide. To cure infection and prevent transmission, timely and appropriate antimicrobial therapy is necessary. Unfortunately, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the etiological agent of gonorrhea, has acquired nearly all known mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), thereby compromising the efficacy of antimicrobial therapy. Treatment failure resulting from AMR has become a global public health concern. Whole-genome sequencing is an effective method to determine the AMR characteristics of N. gonorrhoeae. Compared with next-generation sequencing, the MinION sequencer (Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT)) has the advantages of long read length and portability. Based on a pilot study using MinION to sequence the genome of N. gonorrhoeae, we optimized the workflow of sequencing and data analysis in the current study. Here we sequenced nine isolates within one flow cell using a multiplexed sequencing strategy. After hybrid assembly with Illumina reads, nine integral circular chromosomes were obtained. By using the online tool Pathogenwatch and a BLAST-based workflow, we acquired complete AMR profiles related to seven classes of antibiotics. We also evaluated the performance of ONT-only assemblies. Most AMR determinants identified by ONT-only assemblies were the same as those identified by hybrid assemblies. Moreover, one of the nine assemblies indicated a potentially novel antimicrobial-related mutation located in mtrR which results in a frame-shift, premature stop codon, and truncated peptide. In addition, this is the first study using the MinION sequencer to obtain complete genome sequences of N. gonorrhoeae strains which are epidemic in China. This study shows that complete genome sequences and antimicrobial characteristics of N. gonorrhoeae can be obtained using the MinION sequencer in a simple and cost-effective manner, with hardly any knowledge of bioinformatics required. More importantly, this strategy provides us with a potential approach to discover new AMR determinants.",31784935,,10.1007/s11427-019-1558-8,8
"Genome sequence determination and metagenomic characterization of a Dehalococcoides mixed culture grown on cis-1,2-dichloroethene","A Dehalococcoides-containing bacterial consortium that performed dechlorination of 0.20 mM cis-1,2-dichloroethene to ethene in 14 days was obtained from the sediment mud of the lotus field. To obtain detailed information of the consortium, the metagenome was analyzed using the short-read next-generation sequencer SOLiD 3. Matching the obtained sequence tags with the reference genome sequences indicated that the Dehalococcoides sp. in the consortium was highly homologous to Dehalococcoides mccartyi CBDB1 and BAV1. Sequence comparison with the reference sequence constructed from 16S rRNA gene sequences in a public database showed the presence of Sedimentibacter, Sulfurospirillum, Clostridium, Desulfovibrio, Parabacteroides, Alistipes, Eubacterium, Peptostreptococcus and Proteocatella in addition to Dehalococcoides sp. After further enrichment, the members of the consortium were narrowed down to almost three species. Finally, the full-length circular genome sequence of the Dehalococcoides sp. in the consortium, D. mccartyi IBARAKI, was determined by analyzing the metagenome with the single-molecule DNA sequencer PacBio RS. The accuracy of the sequence was confirmed by matching it to the tag sequences obtained by SOLiD 3. The genome is 1,451,062 nt and the number of CDS is 1566, which includes 3 rRNA genes and 47 tRNA genes. There exist twenty-eight RDase genes that are accompanied by the genes for anchor proteins. The genome exhibits significant sequence identity with other Dehalococcoides spp. throughout the genome, but there exists significant difference in the distribution RDase genes. The combination of a short-read next-generation DNA sequencer and a long-read single-molecule DNA sequencer gives detailed information of a bacterial consortium.",25579666,,10.1016/j.jbiosc.2014.12.001,5
Generation of Comprehensive Ecosystem-Specific Reference Databases with Species-Level Resolution by High-Throughput Full-Length 16S rRNA Gene Sequencing and Automated Taxonomy Assignment (AutoTax),"High-throughput 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing is an essential method for studying the diversity and dynamics of microbial communities. However, this method is presently hampered by the lack of high-identity reference sequences for many environmental microbes in the public 16S rRNA gene reference databases and by the absence of a systematic and comprehensive taxonomy for the uncultured majority. Here, we demonstrate how high-throughput synthetic long-read sequencing can be applied to create ecosystem-specific full-length 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequence variant (FL-ASV) resolved reference databases that include high-identity references (>98.7% identity) for nearly all abundant bacteria (>0.01% relative abundance) using Danish wastewater treatment systems and anaerobic digesters as an example. In addition, we introduce a novel sequence identity-based approach for automated taxonomy assignment (AutoTax) that provides a complete seven-rank taxonomy for all reference sequences, using the SILVA taxonomy as a backbone, with stable placeholder names for unclassified taxa. The FL-ASVs are perfectly suited for the evaluation of taxonomic resolution and bias associated with primers commonly used for amplicon sequencing, allowing researchers to choose those that are ideal for their ecosystem. Reference databases processed with AutoTax greatly improves the classification of short-read 16S rRNA ASVs at the genus- and species-level, compared with the commonly used universal reference databases. Importantly, the placeholder names provide a way to explore the unclassified environmental taxa at different taxonomic ranks, which in combination within situanalyses can be used to uncover their ecological roles.",32963001,PMC7512547,10.1128/mBio.01557-20,43
PacBio SMRT assembly of a complex multi-replicon genome reveals chlorocatechol degradative operon in a region of genome plasticity,"We have sequenced a Burkholderia genome that contains multiple replicons and large repetitive elements that would make it inherently difficult to assemble by short read sequencing technologies. We illustrate how the integrated long read correction algorithms implemented through the PacBio Single Molecule Real-Time (SMRT) sequencing technology successfully provided a de novo assembly that is a reasonable estimate of both the gene content and genome organization without making any further modifications. This assembly is comparable to related organisms assembled by more labour intensive methods. Our assembled genome revealed regions of genome plasticity for further investigation, one of which harbours a chlorocatechol degradative operon highly homologous to those previously identified on globally ubiquitous plasmids. In an ideal world, this assembly would still require experimental validation to confirm gene order and copy number of repeated elements. However, we submit that particularly in instances where a polished genome is not the primary goal of the sequencing project, PacBio SMRT sequencing provides a financially viable option for generating a biologically relevant genome estimate that can be utilized by other researchers for comparative studies.",27063562,,10.1016/j.gene.2016.04.018,8
Phenotypic and genomic comparison of Photorhabdus luminescens subsp. laumondii TT01 and a widely used rifampicin-resistant Photorhabdus luminescens laboratory strain,"Background:Photorhabdus luminescens is an enteric bacterium, which lives in mutualistic association with soil nematodes and is highly pathogenic for a broad spectrum of insects. A complete genome sequence for the type strain P. luminescens subsp. laumondii TT01, which was originally isolated in Trinidad and Tobago, has been described earlier. Subsequently, a rifampicin resistant P. luminescens strain has been generated with superior possibilities for experimental characterization. This strain, which is widely used in research, was described as a spontaneous rifampicin resistant mutant of TT01 and is known as TT01-RifR.Results:Unexpectedly, upon phenotypic comparison between the rifampicin resistant strain and its presumed parent TT01, major differences were found with respect to bioluminescence, pigmentation, biofilm formation, haemolysis as well as growth. Therefore, we renamed the strain TT01-RifRto DJC. To unravel the genomic basis of the observed differences, we generated a complete genome sequence for strain DJC using the PacBio long read technology. As strain DJC was supposed to be a spontaneous mutant, only few sequence differences were expected. In order to distinguish these from potential sequencing errors in the published TT01 genome, we re-sequenced a derivative of strain TT01 in parallel, also using the PacBio technology. The two TT01 genomes differed at only 30 positions. In contrast, the genome of strain DJC varied extensively from TT01, showing 13,000 point mutations, 330 frameshifts, and 220 strain-specific regions with a total length of more than 300 kb in each of the compared genomes.Conclusions:According to the major phenotypic and genotypic differences, the rifampicin resistant P. luminescens strain, now named strain DJC, has to be considered as an independent isolate rather than a derivative of strain TT01. Strains TT01 and DJC both belong to P. luminescens subsp. laumondii.",30497380,PMC6267812,10.1186/s12864-018-5121-z,11
De novo assembly of a chromosome-level reference genome of red-spotted grouper (Epinephelus akaara) using nanopore sequencing and Hi-C,"The red-spotted grouper Epinephelus akaara (E. akaara) is one of the most economically important marine fish in China, Japan and South-East Asia and is a threatened species. The species is also considered a good model for studies of sex inversion, development, genetic diversity and immunity. Despite its importance, molecular resources for E. akaara remain limited and no reference genome has been published to date. In this study, we constructed a chromosome-level reference genome of E. akaara by taking advantage of long-read single-molecule sequencing and de novo assembly by Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) and Hi-C. A red-spotted grouper genome of 1.135 Gb was assembled from a total of 106.29 Gb polished Nanopore sequence (GridION, ONT), equivalent to 96-fold genome coverage. The assembled genome represents 96.8% completeness (BUSCO) with a contig N50 length of 5.25 Mb and a longest contig of 25.75 Mb. The contigs were clustered and ordered onto 24 pseudochromosomes covering approximately 95.55% of the genome assembly with Hi-C data, with a scaffold N50 length of 46.03 Mb. The genome contained 43.02% repeat sequences and 5,480 noncoding RNAs. Furthermore, combined with several RNA-seq data sets, 23,808 (99.5%) genes were functionally annotated from a total of 23,923 predicted protein-coding sequences. The high-quality chromosome-level reference genome of E. akaara was assembled for the first time and will be a valuable resource for molecular breeding and functional genomics studies of red-spotted grouper in the future.",31325912,PMC6899872,10.1111/1755-0998.13064,18
"Use of aCandida albicansSC5314 PacBio HiFi reads dataset to close gaps in the reference genome assembly, reveal a subtelomeric gene family, and produce accurate phased allelic sequences","Candida albicansSC5314 is the most-often used strain for molecular manipulation of the species. The SC5314 reference genome sequence is the result of considerable effort from many scientists and has advanced research into fungal biology and pathogenesis. Although the resource is highly developed and presented in a phased diploid format, the sequence includes gaps and does not extend to the telomeres on its eight chromosome pairs. Accurate SC5314 genome assembly is complicated by the presence of extensive repeated sequences and considerable allelic length variation at some loci. Advances in genome sequencing technology provide the tools to obtain highly accurate long-read data that span even the most-difficult-to-assemble genome regions. Here, we describe derivation of a PacBio HiFi data set and creation of a collapsed haploid telomere-to-telomere assembly of the SC5314 genome (ASM3268872v1) that revealed previously unknown features of the strain. ASM3268872v1 subtelomeric distances were up to 19 kb larger than in the reference genome and revealed a family of highly conserved DNA helicase-encoding genes at 10 of the 16 chromosome ends. We also describe alignments of individual HiFi reads to deduce accurate diploid sequences for the most notoriously difficult-to-assembleC. albicansgenes: the agglutinin-like sequence (ALS) gene family. We provide a tutorial that demonstrates how the HiFi reads can be visualized to explore any region of interest. Availability of the HiFi reads data set and the ASM3268872v1 comparative guide assembly will streamline research efforts because accurate diploid sequences can be derived using simplein silicomethods rather than time-consuming laboratory-bench approaches.",38362496,PMC10867151,10.3389/fcimb.2024.1329438,0
The genome assembly of the fungal pathogen Pyrenochaeta lycopersici from Single-Molecule Real-Time sequencing sheds new light on its biological complexity,"The first draft genome sequencing of the non-model fungal pathogen Pyrenochaeta lycopersici showed an expansion of gene families associated with heterokaryon incompatibility and lacking of mating-type genes, providing insights into the genetic basis of this ""imperfect"" fungus which lost the ability to produce the sexual stage. However, due to the Illumina short-read technology, the draft genome was too fragmented to allow a comprehensive characterization of the genome, especially of the repetitive sequence fraction. In this work, the sequencing of another P. lycopersici isolate using long-read Single Molecule Real-Time sequencing technology was performed with the aim of obtaining a gapless genome. Indeed, a gapless genome assembly of 62.7 Mb was obtained, with a fraction of repetitive sequences representing 30% of the total bases. The gene content of the two P. lycopersici isolates was very similar, and the large difference in genome size (about 8 Mb) might be attributable to the high fraction of repetitive sequences detected for the new sequenced isolate. The role of repetitive elements, including transposable elements, in modulating virulence effectors is well established in fungal plant pathogens. Moreover, transposable elements are of fundamental importance in creating and re-modelling genes, especially in imperfect fungi. Their abundance in P. lycopersici, together with the large expansion of heterokaryon incompatibility genes in both sequenced isolates, suggest the presence of possible mechanisms alternative to gene re-assorting mediated by sexual recombination. A quite large fraction (~9%) of repetitive elements in P. lycopersici, has no homology with known classes, strengthening this hypothesis. The availability of a gapless genome of P. lycopersici allowed the in-depth analysis of its genome content, by annotating functional genes and TEs. This goal will be an important resource for shedding light on the evolution of the reproductive and pathogenic behaviour of this soilborne pathogen and the onset of a possible speciation within this species.",29979772,PMC6034849,10.1371/journal.pone.0200217,10
Complete genome sequence of Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus isolated from the coconut rhinoceros beetle in Solomon Islands,"Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus (OrNV) has been an effective biocontrol agent against the insect pest Oryctes rhinoceros (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) for decades, but there is evidence that resistance could be evolving in some host populations. We detected OrNV infection in O. rhinoceros from Solomon Islands and used Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) long-read sequencing to determine the full length of the virus genomic sequence isolated from an individual belonging to a mitochondrial lineage (CRB-G) that was previously reported as resistant to OrNV. The complete circular genome of the virus consisted of 125,917 nucleotides, 1.698 bp shorter than the originally-described full genome sequence of Ma07 strain from Malaysia. We found 130 out of 139 previously annotated ORFs (seven contained interrupted/non-coding sequences, two were identified as duplicated versions of the existing genes), as well as a putatively inverted regions containing four genes. These results demonstrate the usefulness of a long-read sequencing technology for resolving potential structural variations when describing new virus isolates. While the Solomon Islands isolate exhibited 99.41 % nucleotide sequence identity with the originally described strain, we found several genes, including a core gene (vlf-1), that contained multiple amino acid insertions and/or deletions as putative polymorphisms of large effect. Our complete annotated genome sequence of a newly found isolate in Solomon Islands provides a valuable resource to help elucidate the mechanisms that compromise the efficacy of OrNV as a biocontrol agent against the coconut rhinoceros beetle.",31945420,,10.1016/j.virusres.2020.197864,11
HALC: High throughput algorithm for long read error correction,"Background:The third generation PacBio SMRT long reads can effectively address the read length issue of the second generation sequencing technology, but contain approximately 15% sequencing errors. Several error correction algorithms have been designed to efficiently reduce the error rate to 1%, but they discard large amounts of uncorrected bases and thus lead to low throughput. This loss of bases could limit the completeness of downstream assemblies and the accuracy of analysis.Results:Here, we introduce HALC, a high throughput algorithm for long read error correction. HALC aligns the long reads to short read contigs from the same species with a relatively low identity requirement so that a long read region can be aligned to at least one contig region, including its true genome region's repeats in the contigs sufficiently similar to it (similar repeat based alignment approach). It then constructs a contig graph and, for each long read, references the other long reads' alignments to find the most accurate alignment and correct it with the aligned contig regions (long read support based validation approach). Even though some long read regions without the true genome regions in the contigs are corrected with their repeats, this approach makes it possible to further refine these long read regions with the initial insufficient short reads and correct the uncorrected regions in between. In our performance tests on E. coli, A. thaliana and Maylandia zebra data sets, HALC was able to obtain 6.7-41.1% higher throughput than the existing algorithms while maintaining comparable accuracy. The HALC corrected long reads can thus result in 11.4-60.7% longer assembled contigs than the existing algorithms.Conclusions:The HALC software can be downloaded for free from this site: https://github.com/lanl001/halc .",28381259,PMC5382505,10.1186/s12859-017-1610-3,19
MicroPIPE: validating an end-to-end workflow for high-quality complete bacterial genome construction,"Background:Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) long-read sequencing has become a popular platform for microbial researchers due to the accessibility and affordability of its devices. However, easy and automated construction of high-quality bacterial genomes using nanopore reads remains challenging. Here we aimed to create a reproducible end-to-end bacterial genome assembly pipeline using ONT in combination with Illumina sequencing.Results:We evaluated the performance of several popular tools used during genome reconstruction, including base-calling, filtering, assembly, and polishing. We also assessed overall genome accuracy using ONT both natively and with Illumina. All steps were validated using the high-quality complete reference genome for the Escherichia coli sequence type (ST)131 strain EC958. Software chosen at each stage were incorporated into our final pipeline, MicroPIPE. Further validation of MicroPIPE was carried out using 11 additional ST131 E. coli isolates, which demonstrated that complete circularised chromosomes and plasmids could be achieved without manual intervention. Twelve publicly available Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial genomes (with available raw ONT data and matched complete genomes) were also assembled using MicroPIPE. We found that revised basecalling and updated assembly of the majority of these genomes resulted in improved accuracy compared to the current publicly available complete genomes.Conclusions:MicroPIPE is built in modules using Singularity container images and the bioinformatics workflow manager Nextflow, allowing changes and adjustments to be made in response to future tool development. Overall, MicroPIPE provides an easy-access, end-to-end solution for attaining high-quality bacterial genomes.

Parameterized syncmer schemes improve long-read mapping,"Motivation:Sequencing long reads presents novel challenges to mapping. One such challenge is low sequence similarity between the reads and the reference, due to high sequencing error and mutation rates. This occurs, e.g., in a cancer tumor, or due to differences between strains of viruses or bacteria. A key idea in mapping algorithms is to sketch sequences with their minimizers. Recently, syncmers were introduced as an alternative sketching method that is more robust to mutations and sequencing errors.Results:We introduce parameterized syncmer schemes (PSS), a generalization of syncmers, and provide a theoretical analysis for multi-parameter schemes. By combining PSS with downsampling or minimizers we can achieve any desired compression and window guarantee. We implemented the use of PSS in the popular minimap2 and Winnowmap2 mappers. In tests on simulated and real long-read data from a variety of genomes, the PSS-based algorithms, with scheme parameters selected on the basis of our theoretical analysis, reduced unmapped reads by 20-60% at high compression while usually using less memory. The advantage was more pronounced at low sequence identity. At sequence identity of 75% and medium compression, PSS-minimap had only 37% as many unmapped reads, and 8% fewer of the reads that did map were incorrectly mapped. Even at lower compression and error rates, PSS-based mapping mapped more reads than the original minimizer-based mappers as well as mappers using the original syncmer schemes. We conclude that using PSS can improve mapping of long reads in a wide range of settings.",36306319,PMC9645665,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010638,9
A New Method for Sequencing the Mitochondrial Genome by Using Long Read Technology,"We describe a protocol to prepare a multiplexed mtDNA library from a blood sample for performing a long read sequencing of the mitochondrial genome. All steps are carefully described to get a high enrichment of mtDNA relative to total DNA extracted from the blood sample. The obtained mutiplexed library allows the production of long sequence mtDNA reads up to 16.5 kbp with a quality enabling variant-calling by using a portable sequencer (MinION, Oxford Nanopore Technologies).",34080160,,10.1007/978-1-0716-1270-5_20,1
The effects of sequencing depth on the assembly of coding and noncoding transcripts in the human genome,"Investigating the functions and activities of genes requires proper annotation of the transcribed units. However, transcript assembly efforts have produced a surprisingly large variation in the number of transcripts, and especially so for noncoding transcripts. This heterogeneity in assembled transcript sets might be partially explained by sequencing depth. Here, we used real and simulated short-read sequencing data as well as long-read data to systematically investigate the impact of sequencing depths on the accuracy of assembled transcripts. We assembled and analyzed transcripts from 671 human short-read data sets and four long-read data sets. At the first level, there is a positive correlation between the number of reads and the number of recovered transcripts. However, the effect of the sequencing depth varied based on cell or tissue type, the type of read and the nature and expression levels of the transcripts. The detection of coding transcripts saturated rapidly with both short and long-reads, however, there was no sign of early saturation for noncoding transcripts at any sequencing depth. Increasing long-read sequencing depth specifically benefited transcripts containing transposable elements. Finally, we show how single-cell RNA-seq can be guided by transcripts assembled from bulk long-read samples, and demonstrate that noncoding transcripts are expressed at similar levels to coding transcripts but are expressed in fewer cells. This study highlights the impact of sequencing depth on transcript assembly.",35787153,PMC9251931,10.1186/s12864-022-08717-z,4
Phasing DNA Methylation,"Haplotyping enables the study of allele-specific events. Heterozygous variants, primarily single nucleotide variants (SNVs), enable the assignment of the paternal and maternal origin of the chromosomes and are widely employed to phase sequencing reads to their haplotype of origin. Certain long-read technologies enable the detection of both the DNA sequence and DNA modifications. These long reads and their inherent methylation information are suitable for genome-wide haplotyping and allele-specific DNA methylation analysis. Here, we describe the workflow to phase reads and DNA methylation using nanopore sequencing.",36335502,,10.1007/978-1-0716-2819-5_14,0
Construction of a chromosome-scale long-read reference genome assembly for potato,"Background:Worldwide, the cultivated potato, Solanum tuberosum L., is the No. 1 vegetable crop and a critical food security crop. The genome sequence of DM1-3 516 R44, a doubled monoploid clone of S. tuberosum Group Phureja, was published in 2011 using a whole-genome shotgun sequencing approach with short-read sequence data. Current advanced sequencing technologies now permit generation of near-complete, high-quality chromosome-scale genome assemblies at minimal cost.Findings:Here, we present an updated version of the DM1-3 516 R44 genome sequence (v6.1) using Oxford Nanopore Technologies long reads coupled with proximity-by-ligation scaffolding (Hi-C), yielding a chromosome-scale assembly. The new (v6.1) assembly represents 741.6 Mb of sequence (87.8%) of the estimated 844 Mb genome, of which 741.5 Mb is non-gapped with 731.2 Mb anchored to the 12 chromosomes. Use of Oxford Nanopore Technologies full-length complementary DNA sequencing enabled annotation of 32,917 high-confidence protein-coding genes encoding 44,851 gene models that had a significantly improved representation of conserved orthologs compared with the previous annotation. The new assembly has improved contiguity with a 595-fold increase in N50 contig size, 99% reduction in the number of contigs, a 44-fold increase in N50 scaffold size, and an LTR Assembly Index score of 13.56, placing it in the category of reference genome quality. The improved assembly also permitted annotation of the centromeres via alignment to sequencing reads derived from CENH3 nucleosomes.Conclusions:Access to advanced sequencing technologies and improved software permitted generation of a high-quality, long-read, chromosome-scale assembly and improved annotation dataset for the reference genotype of potato that will facilitate research aimed at improving agronomic traits and understanding genome evolution.",32964225,PMC7509475,10.1093/gigascience/giaa100,95
16S-FASAS: an integrated pipeline for synthetic full-length 16S rRNA gene sequencing data analysis,"Background:The full-length 16S rRNA sequencing can better improve the taxonomic and phylogenetic resolution compared to the partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The 16S-FAS-NGS (16S rRNA full-length amplicon sequencing based on a next-generation sequencing platform) technology can generate high-quality, full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences using short-read sequencers, together with assembly procedures. However there is a lack of a data analysis suite that can help process and analyze the synthetic long read data.Results:Herein, we developed software named 16S-FASAS (16S full-length amplicon sequencing data analysis software) for 16S-FAS-NGS data analysis, which provided high-fidelity species-level microbiome data. 16S-FASAS consists of data quality control,de novoassembly, annotation, and visualization modules. We verified the performance of 16S-FASAS on both mock and fecal samples. In mock communities, we proved that taxonomy assignment by MegaBLAST had fewer misclassifications and tended to find more low abundance species than the USEARCH-UNOISE3-based classifier, resulting in species-level classification of 85.71% (6/7), 85.71% (6/7), 72.72% (8/11), and 70% (7/10) of the target bacteria. When applied to fecal samples, we found that the 16S-FAS-NGS datasets generated contigs grouped into 60 and 56 species, from which 71.62% (43/60) and 76.79% (43/56) were shared with the Pacbio datasets.Conclusions:16S-FASAS is a valuable tool that helps researchers process and interpret the results of full-length 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Depending on the full-length amplicon sequencing technology, the 16S-FASAS pipeline enables a more accurate report on the bacterial complexity of microbiome samples. 16S-FASAS is freely available for use at https://github.com/capitalbio-bioinfo/FASAS.",36172503,PMC9511998,10.7717/peerj.14043,1
Development of a portable on-site applicable metagenomic data generation workflow for enhanced pathogen and antimicrobial resistance surveillance,"Rapid, accurate and comprehensive diagnostics are essential for outbreak prevention and pathogen surveillance. Real-time, on-site metagenomics on miniaturized devices, such as Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION sequencing, could provide a promising approach. However, current sample preparation protocols often require substantial equipment and dedicated laboratories, limiting their use. In this study, we developed a rapid on-site applicable DNA extraction and library preparation approach for nanopore sequencing, using portable devices. The optimized method consists of a portable mechanical lysis approach followed by magnetic bead-based DNA purification and automated sequencing library preparation, and resulted in a throughput comparable to a current optimal, laboratory-based protocol using enzymatic digestion to lyse cells. By using spike-in reference communities, we compared the on-site method with other workflows, and demonstrated reliable taxonomic profiling, despite method-specific biases. We also demonstrated the added value of long-read sequencing by recovering reads containing full-length antimicrobial resistance genes, and attributing them to a host species based on the additional genomic information they contain. Our method may provide a rapid, widely-applicable approach for microbial detection and surveillance in a variety of on-site settings.",37952062,PMC10640560,10.1038/s41598-023-46771-z,1
Improving the sensitivity of long read overlap detection using grouped short k-mer matches,"Background:Single-molecule, real-time sequencing (SMRT) developed by Pacific BioSciences produces longer reads than second-generation sequencing technologies such as Illumina. The increased read length enables PacBio sequencing to close gaps in genome assembly, reveal structural variations, and characterize the intra-species variations. It also holds the promise to decipher the community structure in complex microbial communities because long reads help metagenomic assembly. One key step in genome assembly using long reads is to quickly identify reads forming overlaps. Because PacBio data has higher sequencing error rate and lower coverage than popular short read sequencing technologies (such as Illumina), efficient detection of true overlaps requires specially designed algorithms. In particular, there is still a need to improve the sensitivity of detecting small overlaps or overlaps with high error rates in both reads. Addressing this need will enable better assembly for metagenomic data produced by third-generation sequencing technologies.Results:In this work, we designed and implemented an overlap detection program named GroupK, for third-generation sequencing reads based on grouped k-mer hits. While using k-mer hits for detecting reads' overlaps has been adopted by several existing programs, our method uses a group of short k-mer hits satisfying statistically derived distance constraints to increase the sensitivity of small overlap detection. Grouped k-mer hit was originally designed for homology search. We are the first to apply group hit for long read overlap detection. The experimental results of applying our pipeline to both simulated and real third-generation sequencing data showed that GroupK enables more sensitive overlap detection, especially for datasets of low sequencing coverage.Conclusions:GroupK is best used for detecting small overlaps for third-generation sequencing data. It provides a useful supplementary tool to existing ones for more sensitive and accurate overlap detection.

Improved contiguity of the threespine stickleback genome using long-read sequencing,"While the cost and time for assembling a genome has drastically decreased, it still remains a challenge to assemble a highly contiguous genome. These challenges are rapidly being overcome by the integration of long-read sequencing technologies. Here, we use long-read sequencing to improve the contiguity of the threespine stickleback fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus) genome, a prominent genetic model species. Using Pacific Biosciences sequencing, we assembled a highly contiguous genome of a freshwater fish from Paxton Lake. Using contigs from this genome, we were able to fill over 76.7% of the gaps in the existing reference genome assembly, improving contiguity over fivefold. Our gap filling approach was highly accurate, validated by 10X Genomics long-distance linked-reads. In addition to closing a majority of gaps, we were able to assemble segments of telomeres and centromeres throughout the genome. This highlights the power of using long sequencing reads to assemble highly repetitive and difficult to assemble regions of genomes. This latest genome build has been released through a newly designed community genome browser that aims to consolidate the growing number of genomics datasets available for the threespine stickleback fish.",33598708,PMC8022941,10.1093/g3journal/jkab007,16
De novo assembly of Dekkera bruxellensis: a multi technology approach using short and long-read sequencing and optical mapping,"Background:It remains a challenge to perform de novo assembly using next-generation sequencing (NGS). Despite the availability of multiple sequencing technologies and tools (e.g., assemblers) it is still difficult to assemble new genomes at chromosome resolution (i.e., one sequence per chromosome). Obtaining high quality draft assemblies is extremely important in the case of yeast genomes to better characterise major events in their evolutionary history. The aim of this work is two-fold: on the one hand we want to show how combining different and somewhat complementary technologies is key to improving assembly quality and correctness, and on the other hand we present a de novo assembly pipeline we believe to be beneficial to core facility bioinformaticians. To demonstrate both the effectiveness of combining technologies and the simplicity of the pipeline, here we present the results obtained using the Dekkera bruxellensis genome.Methods:In this work we used short-read Illumina data and long-read PacBio data combined with the extreme long-range information from OpGen optical maps in the task of de novo genome assembly and finishing. Moreover, we developed NouGAT, a semi-automated pipeline for read-preprocessing, de novo assembly and assembly evaluation, which was instrumental for this work.Results:We obtained a high quality draft assembly of a yeast genome, resolved on a chromosomal level. Furthermore, this assembly was corrected for mis-assembly errors as demonstrated by resolving a large collapsed repeat and by receiving higher scores by assembly evaluation tools. With the inclusion of PacBio data we were able to fill about 5 % of the optical mapped genome not covered by the Illumina data.",26617983,PMC4661999,10.1186/s13742-015-0094-1,11

This up-to-date review highlights the recent application of NS in the hematology field, focusing on progress and challenges of the technological approaches employed for the identification of pathologic alterations.

Evaluation of real-time nanopore sequencing for Salmonella serotype prediction,"The use of whole genome sequencing (WGS) data generated by short-read sequencing technologies such as the Illumina sequencing platforms has been shown to provide reliable results for Salmonella serotype prediction. Emerging long-read sequencing platforms developed by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) provide an alternative WGS method to meet the needs of industry for rapid and accurate Salmonella confirmation and serotype classification. Advantages of the ONT sequencing platforms include portability, real-time base-calling and long-read sequencing. To explore whether WGS data generated by an ONT sequencing platform could accurately predict Salmonella serotypes, 38 Salmonella strains representing 34 serotypes were sequenced using R9.4 flow cells on an ONT sequencer for up to 2 h. The downstream bioinformatics analysis was performed using pipelines with different assemblers including Canu, Wdbtg2 combined with Racon, or Miniasm combined with Racon. In silico serotype prediction programs were carried out using both SeqSero2 (raw reads and genome assemblies) and SISTR (genome assemblies). The WGS data of the same strains were also obtained from Illumina Hiseq (200 x depth of coverage per genome) as a benchmark of accurate serotype prediction. Predictions using WGS data generated after 30 min, 45 min, 1 h, and 2 h of ONT sequencing time all matched the prediction results from Illumina WGS data. This study demonstrated the comparable accuracy of WGS-based serotype prediction between ONT and Illumina sequencing platforms. This study also sets a start point for future validation of ONT WGS as a rapid Salmonella confirmation and serotype classification tool for the food industry.",32138998,,10.1016/j.fm.2020.103452,8
ReMILO: reference assisted misassembly detection algorithm using short and long reads,"Motivation:Contigs assembled from the second generation sequencing short reads may contain misassemblies, and thus complicate downstream analysis or even lead to incorrect analysis results. Fortunately, with more and more sequenced species available, it becomes possible to use the reference genome of a closely related species to detect misassemblies. In addition, long reads of the third generation sequencing technology have been more and more widely used, and can also help detect misassemblies.Results:Here, we introduce ReMILO, a reference assisted misassembly detection algorithm that uses both short reads and PacBio SMRT long reads. ReMILO aligns the initial short reads to both the contigs and reference genome, and then constructs a novel data structure called red-black multipositional de Bruijn graph to detect misassemblies. In addition, ReMILO also aligns the contigs to long reads and find their differences from the long reads to detect more misassemblies. In our performance test on short read assemblies of human chromosome 14 data, ReMILO can detect 41.8-77.9% extensive misassemblies and 33.6-54.5% local misassemblies. On hybrid short and long read assemblies of S.pastorianus data, ReMILO can also detect 60.6-70.9% extensive misassemblies and 28.6-54.0% local misassemblies.Availability and implementation:The ReMILO software can be downloaded for free under Artistic License 2.0 from this site: https://github.com/songc001/remilo.Contact:baoe@bjtu.edu.cn.Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",28961789,,10.1093/bioinformatics/btx524,3
Error correction enables use of Oxford Nanopore technology for reference-free transcriptome analysis,"Oxford Nanopore (ONT) is a leading long-read technology which has been revolutionizing transcriptome analysis through its capacity to sequence the majority of transcripts from end-to-end. This has greatly increased our ability to study the diversity of transcription mechanisms such as transcription initiation, termination, and alternative splicing. However, ONT still suffers from high error rates which have thus far limited its scope to reference-based analyses. When a reference is not available or is not a viable option due to reference-bias, error correction is a crucial step towards the reconstruction of the sequenced transcripts and downstream sequence analysis of transcripts. In this paper, we present a novel computational method to error correct ONT cDNA sequencing data, called isONcorrect. IsONcorrect is able to jointly use all isoforms from a gene during error correction, thereby allowing it to correct reads at low sequencing depths. We are able to obtain a median accuracy of 98.9-99.6%, demonstrating the feasibility of applying cost-effective cDNA full transcript length sequencing for reference-free transcriptome analysis.",33397972,PMC7782715,10.1038/s41467-020-20340-8,59
pathMap: a path-based mapping tool for long noisy reads with high sensitivity,"With the rapid development of single-molecule sequencing (SMS) technologies, the output read length is continuously increasing. Mapping such reads onto a reference genome is one of the most fundamental tasks in sequence analysis. Mapping sensitivity is becoming a major concern since high sensitivity can detect more aligned regions on the reference and obtain more aligned bases, which are useful for downstream analysis. In this study, we present pathMap, a novel k-mer graph-based mapper that is specifically designed for mapping SMS reads with high sensitivity. By viewing the alignment chain as a path containing as many anchors as possible in the matched k-mer graph, pathMap treats chaining as a path selection problem in the directed graph. pathMap iteratively searches the longest path in the remaining nodes; more candidate chains with high quality can be effectively detected and aligned. Compared to other state-of-the-art mapping methods such as minimap2 and Winnowmap2, experiment results on simulated and real-life datasets demonstrate that pathMap obtains the number of mapped chains at least 11.50% more than its closest competitor and increases the mapping sensitivity by 17.28% and 13.84% of bases over the next-best mapper for Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore sequencing data, respectively. In addition, pathMap is more robust to sequence errors and more sensitive to species- and strain-specific identification of pathogens using MinION reads.",38517696,PMC10959152,10.1093/bib/bbae107,0
Unraveling the features of somatic transposition in the Drosophila intestine,"Transposable elements (TEs) play a significant role in evolution, contributing to genetic variation. However, TE mobilization in somatic cells is not well understood. Here, we address the prevalence of transposition in a somatic tissue, exploiting the Drosophila midgut as a model. Using whole-genome sequencing of in vivo clonally expanded gut tissue, we have mapped hundreds of high-confidence somatic TE integration sites genome-wide. We show that somatic retrotransposon insertions are associated with inactivation of the tumor suppressor Notch, likely contributing to neoplasia formation. Moreover, applying Oxford Nanopore long-read sequencing technology we provide evidence for tissue-specific differences in retrotransposition. Comparing somatic TE insertional activity with transcriptomic and small RNA sequencing data, we demonstrate that transposon mobility cannot be simply predicted by whole tissue TE expression levels or by small RNA pathway activity. Finally, we reveal that somatic TE insertions in the adult fly intestine are enriched in genic regions and in transcriptionally active chromatin. Together, our findings provide clear evidence of ongoing somatic transposition in Drosophila and delineate previously unknown features underlying somatic TE mobility in vivo.",33634906,PMC8090852,10.15252/embj.2020106388,17
"Long-read nanopore DNA sequencing can resolve complex intragenic duplication/deletion variants, providing information to enable preimplantation genetic diagnosis","Background:The adoption of massively parallel short-read DNA sequencing methods has greatly expanded the scope and availability of genetic testing for inherited diseases. Indeed, the power of these methods has encouraged the integration of whole genome sequencing, the most comprehensive single approach to genomic analysis, into clinical practice. Despite these advances, diagnostic techniques that incompletely resolve the precise molecular boundaries of pathogenic sequence variants continue to be routinely deployed. This can present a barrier for certain prenatal diagnostic approaches. For example, the pre-referral workup for couples seeking preimplantation genetic diagnosis requires intragenic dosage variants to be characterised at nucleotide resolution.Objective:We sought to assess the use of long-read nanopore sequencing to rapidly characterise an apparent heterozygous RB1 exon 23 deletion that was initially identified by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), in a patient with bilateral retinoblastoma.Methods:Target enrichment was performed by long-range polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification prior to Flongle sequencing on a MinION long-read sequencer.Results:Characterisation of the deletion breakpoint included an unexpected 85-bp insertion which duplicated RB1 exon 24 (and was undetected by MLPA). The long-read sequence permitted design of a multiplex PCR assay, which confirmed that the mutation arose de novo.Conclusion:Our experience demonstrates the diagnostic utility of long-read technology for the precise characterisation of structural variants, and highlights how this technology can be efficiently deployed to enable onward referral to reproductive medicine services.",35014072,PMC9305782,10.1002/pd.6089,3
Application of long-read sequencing to elucidate complex pharmacogenomic regions: a proof of principle,"The use of pharmacogenomics in clinical practice is becoming standard of care. However, due to the complex genetic makeup of pharmacogenes, not all genetic variation is currently accounted for. Here, we show the utility of long-read sequencing to resolve complex pharmacogenes by analyzing a well-characterised sample. This data consists of long reads that were processed to resolve phased haploblocks. 73% of pharmacogenes were fully covered in one phased haploblock, including 9/15 genes that are 100% complex. Variant calling accuracy in the pharmacogenes was high, with 99.8% recall and 100% precision for SNVs and 98.7% precision and 98.0% recall for Indels. For the majority of gene-drug interactions in the DPWG and CPIC guidelines, the associated genes could be fully resolved (62% and 63% respectively). Together, these findings suggest that long-read sequencing data offers promising opportunities in elucidating complex pharmacogenes and haplotype phasing while maintaining accurate variant calling.",34741133,PMC8794781,10.1038/s41397-021-00259-z,8
Straglr: discovering and genotyping tandem repeat expansions using whole genome long-read sequences,"Tandem repeat (TR) expansion is the underlying cause of over 40 neurological disorders. Long-read sequencing offers an exciting avenue over conventional technologies for detecting TR expansions. Here, we present Straglr, a robust software tool for both targeted genotyping and novel expansion detection from long-read alignments. We benchmark Straglr using various simulations, targeted genotyping data of cell lines carrying expansions of known diseases, and whole genome sequencing data with chromosome-scale assembly. Our results suggest that Straglr may be useful for investigating disease-associated TR expansions using long-read sequencing.",34389037,PMC8361843,10.1186/s13059-021-02447-3,18
Familial long-read sequencing increases yield of de novo mutations,"Studies of de novo mutation (DNM) have typically excluded some of the most repetitive and complex regions of the genome because these regions cannot be unambiguously mapped with short-read sequencing data. To better understand the genome-wide pattern of DNM, we generated long-read sequence data from an autism parent-child quad with an affected female where no pathogenic variant had been discovered in short-read Illumina sequence data. We deeply sequenced all four individuals by using three sequencing platforms (Illumina, Oxford Nanopore, and Pacific Biosciences) and three complementary technologies (Strand-seq, optical mapping, and 10X Genomics). Using long-read sequencing, we initially discovered and validated 171 DNMs across two children-a 20% increase in the number of de novo single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and indels when compared to short-read callsets. The number of DNMs further increased by 5% when considering a more complete human reference (T2T-CHM13) because of the recovery of events in regions absent from GRCh38 (e.g., three DNMs in heterochromatic satellites). In total, we validated 195 de novo germline mutations and 23 potential post-zygotic mosaic mutations across both children; the overall true substitution rate based on this integrated callset is at least 1.41 × 10-8substitutions per nucleotide per generation. We also identified six de novo insertions and deletions in tandem repeats, two of which represent structural variants. We demonstrate that long-read sequencing and assembly, especially when combined with a more complete reference genome, increases the number of DNMs by >25% compared to previous studies, providing a more complete catalog of DNM compared to short-read data alone.",35290762,PMC9069071,10.1016/j.ajhg.2022.02.014,22
A survey of transcriptome complexity in Sus scrofa using single-molecule long-read sequencing,"Alternative splicing (AS) and fusion transcripts produce a vast expansion of transcriptomes and proteomes diversity. However, the reliability of these events and the extend of epigenetic mechanisms have not been adequately addressed due to its limitation of uncertainties about the complete structure of mRNA. Here we combined single-molecule real-time sequencing, Illumina RNA-seq and DNA methylation data to characterize the landscapes of DNA methylation on AS, fusion isoforms formation and lncRNA feature and further to unveil the transcriptome complexity of pig. Our analysis identified an unprecedented scale of high-quality full-length isoforms with over 28,127 novel isoforms from 26,881 novel genes. More than 92,000 novel AS events were detected and intron retention predominated in AS model, followed by exon skipping. Interestingly, we found that DNA methylation played an important role in generating various AS isoforms by regulating splicing sites, promoter regions and first exons. Furthermore, we identified a large of fusion transcripts and novel lncRNAs, and found that DNA methylation of the promoter and gene body could regulate lncRNA expression. Our results significantly improved existed gene models of pig and unveiled that pig AS and epigenetic modify were more complex than previously thought.",29850846,PMC6105124,10.1093/dnares/dsy014,33
"High-coverage, long-read sequencing of Han Chinese trio reference samples","Single-molecule long-read sequencing datasets were generated for a son-father-mother trio of Han Chinese descent that is part of the Genome in a Bottle (GIAB) consortium portfolio. The dataset was generated using the Pacific Biosciences Sequel System. The son and each parent were sequenced to an average coverage of 60 and 30, respectively, with N50 subread lengths between 16 and 18 kb.

Combined assembly of long and short sequencing reads improve the efficiency of exploring the soil metagenome,"Background:Advances in DNA sequencing technologies have transformed our capacity to perform life science research, decipher the dynamics of complex soil microbial communities and exploit them for plant disease management. However, soil is a complex conglomerate, which makes functional metagenomics studies very challenging.Results:Metagenomes were assembled by long-read (PacBio, PB), short-read (Illumina, IL), and mixture of PB and IL (PI) sequencing of soil DNA samples were compared. Ortholog analyses and functional annotation revealed that the PI approach significantly increased the contig length of the metagenomic sequences compared to IL and enlarged the gene pool compared to PB. The PI approach also offered comparable or higher species abundance than either PB or IL alone, and showed significant advantages for studying natural product biosynthetic genes in the soil microbiomes.Conclusion:Our results provide an effective strategy for combining long and short-read DNA sequencing data to explore and distill the maximum information out of soil metagenomics.",34996356,PMC8742384,10.1186/s12864-021-08260-3,6
Transcriptome profiling analysis of tea plant (Camellia sinensis) using Oxford Nanopore long-read RNA-Seq technology,"Transcriptome profiles have been widely captured using short-read sequencing technology, but there are still limitations partially due to the read length. Here, we generated long reads using Oxford Nanopore PromethION™ technology and short reads using the Illumina sequencing platform to study the transcriptome of root, stem, and leaf of Camellia sinensis cv. Fudingdabai. We mapped the Nanopore reads to the Shuchazao of C. sinensis genome sequence, and the mapping rates ranged from 82.63% to 90.59% (average 86.44%); this is lower than that of the Illumina reads which was 87.83% to 91.14% (average 90.12%). Gene expression level was quantified using the Nanopore and Illumina data and we observed a good agreement. The same tea leaf flavor synthesis pathways were highlighted using both sequencing technologies when analyzing the differentially expressed genes between leaf and root. Alternative splicing was then analyzed, and the intron-retention was observed as the most common alternative splicing. Moreover Nanopore long reads could correct transcript isoform annotation for differential expression investigation purposes. Nanopore sequencing techniques can provide a novel reference basis for molecular analysis of tea plants.",33096183,,10.1016/j.gene.2020.145247,4
A survey of the sorghum transcriptome using single-molecule long reads,"Alternative splicing and alternative polyadenylation (APA) of pre-mRNAs greatly contribute to transcriptome diversity, coding capacity of a genome and gene regulatory mechanisms in eukaryotes. Second-generation sequencing technologies have been extensively used to analyse transcriptomes. However, a major limitation of short-read data is that it is difficult to accurately predict full-length splice isoforms. Here we sequenced the sorghum transcriptome using Pacific Biosciences single-molecule real-time long-read isoform sequencing and developed a pipeline called TAPIS (Transcriptome Analysis Pipeline for Isoform Sequencing) to identify full-length splice isoforms and APA sites. Our analysis reveals transcriptome-wide full-length isoforms at an unprecedented scale with over 11,000 novel splice isoforms. Additionally, we uncover APA of ∼11,000 expressed genes and more than 2,100 novel genes. These results greatly enhance sorghum gene annotations and aid in studying gene regulation in this important bioenergy crop. The TAPIS pipeline will serve as a useful tool to analyse Iso-Seq data from any organism.",27339290,PMC4931028,10.1038/ncomms11706,240
SVNN: an efficient PacBio-specific pipeline for structural variations calling using neural networks,"Background:Once aligned, long-reads can be a useful source of information to identify the type and position of structural variations. However, due to the high sequencing error of long reads, long-read structural variation detection methods are far from precise in low-coverage cases. To be accurate, they need to use high-coverage data, which in turn, results in an extremely time-consuming pipeline, especially in the alignment phase. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to have a structural variation calling pipeline which is both fast and precise for low-coverage data.Results:In this paper, we present SVNN, a fast yet accurate, structural variation calling pipeline for PacBio long-reads that takes raw reads as the input and detects structural variants of size larger than 50 bp. Our pipeline utilizes state-of-the-art long-read aligners, namely NGMLR and Minimap2, and structural variation callers, videlicet Sniffle and SVIM. We found that by using a neural network, we can extract features from Minimap2 output to detect a subset of reads that provide useful information for structural variation detection. By only mapping this subset with NGMLR, which is far slower than Minimap2 but better serves downstream structural variation detection, we can increase the sensitivity in an efficient way. As a result of using multiple tools intelligently, SVNN achieves up to 20 percentage points of sensitivity improvement in comparison with state-of-the-art methods and is three times faster than a naive combination of state-of-the-art tools to achieve almost the same accuracy.Conclusion:Since prohibitive costs of using high-coverage data have impeded long-read applications, with SVNN, we provide the users with a much faster structural variation detection platform for PacBio reads with high precision and sensitivity in low-coverage scenarios.",34147063,PMC8214287,10.1186/s12859-021-04184-7,1
Novel and Annotated Long Noncoding RNAs Associated with Ischemia in the Human Heart,"Background:Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. We aimed to identify novel lncRNAs associated with the early response to ischemia in the heart.Methods and results:RNA sequencing data gathered from 81 paired left ventricle samples from patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass was collected before and after a period of ischemia. Novel lncRNAs were validated with Oxford Nanopore Technologies long-read sequencing. Gene modules associated with an early ischemic response were identified and the subcellular location of selected lncRNAs was determined with RNAscope. A total of 2446 mRNAs, 270 annotated lncRNAs and one novel lncRNA differed in response to ischemia (adjustedp< 0.001, absolute fold change >1.2). The novel lncRNA belonged to a gene module of highly correlated genes that also included 39 annotated lncRNAs. This module associated with ischemia (Pearson correlation coefficient = -0.69,p= 1 × 10-23) and activation of cell death pathways (p< 6 × 10-9). A further nine novel cardiac lncRNAs were identified, of which, one overlapped five cis-eQTL eSNPs for the gene RWD Domain-Containing Sumoylation Enhancer (RWDD3) and was itself correlated with RWDD3 expression (Pearson correlation coefficient -0.2,p= 0.002).Conclusion:We have identified 10 novel lncRNAs, one of which was associated with myocardial ischemia and may have potential as a novel therapeutic target or early marker for myocardial dysfunction.",34768754,PMC8583240,10.3390/ijms222111324,3

The impact of third generation genomic technologies on plant genome assembly,"Since the introduction of next generation sequencing, plant genome assembly projects do not need to rely on dedicated research facilities or community-wide consortia anymore, even individual research groups can sequence and assemble the genomes they are interested in. However, such assemblies are typically not based on the entire breadth of genomic technologies including genetic and physical maps and their contiguities tend to be low compared to the full-length gold standard reference sequences. Recently emerging third generation genomic technologies like long-read sequencing or optical mapping promise to bridge this quality gap and enable simple and cost-effective solutions for chromosomal-level assemblies.",28231512,,10.1016/j.pbi.2017.02.002,91
Detection and visualization of complex structural variants from long reads,"Background:With applications in cancer, drug metabolism, and disease etiology, understanding structural variation in the human genome is critical in advancing the thrusts of individualized medicine. However, structural variants (SVs) remain challenging to detect with high sensitivity using short read sequencing technologies. This problem is exacerbated when considering complex SVs comprised of multiple overlapping or nested rearrangements. Longer reads, such as those from Pacific Biosciences platforms, often span multiple breakpoints of such events, and thus provide a way to unravel small-scale complexities in SVs with higher confidence.Results:We present CORGi (COmplex Rearrangement detection with Graph-search), a method for the detection and visualization of complex local genomic rearrangements. This method leverages the ability of long reads to span multiple breakpoints to untangle SVs that appear very complicated with respect to a reference genome. We validated our approach against both simulated long reads, and real data from two long read sequencing technologies. We demonstrate the ability of our method to identify breakpoints inserted in synthetic data with high accuracy, and the ability to detect and plot SVs from NA12878 germline, achieving 88.4% concordance between the two sets of sequence data. The patterns of complexity we find in many NA12878 SVs match known mechanisms associated with DNA replication and structural variant formation, and highlight the ability of our method to automatically label complex SVs with an intuitive combination of adjacent or overlapping reference transformations.Conclusions:CORGi is a method for interrogating genomic regions suspected to contain local rearrangements using long reads. Using pairwise alignments and graph search CORGi produces labels and visualizations for local SVs of arbitrary complexity.",30577744,PMC6302372,10.1186/s12859-018-2539-x,14
Hybrid correction of highly noisy long reads using a variable-order de Bruijn graph,"Motivation:The recent rise of long read sequencing technologies such as Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore allows to solve assembly problems for larger and more complex genomes than what allowed short reads technologies. However, these long reads are very noisy, reaching an error rate of around 10-15% for Pacific Biosciences, and up to 30% for Oxford Nanopore. The error correction problem has been tackled by either self-correcting the long reads, or using complementary short reads in a hybrid approach. However, even though sequencing technologies promise to lower the error rate of the long reads below 10%, it is still higher in practice, and correcting such noisy long reads remains an issue.Results:We present HG-CoLoR, a hybrid error correction method that focuses on a seed-and-extend approach based on the alignment of the short reads to the long reads, followed by the traversal of a variable-order de Bruijn graph, built from the short reads. Our experiments show that HG-CoLoR manages to efficiently correct highly noisy long reads that display an error rate as high as 44%. When compared to other state-of-the-art long read error correction methods, our experiments also show that HG-CoLoR provides the best trade-off between runtime and quality of the results, and is the only method able to efficiently scale to eukaryotic genomes.Availability and implementation:HG-CoLoR is implemented is C++, supported on Linux platforms and freely available at https://github.com/morispi/HG-CoLoR.Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",29955770,,10.1093/bioinformatics/bty521,16
Long-read direct RNA sequencing reveals epigenetic regulation of chimeric gene-transposon transcripts in Arabidopsis thaliana,"Transposable elements (TEs) are accumulated in both intergenic and intragenic regions in plant genomes. Intragenic TEs often act as regulatory elements of associated genes and are also co-transcribed with genes, generating chimeric TE-gene transcripts. Despite the potential impact on mRNA regulation and gene function, the prevalence and transcriptional regulation of TE-gene transcripts are poorly understood. By long-read direct RNA sequencing and a dedicated bioinformatics pipeline, ParasiTE, we investigated the transcription and RNA processing of TE-gene transcripts in Arabidopsis thaliana. We identified a global production of TE-gene transcripts in thousands of A. thaliana gene loci, with TE sequences often being associated with alternative transcription start sites or transcription termination sites. The epigenetic state of intragenic TEs affects RNAPII elongation and usage of alternative poly(A) signals within TE sequences, regulating alternative TE-gene isoform production. Co-transcription and inclusion of TE-derived sequences into gene transcripts impact regulation of RNA stability and environmental responses of some loci. Our study provides insights into TE-gene interactions that contributes to mRNA regulation, transcriptome diversity, and environmental responses in plants.",37277361,PMC10241880,10.1038/s41467-023-38954-z,2
Efficient mapping of accurate long reads in minimizer space with mapquik,"DNA sequencing data continue to progress toward longer reads with increasingly lower sequencing error rates. We focus on the critical problem of mapping, or aligning, low-divergence sequences from long reads (e.g., Pacific Biosciences [PacBio] HiFi) to a reference genome, which poses challenges in terms of accuracy and computational resources when using cutting-edge read mapping approaches that are designed for all types of alignments. A natural idea would be to optimize efficiency with longer seeds to reduce the probability of extraneous matches; however, contiguous exact seeds quickly reach a sensitivity limit. We introduce mapquik, a novel strategy that creates accurate longer seeds by anchoring alignments through matches ofkconsecutively sampled minimizers (k-min-mers) and only indexing k-min-mers that occur once in the reference genome, thereby unlocking ultrafast mapping while retaining high sensitivity. We show that mapquik significantly accelerates the seeding and chaining steps-fundamental bottlenecks to read mapping-for both the human and maize genomes with [Formula: see text] sensitivity and near-perfect specificity. On the human genome, for both real and simulated reads, mapquik achieves a [Formula: see text] speedup over the state-of-the-art tool minimap2, and on the maize genome, mapquik achieves a [Formula: see text] speedup over minimap2, making mapquik the fastest mapper to date. These accelerations are enabled from not only minimizer-space seeding but also a novel heuristic [Formula: see text] pseudochaining algorithm, which improves upon the long-standing [Formula: see text] bound. Minimizer-space computation builds the foundation for achieving real-time analysis of long-read sequencing data.",37399256,PMC10538364,10.1101/gr.277679.123,5
"A comparison of short-read, HiFi long-read, and hybrid strategies for genome-resolved metagenomics","Shotgun metagenomics enables the reconstruction of complex microbial communities at a high level of detail. Such an approach can be conducted using both short-read and long-read sequencing data, as well as a combination of both. To assess the pros and cons of these different approaches, we used 22 fecal DNA extracts collected weekly for 11 weeks from two respective lab mice to study seven performance metrics over four combinations of sequencing depth and technology: (i) 20 Gbp of Illumina short-read data, (ii) 40 Gbp of short-read data, (iii) 20 Gbp of PacBio HiFi long-read data, and (iv) 40 Gbp of hybrid (20 Gbp of short-read +20 Gbp of long-read) data. No strategy was best for all metrics; instead, each one excelled across different metrics. The long-read approach yielded the best assembly statistics, with the highest N50 and lowest number of contigs. The 40 Gbp short-read approach yielded the highest number of refined bins. Finally, the hybrid approach yielded the longest assemblies and the highest mapping rate to the bacterial genomes. Our results suggest that while long-read sequencing significantly improves the quality of reconstructed bacterial genomes, it is more expensive and requires deeper sequencing than short-read approaches to recover a comparable amount of reconstructed genomes. The most optimal strategy is study-specific and depends on how researchers assess the trade-off between the quantity and quality of recovered genomes.IMPORTANCEMice are an important model organism for understanding the gut microbiome. When studying these gut microbiomes using DNA techniques, researchers can choose from technologies that use short or long DNA reads. In this study, we perform an extensive benchmark between short- and long-read DNA sequencing for studying mice gut microbiomes. We find that no one approach was best for all metrics and provide information that can help guide researchers in planning their experiments.",38451230,PMC10986573,10.1128/spectrum.03590-23,1
Hybrid De Novo Genome Assembly Using MiSeq and SOLiD Short Read Data,"A hybrid de novo assembly pipeline was constructed to utilize both MiSeq and SOLiD short read data in combination in the assembly. The short read data were converted to a standard format of the pipeline, and were supplied to the pipeline components such as ABySS and SOAPdenovo. The assembly pipeline proceeded through several stages, and either MiSeq paired-end data, SOLiD mate-paired data, or both of them could be specified as input data at each stage separately. The pipeline was examined on the filamentous fungus Aspergillus oryzae RIB40, by aligning the assembly results against the reference sequences. Using both the MiSeq and the SOLiD data in the hybrid assembly, the alignment length was improved by a factor of 3 to 8, compared with the assemblies using either one of the data types. The number of the reproduced gene cluster regions encoding secondary metabolite biosyntheses (SMB) was also improved by the hybrid assemblies. These results imply that the MiSeq data with long read length are essential to construct accurate nucleotide sequences, while the SOLiD mate-paired reads with long insertion length enhance long-range arrangements of the sequences. The pipeline was also tested on the actinomycete Streptomyces avermitilis MA-4680, whose gene is known to have high-GC content. Although the quality of the SOLiD reads was too low to perform any meaningful assemblies by themselves, the alignment length to the reference was improved by a factor of 2, compared with the assembly using only the MiSeq data.",25919614,PMC4412624,10.1371/journal.pone.0126289,4
Unraveling metagenomics through long-read sequencing: a comprehensive review,"The study of microbial communities has undergone significant advancements, starting from the initial use of 16S rRNA sequencing to the adoption of shotgun metagenomics. However, a new era has emerged with the advent of long-read sequencing (LRS), which offers substantial improvements over its predecessor, short-read sequencing (SRS). LRS produces reads that are several kilobases long, enabling researchers to obtain more complete and contiguous genomic information, characterize structural variations, and study epigenetic modifications. The current leaders in LRS technologies are Pacific Biotechnologies (PacBio) and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), each offering a distinct set of advantages. This review covers the workflow of long-read metagenomics sequencing, including sample preparation (sample collection, sample extraction, and library preparation), sequencing, processing (quality control, assembly, and binning), and analysis (taxonomic annotation and functional annotation). Each section provides a concise outline of the key concept of the methodology, presenting the original concept as well as how it is challenged or modified in the context of LRS. Additionally, the section introduces a range of tools that are compatible with LRS and can be utilized to execute the LRS process. This review aims to present the workflow of metagenomics, highlight the transformative impact of LRS, and provide researchers with a selection of tools suitable for this task.",38282030,PMC10823668,10.1186/s12967-024-04917-1,4
"Yersinia hibernica sp. nov., isolated from pig-production environments","A Gram-stain-negative, rod-shaped strain isolated from pig-production environments was identified as a new species within the genus Yersinia using multifaceted genomic and biochemical approaches. The genome of this strain was closed using a hybrid assembly approach combining both high accuracy short read sequencing data with long read sequencing technology. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene showed ~98 % similarity to Yersinia kristensenii and ~98 % similarity to Yersinia enterocolitica. Average nucleotide identity (OrthoANI) values were calculated as 85.79 % to Y. kristensenii ATCC 33638Tand 85.73 % to Y. enterocolitica ATCC 9610Tthereby providing evidence that this isolate should be considered as a novel species. The type strain is CFS1934T(=NCTC 14222T=LMG 31076T).",31066656,,10.1099/ijsem.0.003422,7
Novel High-Throughput DNA Part Characterization Technique for Synthetic Biology,"This study presents a novel DNA part characterization technique that increases throughput by combinatorial DNA part assembly, solid plate-based quantitative fluorescence assay for phenotyping, and barcode tagging-based long-read sequencing for genotyping. We confirmed that the fluorescence intensities of colonies on plates were comparable to fluorescence at the single-cell level from a high-end, flow-cytometry device and developed a high-throughput image analysis pipeline. The barcode tagging-based long-read sequencing technique enabled rapid identification of all DNA parts and their combinations with a single sequencing experiment. Using our techniques, forty-four DNA parts (21 promoters and 23 RBSs) were successfully characterized in 72 h without any automated equipment. We anticipate that this high-throughput and easy-to-use part characterization technique will contribute to increasing part diversity and be useful for building genetic circuits and metabolic pathways in synthetic biology.",35879270,PMC9628936,10.4014/jmb.2207.07013,0
"Sexual Dimorphism through the Lens of Genome Manipulation, Forward Genetics, and Spatiotemporal Sequencing","Sexual reproduction often leads to selection that favors the evolution of sex-limited traits or sex-specific variation for shared traits. These sexual dimorphisms manifest due to sex-specific genetic architectures and sex-biased gene expression across development, yet the molecular mechanisms underlying these patterns are largely unknown. The first step is to understand how sexual dimorphisms arise across the genotype-phenotype-fitness map. The emergence of ""4D genome technologies"" allows for efficient, high-throughput, and cost-effective manipulation and observations of this process. Studies of sexual dimorphism will benefit from combining these technological advances (e.g., precision genome editing, inducible transgenic systems, and single-cell RNA sequencing) with clever experiments inspired by classic designs (e.g., bulked segregant analysis, experimental evolution, and pedigree tracing). This perspective poses a synthetic view of how manipulative approaches coupled with cutting-edge observational methods and evolutionary theory are poised to uncover the molecular genetic basis of sexual dimorphism with unprecedented resolution. We outline hypothesis-driven experimental paradigms for identifying genetic mechanisms of sexual dimorphism among tissues, across development, and over evolutionary time.",33587127,PMC7883666,10.1093/gbe/evaa243,4
"Accurate, multi-kb reads resolve complex populations and detect rare microorganisms","Accurate evaluation of microbial communities is essential for understanding global biogeochemical processes and can guide bioremediation and medical treatments. Metagenomics is most commonly used to analyze microbial diversity and metabolic potential, but assemblies of the short reads generated by current sequencing platforms may fail to recover heterogeneous strain populations and rare organisms. Here we used short (150-bp) and long (multi-kb) synthetic reads to evaluate strain heterogeneity and study microorganisms at low abundance in complex microbial communities from terrestrial sediments. The long-read data revealed multiple (probably dozens of) closely related species and strains from previously undescribed Deltaproteobacteria and Aminicenantes (candidate phylum OP8). Notably, these are the most abundant organisms in the communities, yet short-read assemblies achieved only partial genome coverage, mostly in the form of short scaffolds (N50 = ∼ 2200 bp). Genome architecture and metabolic potential for these lineages were reconstructed using a new synteny-based method. Analysis of long-read data also revealed thousands of species whose abundances were <0.1% in all samples. Most of the organisms in this ""long tail"" of rare organisms belong to phyla that are also represented by abundant organisms. Genes encoding glycosyl hydrolases are significantly more abundant than expected in rare genomes, suggesting that rare species may augment the capability for carbon turnover and confer resilience to changing environmental conditions. Overall, the study showed that a diversity of closely related strains and rare organisms account for a major portion of the communities. These are probably common features of many microbial communities and can be effectively studied using a combination of long and short reads.",25665577,PMC4381525,10.1101/gr.183012.114,61
Comparison of mitochondrial DNA variants detection using short- and long-read sequencing,"The recent advent of long-read sequencing technologies is expected to provide reasonable answers to genetic challenges unresolvable by short-read sequencing, primarily the inability to accurately study structural variations, copy number variations, and homologous repeats in complex parts of the genome. However, long-read sequencing comes along with higher rates of random short deletions and insertions, and single nucleotide errors. The relatively higher sequencing accuracy of short-read sequencing has kept it as the first choice of screening for single nucleotide variants and short deletions and insertions. Albeit, short-read sequencing still suffers from systematic errors that tend to occur at specific positions where a high depth of reads is not always capable to correct for these errors. In this study, we compared the genotyping of mitochondrial DNA variants in three samples using PacBio's Sequel (Pacific Biosciences Inc., Menlo Park, CA, USA) long-read sequencing and illumina's HiSeqX10 (illumine Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) short-read sequencing data. We concluded that, despite the differences in the type and frequency of errors in the long-reads sequencing, its accuracy is still comparable to that of short-reads for genotyping short nuclear variants; due to the randomness of errors in long reads, a lower coverage, around 37 reads, can be sufficient to correct for these random errors.",31409854,,10.1038/s10038-019-0654-9,6
GALA: a computational framework for de novo chromosome-by-chromosome assembly with long reads,"High-quality genome assembly has wide applications in genetics and medical studies. However, it is still very challenging to achieve gap-free chromosome-scale assemblies using current workflows for long-read platforms. Here we report on GALA (Gap-free long-read Assembly tool), a computational framework for chromosome-based sequencing data separation and de novo assembly implemented through a multi-layer graph that identifies discordances within preliminary assemblies and partitions the data into chromosome-scale scaffolding groups. The subsequent independent assembly of each scaffolding group generates a gap-free assembly likely free from the mis-assembly errors which usually hamper existing workflows. This flexible framework also allows us to integrate data from various technologies, such as Hi-C, genetic maps, and even motif analyses to generate gap-free chromosome-scale assemblies. As a proof of principle we de novo assemble the C. elegans genome using combined PacBio and Nanopore sequencing data and a rice cultivar genome using Nanopore sequencing data from publicly available datasets. We also demonstrate the proposed method's applicability with a gap-free assembly of the human genome using PacBio high-fidelity (HiFi) long reads. Thus, our method enables straightforward assembly of genomes with multiple data sources and overcomes barriers that at present restrict the application of de novo genome assembly technology.",36639368,PMC9839709,10.1038/s41467-022-35670-y,0
CSSSCL: a python package that uses combined sequence similarity scores for accurate taxonomic classification of long and short sequence reads,"Summary:Sequence comparison of genetic material between known and unknown organisms plays a crucial role in genomics, metagenomics and phylogenetic analysis. The emerging long-read sequencing technologies can now produce reads of tens of kilobases in length that promise a more accurate assessment of their origin. To facilitate the classification of long and short DNA sequences, we have developed a Python package that implements a new sequence classification model that we have demonstrated to improve the classification accuracy when compared with other state of the art classification methods. For the purpose of validation, and to demonstrate its usefulness, we test the combined sequence similarity score classifier (CSSSCL) using three different datasets, including a metagenomic dataset composed of short reads.Availability and implementation:Package's source code and test datasets are available under the GPLv3 license at https://github.com/oicr-ibc/cssscl.Contact:ivan.borozan@oicr.on.caSupplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",26454281,PMC4734043,10.1093/bioinformatics/btv587,3
SASpector: analysis of missing genomic regions in draft genomes of prokaryotes,"Summary:Missing regions in short-read assemblies of prokaryote genomes are often attributed to biases in sequencing technologies and to repetitive elements, the former resulting in low sequencing coverage of certain loci and the latter to unresolved loops in the de novo assembly graph. We developed SASpector, a command-line tool that compares short-read assemblies (draft genomes) to their corresponding closed assemblies and extracts missing regions to analyze them at the sequence and functional level. SASpector allows to benchmark the need for resolved genomes, can be integrated into pipelines to control the quality of assemblies, and could be used for comparative investigations of missingness in assemblies for which both short-read and long-read data are available in the public databases.Availability and implementation:SASpector is available at https://github.com/LoGT-KULeuven/SASpector. The tool is implemented in Python3 and available through pip and Docker (0mician/saspector).Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",35561201,PMC9113259,10.1093/bioinformatics/btac208,0
rMFilter: acceleration of long read-based structure variation calling by chimeric read filtering,"Motivation:Long read sequencing technologies provide new opportunities to investigate genome structural variations (SVs) more accurately. However, the state-of-the-art SV calling pipelines are computational intensive and the applications of long reads are restricted.Results:We propose a local region match-based filter (rMFilter) to efficiently nail down chimeric noisy long reads based on short token matches within local genomic regions. rMFilter is able to substantially accelerate long read-based SV calling pipelines without loss of effectiveness. It can be easily integrated into current long read-based pipelines to facilitate SV studies.Availability and implementation:The C ++ source code of rMFilter is available at https://github.com/hitbc/rMFilter .Contact:ydwang@hit.edu.cn.Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",28482046,,10.1093/bioinformatics/btx279,0
Genomic Structural Variations Within Five Continental Populations ofDrosophila melanogaster,"Chromosomal structural variations (SV) including insertions, deletions, inversions, and translocations occur within the genome and can have a significant effect on organismal phenotype. Some of these effects are caused by structural variations containing genes. Large structural variations represent a significant amount of the genetic diversity within a population. We used a global sampling ofDrosophila melanogaster(Ithaca, Zimbabwe, Beijing, Tasmania, and Netherlands) to represent diverse populations within the species. We used long-read sequencing and optical mapping technologies to identify SVs in these genomes. Among the five lines examined, we found an average of 2,928 structural variants within these genomes. These structural variations varied greatly in size and location, included many exonic regions, and could impact adaptation and genomic evolution.",30111620,PMC6169376,10.1534/g3.118.200631,12
Comprehensive identification of transposable element insertions using multiple sequencing technologies,"Transposable elements (TEs) help shape the structure and function of the human genome. When inserted into some locations, TEs may disrupt gene regulation and cause diseases. Here, we present xTea (x-Transposable element analyzer), a tool for identifying TE insertions in whole-genome sequencing data. Whereas existing methods are mostly designed for short-read data, xTea can be applied to both short-read and long-read data. Our analysis shows that xTea outperforms other short read-based methods for both germline and somatic TE insertion discovery. With long-read data, we created a catalogue of polymorphic insertions with full assembly and annotation of insertional sequences for various types of retroelements, including pseudogenes and endogenous retroviruses. Notably, we find that individual genomes have an average of nine groups of full-length L1s in centromeres, suggesting that centromeres and other highly repetitive regions such as telomeres are a significant yet unexplored source of active L1s. xTea is available at https://github.com/parklab/xTea .",34158502,PMC8219666,10.1038/s41467-021-24041-8,34
SVJedi-graph: improving the genotyping of close and overlapping structural variants with long reads using a variation graph,"Motivation:Structural variation (SV) is a class of genetic diversity whose importance is increasingly revealed by genome resequencing, especially with long-read technologies. One crucial problem when analyzing and comparing SVs in several individuals is their accurate genotyping, that is determining whether a described SV is present or absent in one sequenced individual, and if present, in how many copies. There are only a few methods dedicated to SV genotyping with long-read data, and all either suffer of a bias toward the reference allele by not representing equally all alleles, or have difficulties genotyping close or overlapping SVs due to a linear representation of the alleles.Results:We present SVJedi-graph, a novel method for SV genotyping that relies on a variation graph to represent in a single data structure all alleles of a set of SVs. The long reads are mapped on the variation graph and the resulting alignments that cover allele-specific edges in the graph are used to estimate the most likely genotype for each SV. Running SVJedi-graph on simulated sets of close and overlapping deletions showed that this graph model prevents the bias toward the reference alleles and allows maintaining high genotyping accuracy whatever the SV proximity, contrary to other state of the art genotypers. On the human gold standard HG002 dataset, SVJedi-graph obtained the best performances, genotyping 99.5% of the high confidence SV callset with an accuracy of 95% in less than 30 min.Availability and implementation:SVJedi-graph is distributed under an AGPL license and available on GitHub at https://github.com/SandraLouise/SVJedi-graph and as a BioConda package.",37387169,PMC10311344,10.1093/bioinformatics/btad237,0
Innovations and challenges in detecting long read overlaps: an evaluation of the state-of-the-art,"Identifying overlaps between error-prone long reads, specifically those from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) and Pacific Biosciences (PB), is essential for certain downstream applications, including error correction and de novo assembly. Though akin to the read-to-reference alignment problem, read-to-read overlap detection is a distinct problem that can benefit from specialized algorithms that perform efficiently and robustly on high error rate long reads. Here, we review the current state-of-the-art read-to-read overlap tools for error-prone long reads, including BLASR, DALIGNER, MHAP, GraphMap and Minimap. These specialized bioinformatics tools differ not just in their algorithmic designs and methodology, but also in their robustness of performance on a variety of datasets, time and memory efficiency and scalability. We highlight the algorithmic features of these tools, as well as their potential issues and biases when utilizing any particular method. To supplement our review of the algorithms, we benchmarked these tools, tracking their resource needs and computational performance, and assessed the specificity and precision of each. In the versions of the tools tested, we observed that Minimap is the most computationally efficient, specific and sensitive method on the ONT datasets tested; whereas GraphMap and DALIGNER are the most specific and sensitive methods on the tested PB datasets. The concepts surveyed may apply to future sequencing technologies, as scalability is becoming more relevant with increased sequencing throughput.Contact:cjustin@bcgsc.ca , ibirol@bcgsc.ca.Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",28003261,PMC5408847,10.1093/bioinformatics/btw811,13
Identification of stress-related genes by co-expression network analysis based on the improved turbot genome,"Turbot (Scophthalmus maximus), commercially important flatfish species, is widely cultivated in Europe and China. With the continuous expansion of the intensive breeding scale, turbot is exposed to various stresses, which greatly impedes the healthy development of turbot industry. Here, we present an improved high-quality chromosome-scale genome assembly of turbot using a combination of PacBio long-read and Illumina short-read sequencing technologies. The genome assembly spans 538.22 Mb comprising 27 contigs with a contig N50 size of 25.76 Mb. Annotation of the genome assembly identified 104.45 Mb repetitive sequences, 22,442 protein-coding genes and 3,345 ncRNAs. Moreover, a total of 345 stress responsive candidate genes were identified by gene co-expression network analysis based on 14 published stress-related RNA-seq datasets consisting of 165 samples. Significantly improved genome assembly and stress-related candidate gene pool will provide valuable resources for further research on turbot functional genome and stress response mechanism, as well as theoretical support for the development of molecular breeding technology for resistant turbot varieties.",35768602,PMC9243025,10.1038/s41597-022-01458-4,5
Chromosome-scale genome sequence assemblies of the 'Autumn Bliss' and 'Malling Jewel' cultivars of the highly heterozygous red raspberry (Rubus idaeus L.) derived from long-read Oxford Nanopore sequence data,"Red raspberry (Rubus idaeus L.) is an economically valuable soft-fruit species with a relatively small (~300 Mb) but highly heterozygous diploid (2n = 2x = 14) genome. Chromosome-scale genome sequences are a vital tool in unravelling the genetic complexity controlling traits of interest in crop plants such as red raspberry, as well as for functional genomics, evolutionary studies, and pan-genomics diversity studies. In this study, we developed genome sequences of a primocane fruiting variety ('Autumn Bliss') and a floricane variety ('Malling Jewel'). The use of long-read Oxford Nanopore Technologies sequencing data yielded long read lengths that permitted well resolved genome sequences for the two cultivars to be assembled. The de novo assemblies of 'Malling Jewel' and 'Autumn Bliss' contained 79 and 136 contigs respectively, and 263.0 Mb of the 'Autumn Bliss' and 265.5 Mb of the 'Malling Jewel' assembly could be anchored unambiguously to a previously published red raspberry genome sequence of the cultivar 'Anitra'. Single copy ortholog analysis (BUSCO) revealed high levels of completeness in both genomes sequenced, with 97.4% of sequences identified in 'Autumn Bliss' and 97.7% in 'Malling Jewel'. The density of repetitive sequence contained in the 'Autumn Bliss' and 'Malling Jewel' assemblies was significantly higher than in the previously published assembly and centromeric and telomeric regions were identified in both assemblies. A total of 42,823 protein coding regions were identified in the 'Autumn Bliss' assembly, whilst 43,027 were identified in the 'Malling Jewel' assembly. These chromosome-scale genome sequences represent an excellent genomics resource for red raspberry, particularly around the highly repetitive centromeric and telomeric regions of the genome that are less complete in the previously published 'Anitra' genome sequence.",37192177,PMC10187893,10.1371/journal.pone.0285756,1
Comprehensive evaluation of non-hybrid genome assembly tools for third-generation PacBio long-read sequence data,"Long reads obtained from third-generation sequencing platforms can help overcome the long-standing challenge of the de novo assembly of sequences for the genomic analysis of non-model eukaryotic organisms. Numerous long-read-aided de novo assemblies have been published recently, which exhibited superior quality of the assembled genomes in comparison with those achieved using earlier second-generation sequencing technologies. Evaluating assemblies is important in guiding the appropriate choice for specific research needs. In this study, we evaluated 10 long-read assemblers using a variety of metrics on Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) data sets from different taxonomic categories with considerable differences in genome size. The results allowed us to narrow down the list to a few assemblers that can be effectively applied to eukaryotic assembly projects. Moreover, we highlight how best to use limited genomic resources for effectively evaluating the genome assemblies of non-model organisms.",29112696,PMC6585154,10.1093/bib/bbx147,41
Haplotyping-Assisted Diploid Assembly and Variant Detection with Linked Reads,"Phasing is essential for determining the origins of each set of alleles in the whole-genome sequencing data of individuals. As such, it provides essential information for the causes of hereditary diseases and the sources of individual variability. Recent technical breakthroughs in linked-read (referred to as co-barcoding in other chapters of the book) and long-read sequencing and downstream analysis have brought the goal of accurate and complete phasing within reach. Here we review recent progress related to the assembly and phasing of personal genomes based on linked-reads and related applications. Motivated by current limitations in generating high-quality diploid assemblies and detecting variants, a new suite of software tools, Aquila, was developed to fully take advantage of linked-read sequencing technology. The overarching goal of Aquila is to exploit the strengths of linked-read technology including long-range connectivity and inherent phasing of variants for reference-assisted local de novo assembly at the whole-genome scale. The diploid nature of the assemblies facilitates detection and phasing of genetic variation, including single nucleotide variations (SNVs), small insertions and deletions (indels), and structural variants (SVs). An extension of Aquila, Aquila_stLFR, focuses on another newly developed linked-reads sequencing technology, single-tube long-fragment read (stLFR). AquilaSV, a region-based diploid assembly approach, is used to characterize structural variants and can achieve diploid assembly in one target region at a time. Lastly, we introduce HAPDeNovo, a program that exploits phasing information from linked-read sequencing to improve detection of de novo mutations. Use of these tools is expected to harness the advantages of linked-reads technology, improve phasing, and advance variant discovery.",36335499,,10.1007/978-1-0716-2819-5_11,0
Memory-Efficient Assembly Using Flye,"In the past decade, next-generation sequencing (NGS) enabled the generation of genomic data in a cost-effective, high-throughput manner. The most recent third-generation sequencing technologies produce longer reads; however, their error rates are much higher, which complicates the assembly process. This generates time- and space- demanding long-read assemblers. Moreover, the advances in these technologies have allowed portable and real-time DNA sequencing, enabling in-field analysis. In these scenarios, it becomes crucial to have more efficient solutions that can be executed in computers or mobile devices with minimum hardware requirements. We re-implemented an existing assembler devoted for long reads, more concretely Flye, using compressed data structures. We then compare our version with the original software using real datasets, and evaluate their performance in terms of memory requirements, execution speed, and energy consumption. The assembly results are not affected, as the core of the algorithm is maintained, but the usage of advanced compact data structures leads to improvements in memory consumption that range from 22% to 47% less space, and in the processing time, which range from being on a par up to decreases of 25%. These improvements also cause reductions in energy consumption of around 3-8%, with some datasets obtaining decreases up to 26%.",34469305,,10.1109/TCBB.2021.3108843,10
Expectations and blind spots for structural variation detection from long-read assemblies and short-read genome sequencing technologies,"Virtually all genome sequencing efforts in national biobanks, complex and Mendelian disease programs, and medical genetic initiatives are reliant upon short-read whole-genome sequencing (srWGS), which presents challenges for the detection of structural variants (SVs) relative to emerging long-read WGS (lrWGS) technologies. Given this ubiquity of srWGS in large-scale genomics initiatives, we sought to establish expectations for routine SV detection from this data type by comparison with lrWGS assembly, as well as to quantify the genomic properties and added value of SVs uniquely accessible to each technology. Analyses from the Human Genome Structural Variation Consortium (HGSVC) of three families captured ~11,000 SVs per genome from srWGS and ~25,000 SVs per genome from lrWGS assembly. Detection power and precision for SV discovery varied dramatically by genomic context and variant class: 9.7% of the current GRCh38 reference is defined by segmental duplication (SD) and simple repeat (SR), yet 91.4% of deletions that were specifically discovered by lrWGS localized to these regions. Across the remaining 90.3% of reference sequence, we observed extremely high (93.8%) concordance between technologies for deletions in these datasets. In contrast, lrWGS was superior for detection of insertions across all genomic contexts. Given that non-SD/SR sequences encompass 95.9% of currently annotated disease-associated exons, improved sensitivity from lrWGS to discover novel pathogenic deletions in these currently interpretable genomic regions is likely to be incremental. However, these analyses highlight the considerable added value of assembly-based lrWGS to create new catalogs of insertions and transposable elements, as well as disease-associated repeat expansions in genomic sequences that were previously recalcitrant to routine assessment.",33789087,PMC8206509,10.1016/j.ajhg.2021.03.014,47
Whole human genome 5'-mC methylation analysis using long read nanopore sequencing,"Methylation microarray and bisulphite sequencing are often used to study 5'-methylcytosine (5'-mC) modification of CpG dinucleotides in the human genome. Although both technologies produce trustworthy results, the evaluation of the methylation status of CpG sites suffers from the potential side effects of DNA modification by bisulphite and/or the ambiguity of mapping short reads in repetitive and highly homologous genomic regions, respectively. Nanopore sequencing is an attractive alternative for the study of 5'-mC since it allows sequencing of native DNA molecules, whereas the long reads produced by this technology help to increase the resolution of those genomic regions. In this work, we show that nanopore sequencing with 10X coverage depth, using DNA from a human cell line, produces 5'-mC methylation frequencies consistent with those obtained by 450k microarray, digital restriction enzyme analysis of methylation, and reduced representation bisulphite sequencing. High correlation between methylation frequencies obtained by nanopore sequencing and the other methodologies was also noticeable in either low or high GC content regions, including CpG islands and transcription start sites. We also showed that a minimum of five reads per CpG yields strong correlations (>0.89) in replicate nanopore sequencing runs and an almost uniform linearity of the methylation frequency variation between zero and one. Furthermore, nanopore sequencing was able to correctly display methylation frequency patterns based on genomic annotations of CpG regions. These results demonstrate that nanopore sequencing is a fast, robust, and reliable approach to the study of 5'-mC in the human genome with low coverage depth.",35856633,PMC9665147,10.1080/15592294.2022.2097473,1
Long Read Alignment with Parallel MapReduce Cloud Platform,"Genomic sequence alignment is an important technique to decode genome sequences in bioinformatics. Next-Generation Sequencing technologies produce genomic data of longer reads. Cloud platforms are adopted to address the problems arising from storage and analysis of large genomic data. Existing genes sequencing tools for cloud platforms predominantly consider short read gene sequences and adopt the Hadoop MapReduce framework for computation. However, serial execution of map and reduce phases is a problem in such systems. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce Burrows-Wheeler Aligner's Smith-Waterman Alignment on Parallel MapReduce (BWASW-PMR) cloud platform for long sequence alignment. The proposed cloud platform adopts a widely accepted and accurate BWA-SW algorithm for long sequence alignment. A custom MapReduce platform is developed to overcome the drawbacks of the Hadoop framework. A parallel execution strategy of the MapReduce phases and optimization of Smith-Waterman algorithm are considered. Performance evaluation results exhibit an average speed-up of 6.7 considering BWASW-PMR compared with the state-of-the-art Bwasw-Cloud. An average reduction of 30% in the map phase makespan is reported across all experiments comparing BWASW-PMR with Bwasw-Cloud. Optimization of Smith-Waterman results in reducing the execution time by 91.8%. The experimental study proves the efficiency of BWASW-PMR for aligning long genomic sequences on cloud platforms.",26839887,PMC4709609,10.1155/2015/807407,3
Unexpected diversity in the mobilome of a Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain isolated from a dental unit waterline revealed by SMRT Sequencing,"The Gram-negative bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa is found in several habitats, both natural and human-made, and is particularly known for its recurrent presence as a pathogen in the lungs of patients suffering from cystic fibrosis, a genetic disease. Given its clinical importance, several major studies have investigated the genomic adaptation of P. aeruginosa in lungs and its transition as acute infections become chronic. However, our knowledge about the diversity and adaptation of the P. aeruginosa genome to non-clinical environments is still fragmentary, in part due to the lack of accurate reference genomes of strains from the numerous environments colonized by the bacterium. Here, we used PacBio long-read technology to sequence the genome of PPF-1, a strain of P. aeruginosa isolated from a dental unit waterline. Generating this closed genome was an opportunity to investigate genomic features that are difficult to accurately study in a draft genome (contigs state). It was possible to shed light on putative genomic islands, some shared with other reference genomes, new prophages, and the complete content of insertion sequences. In addition, four different group II introns were also found, including two characterized here and not listed in the specialized group II intron database.",29546998,,10.1139/gen-2017-0239,1
"PRINCESS: comprehensive detection of haplotype resolved SNVs, SVs, and methylation","Long-read sequencing has been shown to have advantages in structural variation (SV) detection and methylation calling.

PRINCESS is a structured workflow that takes raw sequence reads and generates a fully phased SNV, SV, and methylation call set within a few hours. PRINCESS achieves high accuracy and long phasing even on low coverage datasets and can resolve repetitive, complex medical relevant genes that often escape detection.

LUCS: a high-resolution nucleic acid sequencing tool for accurate long-read analysis of individual DNA molecules,"Nucleic acid sequence analyses are fundamental to all aspects of biological research, spanning aging, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and cancer, as well as microbial and viral evolution. Over the past several years, significant improvements in DNA sequencing, including consensus sequence analysis, have proven invaluable for high-throughput studies. However, all current DNA sequencing platforms have limited utility for studies of complex mixtures or of individual long molecules, the latter of which is crucial to understanding evolution and consequences of single nucleotide variants and their combinations. Here we report a new technology termed LUCS (Long-molecule UMI-driven Consensus Sequencing), in which reads from third-generation sequencing are aggregated by unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) specific for each individual DNA molecule. This enables in-silico reconstruction of highly accurate consensus reads of each DNA molecule independent of other molecules in the sample. Additionally, use of two UMIs enables detection of artificial recombinants (chimeras). As proof of concept, we show that application of LUCS to assessment of mitochondrial genomes in complex mixtures from single cells was associated with an error rate of 1X10-4errors/nucleotide. Thus, LUCS represents a major step forward in DNA sequencing that offers high-throughput capacity and high-accuracy reads in studies of long DNA templates and nucleotide variants in heterogenous samples.",32345770,PMC7202536,10.18632/aging.103171,2
A chromosome-scale reference genome for Spironucleus salmonicida,"Spironucleus salmonicida is a diplomonad causing systemic infection in salmon. The first S. salmonicida genome assembly was published 2014 and has been a valuable reference genome in protist research. However, the genome assembly is fragmented without assignment of the sequences to chromosomes. In our previous Giardia genome study, we have shown how a fragmented genome assembly can be improved with long-read sequencing technology complemented with optical maps. Combining Pacbio long-read sequencing technology and optical maps, we are presenting here this new S. salmonicida genome assembly in nine near-complete chromosomes with only three internal gaps at long repeats. This new genome assembly is not only more complete sequence-wise but also more complete at annotation level, providing more details into gene families, gene organizations and chromosomal structure. This near-complete reference genome will aid comparative genomics at chromosomal level, and serve as a valuable resource for the diplomonad community and protist research.",36153341,PMC9509377,10.1038/s41597-022-01703-w,1
Chromosome-Length Haplotypes with StrandPhaseR and Strand-seq,"Dense local haplotypes can now readily be extracted from long-read or droplet-based sequence data. However, these methods struggle to combine subchromosomal haplotype blocks into global chromosome-length haplotypes. Strand-seq is a single cell sequencing technique that uses read orientation to capture sparse global phase information by sequencing only one of two DNA strands for each parental homolog. In combination with dense local haplotypes from other technologies, Strand-seq data can be used to obtain complete chromosome-length phase information. In this chapter, we run the R package StrandPhaseR to phase SNVs using publicly available sequence data for sample HG005 of the Genome in a Bottle project.",36335500,,10.1007/978-1-0716-2819-5_12,3
Nanopore Sequencing Resolves Elusive Long Tandem-Repeat Regions in Mitochondrial Genomes,"Long non-coding, tandem-repetitive regions in mitochondrial (mt) genomes of many metazoans have been notoriously difficult to characterise accurately using conventional sequencing methods. Here, we show how the use of a third-generation (long-read) sequencing and informatic approach can overcome this problem. We employed Oxford Nanopore technology to sequence genomic DNAs from a pool of adult worms of the carcinogenic parasite,Schistosoma haematobium, and used an informatic workflow to define the complete mt non-coding region(s). Using long-read data of high coverage, we defined six dominant mt genomes of 33.4 kb to 22.6 kb. Although no variation was detected in the order or lengths of the protein-coding genes, there was marked length (18.5 kb to 7.6 kb) and structural variation in the non-coding region, raising questions about the evolution and function of what might be a control region that regulates mt transcription and/or replication. The discovery here of the largest tandem-repetitive, non-coding region (18.5 kb) in a metazoan organism also raises a question about the completeness of some of the mt genomes of animals reported to date, and stimulates further explorations using a Nanopore-informatic workflow.",33670420,PMC7918261,10.3390/ijms22041811,15
Information-optimal genome assembly via sparse read-overlap graphs,"Motivation:In the context of third-generation long-read sequencing technologies, read-overlap-based approaches are expected to play a central role in the assembly step. A fundamental challenge in assembling from a read-overlap graph is that the true sequence corresponds to a Hamiltonian path on the graph, and, under most formulations, the assembly problem becomes NP-hard, restricting practical approaches to heuristics. In this work, we avoid this seemingly fundamental barrier by first setting the computational complexity issue aside, and seeking an algorithm that targets information limits In particular, we consider a basic feasibility question: when does the set of reads contain enough information to allow unambiguous reconstruction of the true sequence?Results:Based on insights from this information feasibility question, we present an algorithm-the Not-So-Greedy algorithm-to construct a sparse read-overlap graph. Unlike most other assembly algorithms, Not-So-Greedy comes with a performance guarantee: whenever information feasibility conditions are satisfied, the algorithm reduces the assembly problem to an Eulerian path problem on the resulting graph, and can thus be solved in linear time. In practice, this theoretical guarantee translates into assemblies of higher quality. Evaluations on both simulated reads from real genomes and a PacBio Escherichia coli K12 dataset demonstrate that Not-So-Greedy compares favorably with standard string graph approaches in terms of accuracy of the resulting read-overlap graph and contig N50.Availability:Available at github.com/samhykim/nsgContact:courtade@eecs.berkeley.edu or dntse@stanford.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",27587667,,10.1093/bioinformatics/btw450,7
Emerging Opportunities to Study Mobile Element Insertions and Their Source Elements in an Expanding Universe of Sequenced Human Genomes,"Three mobile element classes, namelyAlu, LINE-1 (L1), and SVA elements, remain actively mobile in human genomes and continue to produce new mobile element insertions (MEIs). Historically, MEIs have been discovered and studied using several methods, including: (1) Southern blots, (2) PCR (including PCR display), and (3) the detection of MEI copies from young subfamilies. We are now entering a new phase of MEI discovery where these methods are being replaced by whole genome sequencing and bioinformatics analysis to discover novel MEIs. We expect that the universe of sequenced human genomes will continue to expand rapidly over the next several years, both with short-read and long-read technologies. These resources will provide unprecedented opportunities to discover MEIs and study their impact on human traits and diseases. They also will allow the MEI community to discover and study the source elements that produce these new MEIs, which will facilitate our ability to study source element regulation in various tissue contexts and disease states. This, in turn, will allow us to better understand MEI mutagenesis in humans and the impact of this mutagenesis on human biology.",37895272,PMC10606232,10.3390/genes14101923,1
Large-Scale Complete Sequencing and Haplotyping of 1-10 kb DNA Molecules Using Short Massively Parallel Reads,"In this chapter, we describe a simple, low-cost method for making many copies of a single DNA molecule (1-10 kb in length) as a concatemer on a long DNA strand. This can enable applications requiring high-quality contiguous sequence and haplotype data from long single DNA molecules at large scale.",36335492,,10.1007/978-1-0716-2819-5_4,0
Evaluation of taxonomic classification and profiling methods for long-read shotgun metagenomic sequencing datasets,"Background:Long-read shotgun metagenomic sequencing is gaining in popularity and offers many advantages over short-read sequencing. The higher information content in long reads is useful for a variety of metagenomics analyses, including taxonomic classification and profiling. The development of long-read specific tools for taxonomic classification is accelerating, yet there is a lack of information regarding their relative performance. Here, we perform a critical benchmarking study using 11 methods, including five methods designed specifically for long reads. We applied these tools to several mock community datasets generated using Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) HiFi or Oxford Nanopore Technology sequencing, and evaluated their performance based on read utilization, detection metrics, and relative abundance estimates.Results:Our results show that long-read classifiers generally performed best. Several short-read classification and profiling methods produced many false positives (particularly at lower abundances), required heavy filtering to achieve acceptable precision (at the cost of reduced recall), and produced inaccurate abundance estimates. By contrast, two long-read methods (BugSeq, MEGAN-LR & DIAMOND) and one generalized method (sourmash) displayed high precision and recall without any filtering required. Furthermore, in the PacBio HiFi datasets these methods detected all species down to the 0.1% abundance level with high precision. Some long-read methods, such as MetaMaps and MMseqs2, required moderate filtering to reduce false positives to resemble the precision and recall of the top-performing methods. We found read quality affected performance for methods relying on protein prediction or exact k-mer matching, and these methods performed better with PacBio HiFi datasets. We also found that long-read datasets with a large proportion of shorter reads (< 2 kb length) resulted in lower precision and worse abundance estimates, relative to length-filtered datasets. Finally, for classification methods, we found that the long-read datasets produced significantly better results than short-read datasets, demonstrating clear advantages for long-read metagenomic sequencing.Conclusions:Our critical assessment of available methods provides best-practice recommendations for current research using long reads and establishes a baseline for future benchmarking studies.",36513983,PMC9749362,10.1186/s12859-022-05103-0,12
pycoMeth: a toolbox for differential methylation testing from Nanopore methylation calls,"We present pycoMeth, a toolbox to store, manage and analyze DNA methylation calls from long-read sequencing data obtained using the Oxford Nanopore Technologies sequencing platform. Building on a novel, rapid-access, read-level and reference-anchored methylation storage format MetH5, we propose efficient algorithms for haplotype aware, multi-sample consensus segmentation and differential methylation testing. We show that MetH5 is more efficient than existing solutions for storing Oxford Nanopore Technologies methylation calls, and carry out benchmarking for pycoMeth segmentation and differential methylation testing, demonstrating increased performance and sensitivity compared to existing solutions designed for short-read methylation data.",37081487,PMC10120131,10.1186/s13059-023-02917-w,4
Going the Distance: Optimizing RNA-Seq Strategies for Transcriptomic Analysis of Complex Viral Genomes,"Transcriptome profiling has become routine in studies of many biological processes. However, the favored approaches such as short-read Illumina RNA sequencing are giving way to long-read sequencing platforms better suited to interrogating the complex transcriptomes typical of many RNA and DNA viruses. Here, we provide a guide-tailored to molecular virologists-to the ins and outs of viral transcriptome sequencing and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the major RNA sequencing technologies as tools to analyze the abundance and diversity of the viral transcripts made during infection.",30305358,PMC6288342,10.1128/JVI.01342-18,24
Characterization and evolutionary dynamics of complex regions in eukaryotic genomes,"Complex regions in eukaryotic genomes are typically characterized by duplications of chromosomal stretches that often include one or more genes repeated in a tandem array or in relatively close proximity. Nevertheless, the repetitive nature of these regions, together with the often high sequence identity among repeats, have made complex regions particularly recalcitrant to proper molecular characterization, often being misassembled or completely absent in genome assemblies. This limitation has prevented accurate functional and evolutionary analyses of these regions. This is becoming increasingly relevant as evidence continues to support a central role for complex genomic regions in explaining human disease, developmental innovations, and ecological adaptations across phyla. With the advent of long-read sequencing technologies and suitable assemblers, the development of algorithms that can accommodate sample heterozygosity, and the adoption of a pangenomic-like view of these regions, accurate reconstructions of complex regions are now within reach. These reconstructions will finally allow for accurate functional and evolutionary studies of complex genomic regions, underlying the generation of genotype-phenotype maps of unprecedented resolution.",30810961,,10.1007/s11427-018-9458-0,6
Characterization of the stability and dynamics of Tn6330 in an Escherichia coli strain by nanopore long reads,"Background:The mcr-1 gene has been widely reported in both bacterial chromosomes and plasmids, while its stability in these genetic materials is not well understood.Objectives:Our aim was to characterize the stability and dynamics of Tn6330 elements in both a plasmid and the chromosome in a single bacterial population.Methods:Plasmid-borne and chromosomal Tn6330 were characterized by PCR, conjugation, S1-PFGE, stability assay, single-molecule long-read sequencing and bioinformatics analysis.Results:Tn6330 was simultaneously detected in both a plasmid and the chromosome of a clinical Escherichia coli strain. The plasmid was found to comprise the IncFIB replicon and a phage-like replicon, as well as two integrons that harboured various mobile elements and resistance genes including mcr-1, floR, blaTEM-1b and strAB. Both plasmid-borne and chromosomal Tn6330 transposons could be re-organized into a circular intermediate that played a role in transmission of the mcr-1 gene. Tn6330 was found to be very stable in both the plasmid and chromosome after 30 passages of 12 h with or without colistin selective pressure. The decayed structure of Tn6330 in the genuine single DNA molecules of bacterial populations, although occurring at a very low frequency, could be detected for the first time, in which Tn6330 was degraded into a single ISApl1 element.Conclusions:Long-read sequencing technology is a good tool to study the evolution and stability of genetic elements in bacteria. The ultrastability of an mcr-1-encoding element in a bacterial plasmid and chromosome renders it unlikely to be eradicated quickly by the reduced use of colistin, and factors leading to the frequent demise of Tn6330 warrant further studies.",30927434,,10.1093/jac/dkz117,10
Evaluation of GRCh38 and de novo haploid genome assemblies demonstrates the enduring quality of the reference assembly,"The human reference genome assembly plays a central role in nearly all aspects of today's basic and clinical research. GRCh38 is the first coordinate-changing assembly update since 2009; it reflects the resolution of roughly 1000 issues and encompasses modifications ranging from thousands of single base changes to megabase-scale path reorganizations, gap closures, and localization of previously orphaned sequences. We developed a new approach to sequence generation for targeted base updates and used data from new genome mapping technologies and single haplotype resources to identify and resolve larger assembly issues. For the first time, the reference assembly contains sequence-based representations for the centromeres. We also expanded the number of alternate loci to create a reference that provides a more robust representation of human population variation. We demonstrate that the updates render the reference an improved annotation substrate, alter read alignments in unchanged regions, and impact variant interpretation at clinically relevant loci. We additionally evaluated a collection of new de novo long-read haploid assemblies and conclude that although the new assemblies compare favorably to the reference with respect to continuity, error rate, and gene completeness, the reference still provides the best representation for complex genomic regions and coding sequences. We assert that the collected updates in GRCh38 make the newer assembly a more robust substrate for comprehensive analyses that will promote our understanding of human biology and advance our efforts to improve health.",28396521,PMC5411779,10.1101/gr.213611.116,435
Fullyin vitroiterative construction of a 24 kb-long artificial DNA sequence to store digital information,"In the absence of a DNA template, theab initioproduction of long double-stranded DNA molecules of predefined sequences is particularly challenging. The DNA synthesis step remains a bottleneck for many applications such as functional assessment of ancestral genes, analysis of alternative splicing or DNA-based data storage. In this report we propose a fullyin vitroprotocol to generate very long double-stranded DNA molecules starting from commercially available short DNA blocks in less than 3 days using Golden Gate assembly. This innovative application allowed us to streamline the process to produce a 24 kb-long DNA molecule storing part oftheDeclaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizenof 1789 .

Plant Single-Cell/Nucleus RNA-seq Workflow,"Single-cell transcriptomics technologies allow researchers to investigate how individual cells, in complex multicellular organisms, differentially use their common genomic DNA. In plant biology, these technologies were recently applied to reveal the transcriptomes of various plant cells isolated from different organs and different species and in response to environmental stresses. These first studies support the potential of single-cell transcriptomics technology to decipher the biological function of plant cells, their developmental programs, cell-type-specific gene networks, programs controlling plant cell response to environmental stresses, etc. In this chapter, we provide information regarding the critical steps and important information to consider when developing an experimental design in plant single-cell biology. We also describe the current status of bioinformatics tools used to analyze single-cell RNA-seq datasets and how additional emerging technologies such as spatial transcriptomics and long-read sequencing technologies will provide additional information on the differential use of the genome by plant cells.",36495448,,10.1007/978-1-0716-2756-3_6,0
Sample and Library Preparation for PacBio Long-Read Sequencing in Grapevine,"PacBio long-read sequencing is a third-generation technology that generates long reads up to 20 kilobases (kb), unlike short-read sequencing instruments that produce up to 600 bases. Long-read sequencing is particularly advantageous in higher organisms, such as humans and plants, where repetitive regions in the genome are more abundant. The PacBio long-read sequencing uses a single molecule, real-time approach where the SMRT cells contain several zero-mode waveguides (ZMWs). Each ZMW contains a single DNA molecule bound by a DNA polymerase. All ZMWs are flushed with deoxy nucleotides with a fluorophore specific to each nucleotide. As the sequencing proceeds, the detector detects the wavelength of the fluorescence and the nucleotides are read in real-time. This chapter describes the sample and library preparation for PacBio long-read sequencing for grapevine.",38656490,,10.1007/978-1-0716-3778-4_12,0
Ultra-long Read Sequencing for Whole Genomic DNA Analysis,"Third generation single-molecule DNA sequencing technologies offer significantly longer read length that can facilitate the assembly of complex genomes and analysis of complex structural variants. Nanopore platforms perform single-molecule sequencing by directly measuring the current changes mediated by DNA passage through the pores and can generate hundreds of kilobase (kb) reads with minimal capital cost. This platform has been adopted by many researchers for a variety of applications. Achieving longer sequencing read lengths is the most critical factor to leverage the value of nanopore sequencing platforms. To generate ultra-long reads, special consideration is required to avoid DNA breakages and gain efficiency to generate productive sequencing templates. Here, we provide the detailed protocol of ultra-long DNA sequencing including high molecular weight (HMW) DNA extraction from fresh or frozen cells, library construction by mechanical shearing or transposase fragmentation, and sequencing on a nanopore device. From 20-25 µg of HMW DNA, the method can achieve N50 read length of 50-70 kb with mechanical shearing and N50 of 90-100 kb read length with transposase mediated fragmentation. The protocol can be applied to DNA extracted from mammalian cells to perform whole genome sequencing for the detection of structural variants and genome assembly. Additional improvements on the DNA extraction and enzymatic reactions will further increase the read length and expand its utility.",30933081,,10.3791/58954,11
A chromosome-scale reference genome for Giardia intestinalis WB,"Giardia intestinalis is a protist causing diarrhea in humans. The first G. intestinalis genome, from the WB isolate, was published more than ten years ago, and has been widely used as the reference genome for Giardia research. However, the genome is fragmented, thus hindering research at the chromosomal level. We re-sequenced the Giardia genome with Pacbio long-read sequencing technology and obtained a new reference genome, which was assembled into near-complete chromosomes with only four internal gaps at long repeats. This new genome is not only more complete but also better annotated at both structural and functional levels, providing more details about gene families, gene organizations and chromosomal structure. This near-complete reference genome will be a valuable resource for the Giardia community and protist research. It also showcases how a fragmented genome can be improved with long-read sequencing technology completed with optical maps.",32019935,PMC7000408,10.1038/s41597-020-0377-y,32
Multicolor Whole-Genome Mapping in Nanochannels for Genetic Analysis,"Analysis of structural variations (SVs) is important to understand mutations underlying genetic disorders and pathogenic conditions. However, characterizing SVs using short-read, high-throughput sequencing technology is difficult. Although long-read sequencing technologies are being increasingly employed in characterizing SVs, their low throughput and high costs discourage widespread adoption. Sequence motif-based optical mapping in nanochannels is useful in whole-genome mapping and SV detection, but it is not possible to precisely locate the breakpoints or estimate the copy numbers. We present here a universal multicolor mapping strategy in nanochannels combining conventional sequence-motif labeling system with Cas9-mediated target-specific labeling of any 20-base sequences (20mers) to create custom labels and detect new features. The sequence motifs are labeled with green fluorophores and the 20mers are labeled with red fluorophores. Using this strategy, it is possible to not only detect the SVs but also utilize custom labels to interrogate the features not accessible to motif-labeling, locate breakpoints, and precisely estimate copy numbers of genomic repeats. We validated our approach by quantifying the D4Z4 copy numbers, a known biomarker for facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) and estimating the telomere length, a clinical biomarker for assessing disease risk factors in aging-related diseases and malignant cancers. We also demonstrate the application of our methodology in discovering transposable long non-interspersed Elements 1 (LINE-1) insertions across the whole genome.",34232611,PMC9705121,10.1021/acs.analchem.1c01373,4
Extraction of High Molecular Weight DNA from Fungal Rust Spores for Long Read Sequencing,"Wheat rust fungi are complex organisms with a complete life cycle that involves two different host plants and five different spore types. During the asexual infection cycle on wheat, rusts produce massive amounts of dikaryotic urediniospores. These spores are dikaryotic (two nuclei) with each nucleus containing one haploid genome. This dikaryotic state is likely to contribute to their evolutionary success, making them some of the major wheat pathogens globally. Despite this, most published wheat rust genomes are highly fragmented and contain very little haplotype-specific sequence information. Current long-read sequencing technologies hold great promise to provide more contiguous and haplotype-phased genome assemblies. Long reads are able to span repetitive regions and phase structural differences between the haplomes. This increased genome resolution enables the identification of complex loci and the study of genome evolution beyond simple nucleotide polymorphisms. Long-read technologies require pure high molecular weight DNA as an input for sequencing. Here, we describe a DNA extraction protocol for rust spores that yields pure double-stranded DNA molecules with molecular weight of >50 kilo-base pairs (kbp). The isolated DNA is of sufficient purity for PacBio long-read sequencing, but may require additional purification for other sequencing technologies such as Nanopore and 10× Genomics.",28856640,,10.1007/978-1-4939-7249-4_5,13
Long-read RNA sequencing reveals widespread sex-specific alternative splicing in threespine stickleback fish,"Alternate isoforms are important contributors to phenotypic diversity across eukaryotes. Although short-read RNA-sequencing has increased our understanding of isoform diversity, it is challenging to accurately detect full-length transcripts, preventing the identification of many alternate isoforms. Long-read sequencing technologies have made it possible to sequence full-length alternative transcripts, accurately characterizing alternative splicing events, alternate transcription start and end sites, and differences in UTR regions. Here, we use Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) long-read RNA-sequencing (Iso-Seq) to examine the transcriptomes of five organs in threespine stickleback fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus), a widely used genetic model species. The threespine stickleback fish has a refined genome assembly in which gene annotations are based on short-read RNA sequencing and predictions from coding sequence of other species. This suggests some of the existing annotations may be inaccurate or alternative transcripts may not be fully characterized. Using Iso-Seq we detected thousands of novel isoforms, indicating many isoforms are absent in the current Ensembl gene annotations. In addition, we refined many of the existing annotations within the genome. We noted many improperly positioned transcription start sites that were refined with long-read sequencing. The Iso-Seq-predicted transcription start sites were more accurate and verified through ATAC-seq. We also detected many alternative splicing events between sexes and across organs. We found a substantial number of genes in both somatic and gonadal samples that had sex-specific isoforms. Our study highlights the power of long-read sequencing to study the complexity of transcriptomes, greatly improving genomic resources for the threespine stickleback fish.",34131005,PMC8327910,10.1101/gr.274282.120,9
Long-Read-Based Genome Assembly Reveals Numerous Endogenous Viral Elements in the Green Algal Bacterivore Cymbomonas tetramitiformis,"The marine tetraflagellate Cymbomonas tetramitiformis has drawn attention as an early diverging green alga that uses a phago-mixotrophic mode of nutrition (i.e., the ability to derive nourishment from both photosynthesis and bacterial prey). The Cymbomonas nuclear genome was sequenced previously, but due to the exclusive use of short-read (Illumina) data, the assembly suffered from missing a large proportion of the genome's repeat regions. For this study, we generated Oxford Nanopore long-read and additional short-read Illumina data and performed a hybrid assembly that significantly improved the total assembly size and contiguity. Numerous endogenous viral elements were identified in the repeat regions of the new assembly. These include the complete genome of a giant Algavirales virus along with many genomes of integrated Polinton-like viruses (PLVs) from two groups: Gezel-like PLVs and a novel group of prasinophyte-specific PLVs. The integrated ∼400 kb genome of the giant Algavirales virus is the first account of the association of the uncultured viral family AG_03 with green algae. The complete PLV genomes from C. tetramitiformis ranged between 15 and 25 kb in length and showed a diverse gene content. In addition, heliorhodopsin gene-containing repeat elements of putative mirusvirus origin were identified. These results illustrate past (and possibly ongoing) multiple alga-virus interactions that accompanied the genome evolution of C. tetramitiformis.",37883709,PMC10675990,10.1093/gbe/evad194,1
Pushing the limits of HiFi assemblies reveals centromere diversity between two Arabidopsis thaliana genomes,"Although long-read sequencing can often enable chromosome-level reconstruction of genomes, it is still unclear how one can routinely obtain gapless assemblies. In the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, other than the reference accession Col-0, all other accessions de novo assembled with long-reads until now have used PacBio continuous long reads (CLR). Although these assemblies sometimes achieved chromosome-arm level contigs, they inevitably broke near the centromeres, excluding megabases of DNA from analysis in pan-genome projects. Since PacBio high-fidelity (HiFi) reads circumvent the high error rate of CLR technologies, albeit at the expense of read length, we compared a CLR assembly of accession Eyach15-2 to HiFi assemblies of the same sample. The use of five different assemblers starting from subsampled data allowed us to evaluate the impact of coverage and read length. We found that centromeres and rDNA clusters are responsible for 71% of contig breaks in the CLR scaffolds, while relatively short stretches of GA/TC repeats are at the core of >85% of the unfilled gaps in our best HiFi assemblies. Since the HiFi technology consistently enabled us to reconstruct gapless centromeres and 5S rDNA clusters, we demonstrate the value of the approach by comparing these previously inaccessible regions of the genome between the Eyach15-2 accession and the reference accession Col-0.",36453992,PMC9757041,10.1093/nar/gkac1115,14
Minimizer-space de Bruijn graphs: Whole-genome assembly of long reads in minutes on a personal computer,"DNA sequencing data continue to progress toward longer reads with increasingly lower sequencing error rates. Here, we define an algorithmic approach, mdBG, that makes use of minimizer-space de Bruijn graphs to enable long-read genome assembly. mdBG achieves orders-of-magnitude improvement in both speed and memory usage over existing methods without compromising accuracy. A human genome is assembled in under 10 min using 8 cores and 10 GB RAM, and 60 Gbp of metagenome reads are assembled in 4 min using 1 GB RAM. In addition, we constructed a minimizer-space de Bruijn graph-based representation of 661,405 bacterial genomes, comprising 16 million nodes and 45 million edges, and successfully search it for anti-microbial resistance (AMR) genes in 12 min. We expect our advances to be essential to sequence analysis, given the rise of long-read sequencing in genomics, metagenomics, and pangenomics.

Transcriptome-wide analysis of a baculovirus using nanopore sequencing,"Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) is a prototypic baculovirus infecting specific insects. AcMNPV contains a large double-stranded DNA genome encoding a complex transcriptome. This virus has a widespread application as a vector for the expression of heterologous proteins. Here, we present a dataset, derived from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) long-read sequencing platform. We used both cDNA and direct RNA sequencing techniques. The dataset contains 520,310 AcMNPV and 1,309,481 host cell reads using the regular cDNA-sequencing method of ONT technique, whereas altogether 6,456 reads were produced by using direct RNA-sequencing. We also used a Cap-selection protocol for certain ONT samples, and obtained 2,568,669 reads by using this method. The raw reads were aligned to the AcMNPV reference genome (KM667940.1). Here, we openly released the 'static' and the dynamic transcript catalogue of AcMNPV. This dataset can be used for deep analyses of the transcriptomic and epitranscriptomic patterns of the AcMNPV and the host cell. The data can be also useful for the validation of different bioinformatics software packages and analysis tools.",30512018,PMC6278695,10.1038/sdata.2018.276,6
FastqCLS: a FASTQ compressor for long-read sequencing via read reordering using a novel scoring model,"Motivation:Over the past decades, vast amounts of genome sequencing data have been produced, requiring an enormous level of storage capacity. The time and resources needed to store and transfer such data cause bottlenecks in genome sequencing analysis. To resolve this issue, various compression techniques have been proposed to reduce the size of original FASTQ raw sequencing data, but these remain suboptimal. Long-read sequencing has become dominant in genomics, whereas most existing compression methods focus on short-read sequencing only.Results:We designed a compression algorithm based on read reordering using a novel scoring model for reducing FASTQ file size with no information loss. We integrated all data processing steps into a software package called FastqCLS and provided it as a Docker image for ease of installation and execution to help users easily install and run. We compared our method with existing major FASTQ compression tools using benchmark datasets. We also included new long-read sequencing data in this validation. As a result, FastqCLS outperformed in terms of compression ratios for storing long-read sequencing data.Availability and implementation:FastqCLS can be downloaded from https://github.com/krlucete/FastqCLS.Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",34623374,,10.1093/bioinformatics/btab696,2
Opportunities and tradeoffs in single-cell transcriptomic technologies,"Recent technological and algorithmic advances enable single-cell transcriptomic analysis with remarkable depth and breadth. Nonetheless, a persistent challenge is the compromise between the ability to profile high numbers of cells and the achievement of full-length transcript coverage. Currently, the field is progressing and developing new and creative solutions that improve cellular throughput, gene detection sensitivity and full-length transcript capture. Furthermore, long-read sequencing approaches for single-cell transcripts are breaking frontiers that have previously blocked full transcriptome characterization.

"Hackflex: low-cost, high-throughput, Illumina Nextera Flex library construction","We developed a low-cost method for the production of Illumina-compatible sequencing libraries that allows up to 14 times more libraries for high-throughput Illumina sequencing to be generated for the same cost. We call this new method Hackflex. The quality of library preparation was tested by constructing libraries fromEscherichia coliMG1655 genomic DNA using either Hackflex, standard Nextera Flex (recently renamed as Illumina DNA Prep) or a variation of standard Nextera Flex in which the bead-linked transposase is diluted prior to use. In order to test the library quality for genomes with a higher and a lower G+C content, library construction methods were also tested onPseudomonas aeruginosaPAO1 andStaphylococcus aureusATCC 25923,respectively. We demonstrated that Hackflex can produce high-quality libraries and yields a highly uniform coverage, equivalent to the standard Nextera Flex kit. We show that strongly size-selected libraries produce sufficient yield and complexity to supportde novomicrobial genome assembly, and that assemblies of the large-insert libraries can be much more contiguous than standard libraries without strong size selection. We introduce a new set of sample barcodes that are distinct from standard Illumina barcodes, enabling Hackflex samples to be multiplexed with samples barcoded using standard Illumina kits. Using Hackflex, we were able to achieve a per-sample reagent cost for library prep of A$7.22 (Australian dollars) (US $5.60; UK £3.87, £1=A$1.87), which is 9.87 times lower than the standard Nextera Flex protocol at advertised retail price. An additional simple modification and further simplification of the protocol by omitting the wash step enables a further price reduction to reach an overall 14-fold cost saving. This method will allow researchers to construct more libraries within a given budget, thereby yielding more data and facilitating research programmes where sequencing large numbers of libraries is beneficial.",35014949,PMC8914357,10.1099/mgen.0.000744,27
Long Reads Are Revolutionizing 20 Years of Insect Genome Sequencing,"The first insect genome assembly (Drosophila melanogaster) was published two decades ago. Today, nuclear genome assemblies are available for a staggering 601 insect species representing 20 orders. In this study, we analyzed the most-contiguous assembly for each species and provide a ""state-of-the-field"" perspective, emphasizing taxonomic representation, assembly quality, gene completeness, and sequencing technologies. Relative to species richness, genomic efforts have been biased toward four orders (Diptera, Hymenoptera, Collembola, and Phasmatodea), Coleoptera are underrepresented, and 11 orders still lack a publicly available genome assembly. The average insect genome assembly is 439.2 Mb in length with 87.5% of single-copy benchmarking genes intact. Most notable has been the impact of long-read sequencing; assemblies that incorporate long reads are ∼48× more contiguous than those that do not. We offer four recommendations as we collectively continue building insect genome resources: 1) seek better integration between independent research groups and consortia, 2) balance future sampling between filling taxonomic gaps and generating data for targeted questions, 3) take advantage of long-read sequencing technologies, and 4) expand and improve gene annotations.",34152413,PMC8358217,10.1093/gbe/evab138,39
Long-read sequencing reveals intra-species tolerance of substantial structural variations and new subtelomere formation inC. elegans,"Long-read sequencing technologies have contributed greatly to comparative genomics among species and can also be applied to study genomics within a species. In this study, to determine how substantial genomic changes are generated and tolerated within a species, we sequenced aC. elegansstrain, CB4856, which is one of the most genetically divergent strains compared to the N2 reference strain. For this comparison, we used the Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) RSII platform (80×, N50 read length 11.8 kb) and generated de novo genome assembly to the level of pseudochromosomes containing 76 contigs (N50 contig = 2.8 Mb). We identified structural variations that affected as many as 2694 genes, most of which are at chromosome arms. Subtelomeric regions contained the most extensive genomic rearrangements, which even created new subtelomeres in some cases. The subtelomere structure of Chromosome VR implies that ancestral telomere damage was repaired by alternative lengthening of telomeres even in the presence of a functional telomerase gene and that a new subtelomere was formed by break-induced replication. Our study demonstrates that substantial genomic changes including structural variations and new subtelomeres can be tolerated within a species, and that these changes may accumulate genetic diversity within a species.",31123081,PMC6581047,10.1101/gr.246082.118,33
IDP-denovo: de novo transcriptome assembly and isoform annotation by hybrid sequencing,"Motivation:In the past years, the long read (LR) sequencing technologies, such as Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore Technologies, have been demonstrated to substantially improve the quality of genome assembly and transcriptome characterization. Compared to the high cost of genome assembly by LR sequencing, it is more affordable to generate LRs for transcriptome characterization. That is, when informative transcriptome LR data are available without a high-quality genome, a method for de novo transcriptome assembly and annotation is of high demand.Results:Without a reference genome, IDP-denovo performs de novo transcriptome assembly, isoform annotation and quantification by integrating the strengths of LRs and short reads. Using the GM12878 human data as a gold standard, we demonstrated that IDP-denovo had superior sensitivity of transcript assembly and high accuracy of isoform annotation. In addition, IDP-denovo outputs two abundance indices to provide a comprehensive expression profile of genes/isoforms. IDP-denovo represents a robust approach for transcriptome assembly, isoform annotation and quantification for non-model organism studies. Applying IDP-denovo to a non-model organism, Dendrobium officinale, we discovered a number of novel genes and novel isoforms that were not reported by the existing annotation library. These results reveal the high diversity of gene isoforms in D.officinale, which was not reported in the existing annotation library.Availability and implementation:The dataset of Dendrobium officinale used/analyzed during the current study has been deposited in SRA, with accession code SRP094520. IDP-denovo is available for download at www.healthcare.uiowa.edu/labs/au/IDP-denovo/.Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",29905763,PMC6022631,10.1093/bioinformatics/bty098,20
From words to complete phrases: insight into single-cell isoforms using short and long reads,"The profiling of gene expression patterns to glean biological insights from single cells has become commonplace over the last few years. However, this approach overlooks the transcript contents that can differ between individual cells and cell populations. In this review, we describe early work in the field of single-cell short-read sequencing as well as full-length isoforms from single cells. We then describe recent work in single-cell long-read sequencing wherein some transcript elements have been observed to work in tandem. Based on earlier work in bulk tissue, we motivate the study of combination patterns of other RNA variables. Given that we are still blind to some aspects of isoform biology, we suggest possible future avenues such as CRISPR screens which can further illuminate the function of RNA variables in distinct cell populations.",37314295,PMC10807471,10.1080/21541264.2023.2213514,5
Functional Annotation of Custom Transcriptomes,"Many eukaryotic genes can give rise to different alternative transcripts depending on stage of development, cell type, and physiological cues. Current transcriptome-wide sequencing technologies highlight the remarkable extent of this regulation in metazoans and allow for RNA isoforms to be profiled in increasingly small biological samples and with a growing confidence. Understanding biological functions of sample-specific transcripts is a major challenge in genomics and RNA processing fields. Here we describe simple bioinformatics workflows that facilitate this task by streamlining reference-guided annotation of novel transcripts. A key part of our protocol is the R package factR that rapidly matches custom-assembled transcripts to their likely host genes, deduces the sequence and domain structure of novel protein products, and predicts sensitivity of newly identified RNA isoforms to nonsense-mediated decay.",35895263,,10.1007/978-1-0716-2521-7_9,1
Nanopore/Illumina Hybrid Whole-Genome Sequence Resource ofPlenodomus lindquistiiStrain US01 Infecting Sunflower,"Plenodomus lindquistii(basionym:Leptosphaeria lindquistii) is the most prevalent fungus pathogen causing the black stem disease in sunflower. To date, only one whole-genome sequence is reported in NCBI, but no complete gene annotation has been submitted. Herein, we sequenced aLeptosphaeria lindquistiiisolate from sunflower seeds imported from the United States using Oxford Nanopore long-read sequencing and Illumina short-read sequencing. We generated a 38.6-Mb genome assembly consisting of 29 contigs with an N50 of 1.689 Mb and a maximum length of 5.316 Mb. In the genome assembly, we identified 13,481 protein-coding genes, of which 12,531 were annotated. The high-quality assembly and annotation of theLeptosphaeria lindquistiigenome will allow us to conduct further studies for the specific identification of pathogens causing sunflower black stem disease and provide a better understanding of the infection mechanisms ofLeptosphaeria lindquistii.",36510424,,10.1094/PDIS-09-22-2055-A,0
Benchmarking Oxford Nanopore read alignment-based insertion and deletion detection in crop plant genomes,"Structural variations (SVs) are larger polymorphisms (> 50 bp in length), which consist of insertions, deletions, inversions, duplications, and translocations. They can have a strong impact on agronomical traits and play an important role in environmental adaptation. The development of long-read sequencing technologies, including Oxford Nanopore, allows for comprehensive SV discovery and characterization even in complex polyploid crop genomes. However, many of the SV discovery pipeline benchmarks do not include complex plant genome datasets. In this study, we benchmarked insertion and deletion detection by popular long-read alignment-based SV detection tools for crop plant genomes. We used real and simulated Oxford Nanopore reads for two crops, allotetraploid Brassica napus (oilseed rape) and diploid Solanum lycopersicum (tomato), and evaluated several read aligners and SV callers across 5×, 10×, and 20× coverages typically used in re-sequencing studies. We further validated our findings using maize and soybean datasets. Our benchmarks provide a useful guide for designing Oxford Nanopore re-sequencing projects and SV discovery pipelines for crop plants.",36988043,,10.1002/tpg2.20314,0
Full-Length Mitochondrial-DNA Sequencing on the PacBio RSII,"Conventional mitochondrial-DNA (MT DNA) sequencing approaches use Sanger sequencing of 20-40 partially overlapping PCR fragments per individual, which is a time- and resource-consuming process.

In this setup we first generate long-range PCR products for two partially overlapping 7.7 and 9.2 kb MT DNA-specific amplicons, add sample-specific barcodes, and sequence these on the PacBio RSII system to obtain full-length MT DNA sequences for genotyping/haplotyping purposes.",27822864,,10.1007/978-1-4939-6442-0_12,4
Current challenges and best-practice protocols for microbiome analysis,"Analyzing the microbiome of diverse species and environments using next-generation sequencing techniques has significantly enhanced our understanding on metabolic, physiological and ecological roles of environmental microorganisms. However, the analysis of the microbiome is affected by experimental conditions (e.g. sequencing errors and genomic repeats) and computationally intensive and cumbersome downstream analysis (e.g. quality control, assembly, binning and statistical analyses). Moreover, the introduction of new sequencing technologies and protocols led to a flood of new methodologies, which also have an immediate effect on the results of the analyses. The aim of this work is to review the most important workflows for 16S rRNA sequencing and shotgun and long-read metagenomics, as well as to provide best-practice protocols on experimental design, sample processing, sequencing, assembly, binning, annotation and visualization. To simplify and standardize the computational analysis, we provide a set of best-practice workflows for 16S rRNA and metagenomic sequencing data (available at https://github.com/grimmlab/MicrobiomeBestPracticeReview).",31848574,PMC7820839,10.1093/bib/bbz155,155
DeepMP: a deep learning tool to detect DNA base modifications on Nanopore sequencing data,"Motivation:DNA methylation plays a key role in a variety of biological processes. Recently, Nanopore long-read sequencing has enabled direct detection of these modifications. As a consequence, a range of computational methods have been developed to exploit Nanopore data for methylation detection. However, current approaches rely on a human-defined threshold to detect the methylation status of a genomic position and are not optimized to detect sites methylated at low frequency. Furthermore, most methods use either the Nanopore signals or the basecalling errors as the model input and do not take advantage of their combination.Results:Here, we present DeepMP, a convolutional neural network-based model that takes information from Nanopore signals and basecalling errors to detect whether a given motif in a read is methylated or not. Besides, DeepMP introduces a threshold-free position modification calling model sensitive to sites methylated at low frequency across cells. We comprehensively benchmarked DeepMP against state-of-the-art methods on Escherichia coli, human and pUC19 datasets. DeepMP outperforms current approaches at read-based and position-based methylation detection across sites methylated at different frequencies in the three datasets.Availability and implementation:DeepMP is implemented and freely available under MIT license at https://github.com/pepebonet/DeepMP.Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",34718417,PMC8826383,10.1093/bioinformatics/btab745,3
A linked-read approach to museomics: Higher quality de novo genome assemblies from degraded tissues,"High-throughput sequencing technologies are a proposed solution for accessing the molecular data in historical specimens. However, degraded DNA combined with the computational demands of short-read assemblies has posed significant laboratory and bioinformatics challenges for de novo genome assembly. Linked-read or ""synthetic long-read"" sequencing technologies, such as 10× Genomics, may provide a cost-effective alternative solution to assemble higher quality de novo genomes from degraded tissue samples. Here, we compare assembly quality (e.g., genome contiguity and completeness, presence of orthogroups) between four new deer mouse (Peromyscus spp.) genomes assembled using linked-read technology and four published genomes assembled from a single shotgun library. At a similar price-point, these approaches produce vastly different assemblies, with linked-read assemblies having overall higher contiguity and completeness, measured by larger N50 values and greater number of genes assembled, respectively. As a proof-of-concept, we used annotated genes from the four Peromyscus linked-read assemblies and eight additional rodent taxa to generate a phylogeny, which reconstructed the expected relationships among species with 100% support. Although not without caveats, our results suggest that linked-read sequencing approaches are a viable option to build de novo genomes from degraded tissues, which may prove particularly valuable for taxa that are extinct, rare or difficult to collect.",32153100,PMC7496956,10.1111/1755-0998.13155,6
Targeted adaptive long-read sequencing for discovery of complex phased variants in inherited retinal disease patients,"Inherited retinal degenerations (IRDs) are a heterogeneous group of predominantly monogenic disorders with over 300 causative genes identified. Short-read exome sequencing is commonly used to genotypically diagnose patients with clinical features of IRDs, however, in up to 30% of patients with autosomal recessive IRDs, one or no disease-causing variants are identified. Furthermore, chromosomal maps cannot be reconstructed for allelic variant discovery with short-reads. Long-read genome sequencing can provide complete coverage of disease loci and a targeted approach can focus sequencing bandwidth to a genomic region of interest to provide increased depth and haplotype reconstruction to uncover cases of missing heritability. We demonstrate that targeted adaptive long-read sequencing on the Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) platform of the USH2A gene from three probands in a family with the most common cause of the syndromic IRD, Usher Syndrome, resulted in greater than 12-fold target gene sequencing enrichment on average. This focused depth of sequencing allowed for haplotype reconstruction and phased variant identification. We further show that variants obtained from the haplotype-aware genotyping pipeline can be heuristically ranked to focus on potential pathogenic candidates without a priori knowledge of the disease-causing variants. Moreover, consideration of the variants unique to targeted long-read sequencing that are not covered by short-read technology demonstrated higher precision and F1 scores for variant discovery by long-read sequencing. This work establishes that targeted adaptive long-read sequencing can generate targeted, chromosome-phased data sets for identification of coding and non-coding disease-causing alleles in IRDs and can be applicable to other Mendelian diseases.",37237007,PMC10219926,10.1038/s41598-023-35791-4,3
mRNA vaccine quality analysis using RNA sequencing,"The success of mRNA vaccines has been realised, in part, by advances in manufacturing that enabled billions of doses to be produced at sufficient quality and safety. However, mRNA vaccines must be rigorously analysed to measure their integrity and detect contaminants that reduce their effectiveness and induce side-effects. Currently, mRNA vaccines and therapies are analysed using a range of time-consuming and costly methods. Here we describe a streamlined method to analyse mRNA vaccines and therapies using long-read nanopore sequencing. Compared to other industry-standard techniques, VAX-seq can comprehensively measure key mRNA vaccine quality attributes, including sequence, length, integrity, and purity. We also show how direct RNA sequencing can analyse mRNA chemistry, including the detection of nucleoside modifications. To support this approach, we provide supporting software to automatically report on mRNA and plasmid template quality and integrity. Given these advantages, we anticipate that RNA sequencing methods, such as VAX-seq, will become central to the development and manufacture of mRNA drugs.",37735471,PMC10514319,10.1038/s41467-023-41354-y,1
Selective nanopore sequencing of human BRCA1 by Cas9-assisted targeting of chromosome segments (CATCH),"Next generation sequencing (NGS) is challenged by structural and copy number variations larger than the typical read length of several hundred bases. Third-generation sequencing platforms such as single-molecule real-time (SMRT) and nanopore sequencing provide longer reads and are able to characterize variations that are undetected in NGS data. Nevertheless, these technologies suffer from inherent low throughput which prohibits deep sequencing at reasonable cost without target enrichment. Here, we optimized Cas9-Assisted Targeting of CHromosome segments (CATCH) for nanopore sequencing of the breast cancer gene BRCA1. A 200 kb target containing the 80 kb BRCA1 gene body and its flanking regions was isolated intact from primary human peripheral blood cells, allowing long-range amplification and long-read nanopore sequencing. The target was enriched 237-fold and sequenced at up to 70× coverage on a single flow-cell. Overall performance and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calling were directly compared to Illumina sequencing of the same enriched sample, highlighting the benefits of CATCH for targeted sequencing. The CATCH enrichment scheme only requires knowledge of the target flanking sequence for Cas9 cleavage while providing contiguous data across both coding and non-coding sequence and holds promise for characterization of complex disease-related or highly variable genomic regions.",29788371,PMC6101500,10.1093/nar/gky411,55
Accurate self-correction of errors in long reads using de Bruijn graphs,"Motivation:New long read sequencing technologies, like PacBio SMRT and Oxford NanoPore, can produce sequencing reads up to 50 000 bp long but with an error rate of at least 15%. Reducing the error rate is necessary for subsequent utilization of the reads in, e.g. de novo genome assembly. The error correction problem has been tackled either by aligning the long reads against each other or by a hybrid approach that uses the more accurate short reads produced by second generation sequencing technologies to correct the long reads.Results:We present an error correction method that uses long reads only. The method consists of two phases: first, we use an iterative alignment-free correction method based on de Bruijn graphs with increasing length of k -mers, and second, the corrected reads are further polished using long-distance dependencies that are found using multiple alignments. According to our experiments, the proposed method is the most accurate one relying on long reads only for read sets with high coverage. Furthermore, when the coverage of the read set is at least 75×, the throughput of the new method is at least 20% higher.Availability and implementation:LoRMA is freely available at http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/lmsalmel/LoRMA/ .Contact:leena.salmela@cs.helsinki.fi.",27273673,PMC5351550,10.1093/bioinformatics/btw321,48
HaploMerger2: rebuilding both haploid sub-assemblies from high-heterozygosity diploid genome assembly,"Summary:De novo assembly is a difficult issue for heterozygous diploid genomes. The advent of high-throughput short-read and long-read sequencing technologies provides both new challenges and potential solutions to the issue. Here, we present HaploMerger2 (HM2), an automated pipeline for rebuilding both haploid sub-assemblies from the polymorphic diploid genome assembly. It is designed to work on pre-existing diploid assemblies, which are typically created by using de novo assemblers. HM2 can process any diploid assemblies, but it is especially suitable for diploid assemblies with high heterozygosity (≥3%), which can be difficult for other tools. This pipeline also implements flexible and sensitive assembly error detection, a hierarchical scaffolding procedure and a reliable gap-closing method for haploid sub-assemblies. Using HM2, we demonstrate that two haploid sub-assemblies reconstructed from a real, highly-polymorphic diploid assembly show greatly improved continuity.Availability and implementation:Source code, executables and the testing dataset are freely available at https://github.com/mapleforest/HaploMerger2/releases/.Contact:hshengf2@mail.sysu.edu.cn.Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",28407147,PMC5870766,10.1093/bioinformatics/btx220,87
HiFi metagenomic sequencing enables assembly of accurate and complete genomes from human gut microbiota,"Advances in metagenomic assembly have led to the discovery of genomes belonging to uncultured microorganisms. Metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) often suffer from fragmentation and chimerism. Recently, 20 complete MAGs (cMAGs) have been assembled from Oxford Nanopore long-read sequencing of 13 human fecal samples, but with low nucleotide accuracy. Here, we report 102 cMAGs obtained by Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) high-accuracy long-read (HiFi) metagenomic sequencing of five human fecal samples, whose initial circular contigs were selected for complete prokaryotic genomes using our bioinformatics workflow. Nucleotide accuracy of the final cMAGs was as high as that of Illumina sequencing. The cMAGs could exceed 6 Mbp and included complete genomes of diverse taxa, including entirely uncultured RF39 and TANB77 orders. Moreover, cMAGs revealed that regions hard to assemble by short-read sequencing comprised mostly genomic islands and rRNAs. HiFi metagenomic sequencing will facilitate cataloging accurate and complete genomes from complex microbial communities, including uncultured species.",36289209,PMC9606305,10.1038/s41467-022-34149-0,15
"Complete chloroplast genome of novel Adrinandra megaphylla Hu species: molecular structure, comparative and phylogenetic analysis","Adrinandra megaphylla Hu is a medicinal plant belonging to the Adrinandra genus, which is well-known for its potential health benefits due to its bioactive compounds. This study aimed to assemble and annotate the chloroplast genome of A. megaphylla as well as compare it with previously published cp genomes within the Adrinandra genus. The chloroplast genome was reconstructed using de novo and reference-based assembly of paired-end reads generated by long-read sequencing of total genomic DNA. The size of the chloroplast genome was 156,298 bp, comprised a large single-copy (LSC) region of 85,688 bp, a small single-copy (SSC) region of 18,424 bp, and a pair of inverted repeats (IRa and IRb) of 26,093 bp each; and a total of 51 SSRs and 48 repeat structures were detected. The chloroplast genome includes a total of 131 functional genes, containing 86 protein-coding genes, 37 transfer RNA genes, and 8 ribosomal RNA genes. The A. megaphylla chloroplast genome indicated that gene content and structure are highly conserved. The phylogenetic reconstruction using complete cp sequences, matK and trnL genes from Pentaphylacaceae species exhibited a genetic relationship. Among them, matK sequence is a better candidate for phylogenetic resolution. This study is the first report for the chloroplast genome of the A. megaphylla.",34083611,PMC8175739,10.1038/s41598-021-91071-z,17
Best practices for variant calling in clinical sequencing,"Next-generation sequencing technologies have enabled a dramatic expansion of clinical genetic testing both for inherited conditions and diseases such as cancer. Accurate variant calling in NGS data is a critical step upon which virtually all downstream analysis and interpretation processes rely. Just as NGS technologies have evolved considerably over the past 10 years, so too have the software tools and approaches for detecting sequence variants in clinical samples. In this review, I discuss the current best practices for variant calling in clinical sequencing studies, with a particular emphasis on trio sequencing for inherited disorders and somatic mutation detection in cancer patients. I describe the relative strengths and weaknesses of panel, exome, and whole-genome sequencing for variant detection. Recommended tools and strategies for calling variants of different classes are also provided, along with guidance on variant review, validation, and benchmarking to ensure optimal performance. Although NGS technologies are continually evolving, and new capabilities (such as long-read single-molecule sequencing) are emerging, the ""best practice"" principles in this review should be relevant to clinical variant calling in the long term.",33106175,PMC7586657,10.1186/s13073-020-00791-w,108
Is It Ordered Correctly? Validating Genome Assemblies by Optical Mapping,"Long-read single-molecule sequencing, Hi-C sequencing, and improved bioinformatic tools are ushering in an era where complete genome assembly will become common for species with few or no classical genetic resources. There are no guidelines for how to proceed in such cases. Ideally, such genomes would be sequenced by two different methods so that one assembly serves as confirmation of the other; however, cost constraints make this approach unlikely. Overreliance on synteny as a means of confirming and ordering contigs will lead to compounded errors. Optical mapping is an accessible and relatively mature technology that can be used for genome assembly validation. We discuss how optical mapping can be used as a validation tool for genome assemblies and how to interpret the results. In addition, we discuss methods for using optical map data to enhance genome assemblies derived from both traditional sequence contigs and Hi-C pseudomolecules.",29263086,PMC5810561,10.1105/tpc.17.00514,18
Advanced sequencing-based high-throughput and long-read single-cell transcriptome analysis,"Cells are the fundamental building blocks of living systems, exhibiting significant heterogeneity. The transcriptome connects the cellular genotype and phenotype, and profiling single-cell transcriptomes is critical for uncovering distinct cell types, states, and the interplay between cells in development, health, and disease. Nevertheless, single-cell transcriptome analysis faces daunting challenges due to the low abundance and diverse nature of RNAs in individual cells, as well as their heterogeneous expression. The advent and continuous advancements of next-generation sequencing (NGS) and third-generation sequencing (TGS) technologies have solved these problems and facilitated the high-throughput, sensitive, full-length, and rapid profiling of single-cell RNAs. In this review, we provide a broad introduction to current methodologies for single-cell transcriptome sequencing. First, state-of-the-art advancements in high-throughput and full-length single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) platforms using NGS are reviewed. Next, TGS-based long-read scRNA-seq methods are summarized.

Evaluation of Oxford Nanopore MinION RNA-Seq Performance for Human Primary Cells,"Transcript sequencing is a crucial tool for gaining a deep understanding of biological processes in diagnostic and clinical medicine. Given their potential to study novel complex eukaryotic transcriptomes, long-read sequencing technologies are able to overcome some limitations of short-read RNA-Seq approaches. Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) offers the ability to generate long-read sequencing data in real time via portable protein nanopore USB devices. This work aimed to provide the user with the number of reads that should be sequenced, through the ONT MinION platform, to reach the desired accuracy level for a human cell RNA study. We sequenced three cDNA libraries prepared from poly-adenosine RNA of human primary cardiac fibroblasts. Since the runs were comparable, they were combined in a total dataset of 48 million reads. Synthetic datasets with different sizes were generated starting from the total and analyzed in terms of the number of identified genes and their expression levels. As expected, an improved sensitivity was obtained, increasing the sequencing depth, particularly for the non-coding genes. The reliability of expression levels was assayed by (i) comparison with PCR quantifications of selected genes and (ii) by the implementation of a user-friendly multiplexing method in a single run.",34204756,PMC8231517,10.3390/ijms22126317,7
Nanopore Sequencing to Identify Transposable Element Insertions and Their Epigenetic Modifications,"Over the past 20 years, high-throughput genomic assays have fundamentally changed how transposable elements (TEs) are studied. While short-read DNA sequencing has been at the heart of these efforts, novel technologies that generate longer reads are driving a shift in the field. Long-read sequencing now permits locus-specific approaches to locate individual TE insertions and understand their epigenetic and transcriptional regulation, while still profiling TE activity genome-wide. Here we provide detailed guidelines to implement Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing to identify polymorphic TE insertions and profile TE epigenetic landscapes. Using human long interspersed element-1 (LINE-1, L1) as an example, we explain the procedures involved, including final visualization, and potential bottlenecks and pitfalls. ONT sequencing will be, in our view, a workhorse technology for the foreseeable future in the TE field.",36449163,,10.1007/978-1-0716-2883-6_9,1
Transcriptomic study of Herpes simplex virus type-1 using full-length sequencing techniques,"Herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1) is a human pathogenic member of the Alphaherpesvirinae subfamily of herpesviruses. The HSV-1 genome is a large double-stranded DNA specifying about 85 protein coding genes. The latest surveys have demonstrated that the HSV-1 transcriptome is much more complex than it had been thought before. Here, we provide a long-read sequencing dataset, which was generated by using the RSII and Sequel systems from Pacific Biosciences (PacBio), as well as MinION sequencing system from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT). This dataset contains 39,096 reads of inserts (ROIs) mapped to the HSV-1 genome (X14112) in RSII sequencing, while Sequel sequencing yielded 77,851 ROIs. The MinION cDNA sequencing altogether resulted in 158,653 reads, while the direct RNA-seq produced 16,516 reads. This dataset can be utilized for the identification of novel HSV RNAs and transcripts isoforms, as well as for the comparison of the quality and length of the sequencing reads derived from the currently available long-read sequencing platforms.

Overcoming uncollapsed haplotypes in long-read assemblies of non-model organisms,"Background:Long-read sequencing is revolutionizing genome assembly: as PacBio and Nanopore technologies become more accessible in technicity and in cost, long-read assemblers flourish and are starting to deliver chromosome-level assemblies. However, these long reads are usually error-prone, making the generation of a haploid reference out of a diploid genome a difficult enterprise. Failure to properly collapse haplotypes results in fragmented and structurally incorrect assemblies and wreaks havoc on orthology inference pipelines, yet this serious issue is rarely acknowledged and dealt with in genomic projects, and an independent, comparative benchmark of the capacity of assemblers and post-processing tools to properly collapse or purge haplotypes is still lacking.Results:We tested different assembly strategies on the genome of the rotifer Adineta vaga, a non-model organism for which high coverages of both PacBio and Nanopore reads were available. The assemblers we tested (Canu, Flye, NextDenovo, Ra, Raven, Shasta and wtdbg2) exhibited strikingly different behaviors when dealing with highly heterozygous regions, resulting in variable amounts of uncollapsed haplotypes. Filtering reads generally improved haploid assemblies, and we also benchmarked three post-processing tools aimed at detecting and purging uncollapsed haplotypes in long-read assemblies: HaploMerger2, purge_haplotigs and purge_dups.Conclusions:We provide a thorough evaluation of popular assemblers on a non-model eukaryote genome with variable levels of heterozygosity. Our study highlights several strategies using pre and post-processing approaches to generate haploid assemblies with high continuity and completeness. This benchmark will help users to improve haploid assemblies of non-model organisms, and evaluate the quality of their own assemblies.",34090340,PMC8178825,10.1186/s12859-021-04118-3,24
A High-QualityDe novoGenome Assembly from a Single Mosquito Using PacBio Sequencing,"A high-quality reference genome is a fundamental resource for functional genetics, comparative genomics, and population genomics, and is increasingly important for conservation biology. PacBio Single Molecule, Real-Time (SMRT) sequencing generates long reads with uniform coverage and high consensus accuracy, making it a powerful technology forde novogenome assembly. Improvements in throughput and concomitant reductions in cost have made PacBio an attractive core technology for many large genome initiatives, however, relatively high DNA input requirements (~5 µg for standard library protocol) have placed PacBio out of reach for many projects on small organisms that have lower DNA content, or on projects with limited input DNA for other reasons. Here we present a high-qualityde novogenome assembly from a singleAnopheles coluzziimosquito. A modified SMRTbell library construction protocol without DNA shearing and size selection was used to generate a SMRTbell library from just 100 ng of starting genomic DNA. The sample was run on the Sequel System with chemistry 3.0 and software v6.0, generating, on average, 25 Gb of sequence per SMRT Cell with 20 h movies, followed by diploidde novogenome assembly with FALCON-Unzip. The resulting curated assembly had high contiguity (contig N50 3.5 Mb) and completeness (more than 98% of conserved genes were present and full-length). In addition, this single-insect assembly now places 667 (>90%) of formerly unplaced genes into their appropriate chromosomal contexts in the AgamP4 PEST reference. We were also able to resolve maternal and paternal haplotypes for over 1/3 of the genome. By sequencing and assembling material from a single diploid individual, only two haplotypes were present, simplifying the assembly process compared to samples from multiple pooled individuals. The method presented here can be applied to samples with starting DNA amounts as low as 100 ng per 1 Gb genome size. This new low-input approach puts PacBio-based assemblies in reach for small highly heterozygous organisms that comprise much of the diversity of life.",30669388,PMC6357164,10.3390/genes10010062,65
Discovery of widespread transcription initiation at microsatellites predictable by sequence-based deep neural network,"Using the Cap Analysis of Gene Expression (CAGE) technology, the FANTOM5 consortium provided one of the most comprehensive maps of transcription start sites (TSSs) in several species. Strikingly, ~72% of them could not be assigned to a specific gene and initiate at unconventional regions, outside promoters or enhancers. Here, we probe these unassigned TSSs and show that, in all species studied, a significant fraction of CAGE peaks initiate at microsatellites, also called short tandem repeats (STRs). To confirm this transcription, we develop Cap Trap RNA-seq, a technology which combines cap trapping and long read MinION sequencing. We train sequence-based deep learning models able to predict CAGE signal at STRs with high accuracy. These models unveil the importance of STR surrounding sequences not only to distinguish STR classes, but also to predict the level of transcription initiation. Importantly, genetic variants linked to human diseases are preferentially found at STRs with high transcription initiation level, supporting the biological and clinical relevance of transcription initiation at STRs. Together, our results extend the repertoire of non-coding transcription associated with DNA tandem repeats and complexify STR polymorphism.",34078885,PMC8172540,10.1038/s41467-021-23143-7,9
Nm-Nano: a machine learning framework for transcriptome-wide single-molecule mapping of 2´-O-methylation (Nm) sites in nanopore direct RNA sequencing datasets,"2´-O-methylation (Nm) is one of the most abundant modifications found in both mRNAs and noncoding RNAs. It contributes to many biological processes, such as the normal functioning of tRNA, the protection of mRNA against degradation by the decapping and exoribonuclease (DXO) protein, and the biogenesis and specificity of rRNA. Recent advancements in single-molecule sequencing techniques for long read RNA sequencing data offered by Oxford Nanopore technologies have enabled the direct detection of RNA modifications from sequencing data. In this study, we propose a bio-computational framework, Nm-Nano, for predicting the presence of Nm sites in direct RNA sequencing data generated from two human cell lines. The Nm-Nano framework integrates two supervised machine learning (ML) models for predicting Nm sites: Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Random Forest (RF) with K-mer embedding. Evaluation on benchmark datasets from direct RNA sequecing of HeLa and HEK293 cell lines, demonstrates high accuracy (99% with XGBoost and 92% with RF) in identifying Nm sites. Deploying Nm-Nano on HeLa and HEK293 cell lines reveals genes that are frequently modified with Nm. In HeLa cell lines, 125 genes are identified as frequently Nm-modified, showing enrichment in 30 ontologies related to immune response and cellular processes. In HEK293 cell lines, 61 genes are identified as frequently Nm-modified, with enrichment in processes like glycolysis and protein localization. These findings underscore the diverse regulatory roles of Nm modifications in metabolic pathways, protein degradation, and cellular processes. The source code of Nm-Nano can be freely accessed at https://github.com/Janga-Lab/Nm-Nano.",38758523,PMC11110688,10.1080/15476286.2024.2352192,0
Reference long-read isoform-aware transcriptomes of 4 human peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets,"Long-read sequencing technologies such as isoform sequencing can generate highly accurate sequences of full-length mRNA transcript isoforms. Such long-read transcriptomics may be especially useful in investigations of lymphocyte functional plasticity as it relates to human health and disease. However, no long-read isoform-aware reference transcriptomes of human circulating lymphocytes are readily available despite being valuable as benchmarks in a variety of transcriptomic studies. To begin to fill this gap, we purified 4 lymphocyte populations (CD4+ T, CD8+ T, NK, and Pan B cells) from the peripheral blood of a healthy male donor and obtained high-quality RNA (RIN &gt; 8) for isoform sequencing and parallel RNA-Seq analyses. Many novel polyadenylated transcript isoforms, supported by both isoform sequencing and RNA-Seq data, were identified within each sample. The datasets met several metrics of high quality and have been deposited to the Gene Expression Omnibus database (GSE202327, GSE202328, GSE202329) as both raw and processed files to serve as long-read reference transcriptomes for future studies of human circulating lymphocytes.",36161486,PMC9635627,10.1093/g3journal/jkac253,1
Oxford Nanopore R10.4 long-read sequencing enables the generation of near-finished bacterial genomes from pure cultures and metagenomes without short-read or reference polishing,"Long-read Oxford Nanopore sequencing has democratized microbial genome sequencing and enables the recovery of highly contiguous microbial genomes from isolates or metagenomes. However, to obtain near-finished genomes it has been necessary to include short-read polishing to correct insertions and deletions derived from homopolymer regions. Here, we show that Oxford Nanopore R10.4 can be used to generate near-finished microbial genomes from isolates or metagenomes without short-read or reference polishing.",35789207,PMC9262707,10.1038/s41592-022-01539-7,110
TEQUILA-seq: a versatile and low-cost method for targeted long-read RNA sequencing,"Long-read RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is a powerful technology for transcriptome analysis, but the relatively low throughput of current long-read sequencing platforms limits transcript coverage. One strategy for overcoming this bottleneck is targeted long-read RNA-seq for preselected gene panels. We present TEQUILA-seq, a versatile, easy-to-implement, and low-cost method for targeted long-read RNA-seq utilizing isothermally linear-amplified capture probes. When performed on the Oxford nanopore platform with multiple gene panels of varying sizes, TEQUILA-seq consistently and substantially enriches transcript coverage while preserving transcript quantification. We profile full-length transcript isoforms of 468 actionable cancer genes across 40 representative breast cancer cell lines. We identify transcript isoforms enriched in specific subtypes and discover novel transcript isoforms in extensively studied cancer genes such as TP53. Among cancer genes, tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) are significantly enriched for aberrant transcript isoforms targeted for degradation via mRNA nonsense-mediated decay, revealing a common RNA-associated mechanism for TSG inactivation. TEQUILA-seq reduces the per-reaction cost of targeted capture by 2-3 orders of magnitude, as compared to a standard commercial solution. TEQUILA-seq can be broadly used for targeted sequencing of full-length transcripts in diverse biomedical research settings.",37553321,PMC10409798,10.1038/s41467-023-40083-6,1
A critical comparison of technologies for a plant genome sequencing project,"Background:A high-quality genome sequence of any model organism is an essential starting point for genetic and other studies. Older clone-based methods are slow and expensive, whereas faster, cheaper short-read-only assemblies can be incomplete and highly fragmented, which minimizes their usefulness. The last few years have seen the introduction of many new technologies for genome assembly. These new technologies and associated new algorithms are typically benchmarked on microbial genomes or, if they scale appropriately, on larger (e.g., human) genomes. However, plant genomes can be much more repetitive and larger than the human genome, and plant biochemistry often makes obtaining high-quality DNA that is free from contaminants difficult. Reflecting their challenging nature, we observe that plant genome assembly statistics are typically poorer than for vertebrates.Results:Here, we compare Illumina short read, Pacific Biosciences long read, 10x Genomics linked reads, Dovetail Hi-C, and BioNano Genomics optical maps, singly and combined, in producing high-quality long-range genome assemblies of the potato species Solanum verrucosum. We benchmark the assemblies for completeness and accuracy, as well as DNA compute requirements and sequencing costs.Conclusions:The field of genome sequencing and assembly is reaching maturity, and the differences we observe between assemblies are surprisingly small. We expect that our results will be helpful to other genome projects, and that these datasets will be used in benchmarking by assembly algorithm developers.",30624602,PMC6423373,10.1093/gigascience/giy163,26
polishCLR: A Nextflow Workflow for Polishing PacBio CLR Genome Assemblies,"Long-read sequencing has revolutionized genome assembly, yielding highly contiguous, chromosome-level contigs. However, assemblies from some third generation long read technologies, such as Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) continuous long reads (CLR), have a high error rate. Such errors can be corrected with short reads through a process called polishing. Although best practices for polishing non-model de novo genome assemblies were recently described by the Vertebrate Genome Project (VGP) Assembly community, there is a need for a publicly available, reproducible workflow that can be easily implemented and run on a conventional high performance computing environment. Here, we describe polishCLR (https://github.com/isugifNF/polishCLR), a reproducible Nextflow workflow that implements best practices for polishing assemblies made from CLR data. PolishCLR can be initiated from several input options that extend best practices to suboptimal cases. It also provides re-entry points throughout several key processes, including identifying duplicate haplotypes in purge_dups, allowing a break for scaffolding if data are available, and throughout multiple rounds of polishing and evaluation with Arrow and FreeBayes. PolishCLR is containerized and publicly available for the greater assembly community as a tool to complete assemblies from existing, error-prone long-read data.",36792366,PMC9985148,10.1093/gbe/evad020,2
Benchmarking genome assembly methods on metagenomic sequencing data,"Metagenome assembly is an efficient approach to reconstruct microbial genomes from metagenomic sequencing data. Although short-read sequencing has been widely used for metagenome assembly, linked- and long-read sequencing have shown their advancements in assembly by providing long-range DNA connectedness. Many metagenome assembly tools were developed to simplify the assembly graphs and resolve the repeats in microbial genomes. However, there remains no comprehensive evaluation of metagenomic sequencing technologies, and there is a lack of practical guidance on selecting the appropriate metagenome assembly tools. This paper presents a comprehensive benchmark of 19 commonly used assembly tools applied to metagenomic sequencing datasets obtained from simulation, mock communities or human gut microbiomes. These datasets were generated using mainstream sequencing platforms, such as Illumina and BGISEQ short-read sequencing, 10x Genomics linked-read sequencing, and PacBio and Oxford Nanopore long-read sequencing. The assembly tools were extensively evaluated against many criteria, which revealed that long-read assemblers generated high contig contiguity but failed to reveal some medium- and high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs). Linked-read assemblers obtained the highest number of overall near-complete MAGs from the human gut microbiomes. Hybrid assemblers using both short- and long-read sequencing were promising methods to improve both total assembly length and the number of near-complete MAGs. This paper also discussed the running time and peak memory consumption of these assembly tools and provided practical guidance on selecting them.",36917471,,10.1093/bib/bbad087,4
SequelTools: a suite of tools for working with PacBio Sequel raw sequence data,"Background:PacBio sequencing is an incredibly valuable third-generation DNA sequencing method due to very long read lengths, ability to detect methylated bases, and its real-time sequencing methodology. Yet, hitherto no tool was available for analyzing the quality of, subsampling, and filtering PacBio data.Results:Here we present SequelTools, a command-line program containing three tools: Quality Control, Read Subsampling, and Read Filtering. The Quality Control tool quickly processes PacBio Sequel raw sequence data from multiple SMRTcells producing multiple statistics and publication-quality plots describing the quality of the data including N50, read length and count statistics, PSR, and ZOR. The Read Subsampling tool allows the user to subsample reads by one or more of the following criteria: longest subreads per CLR or random CLR selection. The Read Filtering tool provides options for normalizing data by filtering out certain low-quality scraps reads and/or by minimum CLR length. SequelTools is implemented in bash, R, and Python using only standard libraries and packages and is platform independent.Conclusions:SequelTools is a program that provides the only free, fast, and easy-to-use quality control tool, and the only program providing this kind of read subsampling and read filtering for PacBio Sequel raw sequence data, and is available at https://github.com/ISUgenomics/SequelTools .",33004007,PMC7532105,10.1186/s12859-020-03751-8,12
Reference-free assembly of long-read transcriptome sequencing data with RNA-Bloom2,"Long-read sequencing technologies have improved significantly since their emergence. Their read lengths, potentially spanning entire transcripts, is advantageous for reconstructing transcriptomes. Existing long-read transcriptome assembly methods are primarily reference-based and to date, there is little focus on reference-free transcriptome assembly. We introduce ""RNA-Bloom2 [ https://github.com/bcgsc/RNA-Bloom ]"", a reference-free assembly method for long-read transcriptome sequencing data. Using simulated datasets and spike-in control data, we show that the transcriptome assembly quality of RNA-Bloom2 is competitive to those of reference-based methods. Furthermore, we find that RNA-Bloom2 requires 27.0 to 80.6% of the peak memory and 3.6 to 10.8% of the total wall-clock runtime of a competing reference-free method. Finally, we showcase RNA-Bloom2 in assembling a transcriptome sample of Picea sitchensis (Sitka spruce). Since our method does not rely on a reference, it further sets the groundwork for large-scale comparative transcriptomics where high-quality draft genome assemblies are not readily available.",37217540,PMC10202958,10.1038/s41467-023-38553-y,7
Epigenetic tumor heterogeneity in the era of single-cell profiling with nanopore sequencing,"Nanopore sequencing has brought the technology to the next generation in the science of sequencing. This is achieved through research advancing on: pore efficiency, creating mechanisms to control DNA translocation, enhancing signal-to-noise ratio, and expanding to long-read ranges. Heterogeneity regarding epigenetics would be broad as mutations in the epigenome are sensitive to cause new challenges in cancer research. Epigenetic enzymes which catalyze DNA methylation and histone modification are dysregulated in cancer cells and cause numerous heterogeneous clones to evolve. Detection of this heterogeneity in these clones plays an indispensable role in the treatment of various cancer types. With single-cell profiling, the nanopore sequencing technology could provide a simple sequence at long reads and is expected to be used soon at the bedside or doctor's office. Here, we review the advancements of nanopore sequencing and its use in the detection of epigenetic heterogeneity in cancer.",36030244,PMC9419648,10.1186/s13148-022-01323-6,5
"Efficient Sequencing, Assembly, and Annotation of Human KIR Haplotypes","The homology, recombination, variation, and repetitive elements in the natural killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) region has made full haplotype DNA interpretation impossible in a high-throughput workflow. Here, we present a new approach using long-read sequencing to efficiently capture, sequence, and assemble diploid human KIR haplotypes. Probes were designed to capture KIR fragments efficiently by leveraging the repeating homology of the region. IDT xGen®Lockdown probes were used to capture 2-8 kb of sheared DNA fragments followed by sequencing on a PacBio Sequel. The sequences were error corrected, binned, and then assembled using the Canu assembler. The location of genes and their exon/intron boundaries are included in the workflow. The assembly and annotation was evaluated on 16 individuals (8 African American and 8 Europeans) from whom ground truth was knownvialong-range sequencing with fosmid library preparation. Using only 18 capture probes, the results show that the assemblies cover 97% of the GenBank reference, are 99.97% concordant, and it takes only 1.8 haplotigs to cover 75% of the reference. We also report the first assembly of diploid KIR haplotypes from long-read WGS. Our targeted hybridization probe capture and sequencing approach is the first of its kind to fully sequence and phase all diploid human KIR haplotypes, and it is efficient enough for population-scale studies and clinical use. The open and free software is available at https://github.com/droeatumn/kass and supported by a environment at https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/droeatumn/kass.",33162997,PMC7581912,10.3389/fimmu.2020.582927,7
"DiMeLo-seq: a long-read, single-molecule method for mapping protein-DNA interactions genome wide","Studies of genome regulation routinely use high-throughput DNA sequencing approaches to determine where specific proteins interact with DNA, and they rely on DNA amplification and short-read sequencing, limiting their quantitative application in complex genomic regions. To address these limitations, we developed directed methylation with long-read sequencing (DiMeLo-seq), which uses antibody-tethered enzymes to methylate DNA near a target protein's binding sites in situ. These exogenous methylation marks are then detected simultaneously with endogenous CpG methylation on unamplified DNA using long-read, single-molecule sequencing technologies. We optimized and benchmarked DiMeLo-seq by mapping chromatin-binding proteins and histone modifications across the human genome. Furthermore, we identified where centromere protein A localizes within highly repetitive regions that were unmappable with short sequencing reads, and we estimated the density of centromere protein A molecules along single chromatin fibers. DiMeLo-seq is a versatile method that provides multimodal, genome-wide information for investigating protein-DNA interactions.",35396487,PMC9189060,10.1038/s41592-022-01475-6,32
LSCplus: a fast solution for improving long read accuracy by short read alignment,"Background:The single molecule, real time (SMRT) sequencing technology of Pacific Biosciences enables the acquisition of transcripts from end to end due to its ability to produce extraordinarily long reads (>10 kb). This new method of transcriptome sequencing has been applied to several projects on humans and model organisms. However, the raw data from SMRT sequencing are of relatively low quality, with a random error rate of approximately 15 %, for which error correction using next-generation sequencing (NGS) short reads is typically necessary. Few tools have been designed that apply a hybrid sequencing approach that combines NGS and SMRT data, and the most popular existing tool for error correction, LSC, has computing resource requirements that are too intensive for most laboratory and research groups. These shortcomings severely limit the application of SMRT long reads for transcriptome analysis.Results:Here, we report an improved tool (LSCplus) for error correction with the LSC program as a reference. LSCplus overcomes the disadvantage of LSC's time consumption and improves quality. Only 1/3-1/4 of the time and 1/20-1/25 of the error correction time is required using LSCplus compared with that required for using LSC.Conclusions:LSCplus is freely available at http://www.herbbol.org:8001/lscplus/ . Sample calculations are provided illustrating the precision and efficiency of this method regarding error correction and isoform detection.",27829364,PMC5103424,10.1186/s12859-016-1316-y,11
The effect of taxonomic classification by full-length 16S rRNA sequencing with a synthetic long-read technology,"Characterizing the microbial communities inhabiting specimens is one of the primary objectives of microbiome studies. A short-read sequencing platform for reading partial regions of the 16S rRNA gene is most commonly used by reducing the cost burden of next-generation sequencing (NGS), but misclassification at the species level due to its length being too short to consider sequence similarity remains a challenge. Loop Genomics recently proposed a new 16S full-length-based synthetic long-read sequencing technology (sFL16S). We compared a 16S full-length-based synthetic long-read (sFL16S) and V3-V4 short-read (V3V4) methods using 24 human GUT microbiota samples. Our comparison analyses of sFL16S and V3V4 sequencing data showed that they were highly similar at all classification resolutions except the species level. At the species level, we confirmed that sFL16S showed better resolutions than V3V4 in analyses of alpha-diversity, relative abundance frequency and identification accuracy. Furthermore, we demonstrated that sFL16S could overcome the microbial misidentification caused by different sequence similarity in each 16S variable region through comparison the identification accuracy of Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides, and Alistipes strains classified from both methods. Therefore, this study suggests that the new sFL16S method is a suitable tool to overcome the weakness of the V3V4 method.",33462291,PMC7814050,10.1038/s41598-020-80826-9,56
Third-generation sequencing for genetic disease,"Third-generation sequencing (TGS) has led to a brave new revolution in detecting genetic diseases over the last few years. TGS has been rapidly developed for genetic disease applications owing to its significant advantages such as long read length, rapid detection, and precise detection of complex and rare structural variants. This approach greatly improves the efficiency of disease diagnosis and complements the shortcomings of short-read sequencing. In this paper, we first briefly introduce the working mechanism of one of the most important representatives of TGS, single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing by Pacific Bioscience (PacBio), followed by a review and comparison of the advantages and disadvantages of different sequencing technologies. Finally, we focused on the progress of SMRT sequencing applications in genetic disease detection. Future perspectives on the applications of TGS in other fields were also presented. With the continuous innovation of the SMRT technologies and the expansion of their fields of application, SMRT sequencing has broad clinical application prospects in genetic diseases detection, and is expected to become an important tool for the molecular diagnosis of other diseases.",37923104,,10.1016/j.cca.2023.117624,2
Long-Read Genome Assemblies Reveal Extraordinary Variation in the Number and Structure of MHC Loci in Birds,"Our knowledge of the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) in birds is limited because it often consists of numerous duplicated genes within individuals that are difficult to assemble with short read sequencing technology. Long-read sequencing provides an opportunity to overcome this limitation because it allows the assembly of long regions with repetitive elements. In this study, we used genomes based on long-read sequencing to predict the number and location of MHC loci in a broad range of bird taxa. From the long-read-based genomes of 34 species, we found that there was extremely large variation in the number of MHC loci between species. Overall, there were greater numbers of both class I and II loci in passerines than nonpasserines. The highest numbers of loci (up to 193 class II loci) were found in manakins (Pipridae), which had previously not been studied at the MHC. Our results provide the first direct evidence from passerine genomes of this high level of duplication. We also found different duplication patterns between species. In some species, both MHC class I and II genes were duplicated together, whereas in most species they were duplicated independently. Our study shows that the analysis of long-read-based genomes can dramatically improve our knowledge of MHC structure, although further improvements in chromosome level assembly are needed to understand the evolutionary mechanisms producing the extraordinary interspecific variation in the architecture of the MHC region.",33367721,PMC7875000,10.1093/gbe/evaa270,24
Effective Identification of Bacterial Genomes From Short and Long Read Sequencing Data,"With the development of sequencing technology, microbiological genome sequencing analysis has attracted extensive attention. For inexperienced users without sufficient bioinformatics skills, making sense of sequencing data for microbial identification, especially for bacterial identification, through reads analysis is still challenging. In order to address the challenge of effectively analyzing genomic information, in this paper, we develop an effective approach and automatic bioinformatics pipeline called PBGI for bacterial genome identification, performing automatedly and customized bioinformatics analysis using short-reads or long-reads sequencing data produced by multiple platforms such as Illumina, PacBio and Oxford Nanopore. An evaluation of the proposed approach on the practical data set is presented, showing that PBGI provides a user-friendly way to perform bacterial identification through short or long reads analysis, and could provide accurate analyzing results.

Extension of human lncRNA transcripts by RACE coupled with long-read high-throughput sequencing (RACE-Seq),"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) constitute a large, yet mostly uncharacterized fraction of the mammalian transcriptome. Such characterization requires a comprehensive, high-quality annotation of their gene structure and boundaries, which is currently lacking. Here we describe RACE-Seq, an experimental workflow designed to address this based on RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) and long-read RNA sequencing. We apply RACE-Seq to 398 human lncRNA genes in seven tissues, leading to the discovery of 2,556 on-target, novel transcripts. About 60% of the targeted loci are extended in either 5' or 3', often reaching genomic hallmarks of gene boundaries. Analysis of the novel transcripts suggests that lncRNAs are as long, have as many exons and undergo as much alternative splicing as protein-coding genes, contrary to current assumptions. Overall, we show that RACE-Seq is an effective tool to annotate an organism's deep transcriptome, and compares favourably to other targeted sequencing techniques.",27531712,PMC4992054,10.1038/ncomms12339,39
"Envisioning a new era: Complete genetic information from routine, telomere-to-telomere genomes","Advances in long-read sequencing and assembly now mean that individual labs can generate phased genomes that are more accurate and more contiguous than the original human reference genome. With declining costs and increasing democratization of technology, we suggest that complete genome assemblies, where both parental haplotypes are phased telomere to telomere, will become standard in human genetics. Soon, even in clinical settings where rigorous sample-handling standards must be met, affected individuals could have reference-grade genomes fully sequenced and assembled in just a few hours given advances in technology, computational processing, and annotation. Complete genetic variant discovery will transform how we map, catalog, and associate variation with human disease and fundamentally change our understanding of the genetic diversity of all humans.",37922882,PMC10645551,10.1016/j.ajhg.2023.09.011,1
De NovoGenome Sequence Assemblies ofGossypium raimondiiandGossypium turneri,"Cotton is an agriculturally important crop. Because of its importance, a genome sequence of a diploid cotton species (Gossypium raimondii, D-genome) was first assembled using Sanger sequencing data in 2012. Improvements to DNA sequencing technology have improved accuracy and correctness of assembled genome sequences. Here we report a newde novogenome assembly ofG. raimondiiand its close relativeG. turneriThe two genomes were assembled to a chromosome level using PacBio long-read technology, HiC, and Bionano optical mapping. This report corrects some minor assembly errors found in the Sanger assembly ofG. raimondiiWe also compare the genome sequences of these two species for gene composition, repetitive element composition, and collinearity. Most of the identified structural rearrangements between these two species are due to intra-chromosomal inversions. More inversions were found in theG. turnerigenome sequence than theG. raimondiigenome sequence. These findings and updates to the D-genome sequence will improve accuracy and translation of genomics to cotton breeding and genetics.",31462444,PMC6778788,10.1534/g3.119.400392,38
Evaluation of tools for long read RNA-seq splice-aware alignment,"Motivation:High-throughput sequencing has transformed the study of gene expression levels through RNA-seq, a technique that is now routinely used by various fields, such as genetic research or diagnostics. The advent of third generation sequencing technologies providing significantly longer reads opens up new possibilities. However, the high error rates common to these technologies set new bioinformatics challenges for the gapped alignment of reads to their genomic origin. In this study, we have explored how currently available RNA-seq splice-aware alignment tools cope with increased read lengths and error rates. All tested tools were initially developed for short NGS reads, but some have claimed support for long Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) or even Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) MinION reads.Results:The tools were tested on synthetic and real datasets from two technologies (PacBio and ONT MinION). Alignment quality and resource usage were compared across different aligners. The effect of error correction of long reads was explored, both using self-correction and correction with an external short reads dataset. A tool was developed for evaluating RNA-seq alignment results. This tool can be used to compare the alignment of simulated reads to their genomic origin, or to compare the alignment of real reads to a set of annotated transcripts. Our tests show that while some RNA-seq aligners were unable to cope with long error-prone reads, others produced overall good results.

Dense and accurate whole-chromosome haplotyping of individual genomes,"The diploid nature of the human genome is neglected in many analyses done today, where a genome is perceived as a set of unphased variants with respect to a reference genome. This lack of haplotype-level analyses can be explained by a lack of methods that can produce dense and accurate chromosome-length haplotypes at reasonable costs. Here we introduce an integrative phasing strategy that combines global, but sparse haplotypes obtained from strand-specific single-cell sequencing (Strand-seq) with dense, yet local, haplotype information available through long-read or linked-read sequencing. We provide comprehensive guidance on the required sequencing depths and reliably assign more than 95% of alleles (NA12878) to their parental haplotypes using as few as 10 Strand-seq libraries in combination with 10-fold coverage PacBio data or, alternatively, 10X Genomics linked-read sequencing data. We conclude that the combination of Strand-seq with different technologies represents an attractive solution to chart the genetic variation of diploid genomes.",29101320,PMC5670131,10.1038/s41467-017-01389-4,55
Genomic analyses of multidrug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA1 resequenced by single-molecule real-time sequencing,"As a third-generation sequencing (TGS) method, single-molecule real-time (SMRT) technology provides long read length, and it is well suited for resequencing projects and de novo assembly. In the present study, Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA1 was characterized and resequenced using SMRT technology. PA1 was also subjected to genomic, comparative and pan-genomic analyses. The multidrug resistant strain PA1 possesses a 6,498,072 bp genome and a sequence type of ST-782. The genome of PA1 was also visualized, and the results revealed the details of general genome annotations, virulence factors, regulatory proteins (RPs), secretion system proteins, type II toxin-antitoxin (T-A) pairs and genomic islands. Whole genome comparison analysis suggested that PA1 exhibits similarity to other P. aeruginosa strains but differs in terms of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) regions, such as prophages and genomic islands. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA sequences demonstrated that PA1 is closely related to PAO1, and P. aeruginosa strains can be divided into two main groups. The pan-genome of P. aeruginosa consists of a core genome of approximately 4,000 genes and an accessory genome of at least 6,600 genes. The present study presented a detailed, visualized and comparative analysis of the PA1 genome, to enhance our understanding of this notorious pathogen.",27765811,PMC5293553,10.1042/BSR20160282,8
Short and long-read ultra-deep sequencing profiles emerging heterogeneity across five platform Escherichia coli strains,"Reprogramming organisms for large-scale bioproduction counters their evolutionary objectives of fast growth and often leads to mutational collapse of the engineered production pathways during cultivation. Yet, the mutational susceptibility of academic and industrial Escherichia coli bioproduction host strains are poorly understood. In this study, we apply 2ndand 3rdgeneration deep sequencing to profile simultaneous modes of genetic heterogeneity that decimate engineered biosynthetic production in five popular E. coli hosts BL21(DE3), TOP10, MG1655, W, and W3110 producing 2,3-butanediol and mevalonic acid. Combining short-read and long-read sequencing, we detect strain and sequence-specific mutational modes including single nucleotide polymorphism, inversion, and mobile element transposition, as well as complex structural variations that disrupt the integrity of the engineered biosynthetic pathway. Our analysis suggests that organism engineers should avoid chassis strains hosting active insertion sequence (IS) subfamilies such as IS1 and IS10 present in popular E. coli TOP10. We also recommend monitoring for increased mutagenicity in the pathway transcription initiation regions and recombinogenic repeats. Together, short and long sequencing reads identified latent low-frequency mutation events such as a short detrimental inversion within a pathway gene, driven by 8-bp short inverted repeats. This demonstrates the power of combining ultra-deep DNA sequencing technologies to profile genetic heterogeneities of engineered constructs and explore the markedly different mutational landscapes of common E. coli host strains. The observed multitude of evolving variants underlines the usefulness of early mutational profiling for new synthetic pathways designed to sustain in organisms over long cultivation scales.",33242648,,10.1016/j.ymben.2020.11.006,7
Early MinION™ nanopore single-molecule sequencing technology enables the characterization of hepatitis B virus genetic complexity in clinical samples,"Until recently, the method of choice to characterize viral diversity consisted in cloning PCR amplicons of full-length viral genomes and Sanger-sequencing of multiple clones. However, this is extremely laborious, time-consuming, and low-throughput. Next generation short-read sequencing appears also limited by its inability to directly sequence full-length viral genomes. The MinION™ device recently developed by Oxford Nanopore Technologies can be a promising alternative by applying long-read single-molecule sequencing directly to the overall amplified products generated in a PCR reaction. This new technology was evaluated by using hepatitis B virus (HBV) as a model. Several previously characterized HBV-infected clinical samples were investigated including recombinant virus, variants that harbored deletions and mixed population. Original MinION device was able to generate individual complete 3,200-nt HBV genome sequences and to identify recombinant variants. MinION was particularly efficient in detecting HBV genomes with multiple large in-frame deletions and spliced variants concomitantly with non-deleted parental genomes. However, an average-12% sequencing error rate per individual reads associated to a low throughput challenged single-nucleotide resolution, polymorphism calling and phasing mutations directly from the sequencing reads. Despite this high error rate, the pairwise identity of MinION HBV consensus genome was consistent with Sanger sequencing method. MinION being under continuous development, further studies are needed to evaluate its potential use for viral infection characterization.",29566006,PMC5864009,10.1371/journal.pone.0194366,17
Targeted short read sequencing and assembly of re-arrangements and candidate gene loci provide megabase diplotypes,"The human genome is composed of two haplotypes, otherwise called diplotypes, which denote phased polymorphisms and structural variations (SVs) that are derived from both parents. Diplotypes place genetic variants in the context of cis-related variants from a diploid genome. As a result, they provide valuable information about hereditary transmission, context of SV, regulation of gene expression and other features which are informative for understanding human genetics. Successful diplotyping with short read whole genome sequencing generally requires either a large population or parent-child trio samples. To overcome these limitations, we developed a targeted sequencing method for generating megabase (Mb)-scale haplotypes with short reads. One selects specific 0.1-0.2 Mb high molecular weight DNA targets with custom-designed Cas9-guide RNA complexes followed by sequencing with barcoded linked reads. To test this approach, we designed three assays, targeting the BRCA1 gene, the entire 4-Mb major histocompatibility complex locus and 18 well-characterized SVs, respectively. Using an integrated alignment- and assembly-based approach, we generated comprehensive variant diplotypes spanning the entirety of the targeted loci and characterized SVs with exact breakpoints. Our results were comparable in quality to long read sequencing.",31350896,PMC6821272,10.1093/nar/gkz661,4
Use of Oxford Nanopore MinION to generate full-length sequences of the Blastocystis small subunit (SSU) rRNA gene,"Background:Blastocystis sp. is one of the most common enteric parasites of humans and animals worldwide. It is well recognized that this ubiquitous protist displays a remarkable degree of genetic diversity in the SSU rRNA gene, which is currently the main gene used for defining Blastocystis subtypes. Yet, full-length reference sequences of this gene are available for only 16 subtypes of Blastocystis in part because of the technical difficulties associated with obtaining these sequences from complex samples.Methods:We have developed a method using Oxford Nanopore MinION long-read sequencing and universal eukaryotic primers to produce full-length (> 1800 bp) SSU rRNA gene sequences for Blastocystis. Seven Blastocystis specimens representing five subtypes (ST1, ST4, ST10, ST11, and ST14) obtained both from cultures and feces were used for validation.Results:We demonstrate that this method can be used to produce highly accurate full-length sequences from both cultured and fecal DNA isolates. Full-length sequences were successfully obtained from all five subtypes including ST11 for which no full-length reference sequence currently exists and for an isolate that contained mixed ST10/ST14.Conclusions:The suitability of the use of MinION long-read sequencing technology to successfully generate full-length Blastocystis SSU rRNA gene sequences was demonstrated. The ability to produce full-length SSU rRNA gene sequences is key in understanding the role of genetic diversity in important aspects of Blastocystis biology such as transmission, host specificity, and pathogenicity.",33239096,PMC7687777,10.1186/s13071-020-04484-6,13
"Comparison of Single Molecule, Real-Time Sequencing and Nanopore Sequencing for Analysis of the Size, End-Motif, and Tissue-of-Origin of Long Cell-Free DNA in Plasma","Background:Recent studies using single molecule, real-time (SMRT) sequencing revealed a substantial population of analyzable long cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in plasma. Potential clinical utilities of such long cfDNA in pregnancy and cancer have been demonstrated. However, the performance of different long-read sequencing platforms for the analysis of long cfDNA remains unknown.Methods:Size biases of SMRT sequencing by Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and nanopore sequencing by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) were evaluated using artificial mixtures of sonicated human and mouse DNA of different sizes. cfDNA from plasma samples of pregnant women at different trimesters, hepatitis B carriers, and patients with hepatocellular carcinoma were sequenced with the 2 platforms.Results:Both platforms showed biases to sequence longer (1500 bp vs 200 bp) DNA fragments, with PacBio showing a stronger bias (5-fold overrepresentation of long fragments vs 2-fold in ONT). Percentages of cfDNA fragments 500 bp were around 6-fold higher in PacBio compared with ONT. End motif profiles of cfDNA from PacBio and ONT were similar, yet exhibited platform-dependent patterns. Tissue-of-origin analysis based on single-molecule methylation patterns showed comparable performance on both platforms.Conclusions:SMRT sequencing generated data with higher percentages of long cfDNA compared with nanopore sequencing. Yet, a higher number of long cfDNA fragments eligible for the tissue-of-origin analysis could be obtained from nanopore sequencing due to its much higher throughput. When analyzing the size and end motif of cfDNA, one should be aware of the analytical characteristics and possible biases of the sequencing platforms being used.",36322427,,10.1093/clinchem/hvac180,8
Nanopore long-read RNAseq reveals widespread transcriptional variation among the surface receptors of individual B cells,"Understanding gene regulation and function requires a genome-wide method capable of capturing both gene expression levels and isoform diversity at the single-cell level. Short-read RNAseq is limited in its ability to resolve complex isoforms because it fails to sequence full-length cDNA copies of RNA molecules. Here, we investigate whether RNAseq using the long-read single-molecule Oxford Nanopore MinION sequencer is able to identify and quantify complex isoforms without sacrificing accurate gene expression quantification. After benchmarking our approach, we analyse individual murine B1a cells using a custom multiplexing strategy. We identify thousands of unannotated transcription start and end sites, as well as hundreds of alternative splicing events in these B1a cells. We also identify hundreds of genes expressed across B1a cells that display multiple complex isoforms, including several B cell-specific surface receptors. Our results show that we can identify and quantify complex isoforms at the single cell level.",28722025,PMC5524981,10.1038/ncomms16027,189
DIAMOND + MEGAN Microbiome Analysis,"Metagenomics is the study of microbiomes using DNA sequencing technologies. Basic computational tasks are to determine the taxonomic composition (who is out there?), the functional composition (what can they do?), and also to correlate changes of composition to changes in external parameters (how do they compare?). One approach to address these issues is to first align all sequences against a protein reference database such as NCBI-nr and to then perform taxonomic and functional binning of all sequences based on their alignments. The resulting classifications can then be interactively analyzed and compared. Here we illustrate how to pursue this approach using the DIAMOND+MEGAN pipeline, on two different publicly available datasets, one containing short-read samples and other containing long-read samples.",37258860,,10.1007/978-1-0716-3072-3_6,1
Evaluation of high molecular weight DNA extraction methods for long-read sequencing of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli,"Next generation sequencing has become essential for pathogen characterization and typing. The most popular second generation sequencing technique produces data of high quality with very low error rates and high depths. One major drawback of this technique is the short reads. Indeed, short-read sequencing data of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) are difficult to assemble because of the presence of numerous mobile genetic elements (MGEs), which contain repeated elements. The resulting draft assemblies are often highly fragmented, which results in a loss of information, especially concerning MGEs or large structural variations. The use of long-read sequencing can circumvent these problems and produce complete or nearly complete genomes. The ONT MinION, for its small size and minimal investment requirements, is particularly popular. The ultra-long reads generated with the MinION can easily span prophages and repeat regions. In order to take full advantage of this technology it requires High Molecular Weight (HMW) DNA of high quality in high quantity. In this study, we have tested three different extraction methods: bead-based, solid-phase and salting-out, and evaluated their impact on STEC DNA yield, quality and integrity as well as performance in MinION long-read sequencing. Both the bead-based and salting-out methods allowed the recovery of large quantities of HMW STEC DNA suitable for MinION library preparation. The DNA extracted using the salting-out method consistently produced longer reads in the subsequent MinION runs, compared with the bead-based methods. While both methods performed similarly in subsequent STEC genome assembly, DNA extraction based on salting-out appeared to be the overall best method to produce high quantity of pure HMW STEC DNA for MinION sequencing.",35830426,PMC9278759,10.1371/journal.pone.0270751,4
Highly accurate-single chromosomal complete genomes using IonTorrent and MinION sequencing of clinical pathogens,"Oxford Nanopore MinION sequencing technology has been gaining immense importance in identification of pathogen and antimicrobial resistance, though with 10-15% error rate. Short read technologies generates high accurate genome but with multiple fragments of genome. This study proposes a novel workflow to reduce the indels resulted from MinION long read sequencing by overlaying short read sequences from IonTorrent in the clinical isolates. Best of both techniques were employed which generated highly accurate-single chromosomal microbial genomes with increase in completeness of genomes from 44.5%, 30% and 43% to 98.6%, 98.6% and 96.6% for P. aeruginosa, A. veronii and B. pertussis respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to generate a hybrid of IonTorrent and MinION reads to obtain single chromosomal genomes. This would enable to precisely infer both structural arrangement of genes and SNP based analysis for phylogenetic information.",30978388,,10.1016/j.ygeno.2019.04.006,17
"Telomere length de novo assembly of all 7 chromosomes and mitogenome sequencing of the model entomopathogenic fungus, Metarhizium brunneum, by means of a novel assembly pipeline","Background:More accurate and complete reference genomes have improved understanding of gene function, biology, and evolutionary mechanisms. Hybrid genome assembly approaches leverage benefits of both long, relatively error-prone reads from third-generation sequencing technologies and short, accurate reads from second-generation sequencing technologies, to produce more accurate and contiguous de novo genome assemblies in comparison to using either technology independently. In this study, we present a novel hybrid assembly pipeline that allowed for both mitogenome de novo assembly and telomere length de novo assembly of all 7 chromosomes of the model entomopathogenic fungus, Metarhizium brunneum.Results:The improved assembly allowed for better ab initio gene prediction and a more BUSCO complete proteome set has been generated in comparison to the eight current NCBI reference Metarhizium spp. genomes. Remarkably, we note that including the mitogenome in ab initio gene prediction training improved overall gene prediction. The assembly was further validated by comparing contig assembly agreement across various assemblers, assessing the assembly performance of each tool. Genomic synteny and orthologous protein clusters were compared between Metarhizium brunneum and three other Hypocreales species with complete genomes, identifying core proteins, and listing orthologous protein clusters shared uniquely between the two entomopathogenic fungal species, so as to further facilitate the understanding of molecular mechanisms underpinning fungal-insect pathogenesis.Conclusions:The novel assembly pipeline may be used for other haploid fungal species, facilitating the need to produce high-quality reference fungal genomes, leading to better understanding of fungal genomic evolution, chromosome structuring and gene regulation.",33509090,PMC7842015,10.1186/s12864-021-07390-y,7
Highly Contiguous Genome Assemblies of 15DrosophilaSpecies Generated Using Nanopore Sequencing,"TheDrosophilagenus is a unique group containing a wide range of species that occupy diverse ecosystems. In addition to the most widely studied species,Drosophila melanogaster, many other members in this genus also possess a well-developed set of genetic tools. Indeed, high-quality genomes exist for several species within the genus, facilitating studies of the function and evolution ofcis-regulatory regions and proteins by allowing comparisons across at least 50 million years of evolution. Yet, the available genomes still fail to capture much of the substantial genetic diversity within theDrosophilagenus. We have therefore tested protocols to rapidly and inexpensively sequence and assemble the genome from any Drosophila species using single-molecule sequencing technology from Oxford Nanopore. Here, we use this technology to present highly contiguous genome assemblies of 15 Drosophila species: 10 of the 12 originally sequenced Drosophila species (ananassae,erecta,mojavensis,persimilis,pseudoobscura,sechellia,simulans,virilis,willistoni, andyakuba), four additional species that had previously reported assemblies (biarmipes,bipectinata,eugracilis, andmauritiana), and one novel assembly (triauraria). Genomes were generated from an average of 29x depth-of-coverage data that after assembly resulted in an average contig N50 of 4.4 Mb. Subsequent alignment of contigs from the published reference genomes demonstrates that our assemblies could be used to close over 60% of the gaps present in the currently published reference genomes. Importantly, the materials and reagents cost for each genome was approximately $1,000 (USD). This study demonstrates the power and cost-effectiveness of long-read sequencing for genome assembly in Drosophila and provides a framework for the affordable sequencing and assembly of additional Drosophila genomes.",30087105,PMC6169393,10.1534/g3.118.200160,69
Minimum error correction-based haplotype assembly: Considerations for long read data,"The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is the most widely studied type of genetic variation. A haplotype is defined as the sequence of alleles at SNP sites on each haploid chromosome. Haplotype information is essential in unravelling the genome-phenotype association. Haplotype assembly is a well-known approach for reconstructing haplotypes, exploiting reads generated by DNA sequencing devices. The Minimum Error Correction (MEC) metric is often used for reconstruction of haplotypes from reads. However, problems with the MEC metric have been reported. Here, we investigate the MEC approach to demonstrate that it may result in incorrectly reconstructed haplotypes for devices that produce error-prone long reads. Specifically, we evaluate this approach for devices developed by Illumina, Pacific BioSciences and Oxford Nanopore Technologies. We show that imprecise haplotypes may be reconstructed with a lower MEC than that of the exact haplotype. The performance of MEC is explored for different coverage levels and error rates of data. Our simulation results reveal that in order to avoid incorrect MEC-based haplotypes, a coverage of 25 is needed for reads generated by Pacific BioSciences RS systems.",32530974,PMC7292361,10.1371/journal.pone.0234470,4
WeFaceNano: a user-friendly pipeline for complete ONT sequence assembly and detection of antibiotic resistance in multi-plasmid bacterial isolates,"Background:Bacterial plasmids often carry antibiotic resistance genes and are a significant factor in the spread of antibiotic resistance. The ability to completely assemble plasmid sequences would facilitate the localization of antibiotic resistance genes, the identification of genes that promote plasmid transmission and the accurate tracking of plasmid mobility. However, the complete assembly of plasmid sequences using the currently most widely used sequencing platform (Illumina-based sequencing) is restricted due to the generation of short sequence lengths. The long-read Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing platform overcomes this limitation. Still, the assembly of plasmid sequence data remains challenging due to software incompatibility with long-reads and the error rate generated using ONT sequencing. Bioinformatics pipelines have been developed for ONT-generated sequencing but require computational skills that frequently are beyond the abilities of scientific researchers. To overcome this challenge, the authors developed 'WeFaceNano', a user-friendly Web interFace for rapid assembly and analysis of plasmid DNA sequences generated using the ONT platform. WeFaceNano includes: a read statistics report; two assemblers (Miniasm and Flye); BLAST searching; the detection of antibiotic resistance- and replicon genes and several plasmid visualizations. A user-friendly interface displays the main features of WeFaceNano and gives access to the analysis tools.Results:Publicly available ONT sequence data of 21 plasmids were used to validate WeFaceNano, with plasmid assemblages and anti-microbial resistance gene detection being concordant with the published results. Interestingly, the ""Flye"" assembler with ""meta"" settings generated the most complete plasmids.Conclusions:WeFaceNano is a user-friendly open-source software pipeline suitable for accurate plasmid assembly and the detection of anti-microbial resistance genes in (clinical) samples where multiple plasmids can be present.",34098864,PMC8186029,10.1186/s12866-021-02225-y,1
Long-Read High-Throughput Sequencing (HTS) Revealed That the Sf-Rhabdovirus X+Genome Contains a 3.7 kb Internal Duplication,"We previously reported a novel rhabdovirus produced from theSpodoptera frugiperdaSf9 cell line, designated as Sf-rhabdovirus X+since it contained a unique accessory gene X. The Sf-rhabdovirus X+genome sequence was generated using Sanger sequencing and short-read high-throughput sequencing (HTS). In this study, we have used long-read HTS technologies, PacBio's single-molecule real-time sequencing and Oxford's Nanopore RNA direct sequencing, to analyze the parent Sf9 cell line transcriptome and the virus RNA produced from an X+cell clone, respectively. A unique 3.7 kb duplication was identified in the L gene between nucleotide position 8523 and 8524, preceded by a GA dinucleotide insertion. This duplication contained a partial G gene, the complete X gene, and a partial L gene, which extended from nucleotide positions 4767-8523 in the X+virus. Thus, the X+genome length is 17,361 nucleotides, and we have re-designated the virus as Sf-rhabdovirus X+3.7. The 3.7 kb duplication was found in all Sf9 cell clones producing the X+variant virus. Furthermore, the Sf-rhabdovirus X+3.7genome was stable at passage 30, which was the highest passage tested. These results highlight the importance of combining short-read and long-read technologies for accurately sequencing virus genomes using HTS.",37896775,PMC10612052,10.3390/v15101998,0

Chromosome-level genome assembly of Nibea coibor using PacBio HiFi reads and Hi-C technologies,"Nibea coibor belongs to Sciaenidae and is distributed in the South China Sea, East China Sea, India and the Philippines. In this study, we sequenced the DNA of a male Nibea coibor using PacBio long-read sequencing and generated chromatin interaction data. The genome size of Nibea coibor was estimated to be 611.85~633.88 Mb based on k-mer counts generated with Jellyfish. PacBio sequencing produced 29.26 Gb of HiFi reads, and Hifiasm was used to assemble a 627.60 Mb genome with a contig N50 of 10.66 Mb. We further found the canonical telomeric repeats ""TTAGGG"" to be present at the telomeres of all 24 chromosomes. The completeness of the assembly was estimated to be 98.9% and 97.8% using BUSCO and Merqury, respectively. Using the combination of ab initio prediction, protein homology and RNAseq annotation, we identified a total of 21,433 protein-coding genes. Phylogenetic analyses showed that Nibea coibor and Nibea albiflora are closely related. The results provide an important basis for research on the genetic breeding and genome evolution of Nibea coibor.",36329044,PMC9633807,10.1038/s41597-022-01804-6,2
Comprehensive evaluation of structural variant genotyping methods based on long-read sequencing data,"Background:Structural variants (SVs) play a crucial role in gene regulation, trait association, and disease in humans. SV genotyping has been extensively applied in genomics research and clinical diagnosis. Although a growing number of SV genotyping methods for long reads have been developed, a comprehensive performance assessment of these methods has yet to be done.Results:Based on one simulated and three real SV datasets, we performed an in-depth evaluation of five SV genotyping methods, including cuteSV, LRcaller, Sniffles, SVJedi, and VaPoR. The results show that for insertions and deletions, cuteSV and LRcaller have similar F1 scores (cuteSV, insertions: 0.69-0.90, deletions: 0.77-0.90 and LRcaller, insertions: 0.67-0.87, deletions: 0.74-0.91) and are superior to other methods. For duplications, inversions, and translocations, LRcaller yields the most accurate genotyping results (0.84, 0.68, and 0.47, respectively). When genotyping SVs located in tandem repeat region or with imprecise breakpoints, cuteSV (insertions and deletions) and LRcaller (duplications, inversions, and translocations) are better than other methods. In addition, we observed a decrease in F1 scores when the SV size increased. Finally, our analyses suggest that the F1 scores of these methods reach the point of diminishing returns at 20× depth of coverage.Conclusions:We present an in-depth benchmark study of long-read SV genotyping methods. Our results highlight the advantages and disadvantages of each genotyping method, which provide practical guidance for optimal application selection and prospective directions for tool improvement.",35461238,PMC9034514,10.1186/s12864-022-08548-y,4
Investigating the mitochondrial genomic landscape of Arabidopsis thaliana by long-read sequencing,"Plant mitochondrial genomes have distinctive features compared to those of animals; namely, they are large and divergent, with sizes ranging from hundreds of thousands of to a few million bases. Recombination among repetitive regions is thought to produce similar structures that differ slightly, known as ""multipartite structures,"" which contribute to different phenotypes. Although many reference plant mitochondrial genomes represent almost all the genes in mitochondria, the full spectrum of their structures remains largely unknown. The emergence of long-read sequencing technology is expected to yield this landscape; however, many studies aimed to assemble only one representative circular genome, because properly understanding multipartite structures using existing assemblers is not feasible. To elucidate multipartite structures, we leveraged the information in existing reference genomes and classified long reads according to their corresponding structures. We developed a method that exploits two classic algorithms, partial order alignment (POA) and the hidden Markov model (HMM) to construct a sensitive read classifier. This method enables us to represent a set of reads as a POA graph and analyze it using the HMM. We can then calculate the likelihood of a read occurring in a given cluster, resulting in an iterative clustering algorithm. For synthetic data, our proposed method reliably detected one variation site out of 9,000-bp synthetic long reads with a 15% sequencing-error rate and produced accurate clustering. It was also capable of clustering long reads from six very similar sequences containing only slight differences. For real data, we assembled putative multipartite structures of mitochondrial genomes of Arabidopsis thaliana from nine accessions sequenced using PacBio Sequel. The results indicated that there are recurrent and strain-specific structures in A. thaliana mitochondrial genomes.",33434206,PMC7833223,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008597,1
NONCODE 2016: an informative and valuable data source of long non-coding RNAs,"NONCODE (http://www.bioinfo.org/noncode/) is an interactive database that aims to present the most complete collection and annotation of non-coding RNAs, especially long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs).

Accumulative experimental data also provides more comprehensive knowledge of lncRNA functions. In this update, NONCODE has added six new species, bringing the total to 16 species altogether. The lncRNAs in NONCODE have increased from 210 831 to 527,336. For human and mouse, the lncRNA numbers are 167,150 and 130,558, respectively.

Draft Assembly ofPhytophthora capsicifrom Long-Read Sequencing Uncovers Complexity,"Resolving complex plant pathogen genomes is important for identifying the genomic shifts associated with rapid adaptation to selective agents such as hosts and fungicides, yet assembling these genomes remains challenging and expensive.Phytophthora capsiciis an important, globally distributed plant pathogen that exhibits widespread fungicide resistance and a broad host range. As with other pathogenic oomycetes,P. capsicihas a complex life history and a complex genome. Here, we leverage Oxford Nanopore Technologies and existing short-read resources to rapidly generate a low-cost, improved assembly. We generated 10 Gbp from a single MinION flow cell resulting in >1.25 million reads with an N50of 13 kb. The resulting assembly is 95.2 Mbp in 424 scaffolds with an N50length of 313 kb. This assembly is approximately 30 Mbp bigger than the current reference genome of 64 Mbp. We confirmed this larger genome size using flow cytometry, with an estimated size of 110 Mbp. BUSCO analysis identified 97.4% complete orthologs (19.2% duplicated). Evolutionary analysis supports a recent whole-genome duplication in this group. Our work provides a blueprint for rapidly integrating benchtop long-read sequencing with existing short-read data, to dramatically improve assembly quality and integrity of complex genomes and offer novel insights into pathogen genome function and evolution.",31479390,,10.1094/MPMI-04-19-0103-TA,15
ReorientExpress: reference-free orientation of nanopore cDNA reads with deep learning,"We describe ReorientExpress, a method to perform reference-free orientation of transcriptomic long sequencing reads. ReorientExpress uses deep learning to correctly predict the orientation of the majority of reads, and in particular when trained on a closely related species or in combination with read clustering. ReorientExpress enables long-read transcriptomics in non-model organisms and samples without a genome reference without using additional technologies and is available at https://github.com/comprna/reorientexpress.",31783882,PMC6883653,10.1186/s13059-019-1884-z,6
Cost-Effective Cas9-Mediated Targeted Sequencing of Spinocerebellar Ataxia Repeat Expansions,"Hereditary repeat diseases are caused by an abnormal expansion of short tandem repeats in the genome. Among them, spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) is a heterogeneous disease, and currently, 16 responsible repeats are known. Genetic diagnosis is obtained by analyzing the number of repeats through separate testing of each repeat. Although simultaneous detection of candidate repeats using current massively parallel sequencing technologies has been developed to avoid complicated multiple experiments, these methods are generally expensive. This study developed a cost-effective SCA repeat panel [Flongle SCA repeat panel sequencing (FLO-SCAp)] using Cas9-mediated targeted long-read sequencing and the smallest long-read sequencing apparatus, Flongle. This panel enabled the detection of repeat copy number changes, internal repeat sequences, and DNA methylation in seven patients with different repeat expansion diseases. The median (interquartile range) values of coverage and on-target rate were 39.5 (12 to 72) and 11.6% (7.5% to 16.5%), respectively. This approach was validated by comparing repeat copy number changes measured by FLO-SCAp and short-read whole-genome sequencing. A high correlation was observed between FLO-SCAp and short-read whole-genome sequencing when the repeat length was ≤250 bp (r = 0.98; P < 0.001). Thus, FLO-SCAp represents the most cost-effective method for conducting multiplex testing of repeats and can serve as the first-line diagnostic tool for SCA.",38008286,,10.1016/j.jmoldx.2023.10.004,0
BreakNet: detecting deletions using long reads and a deep learning approach,"Background:Structural variations (SVs) occupy a prominent position in human genetic diversity, and deletions form an important type of SV that has been suggested to be associated with genetic diseases. Although various deletion calling methods based on long reads have been proposed, a new approach is still needed to mine features in long-read alignment information. Recently, deep learning has attracted much attention in genome analysis, and it is a promising technique for calling SVs.Results:In this paper, we propose BreakNet, a deep learning method that detects deletions by using long reads. BreakNet first extracts feature matrices from long-read alignments. Second, it uses a time-distributed convolutional neural network (CNN) to integrate and map the feature matrices to feature vectors. Third, BreakNet employs a bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM) model to analyse the produced set of continuous feature vectors in both the forward and backward directions. Finally, a classification module determines whether a region refers to a deletion. On real long-read sequencing datasets, we demonstrate that BreakNet outperforms Sniffles, SVIM and cuteSV in terms of their F1 scores. The source code for the proposed method is available from GitHub at https://github.com/luojunwei/BreakNet .Conclusions:Our work shows that deep learning can be combined with long reads to call deletions more effectively than existing methods.",34856923,PMC8641175,10.1186/s12859-021-04499-5,4
Scalable Nanopore sequencing of human genomes provides a comprehensive view of haplotype-resolved variation and methylation,"Long-read sequencing technologies substantially overcome the limitations of short-reads but have not been considered as a feasible replacement for population-scale projects, being a combination of too expensive, not scalable enough or too error-prone. Here we develop an efficient and scalable wet lab and computational protocol, Napu, for Oxford Nanopore Technologies long-read sequencing that seeks to address those limitations. We applied our protocol to cell lines and brain tissue samples as part of a pilot project for the National Institutes of Health Center for Alzheimer's and Related Dementias. Using a single PromethION flow cell, we can detect single nucleotide polymorphisms with F1-score comparable to Illumina short-read sequencing. Small indel calling remains difficult within homopolymers and tandem repeats, but achieves good concordance to Illumina indel calls elsewhere. Further, we can discover structural variants with F1-score on par with state-of-the-art de novo assembly methods. Our protocol phases small and structural variants at megabase scales and produces highly accurate, haplotype-specific methylation calls.",37710018,,10.1038/s41592-023-01993-x,24
Robust Benchmark Structural Variant Calls of An Asian Using State-of-the-art Long-read Sequencing Technologies,"The importance of structural variants (SVs) for human phenotypes and diseases is now recognized. Although a variety of SV detection platforms and strategies that vary in sensitivity and specificity have been developed, few benchmarking procedures are available to confidently assess their performances in biological and clinical research. To facilitate the validation and application of these SV detection approaches, we established an Asian reference material by characterizing the genome of an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-immortalized B lymphocyte line along with identified benchmark regions and high-confidence SV calls. We established a high-confidence SV callset with 8938 SVs by integrating four alignment-based SV callers, including 109× Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) continuous long reads (CLRs), 22× PacBio circular consensus sequencing (CCS) reads, 104× Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) long reads, and 114× Bionano optical mapping platform, and one de novo assembly-based SV caller using CCS reads. A total of 544 randomly selected SVs were validated by PCR amplification and Sanger sequencing, demonstrating the robustness of our SV calls. Combining trio-binning-based haplotype assemblies, we established an SV benchmark for identifying false negatives and false positives by constructing the continuous high-confidence regions (CHCRs), which covered 1.46 gigabase pairs (Gb) and 6882 SVs supported by at least one diploid haplotype assembly. Establishing high-confidence SV calls for a benchmark sample that has been characterized by multiple technologies provides a valuable resource for investigating SVs in human biology, disease, and clinical research.",33662625,PMC9510867,10.1016/j.gpb.2020.10.006,5
Robust Detection of Somatic Mosaicism and Repeat Interruptions by Long-Read Targeted Sequencing in Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1,"Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is the most complex and variable trinucleotide repeat disorder caused by an unstable CTG repeat expansion, reaching up to 4000 CTG in the most severe cases. The genetic and clinical variability of DM1 depend on the sex and age of the transmitting parent, but also on the CTG repeat number, presence of repeat interruptions and/or on the degree of somatic instability. Currently, it is difficult to simultaneously and accurately determine these contributing factors in DM1 patients due to the limitations of gold standard methods used in molecular diagnostics and research laboratories. Our study showed the efficiency of the latest PacBio long-read sequencing technology to sequence large CTG trinucleotides, detect multiple and single repeat interruptions and estimate the levels of somatic mosaicism in DM1 patients carrying complex CTG repeat expansions inaccessible to most methods. Using this innovative approach, we revealed the existence of de novo CCG interruptions associated with CTG stabilization/contraction across generations in a new DM1 family. We also demonstrated that our method is suitable to sequence the DM1 locus and measure somatic mosaicism in DM1 families carrying more than 1000 pure CTG repeats. Better characterization of expanded alleles in DM1 patients can significantly improve prognosis and genetic counseling, not only in DM1 but also for other tandem DNA repeat disorders.",33807660,PMC7962047,10.3390/ijms22052616,14
Long amplicon HiFi sequencing for mitochondrial DNA genomes,"Long-read sequencing technology is a powerful approach with application in various genetic and genomic research. Herein, we developed the pipeline for long amplicon high-fidelity (HiFi) sequencing and then applied it for sequencing mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genomes from pools of 79 Tibetan Mastiffs. We amplified the mtDNA genome with long-range PCR using two pairs of primers. Two rounds of circular consensus sequencing (CCS) were conducted and their accuracy was evaluated. The results indicate that the second round of CCS can improve the accuracy of HiFi reads. In addition, the analysis of 79 high-quality mtDNA genomes shows the Tibetan Mastiffs from outside of the Tibetan Plateau experienced hybridization with other dogs. The high quality reads generator (HQGR) software is provided to facilitate data analyses, which is publicly accessible on GitHub (https://github.com/Caizf-script/HQGR). Our long amplicon HiFi sequencing pipeline can also be applied in various target enrichment strategies for small genomes and candidate genes.",36756726,,10.1111/1755-0998.13765,3
Applications of long-read sequencing to Mendelian genetics,"Advances in clinical genetic testing, including the introduction of exome sequencing, have uncovered the molecular etiology for many rare and previously unsolved genetic disorders, yet more than half of individuals with a suspected genetic disorder remain unsolved after complete clinical evaluation. A precise genetic diagnosis may guide clinical treatment plans, allow families to make informed care decisions, and permit individuals to participate in N-of-1 trials; thus, there is high interest in developing new tools and techniques to increase the solve rate. Long-read sequencing (LRS) is a promising technology for both increasing the solve rate and decreasing the amount of time required to make a precise genetic diagnosis. Here, we summarize current LRS technologies, give examples of how they have been used to evaluate complex genetic variation and identify missing variants, and discuss future clinical applications of LRS. As costs continue to decrease, LRS will find additional utility in the clinical space fundamentally changing how pathological variants are discovered and eventually acting as a single-data source that can be interrogated multiple times for clinical service.",37316925,PMC10266321,10.1186/s13073-023-01194-3,12
"A high-quality genome assembly from a single, field-collected spotted lanternfly (Lycorma delicatula) using the PacBio Sequel II system","Background:A high-quality reference genome is an essential tool for applied and basic research on arthropods. Long-read sequencing technologies may be used to generate more complete and contiguous genome assemblies than alternate technologies; however, long-read methods have historically had greater input DNA requirements and higher costs than next-generation sequencing, which are barriers to their use on many samples. Here, we present a 2.3 Gb de novo genome assembly of a field-collected adult female spotted lanternfly (Lycorma delicatula) using a single Pacific Biosciences SMRT Cell. The spotted lanternfly is an invasive species recently discovered in the northeastern United States that threatens to damage economically important crop plants in the region.Results:The DNA from 1 individual was used to make 1 standard, size-selected library with an average DNA fragment size of ∼20 kb. The library was run on 1 Sequel II SMRT Cell 8M, generating a total of 132 Gb of long-read sequences, of which 82 Gb were from unique library molecules, representing ∼36× coverage of the genome. The assembly had high contiguity (contig N50 length = 1.5 Mb), completeness, and sequence level accuracy as estimated by conserved gene set analysis (96.8% of conserved genes both complete and without frame shift errors). Furthermore, it was possible to segregate more than half of the diploid genome into the 2 separate haplotypes. The assembly also recovered 2 microbial symbiont genomes known to be associated with L. delicatula, each microbial genome being assembled into a single contig.Conclusions:We demonstrate that field-collected arthropods can be used for the rapid generation of high-quality genome assemblies, an attractive approach for projects on emerging invasive species, disease vectors, or conservation efforts of endangered species.",31609423,PMC6791401,10.1093/gigascience/giz122,16
HLA/MHC and KIR characterization in humans and non-human primates using Oxford Nanopore Technologies and Pacific Biosciences sequencing platforms,"The gene products of the HLA/MHC and KIR multigene families are important modulators of the immune system and are associated with health and disease. Characterization of the genes encoding these receptors has been integrated into different biomedical applications, including transplantation and reproduction biology, immune therapies and in fundamental research into disease susceptibility or resistance. Conventional short-read sequencing strategies have shown their value in high throughput typing, but are insufficient to uncover the entire complexity of the highly polymorphic HLA/MHC and KIR gene systems. The implementation of single-molecule and real-time sequencing platforms, offered by Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), revolutionized the fields of genomics and transcriptomics. Using fundamentally distinct principles, these platforms generate long-read data that can unwire the plasticity of the HLA/MHC and KIR genes, including high-resolution characterization of genes, alleles, phased haplotypes, transcription levels and epigenetics modification patterns. These insights might have profound clinical relevance, such as improved matching of donors and patients in clinical transplantation, but could also lift disease association studies to a higher level. Even more, a comprehensive characterization may refine animal models in preclinical studies. In this review, the different HLA/MHC and KIR characterization approaches using PacBio and ONT platforms are described and discussed.",36583332,,10.1111/tan.14957,0
Using de novo assembly to identify structural variation of eight complex immune system gene regions,"Driven by the necessity to survive environmental pathogens, the human immune system has evolved exceptional diversity and plasticity, to which several factors contribute including inheritable structural polymorphism of the underlying genes. Characterizing this variation is challenging due to the complexity of these loci, which contain extensive regions of paralogy, segmental duplication and high copy-number repeats, but recent progress in long-read sequencing and optical mapping techniques suggests this problem may now be tractable. Here we assess this by using long-read sequencing platforms from PacBio and Oxford Nanopore, supplemented with short-read sequencing and Bionano optical mapping, to sequence DNA extracted from CD14+ monocytes and peripheral blood mononuclear cells from a single European individual identified as HV31. We use this data to build a de novo assembly of eight genomic regions encoding four key components of the immune system, namely the human leukocyte antigen, immunoglobulins, T cell receptors, and killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors. Validation of our assembly using k-mer based and alignment approaches suggests that it has high accuracy, with estimated base-level error rates below 1 in 10 kb, although we identify a small number of remaining structural errors. We use the assembly to identify heterozygous and homozygous structural variation in comparison to GRCh38. Despite analyzing only a single individual, we find multiple large structural variants affecting core genes at all three immunoglobulin regions and at two of the three T cell receptor regions. Several of these variants are not accurately callable using current algorithms, implying that further methodological improvements are needed. Our results demonstrate that assessing haplotype variation in these regions is possible given sufficiently accurate long-read and associated data. Continued reductions in the cost of these technologies will enable application of these methods to larger samples and provide a broader catalogue of germline structural variation at these loci, an important step toward making these regions accessible to large-scale genetic association studies.",34343164,PMC8363018,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009254,17
RNA sequencing: the teenage years,"Over the past decade, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has become an indispensable tool for transcriptome-wide analysis of differential gene expression and differential splicing of mRNAs. However, as next-generation sequencing technologies have developed, so too has RNA-seq. Now, RNA-seq methods are available for studying many different aspects of RNA biology, including single-cell gene expression, translation (the translatome) and RNA structure (the structurome). Exciting new applications are being explored, such as spatial transcriptomics (spatialomics). Together with new long-read and direct RNA-seq technologies and better computational tools for data analysis, innovations in RNA-seq are contributing to a fuller understanding of RNA biology, from questions such as when and where transcription occurs to the folding and intermolecular interactions that govern RNA function.",31341269,,10.1038/s41576-019-0150-2,678
High-resolution phylogenetic microbial community profiling,"Over the past decade, high-throughput short-read 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing has eclipsed clone-dependent long-read Sanger sequencing for microbial community profiling. The transition to new technologies has provided more quantitative information at the expense of taxonomic resolution with implications for inferring metabolic traits in various ecosystems. We applied single-molecule real-time sequencing for microbial community profiling, generating full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences at high throughput, which we propose to name PhyloTags. We benchmarked and validated this approach using a defined microbial community. When further applied to samples from the water column of meromictic Sakinaw Lake, we show that while community structures at the phylum level are comparable between PhyloTags and Illumina V4 16S rRNA gene sequences (iTags), variance increases with community complexity at greater water depths. PhyloTags moreover allowed less ambiguous classification. Last, a platform-independent comparison of PhyloTags and in silico generated partial 16S rRNA gene sequences demonstrated significant differences in community structure and phylogenetic resolution across multiple taxonomic levels, including a severe underestimation in the abundance of specific microbial genera involved in nitrogen and methane cycling across the Lake's water column. Thus, PhyloTags provide a reliable adjunct or alternative to cost-effective iTags, enabling more accurate phylogenetic resolution of microbial communities and predictions on their metabolic potential.",26859772,PMC5029162,10.1038/ismej.2015.249,98
Comparative genomics of the Western Hemisphere soft tick-borne relapsing fever borreliae highlights extensive plasmid diversity,"Background:Tick-borne relapsing fever (TBRF) is a globally prevalent, yet under-studied vector-borne disease transmitted by soft and hard bodied ticks. While soft TBRF (sTBRF) spirochetes have been described for over a century, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms facilitating vector and host adaptation is poorly understood. This is due to the complexity of their small (~ 1.5 Mb) but fragmented genomes that typically consist of a linear chromosome and both linear and circular plasmids. A majority of sTBRF spirochete genomes' plasmid sequences are either missing or are deposited as unassembled sequences. Consequently, our goal was to generate complete, plasmid-resolved genomes for a comparative analysis of sTBRF species of the Western Hemisphere.Results:Utilizing a Borrelia specific pipeline, genomes of sTBRF spirochetes from the Western Hemisphere were sequenced and assembled using a combination of short- and long-read sequencing technologies. Included in the analysis were the two recently isolated species from Central and South America, Borrelia puertoricensis n. sp. and Borrelia venezuelensis, respectively. Plasmid analyses identified diverse sequences that clustered plasmids into 30 families; however, only three families were conserved and syntenic across all species. We also compared two species, B. venezuelensis and Borrelia turicatae, which were isolated ~ 6,800 km apart and from different tick vector species but were previously reported to be genetically similar.Conclusions:To truly understand the biological differences observed between species of TBRF spirochetes, complete chromosome and plasmid sequences are needed. This comparative genomic analysis highlights high chromosomal synteny across the species yet diverse plasmid composition. This was particularly true for B. turicatae and B. venezuelensis, which had high average nucleotide identity yet extensive plasmid diversity. These findings are foundational for future endeavors to evaluate the role of plasmids in vector and host adaptation.",35641918,PMC9158201,10.1186/s12864-022-08523-7,8
Diversity of genetic platforms harboring the blaPER-2gene in Enterobacterales and insights into the role of ISPa12 in its mobilization and dissemination,"The production of PER-like extended-spectrum β-lactamases has recently been associated with reduced susceptibility to the last resort drugs aztreonam/avibactam and cefiderocol. PER-2 has been mainly confined to Argentina and neighboring countries. Until now, only three plasmids harboring blaPER-2genes have been characterized but very little is known about the involvement of different plasmid groups in its dissemination. The diversity of genetic platforms associated with blaPER-2genes from a collection of PER-producing Enterobacterales was analysed by describing the close environment and the plasmid backbones. Full sequences of 11 plasmids were obtained by short read (Illumina) and long read (Oxford Nanopore or PacBio) sequencing technologies. De novo assemblies, annotation and sequence analysis were performed by Unicycler, Prokka and BLAST. Plasmid analysis revealed that the blaPER-2gene is encoded on plasmids of different incompatibility groups (A, C, FIB, HI1B, N2), indicating that this gene may have been disseminated through a variety of plasmids. Comparison with the few publicly available nucleotide sequences describing the blaPER-2genetic environment, including those from the environmental species Pararheinheimera spp. (considered as the progenitor of blaPERgenes), indicates a role of ISPa12 in blaPER-2gene mobilization from the chromosome of Pararheinheimera spp. Also, the blaPER-2gene was carried by a novel ISPa12-composite transposon, Tn7390. In addition, its association with ISKox2-like elements in the close genetic environment in all plasmids analysed suggests a role of these insertion sequence elements in further dissemination of blaPER-2genes.",37178777,,10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2023.106850,0
Finding Nemo: hybrid assembly with Oxford Nanopore and Illumina reads greatly improves the clownfish (Amphiprion ocellaris) genome assembly,"Background:Some of the most widely recognized coral reef fishes are clownfish or anemonefish, members of the family Pomacentridae (subfamily: Amphiprioninae). They are popular aquarium species due to their bright colours, adaptability to captivity, and fascinating behavior. Their breeding biology (sequential hermaphrodites) and symbiotic mutualism with sea anemones have attracted much scientific interest. Moreover, there are some curious geographic-based phenotypes that warrant investigation. Leveraging on the advancement in Nanopore long read technology, we report the first hybrid assembly of the clown anemonefish (Amphiprion ocellaris) genome utilizing Illumina and Nanopore reads, further demonstrating the substantial impact of modest long read sequencing data sets on improving genome assembly statistics.Results:We generated 43 Gb of short Illumina reads and 9 Gb of long Nanopore reads, representing approximate genome coverage of 54× and 11×, respectively, based on the range of estimated k-mer-predicted genome sizes of between 791 and 967 Mbp. The final assembled genome is contained in 6404 scaffolds with an accumulated length of 880 Mb (96.3% BUSCO-calculated genome completeness). Compared with the Illumina-only assembly, the hybrid approach generated 94% fewer scaffolds with an 18-fold increase in N50 length (401 kb) and increased the genome completeness by an additional 16%. A total of 27 240 high-quality protein-coding genes were predicted from the clown anemonefish, 26 211 (96%) of which were annotated functionally with information from either sequence homology or protein signature searches.Conclusions:We present the first genome of any anemonefish and demonstrate the value of low coverage (∼11×) long Nanopore read sequencing in improving both genome assembly contiguity and completeness. The near-complete assembly of the A. ocellaris genome will be an invaluable molecular resource for supporting a range of genetic, genomic, and phylogenetic studies specifically for clownfish and more generally for other related fish species of the family Pomacentridae.",29342277,PMC5848817,10.1093/gigascience/gix137,48
Long-read targeted sequencing uncovers clinicopathological associations for C9orf72-linked diseases,"To examine the length of a hexanucleotide expansion in C9orf72, which represents the most frequent genetic cause of frontotemporal lobar degeneration and motor neuron disease, we employed a targeted amplification-free long-read sequencing technology: No-Amp sequencing. In our cross-sectional study, we assessed cerebellar tissue from 28 well-characterized C9orf72 expansion carriers. We obtained 3507 on-target circular consensus sequencing reads, of which 814 bridged the C9orf72 repeat expansion (23%). Importantly, we observed a significant correlation between expansion sizes obtained using No-Amp sequencing and Southern blotting (P = 5.0 × 10-4). Interestingly, we also detected a significant survival advantage for individuals with smaller expansions (P = 0.004). Additionally, we uncovered that smaller expansions were significantly associated with higher levels of C9orf72 transcripts containing intron 1b (P = 0.003), poly(GP) proteins (P = 1.3 × 10- 5), and poly(GA) proteins (P = 0.005). Thorough examination of the composition of the expansion revealed that its GC content was extremely high (median: 100%) and that it was mainly composed of GGGGCC repeats (median: 96%), suggesting that expanded C9orf72 repeats are quite pure. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that No-Amp sequencing is a powerful tool that enables the discovery of relevant clinicopathological associations, highlighting the important role played by the cerebellar size of the expanded repeat in C9orf72-linked diseases.",33889947,PMC8105038,10.1093/brain/awab006,12
Targeted long-read sequencing allows for rapid identification of pathogenic disease-causing variants in retinoblastoma,"Background:Identification of disease-causing variants of the retinoblastoma gene (RB1), the predominant cause of retinoblastoma, is challenging. Targeted long-read genome sequencing offers a novel approach to resolve the diverse range of pathogenic variants in RB1 and provides haplotype information rapidly.Materials and methods:Genomic DNA was isolated from a venipuncture blood draw of a retinoblastoma patient. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) was carried out using the short-read Ilumina platform. WGS and targeted sequencing of RB1 was accomplished using the long-read Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) platform. Deep-learning frameworks allowed haplotagging, variant calling, and variant annotation of both short- and long-read data.Results:Targeted long-read sequencing of the RB1 gene allowed for enhanced depth of read coverage for discovery of rare variants and haplotype analysis. A duplication leading to a frameshift and early termination in RB1 was identified as the most deleterious variant by all sequencing methods, with long-read technology providing additional information of methylation signal and haplotype information. More importantly, there was greater than 98% concordance of RB1 variants identified between short-read and targeted long-read sequencing modalities.Conclusions:Targeted long-read technology allows for focused sequencing effort for variant discovery. Application of this for the first time in a retinoblastoma patient allowed haplotagged variant identification and demonstrated excellent concordance with benchmark short-read sequencing. The added benefit of targeted long-read sequencing to resolve disease-causing genomic variation in RB1 rapidly from a blood draw will provide a more definitive diagnosis of heritable RB and guide management decisions for patients and their families.",36325802,,10.1080/13816810.2022.2141797,2
Dynamic transcriptome profiling dataset of vaccinia virus obtained from long-read sequencing techniques,"Background:Poxviruses are large DNA viruses that infect humans and animals. Vaccinia virus (VACV) has been applied as a live vaccine for immunization against smallpox, which was eradicated by 1980 as a result of worldwide vaccination. VACV is the prototype of poxviruses in the investigation of the molecular pathogenesis of the virus. Short-read sequencing methods have revolutionized transcriptomics; however, they are not efficient in distinguishing between the RNA isoforms and transcript overlaps. Long-read sequencing (LRS) is much better suited to solve these problems and also allow direct RNA sequencing. Despite the scientific relevance of VACV, no LRS data have been generated for the viral transcriptome to date.Findings:For the deep characterization of the VACV RNA profile, various LRS platforms and library preparation approaches were applied. The raw reads were mapped to the VACV reference genome and also to the host (Chlorocebus sabaeus) genome. In this study, we applied the Pacific Biosciences RSII and Sequel platforms, which altogether resulted in 937,531 mapped reads of inserts (1.42 Gb), while we obtained 2,160,348 aligned reads (1.75 Gb) from the different library preparation methods using the MinION device from Oxford Nanopore Technologies.Conclusions:By applying cutting-edge technologies, we were able to generate a large dataset that can serve as a valuable resource for the investigation of the dynamic VACV transcriptome, the virus-host interactions, and RNA base modifications. These data can provide useful information for novel gene annotations in the VACV genome. Our dataset can also be used to analyze the currently available LRS platforms, library preparation methods, and bioinformatics pipelines.",30476066,PMC6290886,10.1093/gigascience/giy139,16
"Assembly of an early-matured japonica (Geng) rice genome, Suijing18, based on PacBio and Illumina sequencing","The early-matured japonica (Geng) rice variety, Suijing18 (SJ18), carries multiple elite traits including durable blast resistance, good grain quality, and high yield. Using PacBio SMRT technology, we produced over 25 Gb of long-read sequencing raw data from SJ18 with a coverage of 62×. Using Illumina paired-end whole-genome shotgun sequencing technology, we generated 59 Gb of short-read sequencing data from SJ18 (23.6 Gb from a 200 bp library with a coverage of 59× and 35.4 Gb from an 800 bp library with a coverage of 88×). With these data, we assembled a single SJ18 genome and then generated a set of annotation data. These data sets can be used to test new programs for variation deep mining, and will provide new insights into the genome structure, function, and evolution of SJ18, and will provide essential support for biological research in general.",29257136,PMC5735919,10.1038/sdata.2017.195,6
Determination of isoform-specific RNA structure with nanopore long reads,"Current methods for determining RNA structure with short-read sequencing cannot capture most differences between distinct transcript isoforms. Here we present RNA structure analysis using nanopore sequencing (PORE-cupine), which combines structure probing using chemical modifications with direct long-read RNA sequencing and machine learning to detect secondary structures in cellular RNAs. PORE-cupine also captures global structural features, such as RNA-binding-protein binding sites and reactivity differences at single-nucleotide variants. We show that shared sequences in different transcript isoforms of the same gene can fold into different structures, highlighting the importance of long-read sequencing for obtaining phase information. We also demonstrate that structural differences between transcript isoforms of the same gene lead to differences in translation efficiency. By revealing isoform-specific RNA structure, PORE-cupine will deepen understanding of the role of structures in controlling gene regulation.",33106685,,10.1038/s41587-020-0712-z,45
Transcript Isoform-Specific Estimation of Poly(A) Tail Length by Nanopore Sequencing of Native RNA,"The poly(A) tail is a homopolymeric stretch of adenosine at the 3'-end of mature RNA transcripts and its length plays an important role in nuclear export, stability, and translational regulation of mRNA. Existing techniques for genome-wide estimation of poly(A) tail length are based on short-read sequencing. These methods are limited because they sequence a synthetic DNA copy of mRNA instead of the native transcripts. Furthermore, they can identify only a short segment of the transcript proximal to the poly(A) tail which makes it difficult to assign the measured poly(A) length uniquely to a single transcript isoform. With the introduction of native RNA sequencing by Oxford Nanopore Technologies, it is now possible to sequence full-length native RNA. A single long read contains both the transcript and the associated poly(A) tail, thereby making transcriptome-wide isoform-specific poly(A) tail length assessment feasible. We developed tailfindr-an R-based package for estimating poly(A) tail length from Oxford Nanopore sequencing data. In this chapter, we describe in detail the pipeline for transcript isoform-specific poly(A) tail profiling based on native RNA Nanopore sequencing-from library preparation to downstream data analysis with tailfindr.",33835463,,10.1007/978-1-0716-1307-8_30,4
Ratatosk: hybrid error correction of long reads enables accurate variant calling and assembly,"A major challenge to long read sequencing data is their high error rate of up to 15%. We present Ratatosk, a method to correct long reads with short read data. We demonstrate on 5 human genome trios that Ratatosk reduces the error rate of long reads 6-fold on average with a median error rate as low as 0.22 %. SNP calls in Ratatosk corrected reads are nearly 99 % accurate and indel calls accuracy is increased by up to 37 %.

High-throughput amplicon sequencing of the full-length 16S rRNA gene with single-nucleotide resolution,"Targeted PCR amplification and high-throughput sequencing (amplicon sequencing) of 16S rRNA gene fragments is widely used to profile microbial communities. New long-read sequencing technologies can sequence the entire 16S rRNA gene, but higher error rates have limited their attractiveness when accuracy is important. Here we present a high-throughput amplicon sequencing methodology based on PacBio circular consensus sequencing and the DADA2 sample inference method that measures the full-length 16S rRNA gene with single-nucleotide resolution and a near-zero error rate. In two artificial communities of known composition, our method recovered the full complement of full-length 16S sequence variants from expected community members without residual errors. The measured abundances of intra-genomic sequence variants were in the integral ratios expected from the genuine allelic variants within a genome. The full-length 16S gene sequences recovered by our approach allowed Escherichia coli strains to be correctly classified to the O157:H7 and K12 sub-species clades. In human fecal samples, our method showed strong technical replication and was able to recover the full complement of 16S rRNA alleles in several E. coli strains. There are likely many applications beyond microbial profiling for which high-throughput amplicon sequencing of complete genes with single-nucleotide resolution will be of use.",31269198,PMC6765137,10.1093/nar/gkz569,182
Utility of long-read sequencing for All of Us,"The All of Us (AoU) initiative aims to sequence the genomes of over one million Americans from diverse ethnic backgrounds to improve personalized medical care. In a recent technical pilot, we compare the performance of traditional short-read sequencing with long-read sequencing in a small cohort of samples from the HapMap project and two AoU control samples representing eight datasets. Our analysis reveals substantial differences in the ability of these technologies to accurately sequence complex medically relevant genes, particularly in terms of gene coverage and pathogenic variant identification. We also consider the advantages and challenges of using low coverage sequencing to increase sample numbers in large cohort analysis. Our results show that HiFi reads produce the most accurate results for both small and large variants. Further, we present a cloud-based pipeline to optimize SNV, indel and SV calling at scale for long-reads analysis. These results lead to widespread improvements across AoU.",38281971,PMC10822842,10.1038/s41467-024-44804-3,6
Best Practices in Microbial Experimental Evolution: Using Reporters and Long-Read Sequencing to Identify Copy Number Variation in Experimental Evolution,"Copy number variants (CNVs), comprising gene amplifications and deletions, are a pervasive class of heritable variation. CNVs play a key role in rapid adaptation in both natural, and experimental, evolution. However, despite the advent of new DNA sequencing technologies, detection and quantification of CNVs in heterogeneous populations has remained challenging. Here, we summarize recent advances in the use of CNV reporters that provide a facile means of quantifying de novo CNVs at a specific locus in the genome, and nanopore sequencing, for resolving the often complex structures of CNVs. We provide guidance for the engineering and analysis of CNV reporters and practical guidelines for single-cell analysis of CNVs using flow cytometry. We summarize recent advances in nanopore sequencing, discuss the utility of this technology, and provide guidance for the bioinformatic analysis of these data to define the molecular structure of CNVs. The combination of reporter systems for tracking and isolating CNV lineages and long-read DNA sequencing for characterizing CNV structures enables unprecedented resolution of the mechanisms by which CNVs are generated and their evolutionary dynamics.",37012421,PMC10275804,10.1007/s00239-023-10102-7,2
Principal Component Analysis of Alternative Splicing Profiles Revealed by Long-Read ONT Sequencing in Human Liver Tissue and Hepatocyte-Derived HepG2 and Huh7 Cell Lines,"The long-read RNA sequencing developed by Oxford Nanopore Technology provides a direct quantification of transcript isoforms. That makes the number of transcript isoforms per gene an intrinsically suitable metric for alternative splicing (AS) profiling in the application to this particular type of RNA sequencing. By using this simple metric and recruiting principal component analysis (PCA) as a tool to visualize the high-dimensional transcriptomic data, we were able to group biospecimens of normal human liver tissue and hepatocyte-derived malignant HepG2 and Huh7 cells into clear clusters in a 2D space. For the transcriptome-wide analysis, the clustering was observed regardless whether all genes were included in analysis or only those expressed in all biospecimens tested. However, in the application to a particular set of genes known as pharmacogenes, which are involved in drug metabolism, the clustering worsened dramatically in the latter case. Based on PCA data, the subsets of genes most contributing to biospecimens' grouping into clusters were selected and subjected to gene ontology analysis that allowed us to determine the top 20 biological processes among which translation and processes related to its regulation dominate. The suggested metrics can be a useful addition to the existing metrics for describing AS profiles, especially in application to transcriptome studies with long-read sequencing.",37958484,PMC10648607,10.3390/ijms242115502,1
High-Quality Genome Resource ofFusarium pseudograminearumIsolate Fp22-2 by Oxford Nanopore Long-Read Sequencing,"Fusarium crown rot (FCR), caused byFusarium pseudograminearum, results in severe yield and quality losses of cereal crops in many arid and semiarid areas of the world. Limited information about the genome ofF. pseudograminearumrestricts the pathogenesis research and breeding of disease-resistant wheat varieties. In this study, a high-quality genome assembly ofF. pseudograminearumisolate Fp22-2 was generated using Oxford Nanopore long-read sequencing technology. The assembled nuclear genome of Fp22-2 is 37.33 Mb with a repeat content of 3.69% and is divided into four contigs with a k-mer completeness score of 97.2% and a base quality accuracy of >99.99%. A total of 14,475 protein-coding genes (BUSCO completeness score, 99.9%) were predicted and functionally annotated. Moreover, genes encoding pathogenic proteins, including effector proteins and carbohydrate-active enzymes, and secondary metabolic gene clusters were identified. Overall, the high-quality genome assembly and gene annotation provided here will allow further investigation of the biology ofF. pseudograminearumand lead to the development of new control options for FCR.",36510423,,10.1094/PDIS-09-22-2034-A,0
Detecting a long insertion variant in SAMD12 by SMRT sequencing: implications of long-read whole-genome sequencing for repeat expansion diseases,"Long-read sequencing technology is now capable of reading single-molecule DNA with an average read length of more than 10 kb, fully enabling the coverage of large structural variations (SVs). This advantage may pave the way for the detection of unprecedented SVs as well as repeat expansions. Pathogenic SVs of only known genes used to be selectively analyzed based on prior knowledge of target DNA sequence. The unbiased application of long-read whole-genome sequencing (WGS) for the detection of pathogenic SVs has just begun. Here, we apply PacBio SMRT sequencing in a Japanese family with benign adult familial myoclonus epilepsy (BAFME). Our SV selection of low-coverage WGS data (7×) narrowed down the candidates to only six SVs in a 7.16-Mb region of the BAFME1 locus and correctly determined an approximately 4.6-kb SAMD12 intronic repeat insertion, which is causal of BAFME1. These results indicate that long-read WGS is potentially useful for evaluating all of the known SVs in a genome and identifying new disease-causing SVs in combination with other genetic methods to resolve the genetic causes of currently unexplained diseases.",30559482,,10.1038/s10038-018-0551-7,21
"A graphical, interactive and GPU-enabled workflow to process long-read sequencing data","Background:Long-read sequencing has great promise in enabling portable, rapid molecular-assisted cancer diagnoses. A key challenge in democratizing long-read sequencing technology in the biomedical and clinical community is the lack of graphical bioinformatics software tools which can efficiently process the raw nanopore reads, support graphical output and interactive visualizations for interpretations of results. Another obstacle is that high performance software tools for long-read sequencing data analyses often leverage graphics processing units (GPU), which is challenging and time-consuming to configure, especially on the cloud.Results:We present a graphical cloud-enabled workflow for fast, interactive analysis of nanopore sequencing data using GPUs. Users customize parameters, monitor execution and visualize results through an accessible graphical interface. The workflow and its components are completely containerized to ensure reproducibility and facilitate installation of the GPU-enabled software. We also provide an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) with all software and drivers pre-installed for GPU computing on the cloud. Most importantly, we demonstrate the potential of applying our software tools to reduce the turnaround time of cancer diagnostics by generating blood cancer (NB4, K562, ME1, 238 MV4;11) cell line Nanopore data using the Flongle adapter. We observe a 29x speedup and a 93x reduction in costs for the rate-limiting basecalling step in the analysis of blood cancer cell line data.Conclusions:Our interactive and efficient software tools will make analyses of Nanopore data using GPU and cloud computing accessible to biomedical and clinical scientists, thus facilitating the adoption of cost effective, fast, portable and real-time long-read sequencing.",34425749,PMC8381503,10.1186/s12864-021-07927-1,5
Single-Molecule Long-Read Sequencing Reveals the Diversity of Full-Length Transcripts in Leaves ofGnetum(Gnetales),"The limitations of RNA sequencing make it difficult to accurately predict alternative splicing (AS) and alternative polyadenylation (APA) events and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), all of which reveal transcriptomic diversity and the complexity of gene regulation.Gnetum, a genus with ambiguous phylogenetic placement in seed plants, has a distinct stomatal structure and photosynthetic characteristics. In this study, a full-length transcriptome ofGnetum luofuenseleaves at different developmental stages was sequenced with the latest PacBio Sequel platform. After correction by short reads generated by Illumina RNA-Seq, 80,496 full-length transcripts were obtained, of which 5269 reads were identified as isoforms of novel genes. Additionally, 1660 lncRNAs and 12,998 AS events were detected. In total, 5647 genes in theG. luofuenseleaves had APA featured by at least one poly(A) site. Moreover, 67 and 30 genes from thebHLHgene family, which play an important role in stomatal development and photosynthesis, were identified from theG. luofuensegenome and leaf transcripts, respectively. This leaf transcriptome supplements the reference genome ofG. luofuense, and the AS events and lncRNAs detected provide valuable resources for future studies of investigating low photosynthetic capacity ofGnetum.",31861078,PMC6941099,10.3390/ijms20246350,6
rRNA Analysis Based on Long-Read High-Throughput Sequencing Reveals a More Accurate Diagnostic for the Bacterial Infection of Ascites,"Traditional pathogenic diagnosis presents defects such as a low positivity rate, inability to identify uncultured microorganisms, and time-consuming nature. Clinical metagenomics next-generation sequencing can be used to detect any pathogen, compensating for the shortcomings of traditional pathogenic diagnosis. We report third-generation long-read sequencing results and second-generation short-read sequencing results for ascitic fluid from a patient with liver ascites and compared the two types of sequencing results with the results of traditional clinical microbial culture. The distribution of pathogenic microbial species revealed by the two types of sequencing results was quite different, and the third-generation sequencing results were consistent with the results of traditional microbial culture, which can effectively guide subsequent treatment. Short reads, the lack of amplification, and enrichment to amplify signals from trace pathogens, and host background noise may be the reasons for the high error in the second-generation short-read sequencing results. Therefore, we propose that long-read-based rRNA analysis technology is superior to the short-read shotgun-based metagenomics method in the identification of pathogenic bacteria.",34869767,PMC8642000,10.1155/2021/6287280,0
Biofoundry-Scale DNA Assembly Validation Using Cost-Effective High-Throughput Long-Read Sequencing,"Biofoundries are automated high-throughput facilities specializing in the design, construction, and testing of engineered/synthetic DNA constructs (plasmids), often from genetic parts. A critical step of this process is assessing the fidelity of the assembled DNA construct to the desired design. Current methods utilized for this purpose are restriction digest or PCR followed by fragment analysis and sequencing. The Edinburgh Genome Foundry (EGF) has recently established a single-molecule sequencing quality control step using the Oxford Nanopore sequencing technology, along with a companion Nextflow pipeline and a Python package, to perform in-depth analysis and generate a detailed report. Our software enables researchers working with plasmids, including biofoundry scientists, to rapidly analyze and interpret sequencing data. In conclusion, we have created a laboratory and software protocol that validates assembled, cloned, or edited plasmids, using Nanopore long-reads, which can serve as a useful resource for the genetics, synthetic biology, and sequencing communities.",38329009,PMC10877595,10.1021/acssynbio.3c00589,1
Long-read sequencing for reliably calling themompSallele inLegionella pneumophilasequence-based typing,"Sequence-based typing (SBT) ofLegionella pneumophilais a valuable tool in epidemiological studies and outbreak investigations of Legionnaires' disease. In theL. pneumophilaSBT scheme,mompS2is one of seven genes that determine the sequence type (ST). TheLegionellagenome typically contains two copies ofmompS (mompS1andmompS2).When they are non-identical it can be challenging to determine themompS2allele, and subsequently the ST, from Illumina short-reads. In our collection of 233L. pneumophilagenomes, there were 62 STs, 18 of which carried non-identicalmompScopies. Using short-reads, themompS2allele was misassembled or untypeable in several STs. Genomes belonging to ST154 and ST574, which carriedmompS1allele 7 andmompS2allele 15, were assigned an incorrectmompS2allele and/ormompSgene copy number when short-read assembled. For other isolates, mainly those carrying non-identicalmompScopies, short-read assemblers occasionally failed to resolve the structure of themompS-region, also resulting in untypeability from the short-read data. In this study, we wanted to understand the challenges we observed with calling themompS2 allele from short-reads, assess if other short-read methods were able to resolve themompS-region, and investigate the possibility of using long-reads to obtain themompSalleles, and thereby performL. pneumophilaSBT from long-reads only. We found that the choice of short-read assembler had a major impact on resolving themompS-region and thus SBT from short-reads, but no method consistently solved themompS2allele. By using Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) sequencing together with Trycycler and Medaka for long-read assembly and polishing we were able to resolve themompScopies and correctly identify themompS2allele, in accordance with Sanger sequencing/EQA results for all tested isolates (n=35). The remaining six genes of the SBT profile could also be determined from the ONT-only reads. The STs called from ONT-only assemblies were also consistent with hybrid-assemblies of Illumina and ONT reads. We therefore propose ONT sequencing as an alternative method to performL. pneumophilaSBT to overcome themompSchallenge observed with short-reads. To facilitate this, we have developed ONTmompS (https://github.com/marithetland/ONTmompS), anin silicoapproach to determineL. pneumophilaST from long-read or hybrid assemblies.",37256104,PMC10226664,10.3389/fcimb.2023.1176182,0
Assignment of virus and antimicrobial resistance genes to microbial hosts in a complex microbial community by combined long-read assembly and proximity ligation,"We describe a method that adds long-read sequencing to a mix of technologies used to assemble a highly complex cattle rumen microbial community, and provide a comparison to short read-based methods. Long-read alignments and Hi-C linkage between contigs support the identification of 188 novel virus-host associations and the determination of phage life cycle states in the rumen microbial community. The long-read assembly also identifies 94 antimicrobial resistance genes, compared to only seven alleles in the short-read assembly. We demonstrate novel techniques that work synergistically to improve characterization of biological features in a highly complex rumen microbial community.",31375138,PMC6676630,10.1186/s13059-019-1760-x,42
A robust benchmark for detection of germline large deletions and insertions,"New technologies and analysis methods are enabling genomic structural variants (SVs) to be detected with ever-increasing accuracy, resolution and comprehensiveness. To help translate these methods to routine research and clinical practice, we developed a sequence-resolved benchmark set for identification of both false-negative and false-positive germline large insertions and deletions. To create this benchmark for a broadly consented son in a Personal Genome Project trio with broadly available cells and DNA, the Genome in a Bottle Consortium integrated 19 sequence-resolved variant calling methods from diverse technologies. The final benchmark set contains 12,745 isolated, sequence-resolved insertion (7,281) and deletion (5,464) calls ≥50 base pairs (bp). The Tier 1 benchmark regions, for which any extra calls are putative false positives, cover 2.51 Gbp and 5,262 insertions and 4,095 deletions supported by ≥1 diploid assembly. We demonstrate that the benchmark set reliably identifies false negatives and false positives in high-quality SV callsets from short-, linked- and long-read sequencing and optical mapping.",32541955,PMC8454654,10.1038/s41587-020-0538-8,149
Microdiversity and phylogeographic diversification of bacterioplankton in pelagic freshwater systems revealed through long-read amplicon sequencing,"Background:Freshwater ecosystems are inhabited by members of cosmopolitan bacterioplankton lineages despite the disconnected nature of these habitats. The lineages are delineated based on > 97% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, but their intra-lineage microdiversity and phylogeography, which are key to understanding the eco-evolutional processes behind their ubiquity, remain unresolved. Here, we applied long-read amplicon sequencing targeting nearly full-length 16S rRNA genes and the adjacent ribosomal internal transcribed spacer sequences to reveal the intra-lineage diversities of pelagic bacterioplankton assemblages in 11 deep freshwater lakes in Japan and Europe.Results:Our single nucleotide-resolved analysis, which was validated using shotgun metagenomic sequencing, uncovered 7-101 amplicon sequence variants for each of the 11 predominant bacterial lineages and demonstrated sympatric, allopatric, and temporal microdiversities that could not be resolved through conventional approaches. Clusters of samples with similar intra-lineage population compositions were identified, which consistently supported genetic isolation between Japan and Europe. At a regional scale (up to hundreds of kilometers), dispersal between lakes was unlikely to be a limiting factor, and environmental factors or genetic drift were potential determinants of population composition. The extent of microdiversification varied among lineages, suggesting that highly diversified lineages (e.g., Iluma-A2 and acI-A1) achieve their ubiquity by containing a consortium of genotypes specific to each habitat, while less diversified lineages (e.g., CL500-11) may be ubiquitous due to a small number of widespread genotypes. The lowest extent of intra-lineage diversification was observed among the dominant hypolimnion-specific lineage (CL500-11), suggesting that their dispersal among lakes is not limited despite the hypolimnion being a more isolated habitat than the epilimnion.Conclusions:Our novel approach complemented the limited resolution of short-read amplicon sequencing and limited sensitivity of the metagenome assembly-based approach, and highlighted the complex ecological processes underlying the ubiquity of freshwater bacterioplankton lineages. To fully exploit the performance of the method, its relatively low read throughput is the major bottleneck to be overcome in the future.

Swan: a library for the analysis and visualization of long-read transcriptomes,"Motivation:Long-read RNA-sequencing technologies such as PacBio and Oxford Nanopore have discovered an explosion of new transcript isoforms that are difficult to visually analyze using currently available tools. We introduce the Swan Python library, which is designed to analyze and visualize transcript models.Results:Swan finds 4909 differentially expressed transcripts between cell lines HepG2 and HFFc6, including 279 that are differentially expressed even though the parent gene is not. Additionally, Swan discovers 285 reproducible exon skipping and 47 intron retention events not recorded in the GENCODE v29 annotation.Availability and implementation:The Swan library for Python 3 is available on PyPi at https://pypi.org/project/swan-vis/ and on GitHub at https://github.com/mortazavilab/swan_vis.",32991665,PMC8189675,10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa836,8
De novo hybrid assembly of the rubber tree genome reveals evidence of paleotetraploidy in Hevea species,"Para rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis) is an important economic species as it is the sole commercial producer of high-quality natural rubber. Here, we report a de novo hybrid assembly of BPM24 accession, which exhibits resistance to major fungal pathogens in Southeast Asia. Deep-coverage 454/Illumina short-read and Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) long-read sequence data were acquired to generate a preliminary draft, which was subsequently scaffolded using a long-range ""Chicago"" technique to obtain a final assembly of 1.26 Gb (N50 = 96.8 kb). The assembled genome contains 69.2% repetitive sequences and has a GC content of 34.31%. Using a high-density SNP-based genetic map, we were able to anchor 28.9% of the genome assembly (363 Mb) associated with over two thirds of the predicted protein-coding genes into rubber tree's 18 linkage groups. These genetically anchored sequences allowed comparative analyses of the intragenomic homeologous synteny, providing the first concrete evidence to demonstrate the presence of paleotetraploidy in Hevea species. Additionally, the degree of macrosynteny conservation observed between rubber tree and cassava strongly supports the hypothesis that the paleotetraploidization event took place prior to the divergence of the Hevea and Manihot species.",28150702,PMC5288721,10.1038/srep41457,36
A new era of long-read sequencing for cancer genomics,"Cancer is a disease largely caused by genomic aberrations. Utilizing many rapidly emerging sequencing technologies, researchers have studied cancer genomes to understand the molecular statuses of cancer cells and to reveal their vulnerabilities, such as driver mutations or gene expression. Long-read technologies enable us to identify and characterize novel types of cancerous mutations, including complicated structural variants in haplotype resolution. In this review, we introduce three representative platforms for long-read sequencing and research trends of cancer genomics with long-read data. Further, we describe that aberrant transcriptome and epigenome statuses, namely, fusion transcripts, as well as aberrant transcript isoforms and the phase information of DNA methylation, are able to be elucidated by long-read sequencers. Long-read sequencing may shed light on novel types of aberrations in cancer genomics that are being missed by conventional short-read sequencing analyses.",31474751,PMC6892365,10.1038/s10038-019-0658-5,40
"A new hybrid approach for MHC genotyping: high-throughput NGS and long read MinION nanopore sequencing, with application to the non-model vertebrate Alpine chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra)","The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) acts as an interface between the immune system and infectious diseases. Accurate characterization and genotyping of the extremely variable MHC loci are challenging especially without a reference sequence. We designed a combination of long-range PCR, Illumina short-reads, and Oxford Nanopore MinION long-reads approaches to capture the genetic variation of the MHC II DRB locus in an Italian population of the Alpine chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra). We utilized long-range PCR to generate a 9 Kb fragment of the DRB locus. Amplicons from six different individuals were fragmented, tagged, and simultaneously sequenced with Illumina MiSeq. One of these amplicons was sequenced with the MinION device, which produced long reads covering the entire amplified fragment. A pipeline that combines short and long reads resolved several short tandem repeats and homopolymers and produced a de novo reference, which was then used to map and genotype the short reads from all individuals. The assembled DRB locus showed a high level of polymorphism and the presence of a recombination breakpoint. Our results suggest that an amplicon-based NGS approach coupled with single-molecule MinION nanopore sequencing can efficiently achieve both the assembly and the genotyping of complex genomic regions in multiple individuals in the absence of a reference sequence.",29572469,PMC6133961,10.1038/s41437-018-0070-5,17
A chromosome-level genome assembly of the parasitoid wasp Pteromalus puparum,"Parasitoid wasps represent a large proportion of hymenopteran species. They have complex evolutionary histories and are important biocontrol agents. To advance parasitoid research, a combination of Illumina short-read, PacBio long-read and Hi-C scaffolding technologies was used to develop a high-quality chromosome-level genome assembly for Pteromalus puparum, which is an important pupal endoparasitoid of caterpillar pests. The chromosome-level assembly has aided in studies of venom and detoxification genes. The assembled genome size is 338 Mb with a contig N50 of 38.7 kb and a scaffold N50 of 1.16 Mb. Hi-C analysis assembled scaffolds onto five chromosomes and raised the scaffold N50 to 65.8 Mb, with more than 96% of assembled bases located on chromosomes. Gene annotation was assisted by RNA sequencing for the two sexes and four different life stages. Analysis detected 98% of the BUSCO (Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs) gene set, supporting a high-quality assembly and annotation. In total, 40.1% (135.6 Mb) of the assembly is composed of repetitive sequences, and 14,946 protein-coding genes were identified. Although venom genes play important roles in parasitoid biology, their spatial distribution on chromosomes was poorly understood. Mapping has revealed venom gene tandem arrays for serine proteases, pancreatic lipase-related proteins and kynurenine-oxoglutarate transaminases, which have amplified in the P. puparum lineage after divergence from its common ancestor with Nasonia vitripennis. In addition, there is a large expansion of P450 genes in P. puparum. These examples illustrate how chromosome-level genome assembly can provide a valuable resource for molecular, evolutionary and biocontrol studies of parasitoid wasps.",32562592,,10.1111/1755-0998.13206,24
De novo assembly of the Indian blue peacock (Pavo cristatus) genome using Oxford Nanopore technology and Illumina sequencing,"Background:The Indian peafowl (Pavo cristanus) is native to South Asia and is the national bird of India. Here we present a draft genome sequence of the male blue peacock using Illumina and Oxford Nanopore technology (ONT).Results:ONT sequencing gave ∼2.3-fold sequencing coverage, whereas Illumina generated 150-base pair paired-end sequence data at 284.6-fold coverage from 5 libraries. Subsequently, we generated a 0.915-gigabase pair de novo assembly of the peacock genome with a scaffold N50 of 0.23 megabase pairs (Mb). We predict that the peacock genome contains 23,153 protein-coding genes and 75.3 Mb (7.33%) of repetitive sequences.Conclusions:We report a high-quality assembly of the peacock genome using a hybrid approach of sequences generated by both Illumina and ONT. The long-read chemistry generated by ONT was useful for addressing challenges related to de novo assembly, particularly at regions containing repetitive sequences spanning longer than the read length, and which could not be resolved with only short-read-based assembly. Contig assembly of Illumina short reads gave an N50 of 1,639 bases, whereas with ONT, the N50 increased by >9-fold to 14,749 bases. The initial contig assembly based on Illumina sequencing reads alone gave 685,241 contigs. Further scaffolding on assembled contigs using both Illumina and ONT sequencing reads resulted in a final assembly of 15,025 super-scaffolds, with an N50 of ∼0.23 Mb. Ninety-five percent of proteins predicted by homology matched with those in a public repository, verifying the completeness of our assembly. Like other phylogenetic studies of avian conserved genes, we found P. cristatus to be most closely related to Gallus gallus, followed by Meleagris gallopavo and Anas platyrhynchos. Compared with the recently published peacock genome assembly, the current, superior, hybrid assembly has greater sequencing depth, fewer non-ATGC sequences, and fewer scaffolds.",31077316,PMC6511069,10.1093/gigascience/giz038,11
No evidence of human genome integration of SARS-CoV-2 found by long-read DNA sequencing,"A recent study proposed that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) hijacks the LINE-1 (L1) retrotransposition machinery to integrate into the DNA of infected cells. If confirmed, this finding could have significant clinical implications. Here, we apply deep (>50×) long-read Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing to HEK293T cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 and do not find the virus integrated into the genome. By examining ONT data from separate HEK293T cultivars, we completely resolve 78 L1 insertions arising in vitro in the absence of L1 overexpression systems. ONT sequencing applied to hepatitis B virus (HBV)-positive liver cancer tissues located a single HBV insertion. These experiments demonstrate reliable resolution of retrotransposon and exogenous virus insertions by ONT sequencing. That we find no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 integration suggests that such events are, at most, extremely rare in vivo and therefore are unlikely to drive oncogenesis or explain post-recovery detection of the virus.",34380018,PMC8316065,10.1016/j.celrep.2021.109530,27
A Global Survey of the Full-Length Transcriptome ofApis melliferaby Single-Molecule Long-Read Sequencing,"As important pollinators, honey bees play a crucial role in both maintaining the ecological balance and providing products for humans. Although several versions of the western honey bee genome have already been published, its transcriptome information still needs to be refined. In this study, PacBio single-molecule sequencing technology was used to sequence the full-length transcriptome of mixed samples from many developmental time points and tissues ofA. melliferaqueens, workers and drones. A total of 116,535 transcripts corresponding to 30,045 genes were obtained. Of these, 92,477 transcripts were annotated. Compared to the annotated genes and transcripts on the reference genome, 18,915 gene loci and 96,176 transcripts were newly identified. From these transcripts, 136,554 alternative splicing (AS) events, 23,376 alternative polyadenylation (APA) sites and 21,813 lncRNAs were detected. In addition, based on the full-length transcripts, we identified many differentially expressed transcripts (DETs) between queen, worker and drone. Our results provide a complete set of reference transcripts forA. melliferathat dramatically expand our understanding of the complexity and diversity of the honey bee transcriptome.",36982901,PMC10059051,10.3390/ijms24065827,0
Improving nanopore read accuracy with the R2C2 method enables the sequencing of highly multiplexed full-length single-cell cDNA,"High-throughput short-read sequencing has revolutionized how transcriptomes are quantified and annotated. However, while Illumina short-read sequencers can be used to analyze entire transcriptomes down to the level of individual splicing events with great accuracy, they fall short of analyzing how these individual events are combined into complete RNA transcript isoforms. Because of this shortfall, long-distance information is required to complement short-read sequencing to analyze transcriptomes on the level of full-length RNA transcript isoforms. While long-read sequencing technology can provide this long-distance information, there are issues with both Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) long-read sequencing technologies that prevent their widespread adoption. Briefly, PacBio sequencers produce low numbers of reads with high accuracy, while ONT sequencers produce higher numbers of reads with lower accuracy. Here, we introduce and validate a long-read ONT-based sequencing method. At the same cost, our Rolling Circle Amplification to Concatemeric Consensus (R2C2) method generates more accurate reads of full-length RNA transcript isoforms than any other available long-read sequencing method. These reads can then be used to generate isoform-level transcriptomes for both genome annotation and differential expression analysis in bulk or single-cell samples.",30201725,PMC6166824,10.1073/pnas.1806447115,97
Opportunities and challenges in long-read sequencing data analysis,"Long-read technologies are overcoming early limitations in accuracy and throughput, broadening their application domains in genomics. Dedicated analysis tools that take into account the characteristics of long-read data are thus required, but the fast pace of development of such tools can be overwhelming. To assist in the design and analysis of long-read sequencing projects, we review the current landscape of available tools and present an online interactive database, long-read-tools.org, to facilitate their browsing. We further focus on the principles of error correction, base modification detection, and long-read transcriptomics analysis and highlight the challenges that remain.",32033565,PMC7006217,10.1186/s13059-020-1935-5,484
Characterization of the poll allele in Brahman cattle using long-read Oxford Nanopore sequencing,"Brahman cattle (Bos indicus) are well adapted to thrive in tropical environments. Since their introduction to Australia in 1933, Brahman's ability to grow and reproduce on marginal lands has proven their value in the tropical beef industry. The poll phenotype, which describes the absence of horns, has become desirable in the cattle industry for animal welfare and handler safety concerns. The poll locus has been mapped to chromosome one. Four alleles, each a copy number variant, have been reported across this locus in B. indicus and Bos taurus. However, the causative mutation in Brahman cattle has not been fully characterized. Oxford Nanopore Technologies' minION sequencer was used to sequence four homozygous poll (PcPc), four homozygous horned (pp), and three heterozygous (Pcp) Brahmans to characterize the poll allele in Brahman cattle. A total of 98 Gb were sequenced and an average coverage of 3.33X was achieved. Read N50 scores ranged from 9.9 to 19 kb. Examination of the mapped reads across the poll locus revealed insertions approximately 200 bp in length in the poll animals that were absent in the horned animals. These results are consistent with the Celtic poll allele, a 212-bp duplication that replaces 10 bp. This provides direct evidence that the Celtic poll allele is segregating in the Australian Brahman population.",32318708,PMC7224446,10.1093/jas/skaa127,6
"Yersinia canariaesp. nov., isolated from a human yersiniosis case","A Gram-negative rod from theYersiniagenus was isolated from a clinical case of yersiniosis in the United Kingdom. Long read sequencing data from an Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) MinION in conjunction with Illumina HiSeq reads were used to generate a finished quality genome of this strain. Overall Genome Related Index (OGRI) of the strain was used to determine that it was a novel species withinYersinia, despite biochemical similarities toYersinia enterocolitica. The 16S ribosomal RNA gene accessions are MN434982-MN434987 and the accession number for the complete and closed chromosome is CP043727.

A chromosome scale tomato genome built from complementary PacBio and Nanopore sequences alone reveals extensive linkage drag during breeding,"The assembly and scaffolding of plant crop genomes facilitate the characterization of genetically diverse cultivated and wild germplasm. The cultivated tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) has been improved through the introgression of genetic material from related wild species, including resistance to pandemic strains of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) from Solanum peruvianum. Here we applied PacBio HiFi and ONT Nanopore sequencing to develop independent, highly contiguous and complementary assemblies of an inbred TMV-resistant tomato variety. We show specific examples of how HiFi and ONT datasets can complement one another to improve assembly contiguity. We merged the HiFi and ONT assemblies to generate a long-read-only assembly where all 12 chromosomes were represented as 12 contiguous sequences (N50 = 68.5 Mbp). This chromosome scale assembly did not require scaffolding using an orthogonal data type. The merged assembly was validated by chromosome conformation capture data and is highly consistent with previous tomato genome assemblies that made use of genetic maps and Hi-C for scaffolding. Our long-read-only assembly reveals that a complex series of structural variants linked to the TMV resistance gene likely contributed to linkage drag of a 64.1-Mbp region of the S. peruvianum genome during tomato breeding. Through marker studies and ONT-based comprehensive haplotyping we show that this minimal introgression region is present in six cultivated tomato hybrid varieties developed in three commercial breeding programs. Our results suggest that complementary long read technologies can facilitate the rapid generation of near-complete genome sequences.",35106855,,10.1111/tpj.15690,24
The genome polishing tool POLCA makes fast and accurate corrections in genome assemblies,"The introduction of third-generation DNA sequencing technologies in recent years has allowed scientists to generate dramatically longer sequence reads, which when used in whole-genome sequencing projects have yielded better repeat resolution and far more contiguous genome assemblies. While the promise of better contiguity has held true, the relatively high error rate of long reads, averaging 8-15%, has made it challenging to generate a highly accurate final sequence. Current long-read sequencing technologies display a tendency toward systematic errors, in particular in homopolymer regions, which present additional challenges. A cost-effective strategy to generate highly contiguous assemblies with a very low overall error rate is to combine long reads with low-cost short-read data, which currently have an error rate below 0.5%. This hybrid strategy can be pursued either by incorporating the short-read data into the early phase of assembly, during the read correction step, or by using short reads to ""polish"" the consensus built from long reads. In this report, we present the assembly polishing tool POLCA (POLishing by Calling Alternatives) and compare its performance with two other popular polishing programs, Pilon and Racon. We show that on simulated data POLCA is more accurate than Pilon, and comparable in accuracy to Racon. On real data, all three programs show similar performance, but POLCA is consistently much faster than either of the other polishing programs.",32589667,PMC7347232,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007981,117
Gaining comprehensive biological insight into the transcriptome by performing a broad-spectrum RNA-seq analysis,"RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) is an essential technique for transcriptome studies, hundreds of analysis tools have been developed since it was debuted. Although recent efforts have attempted to assess the latest available tools, they have not evaluated the analysis workflows comprehensively to unleash the power within RNA-seq. Here we conduct an extensive study analysing a broad spectrum of RNA-seq workflows. Surpassing the expression analysis scope, our work also includes assessment of RNA variant-calling, RNA editing and RNA fusion detection techniques. Specifically, we examine both short- and long-read RNA-seq technologies, 39 analysis tools resulting in ~120 combinations, and ~490 analyses involving 15 samples with a variety of germline, cancer and stem cell data sets. We report the performance and propose a comprehensive RNA-seq analysis protocol, named RNACocktail, along with a computational pipeline achieving high accuracy. Validation on different samples reveals that our proposed protocol could help researchers extract more biologically relevant predictions by broad analysis of the transcriptome.RNA-seq is widely used for transcriptome analysis. Here, the authors analyse a wide spectrum of RNA-seq workflows and present a comprehensive analysis protocol named RNACocktail as well as a computational pipeline leveraging the widely used tools for accurate RNA-seq analysis.",28680106,PMC5498581,10.1038/s41467-017-00050-4,127
"Rapid Low-Cost Assembly of theDrosophila melanogasterReference Genome Using Low-Coverage, Long-Read Sequencing","Accurate and comprehensive characterization of genetic variation is essential for deciphering the genetic basis of diseases and other phenotypes. A vast amount of genetic variation stems from large-scale sequence changes arising from the duplication, deletion, inversion, and translocation of sequences. In the past 10 years, high-throughput short reads have greatly expanded our ability to assay sequence variation due to single nucleotide polymorphisms. However, a recentde novoassembly of a secondDrosophila melanogasterreference genome has revealed that short read genotyping methods miss hundreds of structural variants, including those affecting phenotypes. While genomes assembled using high-coverage long reads can achieve high levels of contiguity and completeness, concerns about cost, errors, and low yield have limited widespread adoption of such sequencing approaches. Here we resequenced the reference strain ofD. melanogaster(ISO1) on a single Oxford Nanopore MinION flow cell run for 24 hr. Using only reads longer than 1 kb or with at least 30x coverage, we assembled a highly contiguousde novogenome. The addition of inexpensive paired reads and subsequent scaffolding using an optical map technology achieved an assembly with completeness and contiguity comparable to theD. melanogasterreference assembly. Comparison of our assembly to the reference assembly of ISO1 uncovered a number of structural variants (SVs), including novel LTR transposable element insertions and duplications affecting genes with developmental, behavioral, and metabolic functions. Collectively, these SVs provide a snapshot of the dynamics of genome evolution. Furthermore, our assembly and comparison to theD. melanogasterreference genome demonstrates that high-qualityde novoassembly of reference genomes and comprehensive variant discovery using such assemblies are now possible by a single lab for under $1,000 (USD).",30018084,PMC6169397,10.1534/g3.118.200162,45
Nanopore sequencing technology: a new route for the fast detection of unauthorized GMO,"In order to strengthen the current genetically modified organism (GMO) detection system for unauthorized GMO, we have recently developed a new workflow based on DNA walking to amplify unknown sequences surrounding a known DNA region. This DNA walking is performed on transgenic elements, commonly found in GMO, that were earlier detected by real-time PCR (qPCR) screening. Previously, we have demonstrated the ability of this approach to detect unauthorized GMO via the identification of unique transgene flanking regions and the unnatural associations of elements from the transgenic cassette. In the present study, we investigate the feasibility to integrate the described workflow with the MinION Next-Generation-Sequencing (NGS). The MinION sequencing platform can provide long read-lengths and deal with heterogenic DNA libraries, allowing for rapid and efficient delivery of sequences of interest. In addition, the ability of this NGS platform to characterize unauthorized and unknown GMO without any a priori knowledge has been assessed.",29785005,PMC5962636,10.1038/s41598-018-26259-x,13
PGG.SV: a whole-genome-sequencing-based structural variant resource and data analysis platform,"Structural variations (SVs) play important roles in human evolution and diseases, but there is a lack of data resources concerning representative samples, especially for East Asians. Taking advantage of both next-generation sequencing and third-generation sequencing data at the whole-genome level, we developed the database PGG.SV to provide a practical platform for both regionally and globally representative structural variants. In its current version, PGG.SV archives 584 277 SVs obtained from whole-genome sequencing data of 6048 samples, including 1030 long-read sequencing genomes representing 177 global populations. PGG.SV provides (i) high-quality SVs with fine-scale and precise genomic locations in both GRCh37 and GRCh38, covering underrepresented SVs in existing sequencing and microarray data; (ii) hierarchical estimation of SV prevalence in geographical populations; (iii) informative annotations of SV-related genes, potential functions and clinical effects; (iv) an analysis platform to facilitate SV-based case-control association studies and (v) various visualization tools for understanding the SV structures in the human genome.

State-of-the-art genome inference in the human MHC,"The Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) on the short arm of chromosome 6 is associated with more diseases than any other region of the genome; it encodes the antigen-presenting Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) proteins and is one of the key immunogenetic regions of the genome. Accurate genome inference and interpretation of MHC association signals have traditionally been hampered by the region's uniquely complex features, such as high levels of polymorphism; inter-gene sequence homologies; structural variation; and long-range haplotype structures. Recent algorithmic and technological advances have, however, significantly increased the accessibility of genetic variation in the MHC; these developments include (i) accurate SNP-based HLA type imputation; (ii) genome graph approaches for variation-aware genome inference from next-generation sequencing data; (iii) long-read-based diploid de novo assembly of the MHC; (iv) cost-effective targeted MHC sequencing methods. Applied to hundreds of thousands of samples over the last years, these technologies have already enabled significant biological discoveries, for example in the field of autoimmune disease genetics. Remaining challenges concern the development of integrated methods that leverage haplotype-resolved de novo assembly of the MHC for the development of improved MHC genotyping methods for short reads and the construction of improved reference panels for SNP-based imputation. Improved genome inference in the MHC can crucially contribute to an improved genetic and functional understanding of many immune-related phenotypes and diseases.",33189874,,10.1016/j.biocel.2020.105882,12
Sequencing of human genomes with nanopore technology,"Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) is becoming widely used in clinical medicine in diagnostic contexts and to inform treatment choice. Here we evaluate the potential of the Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) MinION long-read sequencer for routine WGS by sequencing the reference sample NA12878 and the genome of an individual with ataxia-pancytopenia syndrome and severe immune dysregulation. We develop and apply a novel reference panel-free analytical method to infer and then exploit phase information which improves single-nucleotide variant (SNV) calling performance from otherwise modest levels. In the clinical sample, we identify and directly phase two non-synonymous de novo variants in SAMD9L, (OMIM #159550) inferring that they lie on the same paternal haplotype. Whilst consensus SNV-calling error rates from ONT data remain substantially higher than those from short-read methods, we demonstrate the substantial benefits of analytical innovation. Ongoing improvements to base-calling and SNV-calling methodology must continue for nanopore sequencing to establish itself as a primary method for clinical WGS.",31015479,PMC6478738,10.1038/s41467-019-09637-5,77
Chasing perfection: validation and polishing strategies for telomere-to-telomere genome assemblies,"Advances in long-read sequencing technologies and genome assembly methods have enabled the recent completion of the first telomere-to-telomere human genome assembly, which resolves complex segmental duplications and large tandem repeats, including centromeric satellite arrays in a complete hydatidiform mole (CHM13). Although derived from highly accurate sequences, evaluation revealed evidence of small errors and structural misassemblies in the initial draft assembly. To correct these errors, we designed a new repeat-aware polishing strategy that made accurate assembly corrections in large repeats without overcorrection, ultimately fixing 51% of the existing errors and improving the assembly quality value from 70.2 to 73.9 measured from PacBio high-fidelity and Illumina k-mers. By comparing our results to standard automated polishing tools, we outline common polishing errors and offer practical suggestions for genome projects with limited resources. We also show how sequencing biases in both high-fidelity and Oxford Nanopore Technologies reads cause signature assembly errors that can be corrected with a diverse panel of sequencing technologies.",35361931,PMC9812399,10.1038/s41592-022-01440-3,35
Strand-seq enables reliable separation of long reads by chromosome via expectation maximization,"Motivation:Current sequencing technologies are able to produce reads orders of magnitude longer than ever possible before. Such long reads have sparked a new interest in de novo genome assembly, which removes reference biases inherent to re-sequencing approaches and allows for a direct characterization of complex genomic variants. However, even with latest algorithmic advances, assembling a mammalian genome from long error-prone reads incurs a significant computational burden and does not preclude occasional misassemblies. Both problems could potentially be mitigated if assembly could commence for each chromosome separately.Results:To address this, we show how single-cell template strand sequencing (Strand-seq) data can be leveraged for this purpose. We introduce a novel latent variable model and a corresponding Expectation Maximization algorithm, termed SaaRclust, and demonstrates its ability to reliably cluster long reads by chromosome. For each long read, this approach produces a posterior probability distribution over all chromosomes of origin and read directionalities. In this way, it allows to assess the amount of uncertainty inherent to sparse Strand-seq data on the level of individual reads. Among the reads that our algorithm confidently assigns to a chromosome, we observed more than 99% correct assignments on a subset of Pacific Bioscience reads with 30.1× coverage. To our knowledge, SaaRclust is the first approach for the in silico separation of long reads by chromosome prior to assembly.Availability and implementation:https://github.com/daewoooo/SaaRclust.",29949971,PMC6022540,10.1093/bioinformatics/bty290,11
Nanopore Third-Generation Sequencing for Comprehensive Analysis of Hemoglobinopathy Variants,"Background:Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) third-generation sequencing (TGS) is a versatile genetic diagnostic platform. However, it is nonetheless challenging to prepare long-template libraries for long-read TGS, particularly the ONT method for analysis of hemoglobinopathy variants involving complex structures and occurring in GC-rich and/or homologous regions.Methods:A multiplex long PCR was designed to prepare library templates, including the whole-gene amplicons for HBA2/1, HBG2/1, HBD, and HBB, as well as the allelic amplicons for targeted deletions and special structural variations. Library construction was performed using long-PCR products, and sequencing was conducted on an Oxford Nanopore MinION instrument. Genotypes were identified based on integrative genomics viewer (IGV) plots.Results:This novel long-read TGS method distinguished all single nucleotide variants and structural variants within HBA2/1, HBG2/1, HBD, and HBB based on the whole-gene sequence reads. Targeted deletions and special structural variations were also identified according to the specific allelic reads. The result of 158 α-/β-thalassemia samples showed 100% concordance with previously known genotypes.Conclusions:This ONT TGS method is high-throughput, which can be used for molecular screening and genetic diagnosis of hemoglobinopathies. The strategy of multiplex long PCR is an efficient strategy for library preparation, providing a practical reference for TGS assay development.",37311260,,10.1093/clinchem/hvad073,0

Survey of theBradysia odoriphagaTranscriptome Using PacBio Single-Molecule Long-Read Sequencing,"The damage caused byBradysia odoriphagais the main factor threatening the production of vegetables in the Liliaceae family. However, few genetic studies ofB. odoriphagahave been conducted because of a lack of genomic resources. Many long-read sequencing technologies have been developed in the last decade; therefore, in this study, the transcriptome including all development stages ofB. odoriphagawas sequenced for the first time by Pacific single-molecule long-read sequencing. Here, 39,129 isoforms were generated, and 35,645 were found to have annotation results when checked against sequences available in different databases. Overall, 18,473 isoforms were distributed in 25 various Clusters of Orthologous Groups, and 11,880 isoforms were categorized into 60 functional groups that belonged to the three main Gene Ontology classifications. Moreover, 30,610 isoforms were assigned into 44 functional categories belonging to six main Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes functional categories. Coding DNA sequence (CDS) prediction showed that 36,419 out of 39,129 isoforms were predicted to have CDS, and 4319 simple sequence repeats were detected in total. Finally, 266 insecticide resistance and metabolism-related isoforms were identified as candidate genes for further investigation of insecticide resistance and metabolism inB. odoriphaga.",31242713,PMC6627194,10.3390/genes10060481,3
UNAGI: Yeast Transcriptome Reconstruction and Gene Discovery Using Nanopore Sequencing,"Computational approaches are the main approaches used in genome annotation. However, accuracy is low. Untranslated regions are not identified, complex isoforms are not predicted correctly and discovery rate of noncoding RNA is low. RNA-seq has revolutionized transcriptome reconstruction over the last decade. However, fragmentation included in cDNA sequencing leads to information loss, requiring transcripts to be assembled and reconstructed, thus affecting the accuracy of reconstructed transcriptome. Recently, long-read sequencing has been introduced with technologies such as Oxford Nanopore sequencing. cDNA is sequenced directly without fragmentation producing long reads that don't need to be assembled keeping the transcript structure intact and increasing the accuracy of transcriptome reconstruction.Here we present a protocol and a pipeline to reconstruct the transcriptome of compact genomes including yeasts. It involves generating full-length cDNA and using Oxford Nanopore ligation-based sequencing kit to sequence multiple samples in the same run. The pipeline (1) strands the generated long reads, (2) corrects the reads by mapping them to the reference genome, (3) identifies transcripts including 5'UTR and 3'UTR, (4) profiles the isoforms, filtering out artifacts resulting from low accuracy in sequencing, and (5) improves accuracy of provided annotations. Using long reads improves the accuracy of transcriptome reconstruction and helps in discovering a significant number of novel RNAs.",35524113,,10.1007/978-1-0716-2257-5_6,0
Evaluating nanopore sequencing data processing pipelines for structural variation identification,"Background:Structural variations (SVs) account for about 1% of the differences among human genomes and play a significant role in phenotypic variation and disease susceptibility. The emerging nanopore sequencing technology can generate long sequence reads and can potentially provide accurate SV identification. However, the tools for aligning long-read data and detecting SVs have not been thoroughly evaluated.Results:Using four nanopore datasets, including both empirical and simulated reads, we evaluate four alignment tools and three SV detection tools. We also evaluate the impact of sequencing depth on SV detection. Finally, we develop a machine learning approach to integrate call sets from multiple pipelines. Overall SV callers' performance varies depending on the SV types. For an initial data assessment, we recommend using aligner minimap2 in combination with SV caller Sniffles because of their speed and relatively balanced performance. For detailed analysis, we recommend incorporating information from multiple call sets to improve the SV call performance.Conclusions:We present a workflow for evaluating aligners and SV callers for nanopore sequencing data and approaches for integrating multiple call sets. Our results indicate that additional optimizations are needed to improve SV detection accuracy and sensitivity, and an integrated call set can provide enhanced performance. The nanopore technology is improving, and the sequencing community is likely to grow accordingly. In turn, better benchmark call sets will be available to more accurately assess the performance of available tools and facilitate further tool development.",31727126,PMC6857234,10.1186/s13059-019-1858-1,19
Genomic structure of the horse major histocompatibility complex class II region resolved using PacBio long-read sequencing technology,"The mammalian Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) region contains several gene families characterized by highly polymorphic loci with extensive nucleotide diversity, copy number variation of paralogous genes, and long repetitive sequences. This structural complexity has made it difficult to construct a reliable reference sequence of the horse MHC region. In this study, we used long-read single molecule, real-time (SMRT) sequencing technology from Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) to sequence eight Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC) clones spanning the horse MHC class II region. The final assembly resulted in a 1,165,328 bp continuous gap free sequence with 35 manually curated genomic loci of which 23 were considered to be functional and 12 to be pseudogenes. In comparison to the MHC class II region in other mammals, the corresponding region in horse shows extraordinary copy number variation and different relative location and directionality of the Eqca-DRB, -DQA, -DQB and -DOB loci. This is the first long-read sequence assembly of the horse MHC class II region with rigorous manual gene annotation, and it will serve as an important resource for association studies of immune-mediated equine diseases and for evolutionary analysis of genetic diversity in this region.",28361880,PMC5374520,10.1038/srep45518,16
Resolving repeat families with long reads,"Background:Draft quality genomes for a multitude of organisms have become common due to the advancement of genome assemblers using long-read technologies with high error rates. Although current assemblies are substantially more contiguous than assemblies based on short reads, complete chromosomal assemblies are still challenging. Interspersed repeat families with multiple copy versions dominate the contig and scaffold ends of current long-read assemblies for complex genomes. These repeat families generally remain unresolved, as existing algorithmic solutions either do not scale to large copy numbers or can not handle the current high read error rates.Results:We propose novel repeat resolution methods for large interspersed repeat families and assess their accuracy on simulated data sets with various distinct repeat structures and on drosophila melanogaster transposons. Additionally, we compare our methods to an existing long read repeat resolution tool and show the improved accuracy of our method.Conclusions:Our results demonstrate the applicability of our methods for the improvement of the contiguity of genome assemblies.",31072311,PMC6506941,10.1186/s12859-019-2807-4,5
DNA methylation analysis for screening and diagnostic testing in neurodevelopmental disorders,"DNA methylation (mDNA) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), however its use in diagnostic testing has been largely restricted to a handful of methods for locus-specific analysis in monogenic syndromes. Recent studies employing genome-wide methylation analysis (GWMA) have explored utility of a single array-based test to detect methylation changes in probands negative by exome sequencing, and to diagnose different monogenic NDDs with defined epigenetic signatures. While this may be a more efficient approach, several significant barriers remain. These include non-uniform and low coverage of regulatory regions that may have CG-rich sequences, and lower analytical sensitivity as compared with locus-specific analyses that may result in methylation mosaicism not being detected. A major challenge associated with the above technologies, regardless of whether the analysis is locus specific or genome wide, is the technical bias introduced by indirect analysis of methylation. This review summarizes evidence from the most recent studies in this field and discusses future directions, including direct analysis of methylation using long-read technologies and detection of 5-methylcytosine (5-mC or total mDNA) and 5-hydroxymethylacytosine (5-hmC) as biomarkers of NDDs.",31696914,,10.1042/EBC20190056,8
NanoMethViz: An R/Bioconductor package for visualizing long-read methylation data,"A key benefit of long-read nanopore sequencing technology is the ability to detect modified DNA bases, such as 5-methylcytosine. The lack of R/Bioconductor tools for the effective visualization of nanopore methylation profiles between samples from different experimental groups led us to develop the NanoMethViz R package. Our software can handle methylation output generated from a range of different methylation callers and manages large datasets using a compressed data format. To fully explore the methylation patterns in a dataset, NanoMethViz allows plotting of data at various resolutions. At the sample-level, we use dimensionality reduction to look at the relationships between methylation profiles in an unsupervised way. We visualize methylation profiles of classes of features such as genes or CpG islands by scaling them to relative positions and aggregating their profiles. At the finest resolution, we visualize methylation patterns across individual reads along the genome using the spaghetti plot and heatmaps, allowing users to explore particular genes or genomic regions of interest. In summary, our software makes the handling of methylation signal more convenient, expands upon the visualization options for nanopore data and works seamlessly with existing methylation analysis tools available in the Bioconductor project. Our software is available at https://bioconductor.org/packages/NanoMethViz.",34695109,PMC8568149,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009524,8
"Ultra-deep, long-read nanopore sequencing of mock microbial community standards","Background:Long sequencing reads are information-rich: aiding de novo assembly and reference mapping, and consequently have great potential for the study of microbial communities. However, the best approaches for analysis of long-read metagenomic data are unknown. Additionally, rigorous evaluation of bioinformatics tools is hindered by a lack of long-read data from validated samples with known composition.Findings:We sequenced 2 commercially available mock communities containing 10 microbial species (ZymoBIOMICS Microbial Community Standards) with Oxford Nanopore GridION and PromethION. Both communities and the 10 individual species isolates were also sequenced with Illumina technology. We generated 14 and 16 gigabase pairs from 2 GridION flowcells and 150 and 153 gigabase pairs from 2 PromethION flowcells for the evenly distributed and log-distributed communities, respectively. Read length N50 ranged between 5.3 and 5.4 kilobase pairs over the 4 sequencing runs. Basecalls and corresponding signal data are made available (4.2 TB in total). Alignment to Illumina-sequenced isolates demonstrated the expected microbial species at anticipated abundances, with the limit of detection for the lowest abundance species below 50 cells (GridION). De novo assembly of metagenomes recovered long contiguous sequences without the need for pre-processing techniques such as binning.Conclusions:We present ultra-deep, long-read nanopore datasets from a well-defined mock community. These datasets will be useful for those developing bioinformatics methods for long-read metagenomics and for the validation and comparison of current laboratory and software pipelines.",31089679,PMC6520541,10.1093/gigascience/giz043,102
"Long-read sequencing improves assembly of Trichinella genomes 10-fold, revealing substantial synteny between lineages diverged over 7 million years","Genome assemblies can form the basis of comparative analyses fostering insight into the evolutionary genetics of a parasite's pathogenicity, host-pathogen interactions, environmental constraints and invasion biology; however, the length and complexity of many parasite genomes has hampered the development of well-resolved assemblies. In order to improve Trichinella genome assemblies, the genome of the sylvatic encapsulated species Trichinella murrelli was sequenced using third-generation, long-read technology and, using syntenic comparisons, scaffolded to a reference genome assembly of Trichinella spiralis, markedly improving both. A high-quality draft assembly for T. murrelli was achieved that totalled 63·2 Mbp, half of which was condensed into 26 contigs each longer than 571 000 bp. When compared with previous assemblies for parasites in the genus, ours required 10-fold fewer contigs, which were five times longer, on average. Better assembly across repetitive regions also enabled resolution of 8 Mbp of previously indeterminate sequence. Furthermore, syntenic comparisons identified widespread scaffold misassemblies in the T. spiralis reference genome. The two new assemblies, organized for the first time into three chromosomal scaffolds, will be valuable resources for future studies linking phenotypic traits within each species to their underlying genetic bases.",28583210,,10.1017/S0031182017000348,1
Confident phylogenetic identification of uncultured prokaryotes through long read amplicon sequencing of the 16S-ITS-23S rRNA operon,"Amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene is the predominant method to quantify microbial compositions and to discover novel lineages. However, traditional short amplicons often do not contain enough information to confidently resolve their phylogeny. Here we present a cost-effective protocol that amplifies a large part of the rRNA operon and sequences the amplicons with PacBio technology. We tested our method on a mock community and developed a read-curation pipeline that reduces the overall read error rate to 0.18%. Applying our method on four environmental samples, we captured near full-length rRNA operon amplicons from a large diversity of prokaryotes. The method operated at moderately high-throughput (22286-37,850 raw ccs reads) and generated a large amount of putative novel archaeal 23S rRNA gene sequences compared to the archaeal SILVA database. These long amplicons allowed for higher resolution during taxonomic classification by means of long (∼1000 bp) 16S rRNA gene fragments and for substantially more confident phylogenies by means of combined near full-length 16S and 23S rRNA gene sequences, compared to shorter traditional amplicons (250 bp of the 16S rRNA gene). We recommend our method to those who wish to cost-effectively and confidently estimate the phylogenetic diversity of prokaryotes in environmental samples at high throughput.",31012228,PMC6849856,10.1111/1462-2920.14636,26
Characterization of structural variation in Tibetans reveals new evidence of high-altitude adaptation and introgression,"Background:Structural variation (SV) acts as an essential mutational force shaping the evolution and function of the human genome. However, few studies have examined the role of SVs in high-altitude adaptation and little is known of adaptive introgressed SVs in Tibetans so far.Results:Here, we generate a comprehensive catalog of SVs in a Chinese Tibetan (n = 15) and Han (n = 10) population using nanopore sequencing technology. Among a total of 38,216 unique SVs in the catalog, 27% are sequence-resolved for the first time. We systematically assess the distribution of these SVs across repeat sequences and functional genomic regions. Through genotyping in additional 276 genomes, we identify 69 Tibetan-Han stratified SVs and 80 candidate adaptive genes. We also discover a few adaptive introgressed SV candidates and provide evidence for a deletion of 335 base pairs at 1p36.32.Conclusions:Overall, our results highlight the important role of SVs in the evolutionary processes of Tibetans' adaptation to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and provide a valuable resource for future high-altitude adaptation studies.",34034800,PMC8146648,10.1186/s13059-021-02382-3,25
Rapid CRISPR/Cas9-Mediated Cloning of Full-Length Epstein-Barr Virus Genomes from Latently Infected Cells,Herpesviruses have relatively large DNA genomes of more than 150 kb that are difficult to clone and sequence. Bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) cloning of herpesvirus genomes is a powerful technique that greatly facilitates whole viral genome sequencing as well as functional characterization of reconstituted viruses. We describe recently invented technologies for rapid BAC cloning of herpesvirus genomes using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated homology-directed repair. We focus on recent BAC cloning techniques of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genomes and discuss the possible advantages of a CRISPR/Cas9-mediated strategy comparatively with precedent EBV-BAC cloning strategies. We also describe the design decisions of this technology as well as possible pitfalls and points to be improved in the future. The obtained EBV-BAC clones are subjected to long-read sequencing analysis to determine complete EBV genome sequence including repetitive regions. Rapid cloning and sequence determination of various EBV strains will greatly contribute to the understanding of their global geographical distribution. This technology can also be used to clone disease-associated EBV strains and test the hypothesis that they have special features that distinguish them from strains that infect asymptomatically.,29614006,PMC5923465,10.3390/v10040171,6
MOCHI: a comprehensive cross-platform tool for amplicon-based microbiota analysis,"Motivation:Microbiota analyses have important implications for health and science. These analyses make use of 16S/18S rRNA gene sequencing to identify taxa and predict species diversity. However, most available tools for analyzing microbiota data require adept programming skills and in-depth statistical knowledge for proper implementation. While long-read amplicon sequencing can lead to more accurate taxa predictions and is quickly becoming more common, practitioners have no easily accessible tools with which to perform their analyses.Results:We present MOCHI, a GUI tool for microbiota amplicon sequencing analysis. MOCHI preprocesses sequences, assigns taxonomy, identifies different abundant species and predicts species diversity and function. It takes either taxonomic count table or FASTQ of partial 16S/18S rRNA or full-length 16S rRNA gene as input. It performs analyses in real time and visualizes data in both tabular and graphical formats.Availability and implementation:MOCHI can be installed to run locally or accessed as a web tool at https://mochi.life.nctu.edu.tw.Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",35876544,PMC9477538,10.1093/bioinformatics/btac494,1
Deciphering integration loci of CHO manufacturing cell lines using long read nanopore sequencing,"Despite advances in genetic characterization of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines regarding identification of integration sites using next generation sequencing, e.g. targeted locus amplification sequencing (TLA-seq), the concatemer structure of the integrated vectors remains elusive. Here, the entire integration locus of two CHO manufacturing cell lines was reconstructed combining CRISPR/Cas9 target enrichment, nanopore sequencing and the Canu de novo assembly pipeline. An IgG producing CHO cell line integrated 3 vector copies, which were near full-length and contained all relevant vector elements such as transgenes and their promoters on each of the vector copies. In contrast, a second CHO cell line producing a bivalent bispecific antibody integrated 7 highly fragmented vector copies in different orientations leading to head-to-head and tail-to-tail fusions. The size of the vector fragments ranged from 3.0 to 11.4 kbp each carrying 1-3 transgenes. The breakpoints of the genome-vector and vector-vector junctions were validated using Sanger sequencing and Southern blotting. A comparison to TLA-seq data confirmed the genomic breakpoints, but most of the breakpoints of the vector-vector fusions were missed by TLA-seq. For the first time, the complete transgene locus of CHO manufacturing cell lines could be deciphered. Strikingly, the application of the nanopore long-read sequencing technology led to novel insights into the complexity of genomic transgene integrations of CHO manufacturing cell lines generated via random integration.",36925062,,10.1016/j.nbt.2023.03.003,1
Long-read ChIA-PET for base-pair-resolution mapping of haplotype-specific chromatin interactions,"Chromatin interaction analysis by paired-end tag sequencing (ChIA-PET) is a robust method for capturing genome-wide chromatin interactions. Unlike other 3C-based methods, it includes a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) step that enriches for interactions mediated by specific target proteins. This unique feature allows ChIA-PET to provide the functional specificity and higher resolution needed to detect chromatin interactions, which chromosome conformation capture (3C)/Hi-C approaches have not achieved. The original ChIA-PET protocol generates short paired-end tags (2 × 20 base pairs (bp)) to detect two genomic loci that are far apart on linear chromosomes but are in spatial proximity in the folded genome. We have improved the original approach by developing long-read ChIA-PET, in which the length of the paired-end tags is increased (up to 2 × 250 bp). The longer PET reads not only improve the tag-mapping efficiency but also increase the probability of covering phased single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which allows haplotype-specific chromatin interactions to be identified. Here, we provide the detailed protocol for long-read ChIA-PET that includes cell fixation and lysis, chromatin fragmentation by sonication, ChIP, proximity ligation with a bridge linker, Tn5 tagmentation, PCR amplification and high-throughput sequencing. For a well-trained molecular biologist, it typically takes 6 d from cell harvesting to the completion of library construction, up to a further 36 h for DNA sequencing and <20 h for processing of raw sequencing reads.",28358394,PMC5537732,10.1038/nprot.2017.012,62
Long-read sequence assembly of the firefly Pyrocoelia pectoralis genome,"Background:Fireflies are a family of insects within the beetle order Coleoptera, or winged beetles, and they are one of the most well-known and loved insect species because of their bioluminescence. However, the firefly is in danger of extinction because of the massive destruction of its living environment. In order to improve the understanding of fireflies and protect them effectively, we sequenced the whole genome of the terrestrial firefly Pyrocoelia pectoralis.Findings:Here, we developed a highly reliable genome resource for the terrestrial firefly Pyrocoelia pectoralis (E. Oliv., 1883; Coleoptera: Lampyridae) using single molecule real time (SMRT) sequencing on the PacBio Sequel platform. In total, 57.8 Gb of long reads were generated and assembled into a 760.4-Mb genome, which is close to the estimated genome size and covered 98.7% complete and 0.7% partial insect Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs. The k-mer analysis showed that this genome is highly heterozygous. However, our long-read assembly demonstrates continuousness with a contig N50 length of 3.04 Mb and the longest contig length of 13.69 Mb. Furthermore, 135 589 SSRs and 341 Mb of repeat sequences were detected. A total of 23 092 genes were predicted; 88.44% of genes were annotated with one or more related functions.Conclusions:We assembled a high-quality firefly genome, which will not only provide insights into the conservation and biodiversity of fireflies, but also provide a wealth of information to study the mechanisms of their sexual communication, bio-luminescence, and evolution.",29186486,PMC5751067,10.1093/gigascience/gix112,20
Exploring differential exon usage via short- and long-read RNA sequencing strategies,"Alternative splicing produces various mRNAs, and thereby various protein products, from one gene, impacting a wide range of cellular activities. However, accurate reconstruction and quantification of full-length transcripts using short-reads is limited, due to their length. Long-reads sequencing technologies may provide a solution by sequencing full-length transcripts. We explored the use of both Illumina short-reads and two long Oxford Nanopore Technology (cDNA and Direct RNA) RNA-Seq reads for detecting global differential splicing during mouse embryonic stem cell differentiation, applying several bioinformatics strategies: gene-based, isoform-based and exon-based. We detected the strongest similarity among the sequencing platforms at the gene level compared to exon-based and isoform-based. Furthermore, the exon-based strategy discovered many differential exon usage (DEU) events, mostly in a platform-dependent manner and in non-differentially expressed genes. Thus, the platforms complemented each other in the ability to detect DEUs (i.e. long-reads exhibited an advantage in detecting DEUs at the UTRs, and short-reads detected more DEUs). Exons within 20 genes, detected in one or more platforms, were here validated by PCR, including key differentiation genes, such as Mdb3 and Aplp1. We provide an important analysis resource for discovering transcriptome changes during stem cell differentiation and insights for analysing such data.",36168804,PMC9516339,10.1098/rsob.220206,4
Long-read metagenomics of multiple displacement amplified DNA of low-biomass human gut phageomes by SACRA pre-processing chimeric reads,"The human gut bacteriophage community (phageome) plays an important role in the host's health and disease; however, the entire structure is poorly understood, partly owing to the generation of many incomplete genomes in conventional short-read metagenomics. Here, we show long-read metagenomics of amplified DNA of low-biomass phageomes with multiple displacement amplification (MDA), involving the development of a novel bioinformatics tool, split amplified chimeric read algorithm (SACRA), that efficiently pre-processed numerous chimeric reads generated through MDA. Using five samples, SACRA markedly reduced the average chimera ratio from 72% to 1.5% in PacBio reads with an average length of 1.8 kb. De novo assembly of chimera-less PacBio long reads reconstructed contigs of ≥5 kb with an average proportion of 27%, which was 1% in contigs from MiSeq short reads, thereby dramatically improving contig length and genome completeness. Comparison of PacBio and MiSeq contigs found MiSeq contig fragmentations frequently near local repeats and hypervariable regions in the phage genomes, and those caused by multiple homologous phage genomes coexisting in the community. We also developed a reference-independent method to assess the completeness of the linear phage genomes. Overall, we established a SACRA-coupled long-read metagenomics robust to highly diverse gut phageomes, identifying high-quality circular and linear phage genomes with adequate sequence quantity.",34586399,PMC8513251,10.1093/dnares/dsab019,11
Symposium review: Advances in sequencing technology herald a new frontier in cattle genomics and genome-enabled selection,"The cattle reference genome assembly has underpinned major innovations in beef and dairy genetics through genome-enabled selection, including removal of deleterious recessive variants and selection for favorable alleles affecting quantitative production traits. The initial reference assemblies, up to and including UMD3.1 and Btau4.1, were based on a combination of clone-by-clone sequencing of bacterial artificial chromosome clones generated from blood DNA of a Hereford bull and whole-genome shotgun sequencing of blood DNA from his inbred daughter/granddaughter named L1 Dominette 01449 (Dominette). The approach introduced assembly gaps, misassemblies, and errors, and it limited the ability to assemble regions that undergo rearrangement in blood cells, such as immune gene clusters. Nonetheless, the reference supported the creation of genotyping tools and provided a basis for many studies of gene expression. Recently, long-read sequencing technologies have emerged that facilitated a re-assembly of the reference genome, using lung tissue from Dominette to resolve many of the problems and providing a bridge to place historical studies in common context. The new reference, ARS-UCD1.2, successfully assembled germline immune gene clusters and improved overall continuity (i.e., reduction of gaps and inversions) by over 250-fold. This reference properly places nearly all of the legacy genetic markers used for over a decade in the industry. In this review, we discuss the improvements made to the cattle reference; remaining issues present in the assembly; tools developed to support genome-based studies in beef and dairy cattle; and the emergence of newer genome assembly methods that are producing even higher-quality assemblies for other breeds of cattle at a fraction of the cost. The new frontier for cattle genomics research will likely include a transition from the individual Hereford reference genome, to a ""pan-genome"" reference, representing all the DNA segments existing in commonly used cattle breeds, bringing the cattle reference into line with the current direction of human genome research.",32331872,,10.3168/jds.2019-17693,9
Unveiling novel targets of paclitaxel resistance by single molecule long-read RNA sequencing in breast cancer,"RNA sequencing has become one of the most common technology to study transcriptomes in cancer, whereas its length limits its application on alternative splicing (AS) events and novel isoforms. Firstly, we applied single molecule long-read RNA sequencing (Iso-seq) and de novo assembly with short-read RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) in both wild type (231-WT) and paclitaxel resistant type (231-PTX) of human breast cancer cell MDA-MBA-231. The two sequencing technology provide both the accurate transcript sequences and the deep transcript coverage. Then we combined shor-read and long-read RNA-seq to analyze alternative events and novel isoforms. Last but not the least, we selected BAK1 as our candidate target to verify our analysis. Our results implied that improved characterization of cancer genomic function may require the application of the single molecule long-read RNA sequencing to get the deeper and more precise view to transcriptional level. Our results imply that improved characterization of cancer genomic function may require the application of the single molecule long-read RNA sequencing to get the deeper and more precise view to transcriptional level.",30988345,PMC6465246,10.1038/s41598-019-42184-z,7
Full-length transcript sequencing of human and mouse cerebral cortex identifies widespread isoform diversity and alternative splicing,"Alternative splicing is a post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism producing distinct mRNA molecules from a single pre-mRNA with a prominent role in the development and function of the central nervous system. We used long-read isoform sequencing to generate full-length transcript sequences in the human and mouse cortex. We identify novel transcripts not present in existing genome annotations, including transcripts mapping to putative novel (unannotated) genes and fusion transcripts incorporating exons from multiple genes. Global patterns of transcript diversity are similar between human and mouse cortex, although certain genes are characterized by striking differences between species. We also identify developmental changes in alternative splicing, with differential transcript usage between human fetal and adult cortex. Our data confirm the importance of alternative splicing in the cortex, dramatically increasing transcriptional diversity and representing an important mechanism underpinning gene regulation in the brain. We provide transcript-level data for human and mouse cortex as a resource to the scientific community.",34788620,PMC8609283,10.1016/j.celrep.2021.110022,47
"Chromosome-level genome assembly of a cyprinid fish Onychostoma macrolepis by integration of nanopore sequencing, Bionano and Hi-C technology","Onychostoma macrolepis is an emerging commercial cyprinid fish species. It is a model system for studies of sexual dimorphism and genome evolution. Here, we report the chromosome-level assembly of the O.macrolepis genome obtained from the integration of nanopore long-read sequencing with physical maps produced using Bionano and Hi-C technology. A total of 87.9 Gb of nanopore sequence provided approximately 100-fold coverage of the genome. The preliminary genome assembly was 883.2 Mb in size with a contig N50 size of 11.2 Mb. The 969 corrected contigs obtained from Bionano optical mapping were assembled into 853 scaffolds and produced an assembly of 886.5 Mb with a scaffold N50 of 16.5 Mb. Finally, using the Hi-C data, 881.3 Mb (99.4% of genome) in 526 scaffolds were anchored and oriented in 25 chromosomes ranging in size from 25.27 to 56.49 Mb. In total, 24,770 protein-coding genes were predicted in the genome, and ~96.85% of the genes were functionally annotated. The annotated assembly contains 93.3% complete genes from the BUSCO reference set. In addition, we identified 409 Mb (46.23% of the genome) of repetitive sequence, and 11,213 non-coding RNAs, in the genome. Evolutionary analysis revealed that O. macrolepis diverged from common carp approximately 24.25 million years ago. The chromosomes of O. macrolepis showed an unambiguous correspondence to the chromosomes of zebrafish. The high-quality genome assembled in this work provides a valuable genomic resource for further biological and evolutionary studies of O. macrolepis.",32419357,,10.1111/1755-0998.13190,11
deBGR: an efficient and near-exact representation of the weighted de Bruijn graph,"Motivation:Almost all de novo short-read genome and transcriptome assemblers start by building a representation of the de Bruijn Graph of the reads they are given as input. Even when other approaches are used for subsequent assembly (e.g. when one is using 'long read' technologies like those offered by PacBio or Oxford Nanopore), efficient k -mer processing is still crucial for accurate assembly, and state-of-the-art long-read error-correction methods use de Bruijn Graphs. Because of the centrality of de Bruijn Graphs, researchers have proposed numerous methods for representing de Bruijn Graphs compactly. Some of these proposals sacrifice accuracy to save space. Further, none of these methods store abundance information, i.e. the number of times that each k -mer occurs, which is key in transcriptome assemblers.Results:We present a method for compactly representing the weighted de Bruijn Graph (i.e. with abundance information) with essentially no errors. Our representation yields zero errors while increasing the space requirements by less than 18-28% compared to the approximate de Bruijn graph representation in Squeakr. Our technique is based on a simple invariant that all weighted de Bruijn Graphs must satisfy, and hence is likely to be of general interest and applicable in most weighted de Bruijn Graph-based systems.Availability and implementation:https://github.com/splatlab/debgr .Contact:rob.patro@cs.stonybrook.edu.Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",28881995,PMC5870571,10.1093/bioinformatics/btx261,9
Chromosome-level hybrid de novo genome assemblies as an attainable option for nonmodel insects,"The emergence of third-generation sequencing (3GS; long-reads) is bringing closer the goal of chromosome-size fragments in de novo genome assemblies. This allows the exploration of new and broader questions on genome evolution for a number of nonmodel organisms. However, long-read technologies result in higher sequencing error rates and therefore impose an elevated cost of sufficient coverage to achieve high enough quality. In this context, hybrid assemblies, combining short-reads and long-reads, provide an alternative efficient and cost-effective approach to generate de novo, chromosome-level genome assemblies. The array of available software programs for hybrid genome assembly, sequence correction and manipulation are constantly being expanded and improved. This makes it difficult for nonexperts to find efficient, fast and tractable computational solutions for genome assembly, especially in the case of nonmodel organisms lacking a reference genome or one from a closely related species. In this study, we review and test the most recent pipelines for hybrid assemblies, comparing the model organism Drosophila melanogaster to a nonmodel cactophilic Drosophila, D. mojavensis. We show that it is possible to achieve excellent contiguity on this nonmodel organism using the dbg2olc pipeline.",32329220,,10.1111/1755-0998.13176,7
Expansion of GGC repeat in the human-specific NOTCH2NLC gene is associated with essential tremor,"Essential tremor is one of the most common movement disorders. Despite its high prevalence and heritability, the genetic aetiology of essential tremor remains elusive. Up to now, only a few genes/loci have been identified, but these genes have not been replicated in other essential tremor families or cohorts. Here we report a genetic study in a cohort of 197 Chinese pedigrees clinically diagnosed with essential tremor. Using a comprehensive strategy combining linkage analysis, whole-exome sequencing, long-read whole-genome sequencing, repeat-primed polymerase chain reaction and GC-rich polymerase chain reaction, we identified an abnormal GGC repeat expansion in the 5' region of the NOTCH2NLC gene that co-segregated with disease in 11 essential tremor families (5.58%) from our cohort. Clinically, probands that had an abnormal GGC repeat expansion were found to have more severe tremor phenotypes, lower activities of daily living ability. Obvious genetic anticipation was also detected in these 11 essential tremor-positive families. These results indicate that abnormal GGC repeat expansion in the 5' region of NOTCH2NLC gene is associated with essential tremor, and provide strong evidence that essential tremor is a family of diseases with high clinical and genetic heterogeneities.",31819945,,10.1093/brain/awz372,78
Benchmarking ultra-high molecular weight DNA preservation methods for long-read and long-range sequencing,"Background:Studies in vertebrate genomics require sampling from a broad range of tissue types, taxa, and localities. Recent advancements in long-read and long-range genome sequencing have made it possible to produce high-quality chromosome-level genome assemblies for almost any organism. However, adequate tissue preservation for the requisite ultra-high molecular weight DNA (uHMW DNA) remains a major challenge. Here we present a comparative study of preservation methods for field and laboratory tissue sampling, across vertebrate classes and different tissue types.Results:We find that storage temperature was the strongest predictor of uHMW fragment lengths. While immediate flash-freezing remains the sample preservation gold standard, samples preserved in 95% EtOH or 20-25% DMSO-EDTA showed little fragment length degradation when stored at 4°C for 6 hours. Samples in 95% EtOH or 20-25% DMSO-EDTA kept at 4°C for 1 week after dissection still yielded adequate amounts of uHMW DNA for most applications. Tissue type was a significant predictor of total DNA yield but not fragment length. Preservation solution had a smaller but significant influence on both fragment length and DNA yield.Conclusion:We provide sample preservation guidelines that ensure sufficient DNA integrity and amount required for use with long-read and long-range sequencing technologies across vertebrates. Our best practices generated the uHMW DNA needed for the high-quality reference genomes for phase 1 of the Vertebrate Genomes Project, whose ultimate mission is to generate chromosome-level reference genome assemblies of all ∼70,000 extant vertebrate species.",35946988,PMC9364683,10.1093/gigascience/giac068,8
Draft Genome Assembly of the Aral Barbel Luciobarbus brachycephalus Using PacBio Sequencing,"The endangered Aral barbel Luciobarbus brachycephalus is endemic to the water systems of the Caspian Sea and Aral Sea. Given the scarcity of genetic data for the species, we present a draft assembly based on PacBio long-read sequencing technology. Approximate 299.4 Gb of long reads representing 166× of the estimated genome size were generated, and the final assembly was composed of 653 contigs totaling approximately 1,698.3 Mb, with a contig N50 length of 4.5 Mb. A total of 807.6 Mb represented approximately 47.6% of the assembly and were identified as repeats. Fifty-four thousand and six hundred possible protein genes were predicted, among which 50,727, representing approximately 92.9%, could be annotated by at least one database. Evolutionary analysis showed that L. brachycephalus and Labeo rohita diverged by approximately 42.6 Ma, and the obvious expansion of gene families residing in the L. brachycephalus genome may be attributed to the specific whole-genome duplication of the species. The first genome assembly of L. brachycephalus can not only provide a foundation for genetic conservation and molecular breeding of this species but also contribute to comparative analyses of genome biology and evolution within Cyprinidae.",34255058,PMC8489429,10.1093/gbe/evab131,0
Long-read sequencing characterizes mitochondrial and plastid genome variants in Arabidopsis msh1 mutants,"The abundant repeats in plant mitochondrial genomes can cause rapid genome rearrangements and are also a major obstacle in short-read sequencing studies. Nuclear-encoded proteins such as MSH1 are known to suppress the generation of repeat-associated mitochondrial genome variants, but our understanding of these mechanisms has been constrained by the limitations of short-read technologies. Here, we used highly accurate long-read sequencing (PacBio HiFi) to characterize mitochondrial and plastid genome variants in Arabidopsis thaliana msh1 mutant individuals. The HiFi reads provided a global view of recombination dynamics with detailed quantification of parental and crossover recombination products for both large and small repeats. We found that recombination breakpoints were distributed relatively evenly across the length of repeated sequences and detected widespread internal exchanges of sequence variants between pairs of imperfect repeats in the mitochondrial genome of msh1 mutants. Long-read assemblies of mitochondrial genomes from seven other A. thaliana wild-type accessions differed by repeat-mediated structural rearrangements similar to those observed in msh1 mutants, but they were all in a simple low-heteroplasmy state. The Arabidopsis plastid genome generally lacks small repeats and exhibited a very different pattern of variant accumulation in msh1 mutants compared with the mitochondrial genome. Our data illustrate the power of HiFi technology in studying repeat-mediated recombination in plant organellar genomes and improved the sequence resolution for recombinational processes suppressed by MSH1. Plant organellar genomes can undergo rapid rearrangements. Long-read sequencing provides a detailed and quantitative view of mitochondrial and plastid genome variants normally suppressed by MSH1, advancing our understanding of plant organellar genome dynamics.",36097957,PMC9617793,10.1111/tpj.15976,5
Identification of cell barcodes from long-read single-cell RNA-seq with BLAZE,"Long-read single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables the quantification of RNA isoforms in individual cells. However, long-read scRNA-seq using the Oxford Nanopore platform has largely relied upon matched short-read data to identify cell barcodes. We introduce BLAZE, which accurately and efficiently identifies 10x cell barcodes using only nanopore long-read scRNA-seq data. BLAZE outperforms the existing tools and provides an accurate representation of the cells present in long-read scRNA-seq when compared to matched short reads. BLAZE simplifies long-read scRNA-seq while improving the results, is compatible with downstream tools accepting a cell barcode file, and is available at https://github.com/shimlab/BLAZE .",37024980,PMC10077662,10.1186/s13059-023-02907-y,10
Chromosome level assembly and comparative genome analysis confirm lager-brewing yeasts originated from a single hybridization,"Background:The lager brewing yeast, S. pastorianus, is a hybrid between S. cerevisiae and S. eubayanus with extensive chromosome aneuploidy. S. pastorianus is subdivided into Group 1 and Group 2 strains, where Group 2 strains have higher copy number and a larger degree of heterozygosity for S. cerevisiae chromosomes. As a result, Group 2 strains were hypothesized to have emerged from a hybridization event distinct from Group 1 strains. Current genome assemblies of S. pastorianus strains are incomplete and highly fragmented, limiting our ability to investigate their evolutionary history.Results:To fill this gap, we generated a chromosome-level genome assembly of the S. pastorianus strain CBS 1483 from Oxford Nanopore MinION DNA sequencing data and analysed the newly assembled subtelomeric regions and chromosome heterozygosity. To analyse the evolutionary history of S. pastorianus strains, we developed Alpaca: a method to compute sequence similarity between genomes without assuming linear evolution. Alpaca revealed high similarities between the S. cerevisiae subgenomes of Group 1 and 2 strains, and marked differences from sequenced S. cerevisiae strains.Conclusions:Our findings suggest that Group 1 and Group 2 strains originated from a single hybridization involving a heterozygous S. cerevisiae strain, followed by different evolutionary trajectories. The clear differences between both groups may originate from a severe population bottleneck caused by the isolation of the first pure cultures. Alpaca provides a computationally inexpensive method to analyse evolutionary relationships while considering non-linear evolution such as horizontal gene transfer and sexual reproduction, providing a complementary viewpoint beyond traditional phylogenetic approaches.",31791228,PMC6889557,10.1186/s12864-019-6263-3,26
Accurate transcriptome assembly by Nanopore RNA sequencing reveals novel functional transcripts in hepatocellular carcinoma,"The long reads of Nanopore sequencing permit accurate transcript assembly and ease in discovering novel transcripts with potentially important functions in cancers. The wide adoption of Nanopore sequencing for transcript quantification, however, is largely limited by high costs. To address this issue, we developed a bioinformatics software, NovelQuant, that can specifically quantify long-read-assembled novel transcripts with short-read sequencing data. Nanopore Direct RNA Sequencing was carried out on three hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients' tumor, matched portal vein tumor thrombus, and peritumor to reconstruct the HCC transcriptome. Then, based on the reconstructed transcriptome, NovelQuant was applied on Illumina RNA sequencing data of 59 HCC patients' tumor and paired peritumor to quantify novel transcripts. Our further analysis revealed 361 novel transcripts dysregulated in HCC and that 101 of them were significantly associated with prognosis. There were 19 novel prognostic transcripts predicted to be long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), and some of them had regulatory targets that were reported to be associated with HCC. Additionally, 42 novel prognostic transcripts were predicted to be protein-coding mRNAs, and many of them could be involved in xenobiotic metabolism. Moreover, the tumor-suppressive roles of two representative novel prognostic transcripts, CDO1-novel (lncRNA) and CYP2A6-novel (protein-coding mRNA), were further functionally validated during HCC progression. Overall, the current study shows a possibility of combining long- and short-read sequencing to explore functionally important novel transcripts in HCC with accuracy and cost-efficiency, which expands the pool of molecular biomarkers that could enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of HCC.",34255396,PMC8409408,10.1111/cas.15058,3
Improving the microbial community reconstruction at the genus level by multiple 16S rRNA regions,"Background:16S rRNA genes have been widely used for phylogenetic reconstruction and the quantification of microbial diversity through the application of next-generation sequencing technology. However, long-read sequencing is still costly, while short-read sequencing carries less information for complex microbial community profiling; therefore, the applications of high throughput sequencing platforms still remain challenging in microbial community reconstruction analysis.Results:Here, we developed a method to investigate the profile of aligned 16S rRNA gene sequences and to measure the proper region for microbial community reconstruction, as a step in creating a more efficient way to detect microorganism at the genus level. Finally, we found that each genus has its own preferential genus-specific amplicons for a genus assignment, which are not always located in hyper variable regions (HVRs). It was also noted that the rare genera should contribute less than dominant ones to the common profile of the aligned 16S rRNA sequences and have lower affinity to the common universal primer.Conclusions:Therefore, using multiple 16S rRNA regions rather than one ""universal"" region can significantly improve the ability of microbial community reconstruction. In addition, we found that a short fragment is suitable for most genera identifications, and the proper conserved regions used for primer design are larger than before.",27000773,,10.1016/j.jtbi.2016.03.016,5
Metagenomic binning with assembly graph embeddings,"Motivation:Despite recent advancements in sequencing technologies and assembly methods, obtaining high-quality microbial genomes from metagenomic samples is still not a trivial task. Current metagenomic binners do not take full advantage of assembly graphs and are not optimized for long-read assemblies. Deep graph learning algorithms have been proposed in other fields to deal with complex graph data structures. The graph structure generated during the assembly process could be integrated with contig features to obtain better bins with deep learning.Results:We propose GraphMB, which uses graph neural networks to incorporate the assembly graph into the binning process. We test GraphMB on long-read datasets of different complexities, and compare the performance with other binners in terms of the number of High Quality (HQ) genome bins obtained. With our approach, we were able to obtain unique bins on all real datasets, and obtain more bins on most datasets. In particular, we obtained on average 17.5% more HQ bins when compared with state-of-the-art binners and 13.7% when aggregating the results of our binner with the others. These results indicate that a deep learning model can integrate contig-specific and graph-structure information to improve metagenomic binning.Availability and implementation:GraphMB is available from https://github.com/MicrobialDarkMatter/GraphMB.Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",35972375,PMC9525014,10.1093/bioinformatics/btac557,8
Comprehensive gene profiling of the metabolic landscape of humanized livers in mice,"Background & aims:The human liver transcriptome is complex and highly dynamic, e.g. one gene may produce multiple distinct transcripts, each with distinct posttranscriptional modifications. Direct knowledge of transcriptome dynamics, however, is largely obscured by the inaccessibility of the human liver to treatments and the insufficient annotation of the human liver transcriptome at transcript and RNA modification levels.Methods:We generated mice that carry humanized livers of identical genetic background and subjected them to representative metabolic treatments. We then analyzed the humanized livers with nanopore single-molecule direct RNA sequencing to determine the expression level, m6A modification and poly(A) tail length of all RNA transcript isoforms. Our system allows for the de novo annotation of human liver transcriptomes to reflect metabolic responses and for the study of transcriptome dynamics in parallel.Results:Our analysis uncovered a vast number of novel genes and transcripts. Our transcript-level analysis of human liver transcriptomes also identified a multitude of regulated metabolic pathways that were otherwise invisible using conventional short-read RNA sequencing. We revealed for the first time the dynamic changes in m6A and poly(A) tail length of human liver transcripts, many of which are transcribed from key metabolic genes. Furthermore, we performed comparative analyses of gene regulation between humans and mice, and between two individuals using the liver-specific humanized mice, revealing that transcriptome dynamics are highly species- and genetic background-dependent.Conclusion:Our work revealed a complex metabolic response landscape of the human liver transcriptome and provides a novel resource to understand transcriptome dynamics of the human liver in response to physiologically relevant metabolic stimuli (https://caolab.shinyapps.io/human_hepatocyte_landscape/).Impact and implications:Direct knowledge of the human liver transcriptome is currently very limited, hindering the overall understanding of human liver pathophysiology. We combined a liver-specific humanized mouse model and long-read direct RNA sequencing technology to establish a de novo annotation of the human liver transcriptome and identified a multitude of regulated metabolic pathways that were otherwise invisible using conventional technologies. The extensive regulatory information on human genes we provided could enable basic scientists to infer the pathological relevance of their genes of interest and physician scientists to better pinpoint the changes in metabolic networks underlying a specific pathophysiology.",38049085,,10.1016/j.jhep.2023.11.020,0
Massively parallel DNA target capture using long adapter single stranded oligonucleotide (LASSO) probes assembled through a novel DNA recombinase mediated methodology,"In the attempt to bridge the widening gap from DNA sequence to biological function, we developed a novel methodology to assemble Long-Adapter Single-Strand Oligonucleotide (LASSO) probe libraries that enabled the massively multiplexed capture of kilobase-sized DNA fragments for downstream long read DNA sequencing or expression. This method uses short DNA oligonucleotides (pre-LASSO probes) and a plasmid vector that supplies the linker sequence for the mature LASSO probe through Cre-LoxP intramolecular recombination. This strategy generates high quality LASSO probes libraries (≈46% of correct probes). We performed NGS analysis of the post-capture PCR amplification of DNA circles obtained from the LASSO capture of 3087 Escherichia coli ORFs spanning from 400- to 5000 bp. The median enrichment of all targeted ORFs versus untargeted ORFs was 30 times. For ORFs up to 1kb in size, targeted ORFs were enriched up to a median of 260-fold. Here, we show that LASSO probes obtained in this manner, were able to capture full-length open reading frames from total human cDNA. Furthermore, we show that the LASSO capture specificity and sensitivity is sufficient for target capture from total human genomic DNA template. This technology can be used for the preparation of long-read sequencing libraries and for massively multiplexed cloning of human sequences.",34775678,PMC8825753,10.1002/biot.202100240,1
Evaluation of methods to detect circular RNAs from single-end RNA-sequencing data,"Background:Circular RNA (circRNA), a class of RNA molecule with a loop structure, has recently attracted researchers due to its diverse biological functions and potential biomarkers of human diseases. Most of the current circRNA detection methods from RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) data utilize the mapping information of paired-end (PE) reads to eliminate false positives. However, much of the practical RNA-Seq data such as cross-linking immunoprecipitation sequencing (CLIP-Seq) data usually contain single-end (SE) reads. It is not clear how well these tools perform on SE RNA-Seq data.Results:In this study, we present a systematic evaluation of six advanced RNA-based methods and two CLIP-Seq based methods for detecting circRNAs from SE RNA-Seq data. The performances of the methods are rigorously assessed based on precision, sensitivity, F1 score, and true discovery rate. We investigate the impacts of read length, false positive ratio, sequencing depth and PE mapping information on the performances of the methods using simulated SE RNA-Seq simulated datasets. The real datasets used in this study consist of four experimental RNA-Seq datasets with ≥100bp read length and 124 CLIP-Seq samples from 45 studies that contain mostly short-read (≤50bp) RNA-Seq data. The simulation study shows that the sensitivities of most of the methods can be improved by increasing either read length or sequencing depth, and that the levels of false positive rates significantly affect the precision of all methods. Furthermore, the PE mapping information can improve the method's precision but can not always guarantee the increase of F1 score. Overall, no method is dominant for all SE RNA-Seq data. The RNA-based methods perform better for the long-read datasets but are worse for the short-read datasets. In contrast, the CLIP-Seq based methods outperform the RNA-Seq based methods for all the short-read samples. Combining the results of these methods can significantly improve precision in the CLIP-Seq data.Conclusions:The results provide a systematic evaluation of circRNA detection methods on SE RNA-Seq data that would facilitate researchers' strategies in circRNA analysis.",35135477,PMC8822704,10.1186/s12864-022-08329-7,2
DNA methylation-calling tools for Oxford Nanopore sequencing: a survey and human epigenome-wide evaluation,"Background:Nanopore long-read sequencing technology greatly expands the capacity of long-range, single-molecule DNA-modification detection. A growing number of analytical tools have been developed to detect DNA methylation from nanopore sequencing reads. Here, we assess the performance of different methylation-calling tools to provide a systematic evaluation to guide researchers performing human epigenome-wide studies.Results:We compare seven analytic tools for detecting DNA methylation from nanopore long-read sequencing data generated from human natural DNA at a whole-genome scale. We evaluate the per-read and per-site performance of CpG methylation prediction across different genomic contexts, CpG site coverage, and computational resources consumed by each tool. The seven tools exhibit different performances across the evaluation criteria. We show that the methylation prediction at regions with discordant DNA methylation patterns, intergenic regions, low CG density regions, and repetitive regions show room for improvement across all tools. Furthermore, we demonstrate that 5hmC levels at least partly contribute to the discrepancy between bisulfite and nanopore sequencing. Lastly, we provide an online DNA methylation database ( https://nanome.jax.org ) to display the DNA methylation levels detected by nanopore sequencing and bisulfite sequencing data across different genomic contexts.Conclusions:Our study is the first systematic benchmark of computational methods for detection of mammalian whole-genome DNA modifications in nanopore sequencing. We provide a broad foundation for cross-platform standardization and an evaluation of analytical tools designed for genome-scale modified base detection using nanopore sequencing.",34663425,PMC8524990,10.1186/s13059-021-02510-z,67
Comparative evaluation of analytical pipelines for illumina short- and nanopore long-read 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing with mock microbial communities,"Utility of a recently developed long-read pipeline, Emu, was assessed using an expectation-maximization algorithm for accurate read classification.

The Utilization of Reference-Guided Assembly and In Silico Libraries Improves the Draft Genome of Clarias batrachus and Culter alburnus,"Long-read sequencing technologies can generate highly contiguous genome assemblies compared to short-read methods. However, their higher cost often poses a significant barrier. To address this, we explore the utilization of mapping-based genome assembly and reference-guided assembly as cost-effective alternative approaches. We assess the efficacy of these approaches in improving the contiguity of Clarias batrachus and Culter alburnus draft genomes. Our findings demonstrate that employing an iterative mapping strategy leads to a reduction in assembly errors. Specifically, after three iterations, the Mismatches per 100 kbp value for the C. batrachus genome decreased from 2447.20 to 2432.67, reaching a minimum of 2422.67 after two iterations. Additionally, the N50 value for the C. batrachus genome increased from 362,143 to 1,315,126 bp, with a maximum of 1,315,403 bp after two iterations. Furthermore, we achieved Mismatches per 100 kbp values of 3.70 for the reference-guided assembly of C. batrachus and 0.34 for C. alburnus. Correspondingly, the N50 value for the C. batrachus and C. alburnus genomes increased from 362,143 bp and 3,686,385 bp to 2,026,888 bp and 43,735,735 bp, respectively. Finally, we successfully utilized the improved C. batrachus and C. alburnus genomes to compare genome studies using the combined approach of Ragout and Ragtag. Through a comprehensive comparative analysis of mapping-based and reference-guided genome assembly methods, we shed light on the specific contributions of reference-guided assembly in reducing assembly errors and improving assembly continuity and integrity. These advancements establish reference-guided assembly and the utilization of in silico libraries as a promising and suitable approach for comparative genomics studies.",37661218,,10.1007/s10126-023-10248-x,0
The tea plant reference genome and improved gene annotation using long-read and paired-end sequencing data,"Tea is a globally consumed non-alcohol beverage with great economic importance. However, lack of the reference genome has largely hampered the utilization of precious tea plant genetic resources towards breeding. To address this issue, we previously generated a high-quality reference genome of tea plant using Illumina and PacBio sequencing technology, which produced a total of 2,124 Gb short and 125 Gb long read data, respectively. A hybrid strategy was employed to assemble the tea genome that has been publicly released. We here described the data framework used to generate, annotate and validate the genome assembly. Besides, we re-predicted the protein-coding genes and annotated their putative functions using more comprehensive omics datasets with improved training models. We reassessed the assembly and annotation quality using the latest version of BUSCO. These data can be utilized to develop new methodologies/tools for better assembly of complex genomes, aid in finding of novel genes, variations and evolutionary clues associated with tea quality, thus help to breed new varieties with high yield and better quality in the future.",31308375,PMC6629666,10.1038/s41597-019-0127-1,11
High-quality genome sequence of white lupin provides insight into soil exploration and seed quality,"White lupin (Lupinus albus L.) is an annual crop cultivated for its protein-rich seeds. It is adapted to poor soils due to the production of cluster roots, which are made of dozens of determinate lateral roots that drastically improve soil exploration and nutrient acquisition (mostly phosphate). Using long-read sequencing technologies, we provide a high-quality genome sequence of a cultivated accession of white lupin (2n = 50, 451 Mb), as well as de novo assemblies of a landrace and a wild relative. We describe a modern accession displaying increased soil exploration capacity through early establishment of lateral and cluster roots. We also show how seed quality may have been impacted by domestication in term of protein profiles and alkaloid content. The availability of a high-quality genome assembly together with companion genomic and transcriptomic resources will enable the development of modern breeding strategies to increase and stabilize white lupin yield.",31980615,PMC6981116,10.1038/s41467-019-14197-9,43
Genome Assembly and Annotation of the Trichoplusia ni Tni-FNL Insect Cell Line Enabled by Long-Read Technologies,"Background:Trichoplusianiderived cell lines are commonly used to enable recombinant protein expression via baculovirus infection to generate materials approved for clinical use and in clinical trials. In order to develop systems biology and genome engineering tools to improve protein expression in this host, we performed de novo genome assembly of theTrichoplusiani-derived cell line Tni-FNL.Methods:By integration of PacBio single-molecule sequencing, Bionano optical mapping, and 10X Genomics linked-reads data, we have produced a draft genome assembly of Tni-FNL.Results:Our assembly contains 280 scaffolds, with a N50 scaffold size of 2.3 Mb and a total length of 359 Mb. Annotation of the Tni-FNL genome resulted in 14,101 predicted genes and 93.2% of the predicted proteome contained recognizable protein domains. Ortholog searches within the superorderHolometabolaprovided further evidence of high accuracy and completeness of the Tni-FNL genome assembly.Conclusions:This first draft Tni-FNL genome assembly was enabled by complementary long-read technologies and represents a high-quality, well-annotated genome that provides novel insight into the complexity of this insect cell line and can serve as a reference for future large-scale genome engineering work in this and other similar recombinant protein production hosts.",30678108,PMC6409714,10.3390/genes10020079,10
Assessing structural variation in a personal genome-towards a human reference diploid genome,"Background:Characterizing large genomic variants is essential to expanding the research and clinical applications of genome sequencing. While multiple data types and methods are available to detect these structural variants (SVs), they remain less characterized than smaller variants because of SV diversity, complexity, and size. These challenges are exacerbated by the experimental and computational demands of SV analysis. Here, we characterize the SV content of a personal genome with Parliament, a publicly available consensus SV-calling infrastructure that merges multiple data types and SV detection methods.Results:We demonstrate Parliament's efficacy via integrated analyses of data from whole-genome array comparative genomic hybridization, short-read next-generation sequencing, long-read (Pacific BioSciences RSII), long-insert (Illumina Nextera), and whole-genome architecture (BioNano Irys) data from the personal genome of a single subject (HS1011). From this genome, Parliament identified 31,007 genomic loci between 100 bp and 1 Mbp that are inconsistent with the hg19 reference assembly. Of these loci, 9,777 are supported as putative SVs by hybrid local assembly, long-read PacBio data, or multi-source heuristics. These SVs span 59 Mbp of the reference genome (1.8%) and include 3,801 events identified only with long-read data. The HS1011 data and complete Parliament infrastructure, including a BAM-to-SV workflow, are available on the cloud-based service DNAnexus.Conclusions:HS1011 SV analysis reveals the limits and advantages of multiple sequencing technologies, specifically the impact of long-read SV discovery. With the full Parliament infrastructure, the HS1011 data constitute a public resource for novel SV discovery, software calibration, and personal genome structural variation analysis.",25886820,PMC4490614,10.1186/s12864-015-1479-3,89
Context-aware transcript quantification from long-read RNA-seq data with Bambu,"Most approaches to transcript quantification rely on fixed reference annotations; however, the transcriptome is dynamic and depending on the context, such static annotations contain inactive isoforms for some genes, whereas they are incomplete for others. Here we present Bambu, a method that performs machine-learning-based transcript discovery to enable quantification specific to the context of interest using long-read RNA-sequencing. To identify novel transcripts, Bambu estimates the novel discovery rate, which replaces arbitrary per-sample thresholds with a single, interpretable, precision-calibrated parameter. Bambu retains the full-length and unique read counts, enabling accurate quantification in presence of inactive isoforms. Compared to existing methods for transcript discovery, Bambu achieves greater precision without sacrificing sensitivity. We show that context-aware annotations improve quantification for both novel and known transcripts. We apply Bambu to quantify isoforms from repetitive HERVH-LTR7 retrotransposons in human embryonic stem cells, demonstrating the ability for context-specific transcript expression analysis.",37308696,PMC10448944,10.1038/s41592-023-01908-w,24
"A genomic resource derived from the integration of genome sequences, expressed transcripts and genetic markers in ramie","Background:The redundancy of genomic resources, including transcript and molecular markers, and their uncertain position in the genome have dramatically hindered the study of traits in ramie, an important natural fiber crop.Results:We obtained a high-quality transcriptome consisting of 30,591 non-redundant transcripts using single-molecule long-read sequencing and proposed it as a universal ramie transcriptome. Additionally, 55,882 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified and a high-density genetic map was developed. Based on this genetic map, 181.7 Mb ramie genome sequences were assembled into 14 chromosomes. For the convenient use of these resources, 29,286 (~ 95.7%) of the transcripts and all 55,882 SNPs, along with 1827 previously reported sequence repeat markers (SSRs), were mapped into the ramie genome, and 22,343 (~ 73.0%) transcripts, 50,154 (~ 89.7%) SNPs, and 1466 (~ 80.3%) SSRs were assigned to a specific location in the corresponding chromosome.Conclusion:This is the first study to characterize the ramie transcriptome by long-read sequencing, and the substantial number of transcripts of significant length obtained will accelerate our understanding of ramie growth and development. This integration of genome sequences, expressed transcripts, and genetic markers will provide an extremely useful resource for genetic, molecular, and breeding studies of ramie.",31185891,PMC6558782,10.1186/s12864-019-5878-8,2
Using Direct RNA Nanopore Sequencing to Deconvolute Viral Transcriptomes,"The genomes of DNA viruses encode deceptively complex transcriptomes evolved to maximize coding potential within the confines of a relatively small genome. Defining the full range of viral RNAs produced during an infection is key to understanding the viral replication cycle and its interactions with the host cell. Traditional short-read (Illumina) sequencing approaches are problematic in this setting due to the difficulty of assigning short reads to individual RNAs in regions of transcript overlap and to the biases introduced by the required recoding and amplification steps. Additionally, different methodologies may be required to analyze the 5' and 3' ends of RNAs, which increases both cost and effort. The advent of long-read nanopore sequencing simplifies this approach by providing a single assay that captures and sequences full length RNAs, either in cDNA or native RNA form. The latter is particularly appealing as it reduces known recoding biases whilst allowing more advanced analyses such as estimation of poly(A) tail length and the detection of RNA modifications including N6-methyladenosine. Using herpes simplex virus (HSV)-infected primary fibroblasts as a template, we provide a step-by-step guide to the production of direct RNA sequencing libraries suitable for sequencing using Oxford Nanopore Technologies platforms and provide a simple computational approach to deriving a high-quality annotation of the HSV transcriptome from the resulting sequencing data. © 2020 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Long-read direct RNA sequencing of the mitochondrial transcriptome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae reveals condition-dependent intron abundance,"Mitochondria fulfil many essential roles and have their own genome, which is expressed as polycistronic transcripts that undergo co- or posttranscriptional processing and splicing. Due to the inherent complexity and limited technical accessibility of the mitochondrial transcriptome, fundamental questions regarding mitochondrial gene expression and splicing remain unresolved, even in the model eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Long-read sequencing could address these fundamental questions. Therefore, a method for the enrichment of mitochondrial RNA and sequencing using Nanopore technology was developed, enabling the resolution of splicing of polycistronic genes and the quantification of spliced RNA. This method successfully captured the full mitochondrial transcriptome and resolved RNA splicing patterns with single-base resolution and was applied to explore the transcriptome of S. cerevisiae grown with glucose or ethanol as the sole carbon source, revealing the impact of growth conditions on mitochondrial RNA expression and splicing. This study uncovered a remarkable difference in the turnover of Group II introns between yeast grown in either mostly fermentative or fully respiratory conditions. Whether this accumulation of introns in glucose medium has an impact on mitochondrial functions remains to be explored. Combined with the high tractability of the model yeast S. cerevisiae, the developed method enables to monitor mitochondrial transcriptome responses in a broad range of relevant contexts, including oxidative stress, apoptosis and mitochondrial diseases.",37642136,,10.1002/yea.3893,0
Fully phased human genome assembly without parental data using single-cell strand sequencing and long reads,"Human genomes are typically assembled as consensus sequences that lack information on parental haplotypes. Here we describe a reference-free workflow for diploid de novo genome assembly that combines the chromosome-wide phasing and scaffolding capabilities of single-cell strand sequencing1,2with continuous long-read or high-fidelity3sequencing data. Employing this strategy, we produced a completely phased de novo genome assembly for each haplotype of an individual of Puerto Rican descent (HG00733) in the absence of parental data. The assemblies are accurate (quality value > 40) and highly contiguous (contig N50 > 23 Mbp) with low switch error rates (0.17%), providing fully phased single-nucleotide variants, indels and structural variants. A comparison of Oxford Nanopore Technologies and Pacific Biosciences phased assemblies identified 154 regions that are preferential sites of contig breaks, irrespective of sequencing technology or phasing algorithms.",33288906,PMC7954704,10.1038/s41587-020-0719-5,72

LIQA incorporates base pair quality score and isoform-specific read length information in a survival model to assign different weights across reads, and uses an expectation-maximization algorithm for parameter estimation. We apply LIQA to long-read RNA-seq data from the Universal Human Reference, acute myeloid leukemia, and esophageal squamous epithelial cells and demonstrate its high accuracy in profiling alternative splicing events.",34140043,PMC8212471,10.1186/s13059-021-02399-8,37
Impact of Bead-Beating Intensity on the Genus- and Species-Level Characterization of the Gut Microbiome Using Amplicon and Complete 16S rRNA Gene Sequencing,"Bead-beating within a DNA extraction protocol is critical for complete microbial cell lysis and accurate assessment of the abundance and composition of the microbiome. While the impact of bead-beating on the recovery of OTUs at the phylum and class level have been studied, its influence on species-level microbiome recovery is not clear. Recent advances in sequencing technology has allowed species-level resolution of the microbiome using full length 16S rRNA gene sequencing instead of smaller amplicons that only capture a few hypervariable regions of the gene. We sequenced the v3-v4 hypervariable region as well as the full length 16S rRNA gene in mouse and human stool samples and discovered major clusters of gut bacteria that exhibit different levels of sensitivity to bead-beating treatment. Full length 16S rRNA gene sequencing unraveled vast species diversity in the mouse and human gut microbiome and enabled characterization of several unclassified OTUs in amplicon data. Many species of major gut commensals such asBacteroides, Lactobacillus, Blautia, Clostridium, Escherichia, Roseburia, Helicobacter, andRuminococcuswere identified. Interestingly, v3-v4 amplicon data classified about 50% ofRuminococcusreads asRuminococcus gnavusspecies which showed maximum abundance in a 9 min beaten sample. However, the remaining 50% of reads could not be assigned to any species. Full length 16S rRNA gene sequencing data showed that the majority of the unclassified reads wereRuminococcus albusspecies which unlikeR. gnavusshowed maximum recovery in the unbeaten sample instead. Furthermore, we found that theBlautia hominisandStreptococcus parasanguinisspecies were differently sensitive to bead-beating treatment than the rest of the species in these genera. Thus, the present study demonstrates species level variations in sensitivity to bead-beating treatment that could only be resolved with full length 16S rRNA sequencing. This study identifies species of common gut commensals and potential pathogens that require minimum (0-1 min) or extensive (4-9 min) bead-beating for their maximal recovery.",34660333,PMC8517478,10.3389/fcimb.2021.678522,10
"High-quality genome assembly of Huazhan and Tianfeng, the parents of an elite rice hybrid Tian-you-hua-zhan","High-quality rice reference genomes have accelerated the comprehensive identification of genome-wide variations and research on functional genomics and breeding. Tian-you-hua-zhan has been a leading hybrid in China over the past decade. Here, de novo genome assembly strategy optimization for the rice indica lines Huazhan (HZ) and Tianfeng (TF), including sequencing platforms, assembly pipelines and sequence depth, was carried out. The PacBio and Nanopore platforms for long-read sequencing were utilized, with the Canu, wtdbg2, SMARTdenovo, Flye, Canu-wtdbg2, Canu-SMARTdenovo and Canu-Flye assemblers. The combination of PacBio and Canu was optimal, considering the contig N50 length, contig number, assembled genome size and polishing process. The assembled contigs were scaffolded with Hi-C data, resulting in two ""golden quality"" rice reference genomes, and evaluated using the scaffold N50, BUSCO, and LTR assembly index. Furthermore, 42,625 and 41,815 non-transposable element genes were annotated for HZ and TF, respectively. Based on our assembly of HZ and TF, as well as Zhenshan97, Minghui63, Shuhui498 and 9311, comprehensive variations were identified using Nipponbare as a reference.

Scalable long read self-correction and assembly polishing with multiple sequence alignment,"Third-generation sequencing technologies allow to sequence long reads of tens of kbp, that are expected to solve various problems. However, they display high error rates, currently capped around 10%. Self-correction is thus regularly used in long reads analysis projects. We introduce CONSENT, a new self-correction method that relies both on multiple sequence alignment and local de Bruijn graphs. To ensure scalability, multiple sequence alignment computation benefits from a new and efficient segmentation strategy, allowing a massive speedup. CONSENT compares well to the state-of-the-art, and performs better on real Oxford Nanopore data. Specifically, CONSENT is the only method that efficiently scales to ultra-long reads, and allows to process a full human dataset, containing reads reaching up to 1.5 Mbp, in 10 days. Moreover, our experiments show that error correction with CONSENT improves the quality of Flye assemblies. Additionally, CONSENT implements a polishing feature, allowing to correct raw assemblies. Our experiments show that CONSENT is 2-38x times faster than other polishing tools, while providing comparable results. Furthermore, we show that, on a human dataset, assembling the raw data and polishing the assembly is less resource consuming than correcting and then assembling the reads, while providing better results. CONSENT is available at https://github.com/morispi/CONSENT .",33436980,PMC7804095,10.1038/s41598-020-80757-5,22
Targeted nanopore sequencing with Cas9-guided adapter ligation,"Despite recent improvements in sequencing methods, there remains a need for assays that provide high sequencing depth and comprehensive variant detection. Current methods1-4are limited by the loss of native modifications, short read length, high input requirements, low yield or long protocols. In the present study, we describe nanopore Cas9-targeted sequencing (nCATS), an enrichment strategy that uses targeted cleavage of chromosomal DNA with Cas9 to ligate adapters for nanopore sequencing. We show that nCATS can simultaneously assess haplotype-resolved single-nucleotide variants, structural variations and CpG methylation. We apply nCATS to four cell lines, to a cell-line-derived xenograft, and to normal and paired tumor/normal primary human breast tissue. Median sequencing coverage was 675× using a MinION flow cell and 34× using the smaller Flongle flow cell. The nCATS sequencing requires only ~3 μg of genomic DNA and can target a large number of loci in a single reaction. The method will facilitate the use of long-read sequencing in research and in the clinic.",32042167,PMC7145730,10.1038/s41587-020-0407-5,159
Nanopore Sequencing and Hi-C Based De Novo Assembly ofTrachidermus fasciatusGenome,"Trachidermus fasciatusis a roughskin sculpin fish widespread across the coastal areas of East Asia. Due to environmental destruction and overfishing, the population of this species is under threat. In order to protect this endangered species, it is important to have the genome sequenced. Reference genomes are essential for studying population genetics, domestic farming, and genetic resource protection. However, currently, no reference genome is available forTrachidermus fasciatus, and this has greatly hindered the research on this species. In this study, we integrated nanopore long-read sequencing, Illumina short-read sequencing, and Hi-C methods to thoroughly assemble theTrachidermus fasciatusgenome. Our results provided a chromosome-level high-quality genome assembly with a predicted genome size of 542.6 Mbp (2n= 40) and a scaffold N50 of 24.9 Mbp. The BUSCO value for genome assembly completeness was higher than 96%, and the single-base accuracy was 99.997%. Based on EVM-StringTie genome annotation, a total of 19,147 protein-coding genes were identified, including 35,093 mRNA transcripts. In addition, a novel gene-finding strategy named RNR was introduced, and in total, 51 (82) novel genes (transcripts) were identified. Lastly, we present here the first reference genome forTrachidermus fasciatus; this sequence is expected to greatly facilitate future research on this species.",34066304,PMC8148166,10.3390/genes12050692,1
Genome annotation with long RNA reads reveals new patterns of gene expression and improves single-cell analyses in an ant brain,"Background:Functional genomic analyses rely on high-quality genome assemblies and annotations. Highly contiguous genome assemblies have become available for a variety of species, but accurate and complete annotation of gene models, inclusive of alternative splice isoforms and transcription start and termination sites, remains difficult with traditional approaches.Results:Here, we utilized full-length isoform sequencing (Iso-Seq), a long-read RNA sequencing technology, to obtain a comprehensive annotation of the transcriptome of the ant Harpegnathos saltator. The improved genome annotations include additional splice isoforms and extended 3' untranslated regions for more than 4000 genes. Reanalysis of RNA-seq experiments using these annotations revealed several genes with caste-specific differential expression and tissue- or caste-specific splicing patterns that were missed in previous analyses. The extended 3' untranslated regions afforded great improvements in the analysis of existing single-cell RNA-seq data, resulting in the recovery of the transcriptomes of 18% more cells. The deeper single-cell transcriptomes obtained with these new annotations allowed us to identify additional markers for several cell types in the ant brain, as well as genes differentially expressed across castes in specific cell types.Conclusions:Our results demonstrate that Iso-Seq is an efficient and effective approach to improve genome annotations and maximize the amount of information that can be obtained from existing and future genomic datasets in Harpegnathos and other organisms.",34838024,PMC8626913,10.1186/s12915-021-01188-w,8
[Progress in the Genetic Detection of Thalassemia Based on Third-Generation Gene Sequencing --Review],"Thalassemia is most widely distributed single gene autosome recessive genetic disease in the world, whose clinical manifestation was changed from asymptomatic anemia to severe anemia requiring continous blood transfusion to maintain life, thus resulting in a serious economic burden to society and families. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out the corresponding prentatal screening and diagnosis. Most of the conventional detection methods can only detect the common thalassemia genotype, it can easy to cause misdiagnosis or missed diagnosis for those rate genetic variantions. The third-generation sequecing (TGS) has been applied to the detection of thalassemia genes, which is more accurate, reliable and superior to the converntional detection methods. This article reviews the latest research progress of the TGS technology in genetic testing of thalassemia.",38660878,,10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2024.02.047,0
CentromereArchitect: inference and analysis of the architecture of centromeres,"Motivation:Recent advances in long-read sequencing technologies led to rapid progress in centromere assembly in the last year and, for the first time, opened a possibility to address the long-standing questions about the architecture and evolution of human centromeres. However, since these advances have not been yet accompanied by the development of the centromere-specific bioinformatics algorithms, even the fundamental questions (e.g. centromere annotation by deriving the complete set of human monomers and high-order repeats), let alone more complex questions (e.g. explaining how monomers and high-order repeats evolved) about human centromeres remain open. Moreover, even though there was a four-decade-long series of studies aimed at cataloging all human monomers and high-order repeats, the rigorous algorithmic definitions of these concepts are still lacking. Thus, the development of a centromere annotation tool is a prerequisite for follow-up personalized biomedical studies of centromeres across the human population and evolutionary studies of centromeres across various species.Results:We describe the CentromereArchitect, the first tool for the centromere annotation in a newly sequenced genome, apply it to the recently generated complete assembly of a human genome by the Telomere-to-Telomere consortium, generate the complete set of human monomers and high-order repeats for 'live' centromeres, and reveal a vast set of hybrid monomers that may represent the focal points of centromere evolution.Availability and implementation:CentromereArchitect is publicly available on https://github.com/ablab/stringdecomposer/tree/ismb2021.Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",34252949,PMC8336445,10.1093/bioinformatics/btab265,8
Scaffolding and completing genome assemblies in real-time with nanopore sequencing,"Third generation sequencing technologies provide the opportunity to improve genome assemblies by generating long reads spanning most repeat sequences. However, current analysis methods require substantial amounts of sequence data and computational resources to overcome the high error rates. Furthermore, they can only perform analysis after sequencing has completed, resulting in either over-sequencing, or in a low quality assembly due to under-sequencing. Here we present npScarf, which can scaffold and complete short read assemblies while the long read sequencing run is in progress. It reports assembly metrics in real-time so the sequencing run can be terminated once an assembly of sufficient quality is obtained. In assembling four bacterial and one eukaryotic genomes, we show that npScarf can construct more complete and accurate assemblies while requiring less sequencing data and computational resources than existing methods. Our approach offers a time- and resource-effective strategy for completing short read assemblies.",28218240,PMC5321748,10.1038/ncomms14515,52
Metagenomics Approaches for Improving Food Safety: A Review,"Abstract:Advancements in next-generation sequencing technology have dramatically reduced the cost and increased the ease of microbial whole genome sequencing. This approach is revolutionizing the identification and analysis of foodborne microbial pathogens, facilitating expedited detection and mitigation of foodborne outbreaks, improving public health outcomes, and limiting costly recalls. However, next-generation sequencing is still anchored in the traditional laboratory practice of the selection and culture of a single isolate. Metagenomic-based approaches, including metabarcoding and shotgun and long-read metagenomics, are part of the next disruptive revolution in food safety diagnostics and offer the potential to directly identify entire microbial communities in a single food, ingredient, or environmental sample. In this review, metagenomic-based approaches are introduced and placed within the context of conventional detection and diagnostic techniques, and essential considerations for undertaking metagenomic assays and data analysis are described. Recent applications of the use of metagenomics for food safety are discussed alongside current limitations and knowledge gaps and new opportunities arising from the use of this technology.",34706052,,10.4315/JFP-21-301,8
"Long-Read Sequencing andDe NovoGenome Assembly Pipeline of TwoPlasmodium falciparumClones (Pf3D7,PfW2) Using Only the PromethION Sequencer from Oxford Nanopore Technologies without Whole-Genome Amplification","Antimalarial drug resistance has become a real public health problem despite WHO measures. New sequencing technologies make it possible to investigate genomic variations associated with resistant phenotypes at the genome-wide scale. Based on the use of hemisynthetic nanopores, the PromethION technology from Oxford Nanopore Technologies can produce long-read sequences, in contrast to previous short-read technologies used as the gold standard to sequence Plasmodium. Two clones ofP. falciparum(Pf3D7 andPfW2) were sequenced in long-read using the PromethION sequencer from Oxford Nanopore Technologies without genomic amplification. This made it possible to create a processing analysis pipeline for humanPlasmodiumwith ONT Fastq only.De novoassembly revealed N50 lengths of 18,488 kb and 17,502 kb for thePf3D7 andPfW2, respectively. The genome size was estimated at 23,235,407 base pairs for thePf3D7clone and 21,712,038 base pairs for thePfW2 clone. The average genome coverage depth was estimated at 787X and 653X for thePf3D7 andPfW2 clones, respectively. This study proposes an assembly processing pipeline for the humanPlasmodiumgenome using software adapted to large ONT data and the high AT percentage ofPlasmodium. This search provides all the parameters which were optimized for use with the software selected in the pipeline.",38392307,PMC10886359,10.3390/biology13020089,0
"VIsoQLR: an interactive tool for the detection, quantification and fine-tuning of isoforms in selected genes using long-read sequencing","DNA variants altering the pre-mRNA splicing process represent an underestimated cause of human genetic diseases. Their association with disease traits should be confirmed using functional assays from patient cell lines or alternative models to detect aberrant mRNAs. Long-read sequencing is a suitable technique to identify and quantify mRNA isoforms. Available isoform detection and/or quantification tools are generally designed for the whole transcriptome analysis. However experiments focusing on genes of interest need more precise data fine-tuning and visualization tools.Here we describe VIsoQLR, an interactive analyzer, viewer and editor for the semi-automated identification and quantification of known and novel isoforms using long-read sequencing data. VIsoQLR is tailored to thoroughly analyze mRNA expression in splicing assays of selected genes. Our tool takes sequences aligned to a reference, and for each gene, it defines consensus splice sites and quantifies isoforms. VIsoQLR introduces features to edit the splice sites through dynamic and interactive graphics and tables, allowing accurate manual curation. Known isoforms detected by other methods can also be imported as references for comparison. A benchmark against two other popular transcriptome-based tools shows VIsoQLR accurate performance on both detection and quantification of isoforms. Here, we present VIsoQLR principles and features and its applicability in a case study example using nanopore-based long-read sequencing. VIsoQLR is available at https://github.com/TBLabFJD/VIsoQLR .",36881176,PMC10060319,10.1007/s00439-023-02539-z,1
"Canfam_GSD: De novo chromosome-length genome assembly of the German Shepherd Dog (Canis lupus familiaris) using a combination of long reads, optical mapping, and Hi-C","Background:The German Shepherd Dog (GSD) is one of the most common breeds on earth and has been bred for its utility and intelligence. It is often first choice for police and military work, as well as protection, disability assistance, and search-and-rescue. Yet, GSDs are well known to be susceptible to a range of genetic diseases that can interfere with their training. Such diseases are of particular concern when they occur later in life, and fully trained animals are not able to continue their duties.Findings:Here, we provide the draft genome sequence of a healthy German Shepherd female as a reference for future disease and evolutionary studies. We generated this improved canid reference genome (CanFam_GSD) utilizing a combination of Pacific Bioscience, Oxford Nanopore, 10X Genomics, Bionano, and Hi-C technologies. The GSD assembly is ∼80 times as contiguous as the current canid reference genome (20.9 vs 0.267 Mb contig N50), containing far fewer gaps (306 vs 23,876) and fewer scaffolds (429 vs 3,310) than the current canid reference genome CanFamv3.1. Two chromosomes (4 and 35) are assembled into single scaffolds with no gaps. BUSCO analyses of the genome assembly results show that 93.0% of the conserved single-copy genes are complete in the GSD assembly compared with 92.2% for CanFam v3.1. Homology-based gene annotation increases this value to ∼99%. Detailed examination of the evolutionarily important pancreatic amylase region reveals that there are most likely 7 copies of the gene, indicative of a duplication of 4 ancestral copies and the disruption of 1 copy.Conclusions:GSD genome assembly and annotation were produced with major improvement in completeness, continuity, and quality over the existing canid reference. This resource will enable further research related to canine diseases, the evolutionary relationships of canids, and other aspects of canid biology.",32236524,PMC7111595,10.1093/gigascience/giaa027,23
Identification of a unique conserved region from a kinetoplastid genome of Leishmania orientalis (formerly named Leishmania siamensis) strain PCM2 in Thailand,"Mitochondrial DNAs (mtDNAs) appear in almost all eukaryotic species and are useful molecular markers for phylogenetic studies and species identification. Kinetoplast DNAs (kDNAs) are structurally complex circular mtDNA networks in kinetoplastids, divided into maxicircles and minicircles. Despite several kDNAs of many Leishmania species being examined, the kDNAs of the new species, Leishmania orientalis (formerly named Leishmania siamensis) strain PCM2, have not been explored. This study aimed to investigate the maxicircle and minicircle DNAs of L. orientalis strain PCM2 using hybrid genome sequencing technologies and bioinformatic analyses. The kDNA sequences were isolated and assembled using the SPAdes hybrid assembler from the Illumina short-read and PacBio long-read data. Circular contigs of the maxicircle and minicircle DNAs were reconstructed and confirmed by BLASTn and rKOMICs programs. The kDNA genome was annotated by BLASTn before the genome comparison and phylogenetic analysis by progressiveMauve, MAFFT, and MEGA programs. The maxicircle of L. orientalis strain PCM2 (18,215 bp) showed 99.92% similarity and gene arrangement to Leishmania enriettii strain LEM3045 maxicircle with variation in the 12s rRNA gene and divergent region. Phylogenetics of the whole sequence, coding regions, divergent regions, and 12s rRNA gene also confirmed this relationship and subgenera separation. The identified 105 classes of minicircles (402-1177 bp) were clustered monophyletically and related to the Leishmania donovani minicircles. The kinetoplast maxicircle and minicircle DNAs of L. orientalis strain PCM2 contained a unique conserved region potentially useful for specific diagnosis of L. orientalis and further exploration of this parasite population genetics in Thailand and related regions.",37950023,PMC10638283,10.1038/s41598-023-46638-3,0
A chromosome-scale reference genome and genome-wide genetic variations elucidate adaptation in yak,"Yak is an important livestock animal for the people indigenous to the harsh, oxygen-limited Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau and Hindu Kush ranges of the Himalayas. The yak genome was sequenced in 2012, but its assembly was fragmented because of the inherent limitations of the Illumina sequencing technology used to analyse it. An accurate and complete reference genome is essential for the study of genetic variations in this species. Long-read sequences are more complete than their short-read counterparts and have been successfully applied towards high-quality genome assembly for various species. In this study, we present a high-quality chromosome-scale yak genome assembly (BosGru_PB_v1.0) constructed with long-read sequencing and chromatin interaction technologies. Compared to an existing yak genome assembly (BosGru_v2.0), BosGru_PB_v1.0 shows substantially improved chromosome sequence continuity, reduced repetitive structure ambiguity, and gene model completeness. To characterize genetic variation in yak, we generated de novo genome assemblies based on Illumina short reads for seven recognized domestic yak breeds in Tibet and Sichuan and one wild yak from Hoh Xil. We compared these eight assemblies to the BosGru_PB_v1.0 genome, obtained a comprehensive map of yak genetic diversity at the whole-genome level, and identified several protein-coding genes absent from the BosGru_PB_v1.0 assembly. Despite the genetic bottleneck experienced by wild yak, their diversity was nonetheless higher than that of domestic yak. Here, we identified breed-specific sequences and genes by whole-genome alignment, which may facilitate yak breed identification.",32745324,PMC7754329,10.1111/1755-0998.13236,12
Multiplatform next-generation sequencing identifies novel RNA molecules and transcript isoforms of the endogenous retrovirus isolated from cultured cells,"In this study, we applied short- and long-read RNA sequencing techniques, as well as PCR analysis to investigate the transcriptome of the porcine endogenous retrovirus (PERV) expressed from cultured porcine kidney cell line PK-15. This analysis has revealed six novel transcripts and eight transcript isoforms, including five length and three splice variants. We were able to establish whether a deletion in a transcript is the result of the splicing of mRNAs or of genomic deletion in one of the PERV clones. Additionally, we re-annotated the formerly identified RNA molecules. Our analysis revealed a higher complexity of PERV transcriptome than it was earlier believed.",29361122,PMC6279139,10.1093/femsle/fny013,8
"Complete telomere-to-telomere de novo assembly of the Plasmodium falciparum genome through long-read (>11 kb), single molecule, real-time sequencing","The application of next-generation sequencing to estimate genetic diversity of Plasmodium falciparum, the most lethal malaria parasite, has proved challenging due to the skewed AT-richness [∼80.6% (A + T)] of its genome and the lack of technology to assemble highly polymorphic subtelomeric regions that contain clonally variant, multigene virulence families (Ex: var and rifin). To address this, we performed amplification-free, single molecule, real-time sequencing of P. falciparum genomic DNA and generated reads of average length 12 kb, with 50% of the reads between 15.5 and 50 kb in length. Next, using the Hierarchical Genome Assembly Process, we assembled the P. falciparum genome de novo and successfully compiled all 14 nuclear chromosomes telomere-to-telomere. We also accurately resolved centromeres [∼90-99% (A + T)] and subtelomeric regions and identified large insertions and duplications that add extra var and rifin genes to the genome, along with smaller structural variants such as homopolymer tract expansions. Overall, we show that amplification-free, long-read sequencing combined with de novo assembly overcomes major challenges inherent to studying the P. falciparum genome. Indeed, this technology may not only identify the polymorphic and repetitive subtelomeric sequences of parasite populations from endemic areas but may also evaluate structural variation linked to virulence, drug resistance and disease transmission.",27345719,PMC4991835,10.1093/dnares/dsw022,29
Combined nanopore and single-molecule real-time sequencing survey of human betaherpesvirus 5 transcriptome,"Long-read sequencing (LRS), a powerful novel approach, is able to read full-length transcripts and confers a major advantage over the earlier gold standard short-read sequencing in the efficiency of identifying for example polycistronic transcripts and transcript isoforms, including transcript length- and splice variants. In this work, we profile the human cytomegalovirus transcriptome using two third-generation LRS platforms: the Sequel from Pacific BioSciences, and MinION from Oxford Nanopore Technologies. We carried out both cDNA and direct RNA sequencing, and applied the LoRTIA software, developed in our laboratory, for the transcript annotations. This study identified a large number of novel transcript variants, including splice isoforms and transcript start and end site isoforms, as well as putative mRNAs with truncated in-frame ORFs (located within the larger ORFs of the canonical mRNAs), which potentially encode N-terminally truncated polypeptides. Our work also disclosed a highly complex meshwork of transcriptional read-throughs and overlaps.",34262076,PMC8280142,10.1038/s41598-021-93593-y,6
"An integrated method for targeted Oxford Nanopore sequencing and automated bioinformatics for the simultaneous detection of bacteria, fungi, and ARG","Aims:The use of metagenomics for pathogen identification in clinical practice has been limited. Here we describe a workflow to encourage the clinical utility and potential of NGS for the screening of bacteria, fungi, and antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs).Methods and results:The method includes target enrichment, long-read sequencing, and automated bioinformatics. Evaluation of several tools and databases was undertaken across standard organisms (n = 12), clinical isolates (n = 114), and blood samples from patients with suspected bloodstream infections (n = 33). The strategy used could offset the presence of host background DNA, error rates of long-read sequencing, and provide accurate and reproducible detection of pathogens. Eleven targets could be successfully tested in a single assay. Organisms could be confidently identified considering ≥60% of best hits of a BLAST-based threshold of e-value 0.001 and a percent identity of >80%. For ARGs, reads with percent identity of >90% and >60% overlap of the complete gene could be confidently annotated. A kappa of 0.83 was observed compared to standard diagnostic methods. Thus, a workflow for the direct-from-sample, on-site sequencing combined with automated genomics was demonstrated to be reproducible.Conclusion:NGS-based technologies overcome several limitations of current day diagnostics. Highly sensitive and comprehensive methods of pathogen screening are the need of the hour. We developed a framework for reliable, on-site, screening of pathogens.",38346849,,10.1093/jambio/lxae037,1
[The principle and application of the single-molecule real-time sequencing technology],"Last decade witnessed the explosive development of the third-generation sequencing strategy, including single-molecule real-time sequencing (SMRT), true single-molecule sequencing (tSMSTM) and the single-molecule nanopore DNA sequencing. In this review, we summarize the principle, performance and application of the SMRT sequencing technology. Compared with the traditional Sanger method and the next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, the SMRT approach has several advantages, including long read length, high speed, PCR-free and the capability of direct detection of epigenetic modiﬁcations. However, the disadvantage of its low accuracy, most of which resulted from insertions and deletions, is also notable. So, the raw sequence data need to be corrected before assembly. Up to now, the SMRT is a good fit for applications in the de novo genomic sequencing and the high-quality assemblies of small genomes. In the future, it is expected to play an important role in epigenetics, transcriptomic sequencing, and assemblies of large genomes.",25787000,,10.16288/j.yczz.14-323,8
Technologies for Pharmacogenomics: A Review,"The continuous development of new genotyping technologies requires awareness of their potential advantages and limitations concerning utility for pharmacogenomics (PGx). In this review, we provide an overview of technologies that can be applied in PGx research and clinical practice. Most commonly used are single nucleotide variant (SNV) panels which contain a pre-selected panel of genetic variants. SNV panels offer a short turnaround time and straightforward interpretation, making them suitable for clinical practice. However, they are limited in their ability to assess rare and structural variants. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) and long-read sequencing are promising technologies for the field of PGx research. Both NGS and long-read sequencing often provide more data and more options with regard to deciphering structural and rare variants compared to SNV panels-in particular, in regard to the number of variants that can be identified, as well as the option for haplotype phasing. Nonetheless, while useful for research, not all sequencing data can be applied to clinical practice yet. Ultimately, selecting the right technology is not a matter of fact but a matter of choosing the right technique for the right problem.",33291630,PMC7761897,10.3390/genes11121456,17
Megabase Length Hypermutation Accompanies Human Structural Variation at 17p11.2,"DNA rearrangements resulting in human genome structural variants (SVs) are caused by diverse mutational mechanisms. We used long- and short-read sequencing technologies to investigate end products of de novo chromosome 17p11.2 rearrangements and query the molecular mechanisms underlying both recurrent and non-recurrent events. Evidence for an increased rate of clustered single-nucleotide variant (SNV) mutation in cis with non-recurrent rearrangements was found. Indel and SNV formation are associated with both copy-number gains and losses of 17p11.2, occur up to ∼1 Mb away from the breakpoint junctions, and favor C > G transversion substitutions; results suggest that single-stranded DNA is formed during the genesis of the SV and provide compelling support for a microhomology-mediated break-induced replication (MMBIR) mechanism for SV formation. Our data show an additional mutational burden of MMBIR consisting of hypermutation confined to the locus and manifesting as SNVs and indels predominantly within genes.",30827684,PMC6438178,10.1016/j.cell.2019.01.045,45
abPOA: an SIMD-based C library for fast partial order alignment using adaptive band,"Summary:Partial order alignment, which aligns a sequence to a directed acyclic graph, is now frequently used as a key component in long-read error correction and assembly.

The assembly pipeline comprised initial read correction with Canu and assembly with SMARTdenovo. The resulting raw nanopore-based de novo genome is structurally highly similar to that of the referenceS. pennelliiLA716 accession but has a high error rate and was rich in homopolymer deletions. After polishing the assembly with Illumina reads, we obtained an error rate of <0.02% when assessed versus the same Illumina data.

Time course profiling of host cell response to herpesvirus infection using nanopore and synthetic long-read transcriptome sequencing,"Third-generation sequencing is able to read full-length transcripts and thus to efficiently identify RNA molecules and transcript isoforms, including transcript length and splice isoforms. In this study, we report the time-course profiling of the effect of bovine alphaherpesvirus type 1 on the gene expression of bovine epithelial cells using direct cDNA sequencing carried out on MinION device of Oxford Nanopore Technologies. These investigations revealed a substantial up- and down-regulatory effect of the virus on several gene networks of the host cells, including those that are associated with antiviral response, as well as with viral transcription and translation. Additionally, we report a large number of novel bovine transcript isoforms identified by nanopore and synthetic long-read sequencing. This study demonstrates that viral infection causes differential expression of host transcript isoforms. We could not detect an increased rate of transcriptional readthroughs as described in another alphaherpesvirus. According to our knowledge, this is the first report on the use of LoopSeq for the analysis of eukaryotic transcriptomes. This is also the first report on the application of nanopore sequencing for the kinetic characterization of cellular transcriptomes.

A high-resolution single-molecule sequencing-based Arabidopsis transcriptome using novel methods of Iso-seq analysis,"Background:Accurate and comprehensive annotation of transcript sequences is essential for transcript quantification and differential gene and transcript expression analysis. Single-molecule long-read sequencing technologies provide improved integrity of transcript structures including alternative splicing, and transcription start and polyadenylation sites. However, accuracy is significantly affected by sequencing errors, mRNA degradation, or incomplete cDNA synthesis.Results:We present a new and comprehensive Arabidopsis thaliana Reference Transcript Dataset 3 (AtRTD3). AtRTD3 contains over 169,000 transcripts-twice that of the best current Arabidopsis transcriptome and including over 1500 novel genes. Seventy-eight percent of transcripts are from Iso-seq with accurately defined splice junctions and transcription start and end sites. We develop novel methods to determine splice junctions and transcription start and end sites accurately. Mismatch profiles around splice junctions provide a powerful feature to distinguish correct splice junctions and remove false splice junctions. Stratified approaches identify high-confidence transcription start and end sites and remove fragmentary transcripts due to degradation. AtRTD3 is a major improvement over existing transcriptomes as demonstrated by analysis of an Arabidopsis cold response RNA-seq time-series. AtRTD3 provides higher resolution of transcript expression profiling and identifies cold-induced differential transcription start and polyadenylation site usage.Conclusions:AtRTD3 is the most comprehensive Arabidopsis transcriptome currently. It improves the precision of differential gene and transcript expression, differential alternative splicing, and transcription start/end site usage analysis from RNA-seq data. The novel methods for identifying accurate splice junctions and transcription start/end sites are widely applicable and will improve single-molecule sequencing analysis from any species.",35799267,PMC9264592,10.1186/s13059-022-02711-0,22
Identification of Protein Isoforms Using Reference Databases Built from Long and Short Read RNA-Sequencing,"Alternative splicing can lead to distinct protein isoforms. These can have different functions in specific cells and tissues or in different developmental stages. In this study, we explored whether transcripts assembled from long read, nanopore-based, direct RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) could improve the identification of protein isoforms in human K562 cells. By comparing with Illumina-based short read RNA-seq, we showed that a large proportion of Ensembl transcripts (5949/14,326) and genes expressing alternatively spliced transcripts (486/2981) identified with long direct reads were missed by short paired-end reads. By co-analyzing proteomic and transcriptomic data, we also showed that some peptides (826/35,976), proteins (262/3215), and protein isoforms arising from distinct transcript variants (574/1212) identified with isoform-specific peptides via custom long-read-based databases were missed in Illumina-derived databases. Finally, we generated unequivocal peptide evidence for a set of protein isoforms and showed that long read, direct RNA-seq allows the discovery of novel protein isoforms not already in reference databases or custom databases built from short read RNA-seq data. Our analysis highlights the benefits of long read RNA-seq data in the generation of reference databases to increase tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) identification of protein isoforms.",35612954,,10.1021/acs.jproteome.1c00968,1
Genomic characterization of a wild diploid isolate of Saccharomyces cerevisiae reveals an extensive and dynamic landscape of structural variation,"The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been extensively characterized for many decades and is a crucial resource for the study of numerous facets of eukaryotic biology. Recent whole genome sequence analysis of over 1000 natural isolates of S. cerevisiae has provided critical insights into the evolutionary landscape of this species by revealing a population structure comprised of numerous genomically diverse lineages. These survey-level analyses have been largely devoid of structural genomic information, mainly because short-read sequencing is not suitable for detailed characterization of genomic architecture. Consequently, we still lack a complete perspective of the genomic variation that exists within this species. Single molecule long-read sequencing technologies, such as Oxford Nanopore and PacBio, provide sequencing-based approaches with which to rigorously define the structure of a genome, and have empowered yeast geneticists to explore this poorly described realm of eukaryotic genomics. Here, we present the comprehensive genomic structural analysis of a wild diploid isolate of S. cerevisiae, YJM311. We used long-read sequence analysis to construct a haplotype-phased, telomere-to-telomere length assembly of the YJM311 genome and characterized the structural variations (SVs) therein. We discovered that the genome of YJM311 contains significant intragenomic structural variation, some of which imparts notable consequences to the genomic stability and developmental biology of the strain. Collectively, we outline a new methodology for creating accurate haplotype-phased genome assemblies and highlight how such genomic analyses can be used to define the structural architectures of natural S. cerevisiae isolates. It is our hope that continued structural characterization of S. cerevisiae genomes, such as we have reported here for YJM311, will comprehensively advance our understanding of eukaryotic genome structure-function relationships, structural genomic diversity, and evolution.",34791219,PMC9176296,10.1093/genetics/iyab193,4
Unraveling the complexity of faba bean (Vicia faba L.) transcriptome to reveal cold-stress-responsive genes using long-read isoform sequencing technology,"Faba bean (Vicia faba L.), a globally important grain legume providing a stable source of dietary protein, was one of the earliest plant cytogenetic models. However, the lack of draft genome annotations and unclear structural information on mRNA transcripts have impeded its genetic improvement. To address this, we sequenced faba bean leaf transcriptome using the PacBio single-molecule long-read isoform sequencing platform. We identified 28,569 nonredundant unigenes, ranging from 108 to 9669 bp, with a total length of 94.5 Mb. Many unigenes (3597, 12.5%) had 2-20 isoforms, indicating a highly complex transcriptome. Approximately 96.5% of the unigenes matched sequences in public databases. The predicted proteins and transcription factors included NB-ARC, Myb_domain, C3H, bHLH, and heat shock proteins, implying that this genome has an abundance of stress resistance genes. To validate our results, we selected WCOR413-15785, DHN2-12403, DHN2-14197, DHN2-14797, COR15-14478, and HVA22-15 unigenes from the ICE-CBF-COR pathway to analyze their expression patterns in cold-treated samples via qRT-PCR. The expression of dehydrin-related genes was induced by cold stress. The assembled data provide the first insights into the deep sequencing of full-length RNA from faba bean at the single-molecule level. This study provides an important foundation to improve gene modeling and protein prediction.",34702863,PMC8548339,10.1038/s41598-021-00506-0,8
Father-to-offspring transmission of extremely long NOTCH2NLC repeat expansions with contractions: genetic and epigenetic profiling with long-read sequencing,"Background:GGC repeat expansions in NOTCH2NLC are associated with neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease. Very recently, asymptomatic carriers with NOTCH2NLC repeat expansions were reported. In these asymptomatic individuals, the CpG island in NOTCH2NLC is hypermethylated, suggesting that two factors repeat length and DNA methylation status should be considered to evaluate pathogenicity. Long-read sequencing can be used to simultaneously profile genomic and epigenomic alterations. We analyzed four sporadic cases with NOTCH2NLC repeat expansion and their phenotypically normal parents. The native genomic DNA that retains base modification was sequenced on a per-trio basis using both PacBio and Oxford Nanopore long-read sequencing technologies. A custom workflow was developed to evaluate DNA modifications. With these two technologies combined, long-range DNA methylation information was integrated with complete repeat DNA sequences to investigate the genetic origins of expanded GGC repeats in these sporadic cases.Results:In all four families, asymptomatic fathers had longer expansions (median: 522, 390, 528 and 650 repeats) compared with their affected offspring (median: 93, 117, 162 and 140 repeats, respectively). These expansions are much longer than the disease-causing range previously reported (in general, 41-300 repeats). Repeat lengths were extremely variable in the father, suggesting somatic mosaicism. Instability is more frequent in alleles with uninterrupted pure GGCs. Single molecule epigenetic analysis revealed complex DNA methylation patterns and epigenetic heterogeneity. We identified an aberrant gain-of-methylation region (2.2 kb in size beyond the CpG island and GGC repeats) in asymptomatic fathers. This methylated region was unmethylated in the normal allele with bilateral transitional zones with both methylated and unmethylated CpG dinucleotides, which may be protected from methylation to ensure NOTCH2NLC expression.Conclusions:We clearly demonstrate that the four sporadic NOTCH2NLC-related cases are derived from the paternal GGC repeat contraction associated with demethylation. The entire genetic and epigenetic landscape of the NOTCH2NLC region was uncovered using the custom workflow of long-read sequence data, demonstrating the utility of this method for revealing epigenetic/mutational changes in repetitive elements, which are difficult to characterize by conventional short-read/bisulfite sequencing methods. Our approach should be useful for biomedical research, aiding the discovery of DNA methylation abnormalities through the entire genome.",34774111,PMC8590777,10.1186/s13148-021-01192-5,10
Cas9-targeted nanopore sequencing reveals epigenetic heterogeneity afterde novoassembly of native full-length hepatitis B virus genomes,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) contains a 3.2 kb DNA genome and causes acute and chronic hepatitis. HBV infection is a global health problem, with 350 million chronically infected people at increased risk of developing liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methylation of HBV DNA in a CpG context (5mCpG) can alter the expression patterns of viral genes related to infection and cellular transformation. Moreover, it may also provide clues as to why certain infections are cleared or persist with or without progression to cancer. The detection of 5mCpG often requires techniques that damage DNA or introduce bias through a myriad of limitations. Therefore, we developed a method for the detection of 5mCpG on the HBV genome that does not rely on bisulfite conversion or PCR. With Cas9-guided RNPs to specifically target the HBV genome, we enriched in HBV DNA from primary human hepatocytes (PHHs) infected with different HBV genotypes, as well as enriching in HBV from infected patient liver tissue, followed by sequencing with Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION. Detection of 5mCpG by nanopore sequencing was benchmarked with bisulfite-quantitative methyl-specific qPCR (BS-qMSP). The 5mCpG levels in HBV determined by BS-qMSP and nanopore sequencing were highly correlated. Our nanopore sequencing approach achieved a coverage of ~2000× of HBV depending on infection efficiency, sufficient coverage to perform ade novoassembly and detect small fluctuations in HBV methylation, providing the firstde novoassembly of native HBV DNA, as well as the first landscape of 5mCpG from native HBV sequences. Moreover, by capturing entire HBV genomes, we explored the epigenetic heterogeneity of HBV in infected patients and identified four epigenetically distinct clusters based on methylation profiles. This method is a novel approach that enables the enrichment of viral DNA in a mixture of nucleic acid material from different species and will serve as a valuable tool for infectious disease monitoring.",34003741,PMC8209722,10.1099/mgen.0.000507,7
Synthetic microbe communities provide internal reference standards for metagenome sequencing and analysis,"The complexity of microbial communities, combined with technical biases in next-generation sequencing, pose a challenge to metagenomic analysis. Here, we develop a set of internal DNA standards, termed ""sequins"" (sequencing spike-ins), that together constitute a synthetic community of artificial microbial genomes. Sequins are added to environmental DNA samples prior to library preparation, and undergo concurrent sequencing with the accompanying sample. We validate the performance of sequins by comparison to mock microbial communities, and demonstrate their use in the analysis of real metagenome samples. We show how sequins can be used to measure fold change differences in the size and structure of accompanying microbial communities, and perform quantitative normalization between samples. We further illustrate how sequins can be used to benchmark and optimize new methods, including nanopore long-read sequencing technology. We provide metagenome sequins, along with associated data sets, protocols, and an accompanying software toolkit, as reference standards to aid in metagenomic studies.",30082706,PMC6078961,10.1038/s41467-018-05555-0,44
Nanopore Sequencing Using the Full-Length 16S rRNA Gene for Detection of Blood-Borne Bacteria in Dogs Reveals a Novel Species of Hemotropic Mycoplasma,"Dogs across the globe are afflicted by diverse blood- and vector-borne bacteria (VBB), many of which cause severe disease and can be fatal. Diagnosis of VBB infections can be challenging due to the low concentration of bacteria in the blood, the frequent occurrence of coinfections, and the wide range of known, emerging, and potentially novel VBB species encounterable. Therefore, there is a need for diagnostics that address these challenges by being both sensitive and capable of detecting all VBB simultaneously. We detail the first employment of a nanopore-based sequencing methodology conducted on the Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) MinION device to accurately elucidate the ""hemobacteriome"" from canine blood through sequencing of the full-length 16S rRNA gene. We detected a diverse range of important canine VBB, including Ehrlichia canis, Anaplasma platys, Mycoplasma haemocanis, Bartonella clarridgeiae, ""CandidatusMycoplasma haematoparvum"", a novel species of hemotropic mycoplasma, andWolbachiaendosymbionts of filarial worms, indicative of filariasis. Our nanopore-based protocol was equivalent in sensitivity to both quantitative PCR (qPCR) and Illumina sequencing when benchmarked against these methods, achieving high agreement as defined by the kappa statistics (k> 0.81) for three key VBB. Utilizing the ability of the ONT' MinION device to sequence long read lengths provides an excellent alternative diagnostic method by which the hemobacteriome can be accurately characterized to the species level in a way previously unachievable using short reads. We envision our method to be translatable to multiple contexts, such as the detection of VBB in other vertebrate hosts, including humans, while the small size of the MinION device is highly amenable to field use.IMPORTANCEBlood- and vector-borne bacteria (VBB) can cause severe pathology and even be lethal for dogs in many regions across the globe. Accurate characterization of all the bacterial pathogens infecting a canine host is critical, as coinfections are common and emerging and novel pathogens that may go undetected by traditional diagnostics frequently arise. Deep sequencing using devices from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) provides a solution, as the long read lengths achievable provide species-level taxonomic identification of pathogens that previous short-read technologies could not accomplish. We developed a protocol using ONT' MinION sequencer to accurately detect and classify a wide spectrum of VBB from canine blood at a sensitivity comparable to that of regularly used diagnostics, such as qPCR. This protocol demonstrates great potential for use in biosurveillance and biosecurity operations for the detection of VBB in a range of vertebrate hosts, while the MinION sequencer's portability allows this method to be used easily in the field.",36250862,PMC9769565,10.1128/spectrum.03088-22,8
"High-Quality Genome Assembly ofPseudopestalotiopsis theae, the Pathogenic Fungus Causing Tea Gray Blight","Tea gray blight is one of the most serious foliar diseases of tea tree, caused by the plant-pathogenic fungusPseudopestalotiopsis theae, which can affect production and quality of tea worldwide. We generated a highly contiguous, 50.41-Mbp genome assembly (N50= 1.30 Mbp) ofP. theaestrain CYF27 by combining PacBio long-read and Illumina short-read sequencing technologies. We identified a total of 15,626 gene models, of which 1,038 genes encode putative secreted proteins. The high-quality genome assembly and annotation resource reported here will be useful for the study of fungal infection mechanisms and pathogen-host interaction.",33978433,,10.1094/PDIS-02-21-0318-A,2
Profiling of Oral Bacterial Communities,"The profiling of bacterial communities by the sequencing of housekeeping genes such as that encoding the small subunit ribosomal RNA has revealed the extensive diversity of bacterial life on earth. Standard protocols have been developed and are widely used for this application, but individual habitats may require modification of methods. This review discusses the sequencing and analysis methods most appropriate for the study of the bacterial component of the human oral microbiota. If possible, DNA should be extracted from samples soon after collection. If samples have to be stored for practical reasons, precautions to avoid DNA degradation on freezing should be taken. A critical aspect of profiling oral bacterial communities is the choice of region of the 16S rRNA gene for sequencing. The V1-V2 region provides the best discrimination between species of the genusStreptococcus, the most common genus in the mouth and important in health and disease. The MiSeq platform is most commonly used for sequencing, but long-read technologies are now becoming available that should improve the resolution of analyses. There are a variety of well-established data analysis pipelines available, including mothur and QIIME, which identify sequence reads as phylotypes by comparing them to reference data sets or grouping them into operational taxonomic units. DADA2 has improved sequence error correction capabilities and resolves reads to unique variants. Two curated oral 16S rRNA databases are available: HOMD and CORE. Expert interpretation of community profiles is required, both to detect the presence of contaminating DNA, which is commonly present in the reagents used in analysis, and to differentiate oral and nonoral bacteria and determine the significance of findings. Despite advances in shotgun whole-genome metagenomic methods, oral bacterial community profiling via 16S rRNA sequence analysis remains a valuable technique for the characterization of oral bacterial populations.",32286907,PMC7243418,10.1177/0022034520914594,32
Single-Molecule Sequencing of theDrosophila serrataGenome,"Long-read sequencing technology promises to greatly enhancede novoassembly of genomes for nonmodel species. Although the error rates of long reads have been a stumbling block, sequencing at high coverage permits the self-correction of many errors. Here, we sequence andde novoassemble the genome ofDrosophila serrata, a species from themontiumsubgroup that has been well-studied for latitudinal clines, sexual selection, and gene expression, but which lacks a reference genome. Using 11 PacBio single-molecule real-time (SMRT cells), we generated 12 Gbp of raw sequence data comprising ∼65 × whole-genome coverage. Read lengths averaged 8940 bp (NRead50 12,200) with the longest read at 53 kbp. We self-corrected reads using the PBDagCon algorithm and assembled the genome using the MHAP algorithm within the PBcR assembler. Total genome length was 198 Mbp with an N50 just under 1 Mbp. Contigs displayed a high degree of chromosome arm-level conservation with theD. melanogastergenome and many could be sensibly placed on theD. serrataphysical map. We also provide an initial annotation for this genome usingin silicogene predictions that were supported by RNA-seq data.",28143951,PMC5345708,10.1534/g3.116.037598,15
"The long and short of it: benchmarking viromics using Illumina, Nanopore and PacBio sequencing technologies","Viral metagenomics has fuelled a rapid change in our understanding of global viral diversity and ecology. Long-read sequencing and hybrid assembly approaches that combine long- and short-read technologies are now being widely implemented in bacterial genomics and metagenomics. However, the use of long-read sequencing to investigate viral communities is still in its infancy. While Nanopore and PacBio technologies have been applied to viral metagenomics, it is not known to what extent different technologies will impact the reconstruction of the viral community. Thus, we constructed a mock bacteriophage community of previously sequenced phage genomes and sequenced them using Illumina, Nanopore and PacBio sequencing technologies and tested a number of different assembly approaches. When using a single sequencing technology, Illumina assemblies were the best at recovering phage genomes. Nanopore- and PacBio-only assemblies performed poorly in comparison to Illumina in both genome recovery and error rates, which both varied with the assembler used. The best Nanopore assembly had errors that manifested as SNPs and INDELs at frequencies 41 and 157 % higher than found in Illumina only assemblies, respectively. While the best PacBio assemblies had SNPs at frequencies 12 and 78 % higher than found in Illumina-only assemblies, respectively. Despite high-read coverage, long-read-only assemblies recovered a maximum of one complete genome from any assembly, unless reads were down-sampled prior to assembly. Overall the best approach was assembly by a combination of Illumina and Nanopore reads, which reduced error rates to levels comparable with short-read-only assemblies. When using a single technology, Illumina only was the best approach. The differences in genome recovery and error rates between technology and assembler had downstream impacts on gene prediction, viral prediction, and subsequent estimates of diversity within a sample. These findings will provide a starting point for others in the choice of reads and assembly algorithms for the analysis of viromes.",38376377,PMC10926689,10.1099/mgen.0.001198,2
The chromosomal-scale genome sequencing and assembly of Athetis lepigone,"Athetis lepigone is an emerging highly polyphagous insect pest reported to cause crop damage in several European and Asian countries. However, our understanding of its genetic adaptation mechanisms has been limited due to lack of high-quality genetic resources. In this study, we present a chromosomal-level genome of A. lepigone, representing the first species in the genus of Athetis. We employed PacBio long-read sequencing and Hi-C technologies to generate 612.49 Mb genome assembly which contains 42.43% repeat sequences with a scaffold N50 of 20.9 Mb. The contigs were successfully clustered into 31 chromosomal-size scaffolds with 37% GC content. BUSCO assessment revealed a genome completeness of 97.4% with 96.3 identified as core Arthropoda single copy orthologs. Among the 17,322 genes that were predicted, 15,965 genes were functionally annotated, representing a coverage of 92.17%. Furthermore, we revealed 106 P450, 37 GST, 27 UGT, and 74 COE gene families in the genome of A. lepigone. This genome provides a significant and invaluable genomic resource for further research across the entire genus of Athetis.",38580759,PMC10997617,10.1038/s41597-024-03136-z,0
"Genion, an accurate tool to detect gene fusion from long transcriptomics reads","Background:The advent of next-generation sequencing technologies empowered a wide variety of transcriptomics studies. A widely studied topic is gene fusion which is observed in many cancer types and suspected of having oncogenic properties. Gene fusions are the result of structural genomic events that bring two genes closely located and result in a fused transcript. This is different from fusion transcripts created during or after the transcription process. These chimeric transcripts are also known as read-through and trans-splicing transcripts. Gene fusion discovery with short reads is a well-studied problem, and many methods have been developed. But the sensitivity of these methods is limited by the technology, especially the short read length. Advances in long-read sequencing technologies allow the generation of long transcriptomics reads at a low cost. Transcriptomic long-read sequencing presents unique opportunities to overcome the shortcomings of short-read technologies for gene fusion detection while introducing new challenges.Results:We present Genion, a sensitive and fast gene fusion detection method that can also detect read-through events. We compare Genion against a recently introduced long-read gene fusion discovery method, LongGF, both on simulated and real datasets. On simulated data, Genion accurately identifies the gene fusions and its clustering accuracy for detecting fusion reads is better than LongGF. Furthermore, our results on the breast cancer cell line MCF-7 show that Genion correctly identifies all the experimentally validated gene fusions.Conclusions:Genion is an accurate gene fusion caller. Genion is implemented in C++ and is available at https://github.com/vpc-ccg/genion .",35164688,PMC8842519,10.1186/s12864-022-08339-5,2
Contiguous and accurate de novo assembly of metazoan genomes with modest long read coverage,"Genome assemblies that are accurate, complete and contiguous are essential for identifying important structural and functional elements of genomes and for identifying genetic variation. Nevertheless, most recent genome assemblies remain incomplete and fragmented. While long molecule sequencing promises to deliver more complete genome assemblies with fewer gaps, concerns about error rates, low yields, stringent DNA requirements and uncertainty about best practices may discourage many investigators from adopting this technology. Here, in conjunction with the platinum standard Drosophila melanogaster reference genome, we analyze recently published long molecule sequencing data to identify what governs completeness and contiguity of genome assemblies. We also present a hybrid meta-assembly approach that achieves remarkable assembly contiguity for both Drosophila and human assemblies with only modest long molecule sequencing coverage. Our results motivate a set of preliminary best practices for obtaining accurate and contiguous assemblies, a 'missing manual' that guides key decisions in building high quality de novo genome assemblies, from DNA isolation to polishing the assembly.",27458204,PMC5100563,10.1093/nar/gkw654,225
"Long read, isoform aware sequencing of mouse nucleus accumbens after chronic cocaine treatment","To better understand the full-length transcriptome of the nucleus accumbens (NAc)-a key brain reward region-in chronic cocaine treatment, we perform the first single molecule, long-read sequencing analysis using the Iso-seq method to detect 42,114 unique transcripts from mouse NAc polyadenylated RNA. Using GENCODE annotation as a reference, we find that over half of the Iso-seq derived transcripts are annotated, while 46% of them harbor novel splicing events in known genes; around 1% of them correspond to other types of novel transcripts, such as fusion, antisense and intergenic. Approximately 34% of the novel transcripts are matched with a compiled transcriptome assembled from published short-read data from various tissues, with the remaining 69% being unique to NAc. These data provide a more complete picture of the NAc transcriptome than existing annotations and can serve as a comprehensive reference for future transcriptomic analyses of this important brain reward region.",33762610,PMC7991652,10.1038/s41598-021-86068-7,2
Structural variation and its potential impact on genome instability: Novel discoveries in the EGFR landscape by long-read sequencing,"Structural variation (SV) is typically defined as variation within the human genome that exceeds 50 base pairs (bp). SV may be copy number neutral or it may involve duplications, deletions, and complex rearrangements. Recent studies have shown SV to be associated with many human diseases. However, studies of SV have been challenging due to technological constraints. With the advent of third generation (long-read) sequencing technology, exploration of longer stretches of DNA not easily examined previously has been made possible. In the present study, we utilized third generation (long-read) sequencing techniques to examine SV in the EGFR landscape of four haplotypes derived from two human samples. We analyzed the EGFR gene and its landscape (+/- 500,000 base pairs) using this approach and were able to identify a region of non-coding DNA with over 90% similarity to the most common activating EGFR mutation in non-small cell lung cancer. Based on previously published Alu-element genome instability algorithms, we propose a molecular mechanism to explain how this non-coding region of DNA may be interacting with and impacting the stability of the EGFR gene and potentially generating this cancer-driver gene. By these techniques, we were also able to identify previously hidden structural variation in the four haplotypes and in the human reference genome (hg38). We applied previously published algorithms to compare the relative stabilities of these five different EGFR gene landscape haplotypes to estimate their relative potentials to generate the EGFR exon 19, 15 bp canonical deletion. To our knowledge, the present study is the first to use the differences in genomic architecture between targeted cancer-linked phased haplotypes to estimate their relative potentials to form a common cancer-linked driver mutation.",31940362,PMC6961855,10.1371/journal.pone.0226340,16
A comparison between full-length 16S rRNA Oxford nanopore sequencing and Illumina V3-V4 16S rRNA sequencing in head and neck cancer tissues,"Describing the microbial community within the tumour has been a key aspect in understanding the pathophysiology of the tumour microenvironment. In head and neck cancer (HNC), most studies on tissue samples have only performed 16S rRNA short-read sequencing (SRS) on V3-V5 region. SRS is mostly limited to genus level identification. In this study, we compared full-length 16S rRNA long-read sequencing (FL-ONT) from Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) to V3-V4 Illumina SRS (V3V4-Illumina) in 26 HNC tumour tissues. Further validation was also performed using culture-based methods in 16 bacterial isolates obtained from 4 patients using MALDI-TOF MS. We observed similar alpha diversity indexes between FL-ONT and V3V4-Illumina. However, beta-diversity was significantly different between techniques (PERMANOVA - R2= 0.131, p < 0.0001). At higher taxonomic levels (Phylum to Family), all metrics were more similar among sequencing techniques, while lower taxonomy displayed more discrepancies. At higher taxonomic levels, correlation in relative abundance from FL-ONT and V3V4-Illumina were higher, while this correlation decreased at lower levels. Finally, FL-ONT was able to identify more isolates at the species level that were identified using MALDI-TOF MS (75% vs. 18.8%). FL-ONT was able to identify lower taxonomic levels at a better resolution as compared to V3V4-Illumina 16S rRNA sequencing.",38713383,PMC11076400,10.1007/s00203-024-03985-7,0
Completing bacterial genome assemblies with multiplex MinION sequencing,"Illumina sequencing platforms have enabled widespread bacterial whole genome sequencing. While Illumina data is appropriate for many analyses, its short read length limits its ability to resolve genomic structure. This has major implications for tracking the spread of mobile genetic elements, including those which carry antimicrobial resistance determinants. Fully resolving a bacterial genome requires long-read sequencing such as those generated by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) platforms. Here we describe our use of the ONT MinION to sequence 12 isolates ofKlebsiella pneumoniaeon a single flow cell. We assembled each genome using a combination of ONT reads and previously available Illumina reads, and little to no manual intervention was needed to achieve fully resolved assemblies using the Unicycler hybrid assembler. Assembling only ONT reads with Canu was less effective, resulting in fewer resolved genomes and higher error rates even following error correction with Nanopolish. We demonstrate that multiplexed ONT sequencing is a valuable tool for high-throughput bacterial genome finishing. Specifically, we advocate the use of Illumina sequencing as a first analysis step, followed by ONT reads as needed to resolve genomic structure.",29177090,PMC5695209,10.1099/mgen.0.000132,428
A High-Quality Assembly of the Nine-Spined Stickleback (Pungitius pungitius) Genome,"The Gasterosteidae fish family hosts several species that are important models for eco-evolutionary, genetic, and genomic research. In particular, a wealth of genetic and genomic data has been generated for the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), the ""ecology's supermodel,"" whereas the genomic resources for the nine-spined stickleback (Pungitius pungitius) have remained relatively scarce. Here, we report a high-quality chromosome-level genome assembly of P. pungitius consisting of 5,303 contigs (N50 = 1.2 Mbp) with a total size of 521 Mbp. These contigs were mapped to 21 linkage groups using a high-density linkage map, yielding a final assembly with 98.5% BUSCO completeness. A total of 25,062 protein-coding genes were annotated, and about 23% of the assembly was found to consist of repetitive elements. A comprehensive analysis of repetitive elements uncovered centromere-specific tandem repeats and provided insights into the evolution of retrotransposons. A multigene phylogenetic analysis inferred a divergence time of about 26 million years ago (Ma) between nine- and three-spined sticklebacks, which is far older than the commonly assumed estimate of 13 Ma. Compared with the three-spined stickleback, we identified an additional duplication of several genes in the hemoglobin cluster. Sequencing data from populations adapted to different environments indicated potential copy number variations in hemoglobin genes. Furthermore, genome-wide synteny comparisons between three- and nine-spined sticklebacks identified chromosomal rearrangements underlying the karyotypic differences between the two species. The high-quality chromosome-scale assembly of the nine-spined stickleback genome obtained with long-read sequencing technology provides a crucial resource for comparative and population genomic investigations of stickleback fishes and teleosts.",31687752,PMC7145574,10.1093/gbe/evz240,32
Using Nanopore Sequencing to Obtain Complete Bacterial Genomes from Saliva Samples,"Obtaining complete, high-quality reference genomes is essential to the study of any organism. Recent advances in nanopore sequencing, as well as genome assembly and analysis methods, have made it possible to obtain complete bacterial genomes from metagenomic (i.e., multispecies) samples, including those from the human microbiome. In this study, methods are presented to obtain complete bacterial genomes from human saliva using complementary Oxford Nanopore (ONT) and Illumina sequencing. Applied to 3 human saliva samples, these methods resulted in 11 complete bacterial genomes: 3Saccharibacteriaclade G6 (also known asCa. Nanogingivalaceae HMT-870), 1Saccharibacteriaclade G1 HMT-348, 2 Rothia mucilaginosa, 2 Actinomyces graevenitzii, 1 Mogibacterium diversum, 1LachnospiraceaeHMT-096, and 1Lancefieldella parvula; and one circular chromosome of Ruminococcaceae HMT-075 (which likely has at least 2 chromosomes). The 4Saccharibacteriagenomes, as well as theActinomyces graeventiziigenomes, represented the first complete genomes from their respective bacterial taxa. Aside from the complete genomes, the assemblies contained 147 contigs of over 500,000 bp each and thousands of smaller contigs, together representing a myriad of additional draft genomes including many which are likely nearly complete. The complete genomes enabled highly accurate pangenome analysis, which identified unique and missing features of each genome compared to its closest relatives with complete genomes available in public repositories. These features provide clues as to the lifestyle and ecological role of these bacteria within the human oral microbiota, which will be particularly useful in designing future studies of the taxa that have never been isolated or cultivated.IMPORTANCEObtaining complete and accurate genomes is crucial to the study of any organism. Previously, obtaining complete genomes of bacteria, including those of the human microbiome, frequently required isolation of the organism, as well as low-throughput, manual sequencing methods to resolve repeat regions. Advancements in long-read sequencing technologies, including Oxford Nanopore (ONT), have made it possible to obtain complete, closed bacterial genomes from metagenomic samples. This study reports methods to obtain complete genomes from the human oral microbiome using complementary ONT and Illumina sequencing of saliva samples. Eleven complete genomes were obtained from 3 human saliva samples, with genomes ofSaccharibacteriaHMT-870,SaccharibacteriaHMT-348, andActinomyces graeventziibeing the first complete genomes from their respective taxa. Obtaining complete bacterial genomes in a high-throughput manner will help illuminate the metabolic and ecological roles of important members of the human microbiota, particularly those that have remained recalcitrant to isolation and cultivation.",35993719,PMC9600527,10.1128/msystems.00491-22,5
Weighted gene co‑expression network analysis identifies key genes from extracellular vesicles as potential prognostic biomarkers for congenital pulmonary stenosis,"Pulmonary stenosis (PS) is a congenital heart disease characterized by a dynamic or fixed anatomic obstruction of blood flow from the right ventricle to the pulmonary arterial vasculature. In the present study, extracellular vesicle long RNAs (EVLRs) from pregnant females who had healthy infants or PS infants were analyzed by RNA sequencing, and their diagnostic potential for PS during pregnancy was evaluated. A method for the selection of genes that could be considered as informative for the prediction PS based on extracellular vesicles (EVs) from pregnant females using long‑read RNA sequencing was developed. Blood samples were collected from females carrying fetuses with PS and females carrying unaffected fetuses (n=6 in each group). Physical characterization of EVs was performed using nanoparticle tracking analysis, transmission electron microscopy and western blotting. EVLRs from plasma were profiled by RNA sequencing and mRNA co‑expression modules were constructed by weighted gene co‑expression network analysis (WGCNA). Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis was used to predict the function of the genes in each module. Hub genes were filtered out based on WGCNA and visualized using Cytoscape. EVLRs consisted of mRNAs, microRNAs and long non‑coding RNA. Overall, 26 modules were identified containing 16,394 genes. All modules were independent of each other. One particular module, referred to as the blue module, was markedly different between the two groups. A total of 735 hub genes in the blue module were identified, of which 33 were visualized, demonstrating the connection between these hub genes. GO enrichment analysis demonstrated that the analyzed hub genes were enriched in 'glucose transport', 'ATP‑dependent chromatin remodeling', 'histone deacetylation', 'histone H3‑K4 methylation', 'DNA methylation', 'apoptotic signaling pathway' and 'glucocorticoid receptor signaling pathway'. The hub genes identified in this module may provide a genetic framework for prenatal PS diagnosis. Furthermore, functional analysis of these associated genes may provide a theoretical basis for further research on PS pathogenesis.",32705286,,10.3892/mmr.2020.11332,2
Identifying novel disease genes and revealing the pathomechanism of monogenic diseases,"Diseases are caused by genetic and/or environmental factors. It is important to understand the pathomechanism of monogenic diseases that are caused only by genetic factors, especially prenatal- or childhood-onset diseases for pediatricians. Identifying ""novel"" disease genes and elucidating how genomic changes lead to human phenotypes would develop new therapeutic approaches for rare diseases for which no fundamental cure has yet been established. Genomic analysis has evolved along with the development of analytical techniques, from Sanger sequencing (first-generation sequencing) to techniques such as comparative genomic hybridization, massive parallel short-read sequencing (using a next-generation sequencer or second-generation sequencer) and long-read sequencing (using a next-next generation sequencer or third-generation sequencer). I have been researching human genetics using conventional and new technologies, together with my mentors and numerous collaborators, and have identified genes responsible for more than 60 diseases. Here, an overview of genomic analyses of monogenic diseases that aims to identify novel disease genes, and several examples using different approaches depending on the disease characteristics are presented.",38641939,,10.1111/ped.15760,0
Application and Challenge of 3rd Generation Sequencing for Clinical Bacterial Studies,"Over the past 25 years, the powerful combination of genome sequencing and bioinformatics analysis has played a crucial role in interpreting information encoded in bacterial genomes. High-throughput sequencing technologies have paved the way towards understanding an increasingly wide range of biological questions. This revolution has enabled advances in areas ranging from genome composition to how proteins interact with nucleic acids. This has created unprecedented opportunities through the integration of genomic data into clinics for the diagnosis of genetic traits associated with disease. Since then, these technologies have continued to evolve, and recently, long-read sequencing has overcome previous limitations in terms of accuracy, thus expanding its applications in genomics, transcriptomics and metagenomics. In this review, we describe a brief history of the bacterial genome sequencing revolution and its application in public health and molecular epidemiology. We present a chronology that encompasses the various technological developments: whole-genome shotgun sequencing, high-throughput sequencing, long-read sequencing. We mainly discuss the application of next-generation sequencing to decipher bacterial genomes. Secondly, we highlight how long-read sequencing technologies go beyond the limitations of traditional short-read sequencing. We intend to provide a description of the guiding principles of the 3rd generation sequencing applications and ongoing improvements in the field of microbial medical research.",35163319,PMC8835973,10.3390/ijms23031395,15
ggtranscript: an R package for the visualization and interpretation of transcript isoforms using ggplot2,"Motivation:The advent of long-read sequencing technologies has increased demand for the visualization and interpretation of transcripts. However, tools that perform such visualizations remain inflexible and lack the ability to easily identify differences between transcript structures. Here, we introduce ggtranscript, an R package that provides a fast and flexible method to visualize and compare transcripts. As a ggplot2 extension, ggtranscript inherits the functionality and familiarity of ggplot2 making it easy to use.Availability and implementation:ggtranscript is an R package available at https://github.com/dzhang32/ggtranscript (DOI: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6374061) via an open-source MIT licence.

Analysis of gene expression for microminipig liver transcriptomes using parallel long-read technology and short-read sequencing,"The microminipig is one of the smallest minipigs that has emerged as a possible experimental animal model, because it shares many anatomical and/or physiological similarities with humans, including the coronary artery distribution in the heart, the digestive physiology, the kidney size and its structure, and so on. However, information on gene expression profiles, including those on drug-metabolizing phase I and II enzymes, in the microminipig is limited. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to identify transcripts in microminipig livers and to determine gene expression profiles. De novo assembly and expression analyses of microminipig transcripts were conducted with liver samples from three male and three female microminipigs using parallel long-read and short-read sequencing technologies. After unique sequences had been automatically aligned by assembling software, the mean contig length of 50843 transcripts was 707 bp. The expression profiles of cytochrome P450 (P450) 1A2, 2C, 2E1 and 3A genes in livers in microminipigs were similar to those in humans. Liver carboxylesterase (CES) precursor, liver CES-like, UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 2C1-like, amine sulfotransferase (SULT)-like, N-acetyltransferases (NAT8) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) A2 genes, which are relatively unknown genes in pigs and/or humans, were expressed strongly. Furthermore, no significant gender differences were observed in the gene expression profiles of phase I enzymes, whereas UGT2B17, SULT1E1, SULT2A1, amine SULT-like, NAT8 and GSTT4 genes were different between males and females among phase II enzyme genes under the present sample conditions. These results provide a foundation for mechanistic studies and the use of microminipigs as model animals for drug development in the future.

An improved pig reference genome sequence to enable pig genetics and genomics research,"Background:The domestic pig (Sus scrofa) is important both as a food source and as a biomedical model given its similarity in size, anatomy, physiology, metabolism, pathology, and pharmacology to humans. The draft reference genome (Sscrofa10.2) of a purebred Duroc female pig established using older clone-based sequencing methods was incomplete, and unresolved redundancies, short-range order and orientation errors, and associated misassembled genes limited its utility.Results:We present 2 annotated highly contiguous chromosome-level genome assemblies created with more recent long-read technologies and a whole-genome shotgun strategy, 1 for the same Duroc female (Sscrofa11.1) and 1 for an outbred, composite-breed male (USMARCv1.0). Both assemblies are of substantially higher (>90-fold) continuity and accuracy than Sscrofa10.2.Conclusions:These highly contiguous assemblies plus annotation of a further 11 short-read assemblies provide an unprecedented view of the genetic make-up of this important agricultural and biomedical model species. We propose that the improved Duroc assembly (Sscrofa11.1) become the reference genome for genomic research in pigs.",32543654,PMC7448572,10.1093/gigascience/giaa051,123
De novo Assembly of the Brugia malayi Genome Using Long Reads from a Single MinION Flowcell,"Filarial nematode infections cause a substantial global disease burden. Genomic studies of filarial worms can improve our understanding of their biology and epidemiology. However, genomic information from field isolates is limited and available reference genomes are often discontinuous. Single molecule sequencing technologies can reduce the cost of genome sequencing and long reads produced from these devices can improve the contiguity and completeness of genome assemblies. In addition, these new technologies can make generation and analysis of large numbers of field isolates feasible. In this study, we assessed the performance of the Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION for sequencing and assembling the genome of Brugia malayi, a human parasite widely used in filariasis research. Using data from a single MinION flowcell, a 90.3 Mb nuclear genome was assembled into 202 contigs with an N50 of 2.4 Mb. This assembly covered 96.9% of the well-defined B. malayi reference genome with 99.2% identity. The complete mitochondrial genome was obtained with individual reads and the nearly complete genome of the endosymbiotic bacteria Wolbachia was assembled alongside the nuclear genome. Long-read data from the MinION produced an assembly that approached the quality of a well-established reference genome using comparably fewer resources.",31863009,PMC6925183,10.1038/s41598-019-55908-y,2
Long-read sequencing assays designed to detect potential gene editing events in the myostatin gene revealed distinct haplotype signatures in the Thoroughbred horse population,"We present here the use of targeted, long-read sequencing of the myostatin (MSTN) gene as a model to detect potential gene editing events in Thoroughbred horses. MSTN is a negative regulator of muscle development, making the gene a prime candidate target for gene doping. By sequencing the complete gene in one PCR product, we can catalogue all mutations without the need to produce short-fragment libraries. A panel of reference material fragments with defined mutations was constructed and successfully sequenced by both Oxford Nanopore and Illumina-based methods, showing that gene doping editing events can be detected using this technology. To ascertain the normal variation within the population, we sequenced the MSTN gene in 119 UK Thoroughbred horses. Variants from the reference genome were assigned to haplotypes and eight distinct patterns, designated Hap1 (reference genome) to Hap8, were determined with haplotypes Hap2 and Hap3 (which includes the 'speed gene' variant) being far the most prevalent. Hap3 was most abundant in flat-racing horses, whereas Hap2 was most abundant in jump-racing. Within this data set, results for 105 racehorses from out-of-competition sampling were compared between matrices of extracted DNA and direct PCR of whole blood from lithium heparin gel tubes, and strong agreement was found between the two methods. The direct-blood PCR was achieved without compromising the sample prior to plasma separation for analytical chemistry, and could thus be used as part of a routine screening workflow for gene editing detection.",37288798,,10.1111/age.13332,0
Enigmatic Diphyllatea eukaryotes: culturing and targeted PacBio RS amplicon sequencing reveals a higher order taxonomic diversity and global distribution,"Background:The class Diphyllatea belongs to a group of enigmatic unicellular eukaryotes that play a key role in reconstructing the morphological innovation and diversification of early eukaryotic evolution. Despite its evolutionary significance, very little is known about the phylogeny and species diversity of Diphyllatea. Only three species have described morphology, being taxonomically divided by flagella number, two or four, and cell size. Currently, one 18S rRNA Diphyllatea sequence is available, with environmental sequencing surveys reporting only a single partial sequence from a Diphyllatea-like organism. Accordingly, geographical distribution of Diphyllatea based on molecular data is limited, despite morphological data suggesting the class has a global distribution. We here present a first attempt to understand species distribution, diversity and higher order structure of Diphyllatea.Results:We cultured 11 new strains, characterised these morphologically and amplified their rRNA for a combined 18S-28S rRNA phylogeny. We sampled environmental DNA from multiple sites and designed new Diphyllatea-specific PCR primers for long-read PacBio RSII technology. Near full-length 18S rRNA sequences from environmental DNA, in addition to supplementary Diphyllatea sequence data mined from public databases, resolved the phylogeny into three deeply branching and distinct clades (Diphy I - III). Of these, the Diphy III clade is entirely novel, and in congruence with Diphy II, composed of species morphologically consistent with the earlier described Collodictyon triciliatum. The phylogenetic split between the Diphy I and Diphy II + III clades corresponds with a morphological division of Diphyllatea into bi- and quadriflagellate cell forms.Conclusions:This altered flagella composition must have occurred early in the diversification of Diphyllatea and may represent one of the earliest known morphological transitions among eukaryotes. Further, the substantial increase in molecular data presented here confirms Diphyllatea has a global distribution, seemingly restricted to freshwater habitats. Altogether, the results reveal the advantage of combining a group-specific PCR approach and long-read high-throughput amplicon sequencing in surveying enigmatic eukaryote lineages. Lastly, our study shows the capacity of PacBio RS when targeting a protist class for increasing phylogenetic resolution.",30021531,PMC6052632,10.1186/s12862-018-1224-z,3
Integrative profiling of Epstein-Barr virus transcriptome using a multiplatform approach,"Background:Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is an important human pathogenic gammaherpesvirus with carcinogenic potential. The EBV transcriptome has previously been analyzed using both Illumina-based short read-sequencing and Pacific Biosciences RS II-based long-read sequencing technologies. Since the various sequencing methods have distinct strengths and limitations, the use of multiplatform approaches have proven to be valuable. The aim of this study is to provide a more complete picture on the transcriptomic architecture of EBV.Methods:In this work, we apply the Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION (long-read sequencing) platform for the generation of novel transcriptomic data, and integrate these with other's data generated by another LRS approach, Pacific BioSciences RSII sequencing and Illumina CAGE-Seq and Poly(A)-Seq approaches. Both amplified and non-amplified cDNA sequencings were applied for the generation of sequencing reads, including both oligo-d(T) and random oligonucleotide-primed reverse transcription. EBV transcripts are identified and annotated using the LoRTIA software suite developed in our laboratory.Results:This study detected novel genes embedded into longer host genes containing 5'-truncated in-frame open reading frames, which potentially encode N-terminally truncated proteins. We also detected a number of novel non-coding RNAs and transcript length isoforms encoded by the same genes but differing in their start and/or end sites. This study also reports the discovery of novel splice isoforms, many of which may represent altered coding potential, and of novel replication-origin-associated transcripts. Additionally, novel mono- and multigenic transcripts were identified. An intricate meshwork of transcriptional overlaps was revealed.Conclusions:An integrative approach applying multi-technique sequencing technologies is suitable for reliable identification of complex transcriptomes because each techniques has different advantages and limitations, and the they can be used for the validation of the results obtained by a particular approach.",34991630,PMC8740505,10.1186/s12985-021-01734-6,9
Genomic DNA extraction optimization and validation for genome sequencing using the marine gastropod Kellet's whelk,"Next-generation sequencing technologies, such as Nanopore MinION, Illumina Hiseq and Novaseq, and PacBio Sequel II, hold immense potential for advancing genomic research on non-model organisms, including the vast majority of marine species. However, application of these technologies to marine invertebrate species is often impeded by challenges in extracting and purifying their genomic DNA due to high polysaccharide content and other secondary metabolites. In this study, we help resolve this issue by developing and testing DNA extraction protocols for Kellet's whelk (Kelletia kelletii), a subtidal gastropod with ecological and commercial importance, by comparing four DNA extraction methods commonly used in marine invertebrate studies. In our comparison of extraction methods, the Salting Out protocol was the least expensive, produced the highest DNA yields, produced consistent high DNA quality, and had low toxicity. We validated the protocol using an independent set of tissue samples, then applied it to extract high-molecular-weight (HMW) DNA from over three thousand Kellet's whelk tissue samples. The protocol demonstrated scalability and, with added clean-up, suitability for RAD-seq, GT-seq, as well as whole genome sequencing using both long read (ONT MinION) and short read (Illumina NovaSeq) sequencing platforms. Our findings offer a robust and versatile DNA extraction and clean-up protocol for supporting genomic research on non-model marine organisms, to help mediate the under-representation of invertebrates in genomic studies.",38077446,PMC10710129,10.7717/peerj.16510,0
Full-length transcriptome sequences and splice variants obtained by a combination of sequencing platforms applied to different root tissues of Salvia miltiorrhiza and tanshinone biosynthesis,"Danshen, Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge, is one of the most widely used herbs in traditional Chinese medicine, wherein its rhizome/roots are particularly valued. The corresponding bioactive components include the tanshinone diterpenoids, the biosynthesis of which is a subject of considerable interest. Previous investigations of the S. miltiorrhiza transcriptome have relied on short-read next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology, and the vast majority of the resulting isotigs do not represent full-length cDNA sequences. Moreover, these efforts have been targeted at either whole plants or hairy root cultures. Here, we demonstrate that the tanshinone pigments are produced and accumulate in the root periderm, and apply a combination of NGS and single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing to various root tissues, particularly including the periderm, to provide a more complete view of the S. miltiorrhiza transcriptome, with further insight into tanshinone biosynthesis as well. In addition, the use of SMRT long-read sequencing offered the ability to examine alternative splicing, which was found to occur in approximately 40% of the detected gene loci, including several involved in isoprenoid/terpenoid metabolism.",25912611,,10.1111/tpj.12865,165
A dual-constriction biological nanopore resolves homonucleotide sequences with high fidelity,"Single-molecule long-read DNA sequencing with biological nanopores is fast and high-throughput but suffers reduced accuracy in homonucleotide stretches. We now combine the CsgG nanopore with the 35-residue N-terminal region of its extracellular interaction partner CsgF to produce a dual-constriction pore with improved signal and base-calling accuracy for homopolymer regions. The electron cryo-microscopy structure of CsgG in complex with full-length CsgF shows that the 33 N-terminal residues of CsgF bind inside the β-barrel of the pore, forming a defined second constriction. In complexes of CsgG bound to a 35-residue CsgF constriction peptide, the second constriction is separated from the primary constriction by ~25 Å. We find that both constrictions contribute to electrical signal modulation during single-stranded DNA translocation. DNA sequencing using a prototype CsgG-CsgF protein pore with two constrictions improved single-read accuracy by 25 to 70% in homopolymers up to 9 nucleotides long.",32632300,PMC7610451,10.1038/s41587-020-0570-8,38
Human Mutation special issue on innovations in genomic diagnostics,"This special issue of Human Mutation focuses on Innovations in Genomic Diagnostics. The increasing interest in genomic medicine, and the growing possibilities for treatment and management of genetic disease, make complete and accurate diagnosis mission critical. This issue describes leading-edge technologies with emerging utility for genomic diagnostics. Genomic testing has dramatically evolved as a result of advances in technology, data analytics, and the continuing pace of disease gene discovery. Since 2011, clinical laboratories have increasingly employed next-generation sequencing-based tests in addition to historical techniques to identify a spectrum of germline and somatic variants implicated in human disease. However, common testing platforms have known limitations, including failure to detect disease-causing variants in certain regions, inability to identify all variant types, variant phasing, measuring epigenetic changes, and ongoing challenges with variant interpretation. Innovative solutions are emerging, including increasingly rapid genome sequencing, long-read sequencing, clinical RNA sequencing, epigenomic profiling, facial phenotyping, and an array of computational tools for variant identification and interpretation.",36116036,,10.1002/humu.24474,0
Improved Characterization of Complex β-Globin Gene Cluster Structural Variants Using Long-Read Sequencing,"Complex insertion-deletion (indel) events in the globin genes manifest in widely variable clinical phenotypes. Many are incompletely characterized because of a historic lack of efficient methods. A more complete assessment enables improved prediction of clinical impact, which guides emerging therapeutic choices. Current methods have limited capacity for breakpoint assignment and accurate assessment of mutation extent, especially in cases containing duplications or multiple deletions and insertions. Technology, such as long-read sequencing, holds promise for significant impact in the characterization of indel events because of read lengths that span large regions, resulting in improved resolution. Four known complex β-globin gene cluster indel types were assessed using single-molecule, real-time sequencing technology and showed high correlation with previous reports, including the Caribbean locus control deletion (g.5,305,478_5,310,336del), a large β-gene duplication containing the Hb S mutation (g.4,640,335_5,290,171dup with g.5,248,232T>A, c.20A>T; variant allele fraction, 64%), and two nested variants (double deletions with intervening inversion): the IndianGγ(Aγδβ)0-thalassemia (g.5,246,804-5,254,275del, g.5,254,276_5,269,600inv, and g.5,269,601_5,270,442del) and the Turkish/Macedonian (δβ)0thalassemia (g.5,235,064_5,236,652del, g.5,236,653_5,244,280inv, and g.5,244,281_5,255,766del). Our data confirm long-read sequencing as an efficient and accurate method to identify these clinically significant complex events. Limitations include high-complexity sample preparation requirements, which hinder routine use in clinical laboratories. Continued improvements in sample and data workflow processes are needed to accommodate volumes in a tertiary clinical laboratory.",34839893,,10.1016/j.jmoldx.2021.08.013,4
Highly accurate long-read HiFi sequencing data for five complex genomes,"The PacBio®HiFi sequencing method yields highly accurate long-read sequencing datasets with read lengths averaging 10-25 kb and accuracies greater than 99.5%. These accurate long reads can be used to improve results for complex applications such as single nucleotide and structural variant detection, genome assembly, assembly of difficult polyploid or highly repetitive genomes, and assembly of metagenomes. Currently, there is a need for sample data sets to both evaluate the benefits of these long accurate reads as well as for development of bioinformatic tools including genome assemblers, variant callers, and haplotyping algorithms. We present deep coverage HiFi datasets for five complex samples including the two inbred model genomes Mus musculus and Zea mays, as well as two complex genomes, octoploid Fragaria × ananassa and the diploid anuran Rana muscosa. Additionally, we release sequence data from a mock metagenome community. The datasets reported here can be used without restriction to develop new algorithms and explore complex genome structure and evolution.

Advances in Transcriptomics: Investigating Cardiovascular Disease at Unprecedented Resolution,"Whole-genome transcriptional profiling has become a standard genomic approach to investigate biological processes. RNA sequencing (RNAseq) in particular has witnessed myriad applications in genetics and various biomedical fields. RNAseq involves a relatively simple experimental protocol of RNA extraction and cDNA library preparation and, because of decreasing next-generation sequencing cost and lower computational burden for data processing, has obtained a central role in the modern biology. The recent application of RNAseq methodology to single-cell transcriptional profiling has enabled the more precise characterization of cell lineage and cell state genetic profiles. The development of bioinformatic and statistical tools has provided for differential gene expression analysis, RNA isoform analysis, haplotype-specific analysis of gene expression (allele-specific expression), and analysis of expression quantitative trait loci. We give an overview of these and recent developments in RNAseq methodology with emphasis on quality control, read mapping, feature counting, differential gene expression, allele-specific expression and expression quantitative trait loci analysis, and fusion transcript detection. We describe utilization of RNAseq as a diagnostic tool in Mendelian diseases, complex phenotypes, and cancer and give an overview of long read RNAseq technology. Furthermore, we discuss in detail the recent revolution in single-cell transcriptomics that is reshaping modern biology.",29700068,PMC7274217,10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.310910,15
RNA polyadenylation patterns in the human transcriptome,"The eukaryotic transcriptome undergoes various post-transcriptional modifications which assists gene expression. Polyadenylation is a molecular process occurring at the 3'-end of the RNA molecule which involves the poly(A) polymerase attaching adenine monophosphate molecules in a chain-like fashion to assemble a poly(A) tail. Multiple RNA isoforms are produced with differing 3'-UTR and exonic compositions through alternative polyadenylation (APA) which enhances the diversification of alternatively spliced mRNA transcripts. To study polyadenylation patterns, novel methods have been developed using short-read and long-read sequencing technologies to analyse the 3'-ends of the transcript. Recent studies have identified unique polyadenylation patterns in different cellular functions, including oncogenic activity, which could prove valuable in the understanding of medical genetics, particularly in the discovery of biomarkers in diseased states. We present a review of current literature reporting on polyadenylation and the biological relevance in the mammalian transcriptome, with a focus on the human transcriptome. Additionally, we have explored the various methods available to detect polyadenylation patterns using second and third generation sequencing technologies.",34998928,,10.1016/j.gene.2021.146133,1
Reference-Grade Genome and Large Linear Plasmid of Streptomyces rimosus: Pushing the Limits of Nanopore Sequencing,"Streptomyces rimosus ATCC 10970 is the parental strain of industrial strains used for the commercial production of the important antibiotic oxytetracycline. As an actinobacterium with a large linear chromosome containing numerous long repeat regions, high GC content, and a single giant linear plasmid (GLP), these genomes are challenging to assemble. Here, we apply a hybrid sequencing approach relying on the combination of short- and long-read next-generation sequencing platforms and whole-genome restriction analysis by using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) to produce a high-quality reference genome for this biotechnologically important bacterium. By using PFGE to separate and isolate plasmid DNA from chromosomal DNA, we successfully sequenced the GLP using Nanopore data alone. Using this approach, we compared the sequence of GLP in the parent strain ATCC 10970 with those found in two semi-industrial progenitor strains, R6-500 and M4018. Sequencing of the GLP of these threeS. rimosusstrains shed light on several rearrangements accompanied by transposase genes, suggesting that transposases play an important role in plasmid and genome plasticity inS. rimosus. The polished annotation of secondary metabolite biosynthetic pathways compared to metabolite analysis in the ATCC 10970 strain also refined our knowledge of the secondary metabolite arsenal of these strains. The proposed methodology is highly applicable to a variety of sequencing projects, as evidenced by the reliable assemblies obtained.IMPORTANCEThe genomes ofStreptomycesspecies are difficult to assemble due to long repeats, extrachromosomal elements (giant linear plasmids [GLPs]), rearrangements, and high GC content. To improve the quality of theS. rimosusATCC 10970 genome, producer of oxytetracycline, we validated the assembly of GLPs by applying a new approach to combine pulsed-field gel electrophoresis separation and GLP isolation and sequenced the isolated GLP with Oxford Nanopore technology. By examining the sequenced plasmids of ATCC 10970 and two industrial progenitor strains, R6-500 and M4018, we identified large GLP rearrangements. Analysis of the assembled plasmid sequences shed light on the role of transposases in genome plasticity of this species. The new methodological approach developed for Nanopore sequencing is highly applicable to a variety of sequencing projects. In addition, we present the annotated reference genome sequence of ATCC 10970 with a detailed analysis of the biosynthetic gene clusters.",35377231,PMC9045324,10.1128/spectrum.02434-21,3
Tracking of Antibiotic Resistance Transfer and Rapid Plasmid Evolution in a Hospital Setting by Nanopore Sequencing,"Infections with multidrug-resistant bacteria often leave limited or no treatment options. The transfer of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARG) carrying plasmids between bacterial species by horizontal gene transfer represents an important mode of expansion of ARGs. Here, we demonstrate the application of Nanopore sequencing in a hospital setting for monitoring transfer and rapid evolution of antibiotic resistance plasmids within and across multiple species. In 2009, we experienced an outbreak with extensively multidrug-resistantPseudomonas aeruginosaharboring the carbapenemase-encodingblaIMP-8gene. In 2012, the firstCitrobacter freundiiandCitrobacter cronaestrains harboring the same gene were detected. Using Nanopore and Illumina sequencing, we conducted comparative analysis of allblaIMP-8bacteria isolated in our hospital over a 6-year period (n= 54). We developed the computational platformplasmIDentfor Nanopore-based characterization of clinical isolates and monitoring of ARG transfer, comprisingde novoassembly of genomes and plasmids, plasmid circularization, ARG annotation, comparative genome analysis of multiple isolates, and visualization of results. UsingplasmIDent, we identified a 40-kb plasmid carryingblaIMP-8inP. aeruginosaandC. freundii, verifying the plasmid transfer. WithinC. freundii, the plasmid underwent further evolution and plasmid fusion, resulting in a 164-kb megaplasmid, which was transferred toC. cronaeMultiple rearrangements of the multidrug resistance gene cassette were detected inP. aeruginosa, including deletions and translocations of complete ARGs. In summary, plasmid transfer, plasmid fusion, and rearrangement of the ARG cassette mediated the rapid evolution of opportunistic pathogens in our hospital. We demonstrated the feasibility of near-real-time monitoring of plasmid evolution and ARG transfer in clinical settings, enabling successful countermeasures to contain plasmid-mediated outbreaks.IMPORTANCEInfections with multidrug-resistant bacteria represent a major threat to global health. While the spread of multidrug-resistant bacterial clones is frequently studied in the hospital setting, surveillance of the transfer of mobile genetic elements between different bacterial species was difficult until recent advances in sequencing technologies. Nanopore sequencing technology was applied to track antimicrobial gene transfer in a long-term outbreak of multidrug-resistantPseudomonas aeruginosa,Citrobacter freundii, andCitrobacter cronaein a German hospital over 6 years. We developed a novel computational pipeline,pathoLogic, which enablesde novoassembly of genomes and plasmids, antimicrobial resistance gene annotation and visualization, and comparative analysis. Applying this approach, we detected plasmid transfer between different bacterial species as well as plasmid fusion and frequent rearrangements of the antimicrobial resistance gene cassette.

Pedigree genome data of an early-matured Geng/japonica glutinous rice mega variety Longgeng 57,"By using PacBio HiFi technology, we produced over 700 Gb of long-read sequencing (LRS) raw data; and by using Illumina paired-end whole-genome shotgun (WGS) sequencing technology, we generated more than 70 Gb of short-read sequencing (SRS) data. With LRS data, we assembled one genome and then generate a set of annotation data for an early-matured Geng/japonica glutinous rice mega variety genome, Longgeng 57 (LG57), which carries multiple elite traits including good grain quality and wide adaptability. Together with the SRS data from three parents of LG57, pedigree genome variations were called for three representative types of genes. These data sets can be used for deep variation mining, aid in the discovery of new insights into genome structure, function, and evolution, and help to provide essential support to biological research in general.",38388638,PMC10884013,10.1038/s41597-024-03057-x,0
A new full-length circular DNA sequencing method for viral-sized genomes reveals that RNAi transgenic plants provoke a shift in geminivirus populations in the field,"We present a new method, CIDER-Seq (Circular DNA Enrichment sequencing) for the unbiased enrichment and long-read sequencing of viral-sized circular DNA molecules. We used CIDER-Seq to produce single-read full-length virus genomes for the first time. CIDER-Seq combines PCR-free virus enrichment with Single Molecule Real Time sequencing and a new sequence de-concatenation algorithm. We apply our technique to produce >1200 full-length, highly accurate geminivirus genomes from RNAi-transgenic and control plants in a field trial in Kenya. Using CIDER-Seq we can demonstrate for the first time that the expression of antiviral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) in transgenic plants causes a consistent shift in virus populations towards species sharing low homology to the transgene derived dsRNA. Our method and its application in an economically important crop plant opens new possibilities in periodic virus sequence surveillance and accurate profiling of diverse circular DNA elements.",30357413,PMC6344846,10.1093/nar/gky914,5
A high-quality de novo genome assembly based on nanopore sequencing of a wild-caught coconut rhinoceros beetle (Oryctes rhinoceros),"Background:An optimal starting point for relating genome function to organismal biology is a high-quality nuclear genome assembly, and long-read sequencing is revolutionizing the production of this genomic resource in insects. Despite this, nuclear genome assemblies have been under-represented for agricultural insect pests, particularly from the order Coleoptera. Here we present a de novo genome assembly and structural annotation for the coconut rhinoceros beetle, Oryctes rhinoceros (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae), based on Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) long-read data generated from a wild-caught female, as well as the assembly process that also led to the recovery of the complete circular genome assemblies of the beetle's mitochondrial genome and that of the biocontrol agent, Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus (OrNV). As an invasive pest of palm trees, O. rhinoceros is undergoing an expansion in its range across the Pacific Islands, requiring new approaches to management that may include strategies facilitated by genome assembly and annotation.Results:High-quality DNA isolated from an adult female was used to create four ONT libraries that were sequenced using four MinION flow cells, producing a total of 27.2 Gb of high-quality long-read sequences. We employed an iterative assembly process and polishing with one lane of high-accuracy Illumina reads, obtaining a final size of the assembly of 377.36 Mb that had high contiguity (fragment N50 length = 12 Mb) and accuracy, as evidenced by the exceptionally high completeness of the benchmarked set of conserved single-copy orthologous genes (BUSCO completeness = 99.1%). These quality metrics place our assembly ahead of the published Coleopteran genomes, including that of an insect model, the red flour beetle (Tribolium castaneum). The structural annotation of the nuclear genome assembly contained a highly-accurate set of 16,371 protein-coding genes, with only 2.8% missing BUSCOs, and the expected number of non-coding RNAs. The number and structure of paralogous genes in a gene family like Sigma GST is lower than in another scarab beetle (Onthophagus taurus), but higher than in the red flour beetle (Tribolium castaneum), which suggests expansion of this GST class in Scarabaeidae. The quality of our gene models was also confirmed with the correct placement of O. rhinoceros among other members of the rhinoceros beetles (subfamily Dynastinae) in a phylogeny based on the sequences of 95 protein-coding genes in 373 beetle species from all major lineages of Coleoptera. Finally, we provide a list of 30 candidate dsRNA targets whose orthologs have been experimentally validated as highly effective targets for RNAi-based control of several beetles.Conclusions:The genomic resources produced in this study form a foundation for further functional genetic research and management programs that may inform the control and surveillance of O. rhinoceros populations, and we demonstrate the efficacy of de novo genome assembly using long-read ONT data from a single field-caught insect.",35672676,PMC9172067,10.1186/s12864-022-08628-z,7
High-accuracy long-read amplicon sequences using unique molecular identifiers with Nanopore or PacBio sequencing,"High-throughput amplicon sequencing of large genomic regions remains challenging for short-read technologies. Here, we report a high-throughput amplicon sequencing approach combining unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) with Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) or Pacific Biosciences circular consensus sequencing, yielding high-accuracy single-molecule consensus sequences of large genomic regions. We applied our approach to sequence ribosomal RNA operon amplicons (~4,500 bp) and genomic sequences (>10,000 bp) of reference microbial communities in which we observed a chimera rate <0.02%. To reach a mean UMI consensus error rate <0.01%, a UMI read coverage of 15× (ONT R10.3), 25× (ONT R9.4.1) and 3× (Pacific Biosciences circular consensus sequencing) is needed, which provides a mean error rate of 0.0042%, 0.0041% and 0.0007%, respectively.",33432244,,10.1038/s41592-020-01041-y,126
DBTSS/DBKERO for integrated analysis of transcriptional regulation,"DBTSS (Database of Transcriptional Start Sites)/DBKERO (Database of Kashiwa Encyclopedia for human genome mutations in Regulatory regions and their Omics contexts) is the database originally initiated with the information of transcriptional start sites and their upstream transcriptional regulatory regions. In recent years, we updated the database to assist users to elucidate biological relevance of the human genome variations or somatic mutations in cancers which may affect the transcriptional regulation. In this update, we facilitate interpretations of disease associated genomic variation, using the Japanese population as a model case. We enriched the genomic variation dataset consisting of the 13,368 individuals collected for various genome-wide association studies and the reference epigenome information in the surrounding regions using a total of 455 epigenome datasets (four tissue types from 67 healthy individuals) collected for the International Human Epigenome Consortium (IHEC). The data directly obtained from the clinical samples was associated with that obtained from various model systems, such as the drug perturbation datasets using cultured cancer cells. Furthermore, we incorporated the results obtained using the newly developed analytical methods, Nanopore/10x Genomics long-read sequencing of the human genome and single cell analyses. The database is made publicly accessible at the URL (http://dbtss.hgc.jp/).",29126224,PMC5753362,10.1093/nar/gkx1001,29
LongPhase: an ultra-fast chromosome-scale phasing algorithm for small and large variants,"Motivation:Long-read phasing has been used for reconstructing diploid genomes, improving variant calling and resolving microbial strains in metagenomics. However, the phasing blocks of existing methods are broken by large Structural Variations (SVs), and the efficiency is unsatisfactory for population-scale phasing.Results:This article presents a novel algorithm, LongPhase, which can simultaneously phase single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and SVs of a human genome in 10-20 min, 10× faster than the state-of-the-art WhatsHap, HapCUT2 and Margin. In particular, co-phasing SNPs and SVs produces much larger haplotype blocks (N50 = 25 Mbp) than those of existing methods (N50 = 10-15 Mbp). We show that LongPhase combined with Nanopore ultra-long reads is a cost-effective and highly contiguous solution, which can produce between one and 26 blocks per chromosome arm without the need for additional trios, chromosome-conformation and strand-seq data.Availabilityand implementation:LongPhase is freely available at https://github.com/twolinin/LongPhase/.Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",35104333,,10.1093/bioinformatics/btac058,14
The spatial landscape of gene expression isoforms in tissue sections,"In situ capturing technologies add tissue context to gene expression data, with the potential of providing a greater understanding of complex biological systems. However, splicing variants and full-length sequence heterogeneity cannot be characterized at spatial resolution with current transcriptome profiling methods. To that end, we introduce spatial isoform transcriptomics (SiT), an explorative method for characterizing spatial isoform variation and sequence heterogeneity using long-read sequencing. We show in mouse brain how SiT can be used to profile isoform expression and sequence heterogeneity in different areas of the tissue. SiT reveals regional isoform switching of Plp1 gene between different layers of the olfactory bulb, and the use of external single-cell data allows the nomination of cell types expressing each isoform. Furthermore, SiT identifies differential isoform usage for several major genes implicated in brain function (Snap25, Bin1, Gnas) that are independently validated by in situ sequencing. SiT also provides for the first time an in-depth A-to-I RNA editing map of the adult mouse brain. Data exploration can be performed through an online resource (https://www.isomics.eu), where isoform expression and RNA editing can be visualized in a spatial context.",36928528,PMC10164556,10.1093/nar/gkad169,14
An improved ovine reference genome assembly to facilitate in-depth functional annotation of the sheep genome,"Background:The domestic sheep (Ovis aries) is an important agricultural species raised for meat, wool, and milk across the world. A high-quality reference genome for this species enhances the ability to discover genetic mechanisms influencing biological traits. Furthermore, a high-quality reference genome allows for precise functional annotation of gene regulatory elements. The rapid advances in genome assembly algorithms and emergence of sequencing technologies with increasingly long reads provide the opportunity for an improved de novo assembly of the sheep reference genome.Findings:Short-read Illumina (55× coverage), long-read Pacific Biosciences (75× coverage), and Hi-C data from this ewe retrieved from public databases were combined with an additional 50× coverage of Oxford Nanopore data and assembled with canu v1.9. The assembled contigs were scaffolded using Hi-C data with Salsa v2.2, gaps filled with PBsuitev15.8.24, and polished with Nanopolish v0.12.5. After duplicate contig removal with PurgeDups v1.0.1, chromosomes were oriented and polished with 2 rounds of a pipeline that consisted of freebayes v1.3.1 to call variants, Merfin to validate them, and BCFtools to generate the consensus fasta. The ARS-UI_Ramb_v2.0 assembly is 2.63 Gb in length and has improved continuity (contig NG50 of 43.18 Mb), with a 19- and 38-fold decrease in the number of scaffolds compared with Oar_rambouillet_v1.0 and Oar_v4.0. ARS-UI_Ramb_v2.0 has greater per-base accuracy and fewer insertions and deletions identified from mapped RNA sequence than previous assemblies.Conclusions:The ARS-UI_Ramb_v2.0 assembly is a substantial improvement in contiguity that will optimize the functional annotation of the sheep genome and facilitate improved mapping accuracy of genetic variant and expression data for traits in sheep.",35134925,PMC8848310,10.1093/gigascience/giab096,19
Nanopore Sequencing for Mixed Samples,"Long read Nanopore sequencing can be utilised to determine the quality and accuracy of genetically engineered changes in animals, which often produce heterogenous samples. The protocol presented in this chapter can be used for a range of both low and high throughput sequencing applications. DNA must be repaired, barcoded and ligated to sequencing adapters prior to sequencing. Quality of sequencing data produced is dependent on stringent adherence to the protocol. However, nanopore sequencing is a fast moving field, therefore it is worth considering using the most up to date chemistry available.",36853467,,10.1007/978-1-0716-3004-4_16,0
Single-molecule long-read sequencing of the full-length transcriptome of Rhododendron lapponicum L,"Rhododendron lapponicum L. is a familiar ornamental plant worldwide with important ornamental and economic value. However, a full-length R. lapponicum transcriptome is still lacking. In the present study, we used the Pacific Biosciences single-molecule real-time sequencing technology to generate the R. lapponicum transcriptome. A total of 346,270 full-length non-chimeric reads were generated, from which we obtained 75,002 high-quality full-length transcripts. We identified 55,255 complete open reading frames, 7,140 alternative splicing events and 2,011 long non-coding RNAs. In gene annotation analyses, 71,155, 33,653, 30,359 and 31,749 transcripts were assigned to the Nr, GO, COG and KEGG databases, respectively. Additionally, 3,150 transcription factors were detected. KEGG pathway analysis showed that 96 transcripts were identified coding for the enzymes associated with anthocyanin synthesis. Furthermore, we identified 64,327 simple sequence repeats from 45,319 sequences, and 150 pairs of primers were randomly selected to develop SSR markers. This study provides a large number of full-length transcripts, which will facilitate the further study of the genetics of R. lapponicum.",32317724,PMC7174332,10.1038/s41598-020-63814-x,20
CarrierSeq: a sequence analysis workflow for low-input nanopore sequencing,"Background:Long-read nanopore sequencing technology is of particular significance for taxonomic identification at or below the species level. For many environmental samples, the total extractable DNA is far below the current input requirements of nanopore sequencing, preventing ""sample to sequence"" metagenomics from low-biomass or recalcitrant samples.Results:Here we address this problem by employing carrier sequencing, a method to sequence low-input DNA by preparing the target DNA with a genomic carrier to achieve ideal library preparation and sequencing stoichiometry without amplification. We then use CarrierSeq, a sequence analysis workflow to identify the low-input target reads from the genomic carrier. We tested CarrierSeq experimentally by sequencing from a combination of 0.2 ng Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633 DNA in a background of 1000 ng Enterobacteria phage λ DNA. After filtering of carrier, low quality, and low complexity reads, we detected target reads (B. subtilis), contamination reads, and ""high quality noise reads"" (HQNRs) not mapping to the carrier, target or known lab contaminants. These reads appear to be artifacts of the nanopore sequencing process as they are associated with specific channels (pores).Conclusion:By treating sequencing as a Poisson arrival process, we implement a statistical test to reject data from channels dominated by HQNRs while retaining low-input target reads.",29587645,PMC5872496,10.1186/s12859-018-2124-3,9
Chromosome-levelde novogenome assemblies of over 100 plant species,"Genome sequence analysis in higher plants began with the whole-genome sequencing ofArabidopsis thaliana. Owing to the great advances in sequencing technologies, also known as next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, genomes of more than 400 plant species have been sequenced to date. Long-read sequencing technologies, together with sequence scaffolding methods, have enabled the synthesis of chromosome-levelde novogenome sequence assemblies, which has further allowed comparative analysis of the structural features of multiple plant genomes, thus elucidating the evolutionary history of plants. However, the quality of the assembled chromosome-level sequences varies among plant species. In this review, we summarize the status of chromosome-level assemblies of 114 plant species, with genome sizes ranging from 125 Mb to 16.9 Gb. While the average genome coverage of the assembled sequences reached up to 89.1%, the average coverage of chromosome-level pseudomolecules was 73.3%. Thus, further improvements in sequencing technologies and scaffolding, and data analysis methods, are required to establish gap-free telomere-to-telomere genome sequence assemblies. With the forthcoming new technologies, we are going to enter into a new genomics era where pan-genomics and the >1,000 or >1 million genomes' project will be routine in higher plants.",34377059,PMC8329882,10.1270/jsbbs.20146,10
"Whole-genome sequencing and analysis of two azaleas, Rhododendron ripense and Rhododendron kiyosumense","To enhance the genomics and genetics of azalea, the whole-genome sequences of two species of Rhododendron were determined and analysed in this study: Rhododendron ripense, the cytoplasmic donor and ancestral species of large-flowered and evergreen azalea cultivars; and Rhododendron kiyosumense, a native of Chiba prefecture (Japan) seldomly bred and cultivated. A chromosome-level genome sequence assembly of R. ripense was constructed by single-molecule real-time sequencing and genetic mapping, while the genome sequence of R. kiyosumense was assembled using the single-tube long fragment read sequencing technology. The R. ripense genome assembly contained 319 contigs (506.7 Mb; N50 length: 2.5 Mb) and was assigned to the genetic map to establish 13 pseudomolecule sequences. On the other hand, the genome of R. kiyosumense was assembled into 32,308 contigs (601.9 Mb; N50 length: 245.7 kb). A total of 34,606 genes were predicted in the R. ripense genome, while 35,785 flower and 48,041 leaf transcript isoforms were identified in R. kiyosumense through Iso-Seq analysis. Overall, the genome sequence information generated in this study enhances our understanding of genome evolution in the Ericales and reveals the phylogenetic relationship of closely related species. This information will also facilitate the development of phenotypically attractive azalea cultivars.",34289022,PMC8435550,10.1093/dnares/dsab010,3
Bridging the splicing gap in human genetics with long-read RNA sequencing: finding the protein isoform drivers of disease,"Aberrant splicing underlies many human diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular diseases and neurological disorders. Genome-wide mapping of splicing quantitative trait loci (sQTLs) has shown that genetic regulation of alternative splicing is widespread. However, identification of the corresponding isoform or protein products associated with disease-associated sQTLs is challenging with short-read RNA-seq, which cannot precisely characterize full-length transcript isoforms. Furthermore, contemporary sQTL interpretation often relies on reference transcript annotations, which are incomplete. Solutions to these issues may be found through integration of newly emerging long-read sequencing technologies. Long-read sequencing offers the capability to sequence full-length mRNA transcripts and, in some cases, to link sQTLs to transcript isoforms containing disease-relevant protein alterations. Here, we provide an overview of sQTL mapping approaches, the use of long-read sequencing to characterize sQTL effects on isoforms, the linkage of RNA isoforms to protein-level functions and comment on future directions in the field. Based on recent progress, long-read RNA sequencing promises to be part of the human disease genetics toolkit to discover and treat protein isoforms causing rare and complex diseases.",35960994,PMC9585682,10.1093/hmg/ddac196,8
A Long-Read Sequencing Approach for Direct Haplotype Phasing in Clinical Settings,"The reconstruction of individual haplotypes can facilitate the interpretation of disease risks; however, high costs and technical challenges still hinder their assessment in clinical settings. Second-generation sequencing is the gold standard for variant discovery but, due to the production of short reads covering small genomic regions, allows only indirect haplotyping based on statistical methods. In contrast, third-generation methods such as the nanopore sequencing platform developed by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) generate long reads that can be used for direct haplotyping, with fewer drawbacks. However, robust standards for variant phasing in ONT-based target resequencing efforts are not yet available. In this study, we presented a streamlined proof-of-concept workflow for variant calling and phasing based on ONT data in a clinically relevant 12-kb region of theAPOElocus, a hotspot for variants and haplotypes associated with aging-related diseases and longevity. Starting with sequencing data from simple amplicons of the target locus, we demonstrated that ONT data allow for reliable single-nucleotide variant (SNV) calling and phasing from as little as 60 reads, although the recognition of indels is less efficient. Even so, we identified the best combination of ONT read sets (600) and software (BWA/Minimap2 and HapCUT2) that enables full haplotype reconstruction when both SNVs and indels have been identified previously using a highly-accurate sequencing platform. In conclusion, we established a rapid and inexpensive workflow for variant phasing based on ONT long reads. This allowed for the analysis of multiple samples in parallel and can easily be implemented in routine clinical practice, including diagnostic testing.",33271988,PMC7731377,10.3390/ijms21239177,16
Lost in plasmids: next generation sequencing and the complex genome of the tick-borne pathogen Borrelia burgdorferi,"Background:Borrelia (B.) burgdorferi sensu lato, including the tick-transmitted agents of human Lyme borreliosis, have particularly complex genomes, consisting of a linear main chromosome and numerous linear and circular plasmids. The number and structure of plasmids is variable even in strains within a single genospecies. Genes on these plasmids are known to play essential roles in virulence and pathogenicity as well as host and vector associations. For this reason, it is essential to explore methods for rapid and reliable characterisation of molecular level changes on plasmids. In this study we used three strains: a low passage isolate of B. burgdorferi sensu stricto strain B31(-NRZ) and two closely related strains (PAli and PAbe) that were isolated from human patients. Sequences of these strains were compared to the previously sequenced reference strain B31 (available in GenBank) to obtain proof-of-principle information on the suitability of next generation sequencing (NGS) library construction and sequencing methods on the assembly of bacterial plasmids. We tested the effectiveness of different short read assemblers on Illumina sequences, and of long read generation methods on sequence data from Pacific Bioscience single-molecule real-time (SMRT) and nanopore (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) sequencing technology.Results:Inclusion of mate pair library reads improved the assembly in some plasmids as did prior enrichment of plasmids. While cp32 plasmids remained refractory to assembly using only short reads they were effectively assembled by long read sequencing methods. The long read SMRT and nanopore sequences came, however, at the cost of indels (insertions or deletions) appearing in an unpredictable manner. Using long and short read technologies together allowed us to show that the three B. burgdorferi s.s. strains investigated here, whilst having similar plasmid structures to each other (apart from fusion of cp32 plasmids), differed significantly from the reference strain B31-GB, especially in the case of cp32 plasmids.Conclusion:Short read methods are sufficient to assemble the main chromosome and many of the plasmids in B. burgdorferi. However, a combination of short and long read sequencing methods is essential for proper assembly of all plasmids including cp32 and thus, for gaining an understanding of host- or vector adaptations. An important conclusion from our work is that the evolution of Borrelia plasmids appears to be dynamic. This has important implications for the development of useful research strategies to monitor the risk of Lyme disease occurrence and how to medically manage it.",28558786,PMC5450258,10.1186/s12864-017-3804-5,32
Proteogenomics produces comprehensive and highly accurate protein-coding gene annotation in a complete genome assembly of Malassezia sympodialis,"Complete and accurate genome assembly and annotation is a crucial foundation for comparative and functional genomics. Despite this, few complete eukaryotic genomes are available, and genome annotation remains a major challenge. Here, we present a complete genome assembly of the skin commensal yeast Malassezia sympodialis and demonstrate how proteogenomics can substantially improve gene annotation. Through long-read DNA sequencing, we obtained a gap-free genome assembly for M. sympodialis (ATCC 42132), comprising eight nuclear and one mitochondrial chromosome. We also sequenced and assembled four M. sympodialis clinical isolates, and showed their value for understanding Malassezia reproduction by confirming four alternative allele combinations at the two mating-type loci. Importantly, we demonstrated how proteomics data could be readily integrated with transcriptomics data in standard annotation tools. This increased the number of annotated protein-coding genes by 14% (from 3612 to 4113), compared to using transcriptomics evidence alone. Manual curation further increased the number of protein-coding genes by 9% (to 4493). All of these genes have RNA-seq evidence and 87% were confirmed by proteomics. The M. sympodialis genome assembly and annotation presented here is at a quality yet achieved only for a few eukaryotic organisms, and constitutes an important reference for future host-microbe interaction studies.",28100699,PMC5389616,10.1093/nar/gkx006,25
SVision: a deep learning approach to resolve complex structural variants,"Complex structural variants (CSVs) encompass multiple breakpoints and are often missed or misinterpreted. We developed SVision, a deep-learning-based multi-object-recognition framework, to automatically detect and haracterize CSVs from long-read sequencing data. SVision outperforms current callers at identifying the internal structure of complex events and has revealed 80 high-quality CSVs with 25 distinct structures from an individual genome. SVision directly detects CSVs without matching known structures, allowing sensitive detection of both common and previously uncharacterized complex rearrangements.",36109679,PMC9985066,10.1038/s41592-022-01609-w,14
Introduction to the Analysis of Environmental Sequences: Metagenomics with MEGAN,"Metagenomics has become a part of the standard toolkit for scientists interested in studying microbes in the environment. Compared to 16S rDNA sequencing, which allows coarse taxonomic profiling of samples, shotgun metagenomic sequencing provides a more detailed analysis of the taxonomic and functional content of samples. Long read technologies, such as developed by Pacific Biosciences or Oxford Nanopore, produce much longer stretches of informative sequence, greatly simplifying the difficult and time-consuming process of metagenomic assembly. MEGAN6 provides a wide range of analysis and visualization methods for the analysis of short and long read metagenomic data. A simple and efficient analysis pipeline for metagenomic analysis consists of the DIAMOND alignment tool on short reads, or the LAST alignment tool on long reads, followed by MEGAN. This approach performs taxonomic and functional abundance analysis, supports comparative analysis of large-scale experiments, and allows one to involve experimental metadata in the analysis.",31278678,,10.1007/978-1-4939-9074-0_19,14
Genome-wide single-molecule analysis of long-read DNA methylation reveals heterogeneous patterns at heterochromatin that reflect nucleosome organisation,"High-throughput sequencing technology is central to our current understanding of the human methylome. The vast majority of studies use chemical conversion to analyse bulk-level patterns of DNA methylation across the genome from a population of cells. While this technology has been used to probe single-molecule methylation patterns, such analyses are limited to short reads of a few hundred basepairs. DNA methylation can also be directly detected using Nanopore sequencing which can generate reads measuring megabases in length. However, thus far these analyses have largely focused on bulk-level assessment of DNA methylation. Here, we analyse DNA methylation in single Nanopore reads from human lymphoblastoid cells, to show that bulk-level metrics underestimate large-scale heterogeneity in the methylome. We use the correlation in methylation state between neighbouring sites to quantify single-molecule heterogeneity and find that heterogeneity varies significantly across the human genome, with some regions having heterogeneous methylation patterns at the single-molecule level and others possessing more homogeneous methylation patterns. By comparing the genomic distribution of the correlation to epigenomic annotations, we find that the greatest heterogeneity in single-molecule patterns is observed within heterochromatic partially methylated domains (PMDs). In contrast, reads originating from euchromatic regions and gene bodies have more ordered DNA methylation patterns. By analysing the patterns of single molecules in more detail, we show the existence of a nucleosome-scale periodicity in DNA methylation that accounts for some of the heterogeneity we uncover in long single-molecule DNA methylation patterns. We find that this periodic structure is partially masked in bulk data and correlates with DNA accessibility as measured by nanoNOMe-seq, suggesting that it could be generated by nucleosomes. Our findings demonstrate the power of single-molecule analysis of long-read data to understand the structure of the human methylome.",37782664,PMC10569558,10.1371/journal.pgen.1010958,2
MGnify: the microbiome sequence data analysis resource in 2023,"The MGnify platform (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics) facilitates the assembly, analysis and archiving of microbiome-derived nucleic acid sequences. The platform provides access to taxonomic assignments and functional annotations for nearly half a million analyses covering metabarcoding, metatranscriptomic, and metagenomic datasets, which are derived from a wide range of different environments. Over the past 3 years, MGnify has not only grown in terms of the number of datasets contained but also increased the breadth of analyses provided, such as the analysis of long-read sequences. The MGnify protein database now exceeds 2.4 billion non-redundant sequences predicted from metagenomic assemblies. This collection is now organised into a relational database making it possible to understand the genomic context of the protein through navigation back to the source assembly and sample metadata, marking a major improvement. To extend beyond the functional annotations already provided in MGnify, we have applied deep learning-based annotation methods. The technology underlying MGnify's Application Programming Interface (API) and website has been upgraded, and we have enabled the ability to perform downstream analysis of the MGnify data through the introduction of a coupled Jupyter Lab environment.",36477304,PMC9825492,10.1093/nar/gkac1080,47
The Chrysanthemum nankingense Genome Provides Insights into the Evolution and Diversification of Chrysanthemum Flowers and Medicinal Traits,"The Asteraceae (Compositae), a large plant family of approximately 24 000-35 000 species, accounts for ∼10% of all angiosperm species and contributes a lot to plant diversity. The most representative members of the Asteraceae are the economically important chrysanthemums (Chrysanthemum L.) that diversified through reticulate evolution. Biodiversity is typically created by multiple evolutionary mechanisms such as whole-genome duplication (WGD) or polyploidization and locally repetitive genome expansion. However, the lack of genomic data from chrysanthemum species has prevented an in-depth analysis of the evolutionary mechanisms involved in their diversification. Here, we used Oxford Nanopore long-read technology to sequence the diploid Chrysanthemum nankingense genome, which represents one of the progenitor genomes of domesticated chrysanthemums. Our analysis revealed that the evolution of the C. nankingense genome was driven by bursts of repetitive element expansion and WGD events including a recent WGD that distinguishes chrysanthemum from sunflower, which diverged from chrysanthemum approximately 38.8 million years ago. Variations of ornamental and medicinal traits in chrysanthemums are linked to the expansion of candidate gene families by duplication events including paralogous gene duplication. Collectively, our study of the assembled reference genome offers new knowledge and resources to dissect the history and pattern of evolution and diversification of chrysanthemum plants, and also to accelerate their breeding and improvement.",30342096,,10.1016/j.molp.2018.10.003,82
Long-Read Based Novel Sequence Insertion Detection With rCANID,"Novel sequence insertion (NSI) is an essential category of genome structural variations (SVs), which represents DNA segments absent from the reference genome assembly. It has important biological functions and strong correlation with phenotypes and diseases. The rapid development of long-read sequencing technologies provides the opportunities to discover NSIs more sensitively, since the much longer reads are helpful for the assembly and location of the novel sequences. However, most of state-of-the-art long-read based SV detection approaches are in generic design to detect various kinds of SVs, and they are either not suited to detect NSIs or computationally expensive. Herein, we propose read clustering and assembly-based novel insertion detection tool (rCANID). It applies tailored chimerically aligned and unaligned read clustering and lightweight local assembly methods to reconstruct inserted sequences with low computational cost. Benchmarks on both simulated and real datasets demonstrate that rCANID can discover NSIs sensitively and efficiently, especially for NSI events with long inserted sequences which is still a non-trivial task for state-of-the-art approaches. With its good NSI detection ability, rCANID is suited to be integrated into computational pipelines to play important roles in many cutting-edge genomics studies.",30946672,,10.1109/TNB.2019.2908438,2
"Identification and characterization of repeat expansions in neurological disorders: Methodologies, tools, and strategies","Tandem repeats are a common, highly polymorphic class of variation in human genomes. Their expansion beyond a pathogenic threshold is a process that contributes to a wide range of neurological and neuromuscular genetic disorders, of which over 60 have been identified to date. The last few years have seen a resurgence in repeat expansion discovery propelled by technological advancements, enabling the identification of over 20 novel repeat expansion disorders. These expansions can occur in coding or non-coding regions of genes, resulting in a range of pathogenic mechanisms. In this article, we review strategies, tools and methods that can be used for efficient detection and characterization of known repeat expansions and identification of new expansion disorders. Features that can be used to prioritize repeat expansions include anticipation, which is characterized by increased severity or earlier onset of symptoms across generations, and founder effects, which contribute to higher prevalence rates in certain populations. Classical technologies such as Southern blotting, repeat-primed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and long-range PCR can still be used to detect known repeat expansions, although they usually have significant limitations linked to the absence of sequence context. Targeted sequencing of known expansions using either long-range PCR or CRISPR-Cas9 enrichment combined with long-read sequencing or adaptive nanopore sampling are usually better but more expensive alternatives. The development of new bioinformatics tools applied to short-read genome data can now be used to detect repeat expansions either in a targeted manner or at the genome-wide level. In addition, technological advances, particularly long-read technologies such as optical genome mapping (Bionano Genomics), Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) and Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) HiFi sequencing, offer promising avenues for the detection of repeat expansions. Despite challenges in specific DNA extraction requirements, computation resources needed and data interpretation, these technologies have an immense potential to advance our understanding of repeat expansion disorders and improve diagnostic accuracy.",38594146,,10.1016/j.neurol.2024.03.005,0
Long-read sequencing uncovers a complex transcriptome topology in varicella zoster virus,"Background:Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is a human pathogenic alphaherpesvirus harboring a relatively large DNA molecule. The VZV transcriptome has already been analyzed by microarray and short-read sequencing analyses. However, both approaches have substantial limitations when used for structural characterization of transcript isoforms, even if supplemented with primer extension or other techniques. Among others, they are inefficient in distinguishing between embedded RNA molecules, transcript isoforms, including splice and length variants, as well as between alternative polycistronic transcripts. It has been demonstrated in several studies that long-read sequencing is able to circumvent these problems.Results:In this work, we report the analysis of the VZV lytic transcriptome using the Oxford Nanopore Technologies sequencing platform. These investigations have led to the identification of 114 novel transcripts, including mRNAs, non-coding RNAs, polycistronic RNAs and complex transcripts, as well as 10 novel spliced transcripts and 25 novel transcription start site isoforms and transcription end site isoforms. A novel class of transcripts, the nroRNAs are described in this study. These transcripts are encoded by the genomic region located in close vicinity to the viral replication origin. We also show that the ORF63 exhibits a complex structural variation encompassing the splice sites of VZV latency transcripts. Additionally, we have detected RNA editing in a novel non-coding RNA molecule.Conclusions:Our investigations disclosed a composite transcriptomic architecture of VZV, including the discovery of novel RNA molecules and transcript isoforms, as well as a complex meshwork of transcriptional read-throughs and overlaps. The results represent a substantial advance in the annotation of the VZV transcriptome and in understanding the molecular biology of the herpesviruses in general.",30514211,PMC6280550,10.1186/s12864-018-5267-8,37
Whole-genome long-read sequencing downsampling and its effect on variant-calling precision and recall,"Advances in long-read sequencing (LRS) technologies continue to make whole-genome sequencing more complete, affordable, and accurate. LRS provides significant advantages over short-read sequencing approaches, including phased de novo genome assembly, access to previously excluded genomic regions, and discovery of more complex structural variants (SVs) associated with disease. Limitations remain with respect to cost, scalability, and platform-dependent read accuracy and the tradeoffs between sequence coverage and sensitivity of variant discovery are important experimental considerations for the application of LRS. We compare the genetic variant-calling precision and recall of Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) and Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) HiFi platforms over a range of sequence coverages. For read-based applications, LRS sensitivity begins to plateau around 12-fold coverage with a majority of variants called with reasonable accuracy (F1score above 0.5), and both platforms perform well for SV detection. Genome assembly increases variant-calling precision and recall of SVs and indels in HiFi data sets with HiFi outperforming ONT in quality as measured by the F1score of assembly-based variant call sets. While both technologies continue to evolve, our work offers guidance to design cost-effective experimental strategies that do not compromise on discovering novel biology.",38190646,PMC10760522,10.1101/gr.278070.123,3
Unveiling the complexity of the maize transcriptome by single-molecule long-read sequencing,"Zea mays is an important genetic model for elucidating transcriptional networks. Uncertainties about the complete structure of mRNA transcripts limit the progress of research in this system. Here, using single-molecule sequencing technology, we produce 111,151 transcripts from 6 tissues capturing ∼70% of the genes annotated in maize RefGen_v3 genome. A large proportion of transcripts (57%) represent novel, sometimes tissue-specific, isoforms of known genes and 3% correspond to novel gene loci. In other cases, the identified transcripts have improved existing gene models. Averaging across all six tissues, 90% of the splice junctions are supported by short reads from matched tissues. In addition, we identified a large number of novel long non-coding RNAs and fusion transcripts and found that DNA methylation plays an important role in generating various isoforms. Our results show that characterization of the maize B73 transcriptome is far from complete, and that maize gene expression is more complex than previously thought.",27339440,PMC4931018,10.1038/ncomms11708,259
"Erysipelothrix amsterdamensissp. nov., associated with mortalities among endangered seabirds","Infectious diseases threaten endangered species, particularly in small isolated populations. Seabird populations on the remote Amsterdam Island in the Indian Ocean have been in decline for the past three decades, with avian cholera caused byPasteurella multocidaproposed as the primary driver. However,Erysipelothrixspecies have also been sporadically detected from albatrosses on Amsterdam Island and may be contributing to some of the observed mortality. In this study, we genomically characterized 16Erysipelothrixspecies isolates obtained from three Indian yellow-nosed albatross (Thalassarche carteri) chick carcasses in 2019. Histological analyses suggest that they died of bacterial septicaemia. Two isolates were sequenced using both Illumina short-read and MinION long-read approaches, which - following hybrid assembly - resulted in closed circular genomes. Mapping of Illumina reads from the remaining isolates to one of these new reference genomes revealed that all 16 isolates were closely related, with a maximum of 13 nucleotide differences distinguishing any pair of isolates. The nucleotide diversity of isolates obtained from the same or different carcasses was similar, suggesting all three chicks were likely infected from a common source. These genomes were compared with a global collection of genomes fromErysipelothrix rhusiopathiaeand other species from the same genus. The isolates from albatrosses were phylogenetically distinct, sharing a most recent common ancestor withE. rhusiopathiae. Based on phylogenomic analysis and standard thresholds for average nucleotide identity and digital DNA-DNA hybridization, these isolates represent a novelErysipelothrixspecies, for which we propose the nameErysipelothrix amsterdamensissp. nov. The type strain is A18Y020dT(=CIP 112216T=DSM 115297T). The implications of this bacterium for albatross conservation will require further study.",38359084,,10.1099/ijsem.0.006264,0
IMOS: improved Meta-aligner and Minimap2 On Spark,"Background:Long reads provide valuable information regarding the sequence composition of genomes. Long reads are usually very noisy which renders their alignments on the reference genome a daunting task. It may take days to process datasets enough to sequence a human genome on a single node. Hence, it is of primary importance to have an aligner which can operate on distributed clusters of computers with high performance in accuracy and speed.Results:In this paper, we presented IMOS, an aligner for mapping noisy long reads to the reference genome. It can be used on a single node as well as on distributed nodes. In its single-node mode, IMOS is an Improved version of Meta-aligner (IM) enhancing both its accuracy and speed. IM is up to 6x faster than the original Meta-aligner. It is also implemented to run IM and Minimap2 on Apache Spark for deploying on a cluster of nodes. Moreover, multi-node IMOS is faster than SparkBWA while executing both IM (1.5x) and Minimap2 (25x).Conclusion:In this paper, we purposed an architecture for mapping long reads to a reference. Due to its implementation, IMOS speed can increase almost linearly with respect to the number of nodes in a cluster. Also, it is a multi-platform application able to operate on Linux, Windows, and macOS.",30678641,PMC6345043,10.1186/s12859-018-2592-5,4
A Novel Framework for Characterizing Genomic Haplotype Diversity in the Human Immunoglobulin Heavy Chain Locus,"An incomplete ascertainment of genetic variation within the highly polymorphic immunoglobulin heavy chain locus (IGH) has hindered our ability to define genetic factors that influence antibody-mediated processes. Due to locus complexity, standard high-throughput approaches have failed to accurately and comprehensively capture IGH polymorphism. As a result, the locus has only been fully characterized two times, severely limiting our knowledge of human IGH diversity. Here, we combine targeted long-read sequencing with a novel bioinformatics tool, IGenotyper, to fully characterize IGH variation in a haplotype-specific manner. We apply this approach to eight human samples, including a haploid cell line and two mother-father-child trios, and demonstrate the ability to generate high-quality assemblies (>98% complete and >99% accurate), genotypes, and gene annotations, identifying 2 novel structural variants and 15 novel IGH alleles. We show multiplexing allows for scaling of the approach without impacting data quality, and that our genotype call sets are more accurate than short-read (>35% increase in true positives and >97% decrease in false-positives) and array/imputation-based datasets. This framework establishes a desperately needed foundation for leveraging IG genomic data to study population-level variation in antibody-mediated immunity, critical for bettering our understanding of disease risk, and responses to vaccines and therapeutics.",33072076,PMC7539625,10.3389/fimmu.2020.02136,33
Strainberry: automated strain separation in low-complexity metagenomes using long reads,"High-throughput short-read metagenomics has enabled large-scale species-level analysis and functional characterization of microbial communities. Microbiomes often contain multiple strains of the same species, and different strains have been shown to have important differences in their functional roles. Recent advances on long-read based methods enabled accurate assembly of bacterial genomes from complex microbiomes and an as-yet-unrealized opportunity to resolve strains. Here we present Strainberry, a metagenome assembly pipeline that performs strain separation in single-sample low-complexity metagenomes and that relies uniquely on long-read data. We benchmarked Strainberry on mock communities for which it produces strain-resolved assemblies with near-complete reference coverage and 99.9% base accuracy. We also applied Strainberry on real datasets for which it improved assemblies generating 20-118% additional genomic material than conventional metagenome assemblies on individual strain genomes. We show that Strainberry is also able to refine microbial diversity in a complex microbiome, with complete separation of strain genomes. We anticipate this work to be a starting point for further methodological improvements on strain-resolved metagenome assembly in environments of higher complexities.",34301928,PMC8302730,10.1038/s41467-021-24515-9,19
Mapping the phylogeny and lineage history of geographically distinct BCG vaccine strains,"The bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine has been in use for prevention of tuberculosis for over a century. It remains the only widely available tuberculosis vaccine and its protective efficacy has varied across geographical regions. Since it was developed, the BCG vaccine strain has been shared across different laboratories around the world, where use of differing culture methods has resulted in genetically distinct strains over time. Whilst differing BCG vaccine efficacy around the world is well documented, and the reasons for this may be multifactorial, it has been hypothesized that genetic differences in BCG vaccine strains contribute to this variation. Isolates from an historic archive of lyophilized BCG strains were regrown, DNA was extracted and then whole-genome sequenced using Oxford Nanopore Technologies. The resulting whole-genome data were plotted on a phylogenetic tree and analysed to identify the presence or absence of regions of difference (RDs) and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) relating to virulence, growth and cell wall structure. Of 50 strains available, 36 were revived in culture and 39 were sequenced. Morphology differed between the strains distributed before and after 1934. There was phylogenetic association amongst certain geographically classified strains, most notably BCG-Russia, BCG-Japan and BCG-Danish. RD2, RD171 and RD713 deletions were associated with late strains (seeded after 1927). When mapped to BCG-Pasteur 1172, the SNPs insigK,plaA,mmaA3andeccC5were associated with early strains. Whilst BCG-Russia, BCG-Japan and BCG-Danish showed strong geographical isolate clustering, the late strains, including BCG-Pasteur, showed more variation. A wide range of SNPs were seen within geographically classified strains, and as much intra-strain variation as between-strain variation was seen. The date of distribution from the original Pasteur laboratory (early pre-1927 or late post-1927) gave the strongest association with genetic differences in regions of difference and virulence-related SNPs, which agrees with the previous literature.",37526642,PMC10483423,10.1099/mgen.0.001077,0
Short-read and long-read RNA sequencing of mouse hematopoietic stem cells at bulk and single-cell levels,"Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) lie at the top of the differentiation hierarchy. Although HSC and their immediate downstream, multipotent progenitors (MPP) have full multilineage differentiation capacity, only long-term (LT-) HSC has the capacity of long-term self-renewal. The heterogeneity within the HSC population is gradually acknowledged with the development of single-cell RNA sequencing and lineage tracing technologies. Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulations play important roles in controlling the differentiation and self-renewal capacity within HSC population. Here we report a dataset comprising short- and long-read RNA sequencing for mouse long- and short-term HSC and MPP at bulk and single-cell levels. We demonstrate that integrating short- and long-read sequencing can facilitate the identification and quantification of known and unannotated isoforms. Thus, this dataset provides a groundwork for comprehensive and comparative studies on transcriptional diversity and heterogeneity within different HSC cell types.",34845251,PMC8630105,10.1038/s41597-021-01078-4,1
The changing face of genome assemblies: Guidance on achieving high-quality reference genomes,"The quality of genome assemblies has improved rapidly in recent years due to continual advances in sequencing technology, assembly approaches, and quality control. In the field of molecular ecology, this has led to the development of exceptional quality genome assemblies that will be important long-term resources for broader studies into ecological, conservation, evolutionary, and population genomics of naturally occurring species. Moreover, the extent to which a single reference genome represents the diversity within a species varies: pan-genomes will become increasingly important ecological genomics resources, particularly in systems found to have considerable presence-absence variation in their functional content. Here, we highlight advances in technology that have raised the bar for genome assembly and provide guidance on standards to achieve exceptional quality reference genomes. Key recommendations include the following: (a) Genome assemblies should include long-read sequencing except in rare cases where it is effectively impossible to acquire adequately preserved samples needed for high molecular weight DNA standards. (b) At least one scaffolding approach should be included with genome assembly such as Hi-C or optical mapping. (c) Genome assemblies should be carefully evaluated, this may involve utilising short read data for genome polishing, error correction, k-mer analyses, and estimating the percent of reads that map back to an assembly. Finally, a genome assembly is most valuable if all data and methods are made publicly available and the utility of a genome for further studies is verified through examples. While these recommendations are based on current technology, we anticipate that future advances will push the field further and the molecular ecology community should continue to adopt new approaches that attain the highest quality genome assemblies.",33326691,,10.1111/1755-0998.13312,25
Long-read genome sequencing identifies causal structural variation in a Mendelian disease,"PurposeCurrent clinical genomics assays primarily utilize short-read sequencing (SRS), but SRS has limited ability to evaluate repetitive regions and structural variants. Long-read sequencing (LRS) has complementary strengths, and we aimed to determine whether LRS could offer a means to identify overlooked genetic variation in patients undiagnosed by SRS.MethodsWe performed low-coverage genome LRS to identify structural variants in a patient who presented with multiple neoplasia and cardiac myxomata, in whom the results of targeted clinical testing and genome SRS were negative.ResultsThis LRS approach yielded 6,971 deletions and 6,821 insertions > 50 bp. Filtering for variants that are absent in an unrelated control and overlap a disease gene coding exon identified three deletions and three insertions. One of these, a heterozygous 2,184 bp deletion, overlaps the first coding exon of PRKAR1A, which is implicated in autosomal dominant Carney complex. RNA sequencing demonstrated decreased PRKAR1A expression. The deletion was classified as pathogenic based on guidelines for interpretation of sequence variants.ConclusionThis first successful application of genome LRS to identify a pathogenic variant in a patient suggests that LRS has significant potential for the identification of disease-causing structural variation. Larger studies will ultimately be required to evaluate the potential clinical utility of LRS.",28640241,PMC5741540,10.1038/gim.2017.86,119
Whole genome sequencing of Borrelia miyamotoi isolate Izh-4: reference for a complex bacterial genome,"Background:The genus Borrelia comprises spirochaetal bacteria maintained in natural transmission cycles by tick vectors and vertebrate reservoir hosts. The main groups are represented by a species complex including the causative agents of Lyme borreliosis and relapsing fever group Borrelia. Borrelia miyamotoi belongs to the relapsing fever group of spirochetes and forms distinct populations in North America, Asia, and Europe. As all Borrelia species B. miyamotoi possess an unusual and complex genome consisting of a linear chromosome and a number of linear and circular plasmids. The species is considered an emerging human pathogen and an increasing number of human cases are being described in the Northern hemisphere. The aim of this study was to produce a high quality reference genome that will facilitate future studies into genetic differences between different populations and the genome plasticity of B. miyamotoi.Results:We used multiple available sequencing methods, including Pacific Bioscience single-molecule real-time technology (SMRT) and Oxford Nanopore technology (ONT) supplemented with highly accurate Illumina sequences, to explore the suitability for whole genome assembly of the Russian B. miyamotoi isolate, Izh-4. Plasmids were typed according to their potential plasmid partitioning genes (PF32, 49, 50, 57/62). Comparing and combining results of both long-read (SMRT and ONT) and short-read methods (Illumina), we determined that the genome of the isolate Izh-4 consisted of one linear chromosome, 12 linear and two circular plasmids. Whilst the majority of plasmids had corresponding contigs in the Asian B. miyamotoi isolate FR64b, there were only four that matched plasmids of the North American isolate CT13-2396, indicating differences between B. miyamotoi populations. Several plasmids, e.g. lp41, lp29, lp23, and lp24, were found to carry variable major proteins. Amongst those were variable large proteins (Vlp) subtype Vlp-α, Vlp-γ, Vlp-δ and also Vlp-β. Phylogenetic analysis of common plasmids types showed the uniqueness in Russian/Asian isolates of B. miyamotoi compared to other isolates.Conclusions:We here describe the genome of a Russian B. miyamotoi clinical isolate, providing a solid basis for future comparative genomics of B. miyamotoi isolates. This will be a great impetus for further basic, molecular and epidemiological research on this emerging tick-borne pathogen.",31906865,PMC6945570,10.1186/s12864-019-6388-4,18
Targeted long-read sequencing identifies missing disease-causing variation,"Despite widespread clinical genetic testing, many individuals with suspected genetic conditions lack a precise diagnosis, limiting their opportunity to take advantage of state-of-the-art treatments. In some cases, testing reveals difficult-to-evaluate structural differences, candidate variants that do not fully explain the phenotype, single pathogenic variants in recessive disorders, or no variants in genes of interest. Thus, there is a need for better tools to identify a precise genetic diagnosis in individuals when conventional testing approaches have been exhausted. We performed targeted long-read sequencing (T-LRS) using adaptive sampling on the Oxford Nanopore platform on 40 individuals, 10 of whom lacked a complete molecular diagnosis. We computationally targeted up to 151 Mbp of sequence per individual and searched for pathogenic substitutions, structural variants, and methylation differences using a single data source. We detected all genomic aberrations-including single-nucleotide variants, copy number changes, repeat expansions, and methylation differences-identified by prior clinical testing. In 8/8 individuals with complex structural rearrangements, T-LRS enabled more precise resolution of the mutation, leading to changes in clinical management in one case. In ten individuals with suspected Mendelian conditions lacking a precise genetic diagnosis, T-LRS identified pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in six and variants of uncertain significance in two others. T-LRS accurately identifies pathogenic structural variants, resolves complex rearrangements, and identifies Mendelian variants not detected by other technologies. T-LRS represents an efficient and cost-effective strategy to evaluate high-priority genes and regions or complex clinical testing results.",34216551,PMC8387463,10.1016/j.ajhg.2021.06.006,79
The use of Oxford Nanopore native barcoding for complete genome assembly,"Background:The Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION(TM) is a mobile DNA sequencer that can produce long read sequences with a short turn-around time. Here we report the first demonstration of single contig genome assembly using Oxford Nanopore native barcoding when applied to a multiplexed library of 12 samples and combined with existing Illumina short read data. This paves the way for the closure of multiple bacterial genomes from a single MinION(TM) sequencing run, given the availability of existing short read data. The strain we used, MHO_001, represents the important community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus lineage USA300.Findings:Using a hybrid assembly of existing short read and barcoded long read sequences from multiplexed data, we completed a genome of the S. aureus USA300 strain MHO_001. The long read data represented only ∼5% to 10% of an average MinION(TM) run (∼7x genomic coverage), but, using standard tools, this was sufficient to complete the circular chromosome of S. aureus strain MHO_001 (2.86 Mb) and two complete plasmids (27 Kb and 3 Kb). Minor differences were noted when compared to USA300 reference genome, USA300_FPR3757, including the translocation, loss, and gain of mobile genetic elements.Conclusion:Here we demonstrate that MinION(TM) reads, multiplexed using native barcoding, can be used in combination with short read data to fully complete a bacterial genome. The ability to complete multiple genomes, for which short read data is already available, from a single MinION(TM) run is set to impact our understanding of accessory genome content, plasmid diversity, and genome rearrangements.",28327913,PMC5467021,10.1093/gigascience/gix001,11
Improved annotation of the domestic pig genome through integration of Iso-Seq and RNA-seq data,"Background:Our understanding of the pig transcriptome is limited. RNA transcript diversity among nine tissues was assessed using poly(A) selected single-molecule long-read isoform sequencing (Iso-seq) and Illumina RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) from a single White cross-bred pig.Results:Across tissues, a total of 67,746 unique transcripts were observed, including 60.5% predicted protein-coding, 36.2% long non-coding RNA and 3.3% nonsense-mediated decay transcripts. On average, 90% of the splice junctions were supported by RNA-seq within tissue. A large proportion (80%) represented novel transcripts, mostly produced by known protein-coding genes (70%), while 17% corresponded to novel genes. On average, four transcripts per known gene (tpg) were identified; an increase over current EBI (1.9 tpg) and NCBI (2.9 tpg) annotations and closer to the number reported in human genome (4.2 tpg). Our new pig genome annotation extended more than 6000 known gene borders (5' end extension, 3' end extension, or both) compared to EBI or NCBI annotations. We validated a large proportion of these extensions by independent pig poly(A) selected 3'-RNA-seq data, or human FANTOM5 Cap Analysis of Gene Expression data. Further, we detected 10,465 novel genes (81% non-coding) not reported in current pig genome annotations. More than 80% of these novel genes had transcripts detected in > 1 tissue. In addition, more than 80% of novel intergenic genes with at least one transcript detected in liver tissue had H3K4me3 or H3K36me3 peaks mapping to their promoter and gene body, respectively, in independent liver chromatin immunoprecipitation data.Conclusions:These validated results show significant improvement over current pig genome annotations.",31064321,PMC6505119,10.1186/s12864-019-5709-y,38
Mapping and phasing of structural variation in patient genomes using nanopore sequencing,"Despite improvements in genomics technology, the detection of structural variants (SVs) from short-read sequencing still poses challenges, particularly for complex variation. Here we analyse the genomes of two patients with congenital abnormalities using the MinION nanopore sequencer and a novel computational pipeline-NanoSV. We demonstrate that nanopore long reads are superior to short reads with regard to detection of de novo chromothripsis rearrangements. The long reads also enable efficient phasing of genetic variations, which we leveraged to determine the parental origin of all de novo chromothripsis breakpoints and to resolve the structure of these complex rearrangements. Additionally, genome-wide surveillance of inherited SVs reveals novel variants, missed in short-read data sets, a large proportion of which are retrotransposon insertions. We provide a first exploration of patient genome sequencing with a nanopore sequencer and demonstrate the value of long-read sequencing in mapping and phasing of SVs for both clinical and research applications.",29109544,PMC5673902,10.1038/s41467-017-01343-4,177
Highly Contiguous Genomes Improve the Understanding of Avian Olfactory Receptor Repertoires,"Third-generation (long-read-based) sequencing technologies are reshaping our understanding of genome structure and function. One of the most persistent challenges in genome biology has been confidently reconstructing radiations of complex gene families. Olfactory receptors (ORs) represent just such a gene family with upward of thousands of receptors in some mammalian taxa. Whereas in birds olfaction was historically an overlooked sensory modality, new studies have revealed an important role for smell. Chromosome-level assemblies for birds allow a new opportunity to characterize patterns of OR diversity among major bird lineages. Previous studies of short-read-based (second-generation) genome assemblies have associated OR gene family size with avian ecology, but such conclusions could be premature especially when new assembly methods reshape our understanding of avian OR evolution. Here we provide a fundamental characterization of OR repertoires in five recent genome assemblies, including the most recent assembly of golden-collared manakin (Manacus vitellinus). We find that short read-based assemblies systematically undercount the avian-specific gamma-c OR subfamily, a subfamily that comprises over 65% of avian OR diversity. Therefore, in contrast to previous studies, we find a high diversity of gamma-c ORs across the avian tree of life. Building on these findings, ongoing sequencing efforts and improved genome assemblies will clarify the relationship between OR diversity and avian ecology.",34180521,,10.1093/icb/icab150,2
A high-quality reference genome for cabbage obtained with SMRT reveals novel genomic features and evolutionary characteristics,"Cabbage (Brassica oleracea var. capitata) is an important vegetable crop widely grown throughout the world, providing plentiful nutrients and health-promoting substances. To facilitate further genetics and genomic studies and crop improvement, we present here a high-quality reference genome for cabbage. We report a de novo genome assembly of the cabbage double-haploid line D134. A combined strategy of single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing, 10× Genomics and chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) produced a high quality cabbage draft genome. The chromosome-level D134 assembly is 529.92 Mb in size, 135 Mb longer than the current 02-12 reference genome, with scaffold N50 length being raised as high as 38 times. We annotated 44,701 high-quality protein-coding genes, and provided full-length transcripts for 45.59% of the total predicted gene models. Moreover, we identified novel genomic features like underrated TEs, as well as gene families and gene family expansions and contractions during B. oleracea evolution. The D134 draft genome is a cabbage reference genome assembled by SMRT long-read sequencing combined with the 10× Genomics and Hi-C technologies for scaffolding. This high-quality cabbage reference genome provides a valuable tool for improvement of Brassica crops.",32709963,PMC7381634,10.1038/s41598-020-69389-x,20
Long-read individual-molecule sequencing reveals CRISPR-induced genetic heterogeneity in human ESCs,"Quantifying the genetic heterogeneity of a cell population is essential to understanding of biological systems. We develop a universal method to label individual DNA molecules for single-base-resolution haplotype-resolved quantitative characterization of diverse types of rare variants, with frequency as low as 4 × 10-5, using both short- or long-read sequencing platforms. It provides the first quantitative evidence of persistent nonrandom large structural variants and an increase in single-nucleotide variants at the on-target locus following repair of double-strand breaks induced by CRISPR-Cas9 in human embryonic stem cells.",32831134,PMC7444080,10.1186/s13059-020-02143-8,14
Long-read and chromosome-scale assembly of the hexaploid wheat genome achieves high resolution for research and breeding,"Background:The sequencing of the wheat (Triticum aestivum) genome has been a methodological challenge for many years owing to its large size (15.5 Gb), repeat content, and hexaploidy. Many initiatives aiming at obtaining a reference genome of cultivar Chinese Spring have been launched in the past years and it was achieved in 2018 as the result of a huge effort to combine short-read sequencing with many other resources. Reference-quality genome assemblies were then produced for other accessions, but the rapid evolution of sequencing technologies offers opportunities to reach high-quality standards at lower cost.Results:Here, we report on an optimized procedure based on long reads produced on the Oxford Nanopore Technology PromethION device to assemble the genome of the French bread wheat cultivar Renan.Conclusions:We provide the most contiguous chromosome-scale assembly of a bread wheat genome to date. Coupled with an annotation based on RNA-sequencing data, this resource will be valuable for the crop community and will facilitate the rapid selection of agronomically important traits. We also provide a framework to generate high-quality assemblies of complex genomes using ONT.",35482491,PMC9049114,10.1093/gigascience/giac034,18
"Two reads to rule them all: Nanopore long read-guided assembly of the iconic Christmas Island red crab, Gecarcoidea natalis (Pocock, 1888), mitochondrial genome and the challenges of AT-rich mitogenomes","Despite recent advances in sequencing technology, a complete mitogenome assembly is still unavailable for the gecarcinid land crabs that include the iconic Christmas Island red crab (Gecarcoidea natalis) which is known for its high population density, annual mass breeding migration and ecological significance in maintaining rainforest structure. Using sequences generated from Nanopore and Illumina platforms, we assembled the complete mitogenome for G. natalis, the first for the genus and only second for the family Gecarcinidae. Nine Nanopore long reads representing 0.15% of the sequencing output from an overnight MinION Nanopore run were aligned to the mitogenome. Two of them were >10 kb and combined are sufficient to span the entire G. natalis mitogenome. The use of Illumina genome skimming data only resulted in a fragmented assembly that can be attributed to low to zero sequencing coverage in multiple high AT-regions including the mitochondrial protein-coding genes (NAD4 and NAD5), 16S ribosomal rRNA and non-coding control region. Supplementing the mitogenome assembly with previously acquired transcriptome dataset containing high abundance of mitochondrial transcripts improved mitogenome sequence coverage and assembly reliability. We then inferred the phylogeny of the Eubrachyura using Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian approaches, confirming the phylogenetic placement of G. natalis within the family Gecarcinidae based on whole mitogenome alignment. Given the substantial impact of AT-content on mitogenome assembly and the value of complete mitogenomes in phylogenetic and comparative studies, we recommend that future mitogenome sequencing projects consider generating a modest amount of Nanopore long reads to facilitate the closing of problematic and fragmented mitogenome assemblies.",30928201,,10.1016/j.margen.2019.02.002,8
A method for multiplexed full-length single-molecule sequencing of the human mitochondrial genome,"Methods to reconstruct the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence using short-read sequencing come with an inherent bias due to amplification and mapping. They can fail to determine the phase of variants, to capture multiple deletions and to cover the mitochondrial genome evenly. Here we describe a method to target, multiplex and sequence at high coverage full-length human mitochondrial genomes as native single-molecules, utilizing the RNA-guided DNA endonuclease Cas9. Combining Cas9 induced breaks, that define the mtDNA beginning and end of the sequencing reads, as barcodes, we achieve high demultiplexing specificity and delineation of the full-length of the mtDNA, regardless of the structural variant pattern. The long-read sequencing data is analysed with a pipeline where our custom-developed software, baldur, efficiently detects single nucleotide heteroplasmy to below 1%, physically determines phase and can accurately disentangle complex deletions. Our workflow is a tool for studying mtDNA variation and will accelerate mitochondrial research.",36202811,PMC9537161,10.1038/s41467-022-33530-3,7
Identification of grapevine clones via high-throughput amplicon sequencing: a proof-of-concept study,"Wine cultivars are available to growers in multiple clonal selections with agronomic and enological differences. Phenotypic differences between clones originated from somatic mutations that accrued over thousands of asexual propagation cycles. Genetic diversity between grape cultivars remains unexplored, and tools to discriminate unequivocally clones have been lacking. This study aimed to uncover genetic variations among a group of clonal selections of 4 important Vitis vinifera cultivars: Cabernet sauvignon, Sauvignon blanc, Chardonnay, and Merlot, and use this information to develop genetic markers to discriminate the clones of these cultivars. We sequenced with short-read sequencing technology the genomes of 18 clones, including biological replicates for a total of 46 genomes. Sequences were aligned to their respective cultivar's reference genome for variant calling. We used reference genomes of Cabernet sauvignon, Chardonnay, and Merlot and developed a de novo genome assembly of Sauvignon blanc using long-read sequencing. On average, 4 million variants were detected for each clone, with 74.2% being single nucleotide variants and 25.8% being small insertions or deletions (InDel). The frequency of these variants was consistent across all clones. From these variants, we validated 46 clonal markers using high-throughput amplicon sequencing for 77.7% of the evaluated clones, most of them small InDel. These results represent an advance in grapevine genotyping strategies and will benefit the viticulture industry for the characterization and identification of the plant material.",37395733,PMC10468313,10.1093/g3journal/jkad145,1
Analysis of resistance genes of clinical Pannonibacter phragmitetus strain 31801 by complete genome sequencing,"To clarify the resistance mechanisms of Pannonibacter phragmitetus 31801, isolated from the blood of a liver abscess patient, at the genomic level, we performed whole genomic sequencing using a PacBio RS II single-molecule real-time long-read sequencer. Bioinformatic analysis of the resulting sequence was then carried out to identify any possible resistance genes. Analyses included Basic Local Alignment Search Tool searches against the Antibiotic Resistance Genes Database, ResFinder analysis of the genome sequence, and Resistance Gene Identifier analysis within the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database. Prophages, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR), and other putative virulence factors were also identified using PHAST, CRISPRfinder, and the Virulence Factors Database, respectively. The circular chromosome and single plasmid of P. phragmitetus 31801 contained multiple antibiotic resistance genes, including those coding for three different types of β-lactamase [NPS β-lactamase (EC 3.5.2.6), β-lactamase class C, and a metal-dependent hydrolase of β-lactamase superfamily I]. In addition, genes coding for subunits of several multidrug-resistance efflux pumps were identified, including those targeting macrolides (adeJ, cmeB), tetracycline (acrB, adeAB), fluoroquinolones (acrF, ceoB), and aminoglycosides (acrD, amrB, ceoB, mexY, smeB). However, apart from the tripartite macrolide efflux pump macAB-tolC, the genome did not appear to contain the complete complement of subunit genes required for production of most of the major multidrug-resistance efflux pumps.",29761214,,10.1007/s00203-018-1522-2,1
"De Novo Assembly of Human Herpes Virus Type 1 (HHV-1) Genome, Mining of Non-Canonical Structures and Detection of Novel Drug-Resistance Mutations Using Short- and Long-Read Next Generation Sequencing Technologies","Human herpesvirus type 1 (HHV-1) has a large double-stranded DNA genome of approximately 152 kbp that is structurally complex and GC-rich. This makes the assembly of HHV-1 whole genomes from short-read sequencing data technically challenging. To improve the assembly of HHV-1 genomes we have employed a hybrid genome assembly protocol using data from two sequencing technologies: the short-read Roche 454 and the long-read Oxford Nanopore MinION sequencers. We sequenced 18 HHV-1 cell culture-isolated clinical specimens collected from immunocompromised patients undergoing antiviral therapy. The susceptibility of the samples to several antivirals was determined by plaque reduction assay. Hybrid genome assembly resulted in a decrease in the number of contigs in 6 out of 7 samples and an increase in N(G)50 and N(G)75 of all 7 samples sequenced by both technologies. The approach also enhanced the detection of non-canonical contigs including a rearrangement between the unique (UL) and repeat (T/IRL) sequence regions of one sample that was not detectable by assembly of 454 reads alone. We detected several known and novel resistance-associated mutations in UL23 and UL30 genes. Genome-wide genetic variability ranged from <1% to 53% of amino acids in each gene exhibiting at least one substitution within the pool of samples. The UL23 gene had one of the highest genetic variabilities at 35.2% in keeping with its role in development of drug resistance. The assembly of accurate, full-length HHV-1 genomes will be useful in determining genetic determinants of drug resistance, virulence, pathogenesis and viral evolution. The numerous, complex repeat regions of the HHV-1 genome currently remain a barrier towards this goal.",27309375,PMC4910999,10.1371/journal.pone.0157600,25
Accessing a Russian Wheat Aphid Resistance Gene in Bread Wheat by Long-Read Technologies,"Russian wheat aphid (RWA) ( Kurdjumov) is a serious invasive pest of small-grain cereals and many grass species. An efficient strategy to defy aphid attacks is to identify sources of natural resistance and transfer resistance genes into susceptible crop cultivars. Revealing the genes helps understand plant defense mechanisms and engineer plants with durable resistance to the pest. To date, more than 15 RWA resistance genes have been identified in wheat ( L.) but none of them has been cloned. Previously, we genetically mapped the RWA resistance gene into an interval of 0.83 cM on the short arm of chromosome 7D and spanned it with five bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones. Here, we used a targeted strategy combining traditional approaches toward gene cloning (genetic mapping and sequencing of BAC clones) with novel technologies, including optical mapping and long-read nanopore sequencing. The latter, with reads spanning the entire length of a BAC insert, enabled us to assemble the whole region, a task that was not achievable with short reads. Long-read optical mapping validated the DNA sequence in the interval and revealed a difference in the locus organization between resistant and susceptible genotypes. The complete and accurate sequence of the region facilitated the identification of new markers and precise annotation of the interval, revealing six high-confidence genes. Identification of as the most likely candidate opens an avenue for its validation through functional genomics approaches.",31290924,,10.3835/plantgenome2018.09.0065,4
Draft Genome of the Rice Coral Montipora capitata Obtained from Linked-Read Sequencing,"The rice coral, Montipora capitata, is widely distributed throughout the Indo-Pacific and comprises one of the most important reef-building species in the Hawaiian Islands. Here, we describe a de novo assembly of its genome based on a linked-read sequencing approach developed by 10x Genomics. The final draft assembly consisted of 27,870 scaffolds with a N50 size of 186 kb and contained a fairly complete set (81%) of metazoan benchmarking (BUSCO) genes. Based on haploid assembly size (615 Mb) and read k-mer profiles, we estimated the genome size to fall between 600 and 700 Mb, although the high fraction of repetitive sequence introduced considerable uncertainty. Repeat analysis indicated that 42% of the assembly consisted of interspersed, mostly unclassified repeats, and almost 3% tandem repeats. We also identified 36,691 protein-coding genes with a median coding sequence length of 807 bp, together spanning 7% of the assembly. The high repeat content and heterozygosity of the genome proved a challenging scenario for assembly, requiring additional steps to merge haplotypes and resulting in a higher than expected fragmentation at the scaffold level. Despite these challenges, the assembly turned out to be comparable in most quality measures to that of other available coral genomes while being considerably more cost-effective, especially with respect to long-read sequencing methods. Provided high-molecular-weight DNA is available, linked-read technology may thus serve as a valuable alternative capable of providing quality genome assemblies of nonmodel organisms.",31243452,PMC6668484,10.1093/gbe/evz135,17
"UltraSEQ, a Universal Bioinformatic Platform for Information-Based Clinical Metagenomics and Beyond","Applied metagenomics is a powerful emerging capability enabling the untargeted detection of pathogens, and its application in clinical diagnostics promises to alleviate the limitations of current targeted assays. While metagenomics offers a hypothesis-free approach to identify any pathogen, including unculturable and potentially novel pathogens, its application in clinical diagnostics has so far been limited by workflow-specific requirements, computational constraints, and lengthy expert review requirements. To address these challenges, we developed UltraSEQ, a first-of-its-kind accurate and scalable metagenomic bioinformatic tool for potential clinical diagnostics and biosurveillance utility. Here, we present the results of the evaluation of our novel UltraSEQ pipeline using anin silico-synthesized metagenome, mock microbial community data sets, and publicly available clinical data sets from samples of different infection types, including both short-read and long-read sequencing data. Our results show that UltraSEQ successfully detected all expected species across the tree of life in thein silicosample and detected all 10 bacterial and fungal species in the mock microbial community data set. For clinical data sets, even without requiring data set-specific configuration setting changes, background sample subtraction, or prior sample information, UltraSEQ achieved an overall accuracy of 91%. Furthermore, as an initial demonstration with a limited patient sample set, we show UltraSEQ's ability to provide antibiotic resistance and virulence factor genotypes that are consistent with phenotypic results. Taken together, the above-described results demonstrate that the UltraSEQ platform offers a transformative approach for microbial and metagenomic sample characterization, employing a biologically informed detection logic, deep metadata, and a flexible system architecture for the classification and characterization of taxonomic origin, gene function, and user-defined functions, including disease-causing infections.IMPORTANCETraditional clinical microbiology-based diagnostic tests rely on targeted methods that can detect only one to a few preselected organisms or slow, culture-based methods. Although widely used today, these methods have several limitations, resulting in rates of cases of an unknown etiology of infection of >50% for several disease types. Massive developments in sequencing technologies have made it possible to apply metagenomic methods to clinical diagnostics, but current offerings are limited to a specific disease type or sequencer workflow and/or require laboratory-specific controls. The limitations associated with current clinical metagenomic offerings result from the fact that the backend bioinformatic pipelines are optimized for the specific parameters described above, resulting in an excess of unmaintained, redundant, and niche tools that lack standardization and explainable outputs. In this paper, we demonstrate that UltraSEQ uses a novel, information-based approach that enables accurate, evidence-based predictions for diagnosis as well as the functional characterization of a sample.",37039637,PMC10269449,10.1128/spectrum.04160-22,0
A 12-kb structural variation in progressive myoclonic epilepsy was newly identified by long-read whole-genome sequencing,"We report a family with progressive myoclonic epilepsy who underwent whole-exome sequencing but was negative for pathogenic variants. Similar clinical courses of a devastating neurodegenerative phenotype of two affected siblings were highly suggestive of a genetic etiology, which indicates that the survey of genetic variation by whole-exome sequencing was not comprehensive. To investigate the presence of a variant that remained unrecognized by standard genetic testing, PacBio long-read sequencing was performed. Structural variant (SV) detection using low-coverage (6×) whole-genome sequencing called 17,165 SVs (7,216 deletions and 9,949 insertions). Our SV selection narrowed down potential candidates to only five SVs (two deletions and three insertions) on the genes tagged with autosomal recessive phenotypes. Among them, a 12.4-kb deletion involving the CLN6 gene was the top candidate because its homozygous abnormalities cause neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis. This deletion included the initiation codon and was found in a GC-rich region containing multiple repetitive elements. These results indicate the presence of a causal variant in a difficult-to-sequence region and suggest that such variants that remain enigmatic after the application of current whole-exome sequencing technology could be uncovered by unbiased application of long-read whole-genome sequencing.",30760880,,10.1038/s10038-019-0569-5,30
Chromosomal DNA sequences of the Pacific saury genome: versatile resources for fishery science and comparative biology,"Pacific saury (Cololabis saira) is a commercially important small pelagic fish species in Asia. In this study, we conducted the first-ever whole genome sequencing of this species, with single molecule, real-time (SMRT) sequencing technology. The obtained high-fidelity (HiFi) long-read sequence data, which amount to ~30-folds of its haploid genome size that was measured with quantitative PCR (1.17 Gb), were assembled into contigs. Scaffolding with Hi-C reads yielded a whole genome assembly containing 24 chromosome-scale sequences, with a scaffold N50 length of 47.7 Mb. Screening of repetitive elements including telomeric repeats was performed to characterize possible factors that need to be resolved towards 'telomere-to-telomere' sequencing. The larger genome size than in medaka, a close relative in Beloniformes, is at least partly explained by larger repetitive element quantity, which is reflected in more abundant tRNAs, in the Pacific saury genome. Protein-coding regions were predicted using transcriptome data, which resulted in 22,274 components. Retrieval of Pacific saury homologs of aquaporin (AQP) genes known from other teleost fishes validated high completeness and continuity of the genome assembly. These resources are available at https://treethinkers.nig.ac.jp/saira/ and will assist various molecular-level studies in fishery science and comparative biology.",38451834,PMC11090075,10.1093/dnares/dsae004,0
De NovoGenome Assembly and Comparative Genomics of the Barley Leaf Rust PathogenPuccinia hordeiIdentifies Candidates for Three Avirulence Genes,"Puccinia hordei(Ph) is a damaging pathogen of barley throughout the world. Despite its importance, almost nothing is known about the genomics of this pathogen, and a reference genome is lacking. In this study, the first reference genome was assembled for an Australian isolate ofPh(""Ph560"") using long-read SMRT sequencing. A total of 838 contigs were assembled, with a total size of 207 Mbp. This included both haplotype collapsed and separated regions, consistent with an estimated haploid genome size of about 150Mbp. An annotation pipeline that combined RNA-Seq ofPh-infected host tissues and homology to proteins from four otherPucciniaspecies predicted 25,543 gene models of which 1,450 genes were classified as encoding secreted proteins based on the prediction of a signal peptide and no transmembrane domain. Genome resequencing using short-read technology was conducted for four additional Australian strains,Ph612,Ph626,Ph608 andPh584, which are considered to be simple mutational derivatives ofPh560 with added virulence to one or two of three barley leaf rust resistance genes (viz. Rph3,Rph13andRph19). To identify candidate genes for the corresponding avirulence genesAvrRph3,AvrRph13andAvrRph19, genetic variation in predicted secreted protein genes between the strains was correlated to the virulence profiles of each, identifying 35, 29 and 46 candidates forAvrRph13,AvrRph3andAvrRph19, respectively. The identification of these candidate genes provides a strong foundation for future efforts to isolate these three avirulence genes, investigate their biological properties, and develop new diagnostic tests for monitoring pathogen virulence.",31444296,PMC6778787,10.1534/g3.119.400450,8
Leveraging long read sequencing from a single individual to provide a comprehensive resource for benchmarking variant calling methods,"A high-confidence, comprehensive human variant set is critical in assessing accuracy of sequencing algorithms, which are crucial in precision medicine based on high-throughput sequencing. Although recent works have attempted to provide such a resource, they still do not encompass all major types of variants including structural variants (SVs). Thus, we leveraged the massive high-quality Sanger sequences from the HuRef genome to construct by far the most comprehensive gold set of a single individual, which was cross validated with deep Illumina sequencing, population datasets, and well-established algorithms. It was a necessary effort to completely reanalyze the HuRef genome as its previously published variants were mostly reported five years ago, suffering from compatibility, organization, and accuracy issues that prevent their direct use in benchmarking. Our extensive analysis and validation resulted in a gold set with high specificity and sensitivity. In contrast to the current gold sets of the NA12878 or HS1011 genomes, our gold set is the first that includes small variants, deletion SVs and insertion SVs up to a hundred thousand base-pairs. We demonstrate the utility of our HuRef gold set to benchmark several published SV detection tools.",26412485,PMC4585973,10.1038/srep14493,8
TIF-Seq2 disentangles overlapping isoforms in complex human transcriptomes,"Eukaryotic transcriptomes are complex, involving thousands of overlapping transcripts. The interleaved nature of the transcriptomes limits our ability to identify regulatory regions, and in some cases can lead to misinterpretation of gene expression. To improve the understanding of the overlapping transcriptomes, we have developed an optimized method, TIF-Seq2, able to sequence simultaneously the 5' and 3' ends of individual RNA molecules at single-nucleotide resolution. We investigated the transcriptome of a well characterized human cell line (K562) and identified thousands of unannotated transcript isoforms. By focusing on transcripts which are challenging to be investigated with RNA-Seq, we accurately defined boundaries of lowly expressed unannotated and read-through transcripts putatively encoding fusion genes. We validated our results by targeted long-read sequencing and standard RNA-Seq for chronic myeloid leukaemia patient samples. Taking the advantage of TIF-Seq2, we explored transcription regulation among overlapping units and investigated their crosstalk. We show that most overlapping upstream transcripts use poly(A) sites within the first 2 kb of the downstream transcription units. Our work shows that, by paring the 5' and 3' end of each RNA, TIF-Seq2 can improve the annotation of complex genomes, facilitate accurate assignment of promoters to genes and easily identify transcriptionally fused genes.",32816037,PMC7544212,10.1093/nar/gkaa691,4
Improved data analysis for the MinION nanopore sequencer,"Speed, single-base sensitivity and long read lengths make nanopores a promising technology for high-throughput sequencing. We evaluated and optimized the performance of the MinION nanopore sequencer using M13 genomic DNA and used expectation maximization to obtain robust maximum-likelihood estimates for insertion, deletion and substitution error rates (4.9%, 7.8% and 5.1%, respectively). Over 99% of high-quality 2D MinION reads mapped to the reference at a mean identity of 85%. We present a single-nucleotide-variant detection tool that uses maximum-likelihood parameter estimates and marginalization over many possible read alignments to achieve precision and recall of up to 99%. By pairing our high-confidence alignment strategy with long MinION reads, we resolved the copy number for a cancer-testis gene family (CT47) within an unresolved region of human chromosome Xq24.",25686389,PMC4907500,10.1038/nmeth.3290,255
"Yes, we can use it: a formal test on the accuracy of low-pass nanopore long-read sequencing for mitophylogenomics and barcoding research using the Caribbean spiny lobster Panulirus argus","Background:Whole mitogenomes or short fragments (i.e., 300-700 bp of the cox1 gene) are the markers of choice for revealing within- and among-species genealogies. Protocols for sequencing and assembling mitogenomes include 'primer walking' or 'long PCR' followed by Sanger sequencing or Illumina short-read low-coverage whole genome (LC-WGS) sequencing with or without prior enrichment of mitochondrial DNA. The aforementioned strategies assemble complete and accurate mitochondrial genomes but are time consuming and/or expensive. In this study, I first tested whether mitogenomes can be sequenced from long-read nanopore sequencing data exclusively. Second, I explored the accuracy of the long-read assembled genomes by comparing them to a 'gold' standard reference mitogenome retrieved from the same individual using Illumina sequencing. Third and lastly, I tested if the long-read assemblies are useful for mitophylogenomics and barcoding research. To accomplish these goals, I used the Caribbean spiny lobster Panulirus argus, an ecologically relevant species in shallow water coral reefs and target of the most lucrative fishery in the greater Caribbean region.Results:LC-WGS using a MinION ONT device and various de-novo and reference-based assembly pipelines retrieved a complete and highly accurate mitogenome for the Caribbean spiny lobster Panulirus argus. Discordance between each of the long-read assemblies and the reference mitogenome was mostly due to indels at the flanks of homopolymer regions. Although not 'perfect', phylogenetic analyses using entire mitogenomes or a fragment of the cox1 gene demonstrated that mitogenomes assembled using long reads reliably identify the sequenced specimen as belonging to P. argus and distinguish it from other related species in the same genus, family, and superorder.Conclusions:This study serves as a proof-of-concept for the future implementation of in-situ surveillance protocols using the MinION to detect mislabeling in P. argus across its supply chain. Mislabeling detection will improve fishery management in this overexploited lobster. This study will additionally aid in decreasing costs for exploring meta-population connectivity in the Caribbean spiny lobster and will aid with the transfer of genomics technology to low-income countries.",33297960,PMC7726883,10.1186/s12864-020-07292-5,5
A draft chromosome-scale genome assembly of a commercial sugarcane,"Sugarcane accounts for a large portion of the worlds sugar production. Modern commercial cultivars are complex hybrids of S. officinarum, S. spontaneum, and several other Saccharum species, resulting in an auto-allopolyploid with 8-12 copies of each chromosome. The current genome assembly gold standard is to generate a long read assembly followed by chromatin conformation capture sequencing to scaffold. We used the PacBio RSII and chromatin conformation capture sequencing to sequence and assemble the genome of a South East Asian commercial sugarcane cultivar, known as Khon Kaen 3. The Khon Kaen 3 genome assembled into 104,477 contigs totalling 7 Gb, which scaffolded into 56 pseudochromosomes containing 5.2 Gb of sequence. Genome annotation produced 242,406 genes from 30,927 orthogroups. Aligning the Khon Kaen 3 genome sequence to S. officinarum and S. spontaneum revealed a high level of apparent recombination, indicating a chimeric assembly. This assembly error is explained by high nucleotide identity between S. officinarum and S. spontaneum, where 91.8% of S. spontaneum aligns to S. officinarum at 94% identity. Thus, the subgenomes of commercial sugarcane are so similar that using short reads to correct long PacBio reads produced chimeric long reads. Future attempts to sequence sugarcane must take this information into account.",36443360,PMC9705387,10.1038/s41598-022-24823-0,7
Third-generation Sequencing Reveals Extensive Polycistronism and Transcriptional Overlapping in a Baculovirus,"The Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) is an insect-pathogen baculovirus. In this study, we applied the Oxford Nanopore Technologies platform for the analysis of the polyadenylated fraction of the viral transcriptome using both cDNA and direct RNA sequencing methods. We identified and annotated altogether 132 novel transcripts and transcript isoforms, including 4 coding and 4 non-coding RNA molecules, 47 length variants, 5 splice isoforms, as well as 23 polycistronic and 49 complex transcripts. All of the identified novel protein-coding genes were 5'-truncated forms of longer host genes. In this work, we demonstrated that in the case of transcript start site isoforms, the promoters and the initiator sequence of the longer and shorter variants belong to the same kinetic class. Long-read sequencing also revealed a complex meshwork of transcriptional overlaps, the function of which needs to be clarified. Additionally, we developed bioinformatics methods to improve the transcript annotation and to eliminate the non-specific transcription reads generated by template switching and false priming.",29872099,PMC5988703,10.1038/s41598-018-26955-8,32
A New Way to Discover IRESs in Pathology or Stress Conditions? Harnessing Latest High-Throughput Technologies,"The cellular internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) is one of the most important elements to mediate cap-independent translational initiation, especially under conditions of stress and pathology. However, a high-throughput method to discover IRESs in these conditions is still lacking. Here, a possible way IRES long-read sequencing based on the latest high-throughput technologies is proposed to solve this problem. Based on this design, diversity and integrity of the transcriptome from original samples can be kept. The micro-environment that stimulates or inhibits IRES activity can also be mimicked. By using long read-length sequencing technology, additional experiments that are essential for ruling out the cryptic promoters or splicing events in routine IRES identification processes can be circumvented. It is hoped that this proposed methodology may be adopted for IRES element discovery, hence uncovering the full extent of the role of IRESs in disease, development, and stress.

Illumina short-read and MinION long-read WGS to characterize the molecular epidemiology of an NDM-1 Serratia marcescens outbreak in Romania,"Background and objectives:Serratia marcescens is an emerging nosocomial pathogen, and the carbapenemase blaNDM has been reported in several surveys in Romania. We aimed to investigate the molecular epidemiology of S. marcescens in two Romanian hospitals over 2010-15, including a neonatal NDM-1 S. marcescens outbreak.Methods:Isolates were sequenced using Illumina technology together with carbapenem-non-susceptible NDM-1-positive and NDM-1-negative Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae to provide genomic context. A subset was sequenced with MinION to fully resolve NDM-1 plasmid structures. Resistance genes, plasmid replicons and ISs were identified in silico for all isolates; an annotated phylogeny was reconstructed for S. marcescens. Fully resolved study NDM-1 plasmid sequences were compared with the most closely related publicly available NDM-1 plasmid reference.Results:44/45 isolates were successfully sequenced (S. marcescens, n = 33; K. pneumoniae, n = 7; E. cloacae, n = 4); 10 with MinION. The S. marcescens phylogeny demonstrated several discrete clusters of NDM-1-positive and -negative isolates. All NDM-1-positive isolates across species harboured a pKOX_NDM1-like plasmid; more detailed comparisons of the plasmid structures demonstrated a number of differences, but highlighted the largely conserved plasmid backbones across species and hospital sites.Conclusions:The molecular epidemiology is most consistent with the importation of a pKOX_NDM1-like plasmid into Romania and its dissemination amongst K. pneumoniae/E. cloacae and subsequently S. marcescens across hospitals. The data suggested multiple acquisitions of this plasmid by S. marcescens in the two hospitals studied; transmission events within centres, including a large outbreak on the Targu Mures neonatal unit; and sharing of the pKOX_NDM1-like plasmid between species within outbreaks.",29237003,PMC5890751,10.1093/jac/dkx456,14
Genomic characterisation of bioaerosols within livestock facilities: A systematic review,"Livestock facilities are widely regarded as reservoirs of infectious disease, owing to their abundance in particulate matter (PM) and microbial bioaerosols. Over the past decade, bioaerosol studies have increasingly utilised high throughput sequencing (HTS) to achieve superior throughput, taxonomic resolution, and the detection of unculturable organisms. However, the prevailing focus on amplicon sequencing has limited the identification of viruses and microbial taxa at the species-level. Herein, a literature search was conducted to identify methods capable of overcoming the aforementioned limitations. Screening 1531 international publications resulted in 29 eligible for review. Metagenomics capable of providing rich insights were identified in only three instances. Notably, long-read sequencing was not utilised for metagenomics. This review also identified that sample collection methods lack a uniform approach, highlighted by the differences in sampling equipment, flow rates and durations. Further heterogeneity was introduced by the unique sampling conditions, which makes it challenging to ground new findings within the established literature. For instance, winter was associated with increased microbial abundance and antimicrobial resistance, yet less alpha diversity. Researchers implementing metagenomics into the livestock environment should consider season, the microclimate, and livestock growth stage as influential upon their findings. Considering the increasing accessibility of long-read sequencing, future research should explore its viability within a novel uniform testing protocol for bioaerosol emissions.",38331298,,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.170722,0

Beyond the exome: What's next in diagnostic testing for Mendelian conditions,"Despite advances in clinical genetic testing, including the introduction of exome sequencing (ES), more than 50% of individuals with a suspected Mendelian condition lack a precise molecular diagnosis. Clinical evaluation is increasingly undertaken by specialists outside of clinical genetics, often occurring in a tiered fashion and typically ending after ES. The current diagnostic rate reflects multiple factors, including technical limitations, incomplete understanding of variant pathogenicity, missing genotype-phenotype associations, complex gene-environment interactions, and reporting differences between clinical labs. Maintaining a clear understanding of the rapidly evolving landscape of diagnostic tests beyond ES, and their limitations, presents a challenge for non-genetics professionals. Newer tests, such as short-read genome or RNA sequencing, can be challenging to order, and emerging technologies, such as optical genome mapping and long-read DNA sequencing, are not available clinically. Furthermore, there is no clear guidance on the next best steps after inconclusive evaluation. Here, we review why a clinical genetic evaluation may be negative, discuss questions to be asked in this setting, and provide a framework for further investigation, including the advantages and disadvantages of new approaches that are nascent in the clinical sphere. We present a guide for the next best steps after inconclusive molecular testing based upon phenotype and prior evaluation, including when to consider referral to research consortia focused on elucidating the underlying cause of rare unsolved genetic disorders.",37541186,PMC10432150,10.1016/j.ajhg.2023.06.009,14
Extended haplotype-phasing of long-read de novo genome assemblies using Hi-C,"Haplotype-resolved genome assemblies are important for understanding how combinations of variants impact phenotypes. To date, these assemblies have been best created with complex protocols, such as cultured cells that contain a single-haplotype (haploid) genome, single cells where haplotypes are separated, or co-sequencing of parental genomes in a trio-based approach. These approaches are impractical in most situations. To address this issue, we present FALCON-Phase, a phasing tool that uses ultra-long-range Hi-C chromatin interaction data to extend phase blocks of partially-phased diploid assembles to chromosome or scaffold scale. FALCON-Phase uses the inherent phasing information in Hi-C reads, skipping variant calling, and reduces the computational complexity of phasing. Our method is validated on three benchmark datasets generated as part of the Vertebrate Genomes Project (VGP), including human, cow, and zebra finch, for which high-quality, fully haplotype-resolved assemblies are available using the trio-based approach. FALCON-Phase is accurate without having parental data and performance is better in samples with higher heterozygosity. For cow and zebra finch the accuracy is 97% compared to 80-91% for human. FALCON-Phase is applicable to any draft assembly that contains long primary contigs and phased associate contigs.",33911078,PMC8081726,10.1038/s41467-020-20536-y,43
Semi-automated assembly of high-quality diploid human reference genomes,"The current human reference genome, GRCh38, represents over 20 years of effort to generate a high-quality assembly, which has benefitted society1,2. However, it still has many gaps and errors, and does not represent a biological genome as it is a blend of multiple individuals3,4. Recently, a high-quality telomere-to-telomere reference, CHM13, was generated with the latest long-read technologies, but it was derived from a hydatidiform mole cell line with a nearly homozygous genome5. To address these limitations, the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium formed with the goal of creating high-quality, cost-effective, diploid genome assemblies for a pangenome reference that represents human genetic diversity6. Here, in our first scientific report, we determined which combination of current genome sequencing and assembly approaches yield the most complete and accurate diploid genome assembly with minimal manual curation. Approaches that used highly accurate long reads and parent-child data with graph-based haplotype phasing during assembly outperformed those that did not. Developing a combination of the top-performing methods, we generated our first high-quality diploid reference assembly, containing only approximately four gaps per chromosome on average, with most chromosomes within ±1% of the length of CHM13. Nearly 48% of protein-coding genes have non-synonymous amino acid changes between haplotypes, and centromeric regions showed the highest diversity. Our findings serve as a foundation for assembling near-complete diploid human genomes at scale for a pangenome reference to capture global genetic variation from single nucleotides to structural rearrangements.",36261518,PMC9668749,10.1038/s41586-022-05325-5,63
Species-specific basecallers improve actual accuracy of nanopore sequencing in plants,"Background:Long-read sequencing platforms offered by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) allow native DNA containing epigenetic modifications to be directly sequenced, but can be limited by lower per-base accuracies. A key step post-sequencing is basecalling, the process of converting raw electrical signals produced by the sequencing device into nucleotide sequences. This is challenging as current basecallers are primarily based on mixtures of model species for training. Here we utilise both ONT PromethION and higher accuracy PacBio Sequel II HiFi sequencing on two plants, Phebalium stellatum and Xanthorrhoea johnsonii, to train species-specific basecaller models with the aim of improving per-base accuracy. We investigate sequencing accuracies achieved by ONT basecallers and assess accuracy gains by training single-species and species-specific basecaller models. We also evaluate accuracy gains from ONT's improved flowcells (R10.4, FLO-PRO112) and sequencing kits (SQK-LSK112). For the truth dataset for both model training and accuracy assessment, we developed highly accurate, contiguous diploid reference genomes with PacBio Sequel II HiFi reads.Results:Basecalling with ONT Guppy 5 and 6 super-accurate gave almost identical results, attaining read accuracies of 91.96% and 94.15%. Guppy's plant-specific model gave highly mixed results, attaining read accuracies of 91.47% and 96.18%. Species-specific basecalling models improved read accuracy, attaining 93.24% and 95.16% read accuracies. R10.4 sequencing kits also improve sequencing accuracy, attaining read accuracies of 95.46% (super-accurate) and 96.87% (species-specific).Conclusions:The use of a single mixed-species basecaller model, such as ONT Guppy super-accurate, may be reducing the accuracy of nanopore sequencing, due to conflicting genome biology within the training dataset and study species. Training of single-species and genome-specific basecaller models improves read accuracy. Studies that aim to do large-scale long-read genotyping would primarily benefit from training their own basecalling models. Such studies could use sequencing accuracy gains and improving bioinformatics tools to improve study outcomes.",36517904,PMC9749173,10.1186/s13007-022-00971-2,6
Chromosome assembled and annotated genome sequence of Aspergillus flavus NRRL 3357,"Aspergillus flavus is an opportunistic pathogen of crops, including peanuts and maize, and is the second leading cause of aspergillosis in immunocompromised patients. A. flavus is also a major producer of the mycotoxin, aflatoxin, a potent carcinogen, which results in significant crop losses annually. The A. flavus isolate NRRL 3357 was originally isolated from peanut and has been used as a model organism for understanding the regulation and production of secondary metabolites, such as aflatoxin. A draft genome of NRRL 3357 was previously constructed, enabling the development of molecular tools and for understanding population biology of this particular species. Here, we describe an updated, near complete, telomere-to-telomere assembly and re-annotation of the eight chromosomes of A. flavus NRRL 3357 genome, accomplished via long-read PacBio and Oxford Nanopore technologies combined with Illumina short-read sequencing. A total of 13,715 protein-coding genes were predicted. Using RNA-seq data, a significant improvement was achieved in predicted 5' and 3' untranslated regions, which were incorporated into the new gene models.",34849826,PMC8496237,10.1093/g3journal/jkab213,13
High-Quality Genome Resource ofClonostachys roseaStrain CanS41 by Oxford Nanopore Long-Read Sequencing,"Clonostachys roseais a necrotrophic mycoparasitic fungus with excellent biological control ability against numerous fungal plant pathogens. Here, we performed genomic sequencing ofC. roseastrain CanS41 using Oxford Nanopore sequencing technology. We generated a high-quality genome assembly (>99.99% accuracy), which comprised 26 contigs containing 60.68 Mb sequences with a GC content of 48.55% and a repeat content of 8.38%. The N50contig length is 3.02 Mb. In total, 20,818 protein-coding genes were identified and functionally annotated. Genes encoding secreted proteins and carbohydrate-active enzymes as well as secondary metabolic gene clusters were also identified and analyzed. In summary, the high-quality genome assembly and gene annotation provided here will allow further exploration of biological functions and enhance biological control ability ofC. rosea.",33529071,,10.1094/PDIS-12-20-2615-A,1
Significance and limitations of the use of next-generation sequencing technologies for detecting mutational signatures,"Next generation sequencing technologies (NGS) have been critical in characterizing the genomic landscape and untangling the genetic heterogeneity of human cancer. Since its advent, NGS has played a pivotal role in identifying the patterns of somatic mutations imprinted on cancer genomes and in deciphering the signatures of the mutational processes that have generated these patterns. Mutational signatures serve as phenotypic molecular footprints of exposures to environmental factors as well as deficiency and infidelity of DNA replication and repair pathways. Since the first roadmap of mutational signatures in human cancer was generated from whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing data, there has been a growing interest to extract mutational signatures from other NGS technologies such as targeted panel sequencing, RNA sequencing, single-cell sequencing, duplex sequencing, reduced representation sequencing, and long-read sequencing. Many of these technologies have their inherent sequencing biases and produce technical artifacts that can confound the extraction of reliable and interpretable mutational signatures. In this review, we highlight the relevance, limitations, and prospects of using different NGS technologies for examining mutational patterns and for deciphering mutational signatures.",34411908,PMC9478565,10.1016/j.dnarep.2021.103200,10
Long-read sequencing identifies the pathogenic nucleotide repeat expansion in RFC1 in a Japanese case of CANVAS,"Recently, a recessively inherited intronic repeat expansion in replication factor C1 (RFC1) was identified in cerebellar ataxia with neuropathy and bilateral vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS). Here, we describe a Japanese case of genetically confirmed CANVAS with autonomic failure and auditory hallucination. The case showed impaired uptake of iodine-123-metaiodobenzylguanidine and123I-ioflupane in the cardiac sympathetic nerve and dopaminergic neurons, respectively, by single-photon emission computed tomography. Long-read sequencing identified biallelic pathogenic (AAGGG)n nucleotide repeat expansion in RFC1 and heterozygous benign (TAAAA)n and (TAGAA)n expansions in brain expressed, associated with NEDD4 (BEAN1). Enrichment of the repeat regions in RFC1 and BEAN1 using a Cas9-mediated system clearly distinguished between pathogenic and benign repeat expansions. The haplotype around RFC1 indicated that the (AAGGG)n expansion in our case was on the same ancestral allele as that of European cases. Thus, long-read sequencing facilitates precise genetic diagnosis of diseases with complex repeat structures and various expansions.",32066831,,10.1038/s10038-020-0733-y,22
Nanopore long-read RNA sequencing reveals functional alternative splicing variants in human vascular smooth muscle cells,"Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) are the major contributor to vascular repair and remodeling, which showed high level of phenotypic plasticity. Abnormalities in VSMC plasticity can lead to multiple cardiovascular diseases, wherein alternative splicing plays important roles. However, alternative splicing variants in VSMC plasticity are not fully understood. Here we systematically characterized the long-read transcriptome and their dysregulation in human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs) by employing the Oxford Nanopore Technologies long-read RNA sequencing in HASMCs that are separately treated with platelet-derived growth factor, transforming growth factor, and hsa-miR-221-3P transfection. Our analysis reveals frequent alternative splicing events and thousands of unannotated transcripts generated from alternative splicing. HASMCs treated with different factors exhibit distinct transcriptional reprogramming modulated by alternative splicing. We also found that unannotated transcripts produce different open reading frames compared to the annotated transcripts. Finally, we experimentally validated the unannotated transcript derived from gene CISD1, namely CISD1-u, which plays a role in the phenotypic switch of HASMCs. Our study characterizes the phenotypic modulation of HASMCs from an insight of long-read transcriptome, which would promote the understanding and the manipulation of HASMC plasticity in cardiovascular diseases.",37907652,PMC10618188,10.1038/s42003-023-05481-y,2
"FLEP-seq: simultaneous detection of RNA polymerase II position, splicing status, polyadenylation site and poly(A) tail length at genome-wide scale by single-molecule nascent RNA sequencing","Elongation, splicing and polyadenylation are fundamental steps of transcription, and studying their coordination requires simultaneous monitoring of these dynamic processes on one transcript. We recently developed a full-length nascent RNA sequencing method in the model plant Arabidopsis that simultaneously detects RNA polymerase II position, splicing status, polyadenylation site and poly(A) tail length at genome-wide scale. This method allows calculation of the kinetics of cotranscriptional splicing and detects polyadenylated transcripts with unspliced introns retained at specific positions posttranscriptionally. Here we describe a detailed protocol for this method called FLEP-seq (full-length elongating and polyadenylated RNA sequencing) that is applicable to plants. Library production requires as little as one nanogram of nascent RNA (after rRNA/tRNA removal), and either Nanopore or PacBio platforms can be used for sequencing. We also provide a complete bioinformatic pipeline from raw data processing to downstream analysis. The minimum time required for FLEP-seq, including RNA extraction and library preparation, is 36 h. The subsequent long-read sequencing and initial data analysis ranges between 31 and 40 h, depending on the sequencing platform.",34331052,,10.1038/s41596-021-00581-7,14
Rapid whole-genome based typing and surveillance of avipoxviruses using nanopore sequencing,"Avian pox is an infectious disease caused by avipoxviruses (APV), resulting in cutaneous and/or tracheal lesions. Poxviruses share large genome sizes (from 130 to 360 kb), featuring repetitions, deletions or insertions as a result of a long-term recombination history. The increasing performances of next-generation sequencing (NGS) opened new opportunities for surveillance of poxviruses, based on timely and affordable workflows. We investigated the application of the 3rdgeneration Oxford Nanopore Minion technology to achieve real-time whole-genome sequencing directly from lesions, without any enrichment or isolation step. Fowlpox lesions were sampled on hens, total DNA was extracted and processed for sequencing on a MinION, Oxford Nanopore. We readily generated whole APV genomes from cutaneous or tracheal lesions, without any isolation or PCR-based enrichment: Fowlpox virus reads loads ranged from 0.75% to 2.62% and reads up to 61 kbp were generated and readily assembled into 3 APV complete genomes. This long read size eases the assembly step and lowers the bioinformatics capacity requirements and processing time compared to huge sets of short reads. The complete genome analysis confirmed that these Fowlpox viruses cluster within clade A1 and host full length reticuloendotheliovirus (REV) inserts. The pathobiological relevance of REV insert, although a classical feature of fowlpoxviruses (FPVs), should be further investigated. Surveillance of emerging poxviruses could greatly benefit from real-time whole genome sequencing.",30086381,,10.1016/j.jviromet.2018.08.003,20
The present and future of de novo whole-genome assembly,"As the advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology, various de novo assembly algorithms based on the de Bruijn graph have been developed to construct chromosome-level sequences. However, numerous technical or computational challenges in de novo assembly still remain, although many bright ideas and heuristics have been suggested to tackle the challenges in both experimental and computational settings. In this review, we categorize de novo assemblers on the basis of the type of de Bruijn graphs (Hamiltonian and Eulerian) and discuss the challenges of de novo assembly for short NGS reads regarding computational complexity and assembly ambiguity. Then, we discuss how the limitations of the short reads can be overcome by using a single-molecule sequencing platform that generates long reads of up to several kilobases. In fact, the long read assembly has caused a paradigm shift in whole-genome assembly in terms of algorithms and supporting steps. We also summarize (i) hybrid assemblies using both short and long reads and (ii) overlap-based assemblies for long reads and discuss their challenges and future prospects. This review provides guidelines to determine the optimal approach for a given input data type, computational budget or genome.",27742661,,10.1093/bib/bbw096,93
Comprehensive profiling of rhizome-associated alternative splicing and alternative polyadenylation in moso bamboo (Phyllostachys edulis),"Moso bamboo (Phyllostachys edulis) represents one of the fastest-spreading plants in the world, due in part to its well-developed rhizome system. However, the post-transcriptional mechanism for the development of the rhizome system in bamboo has not been comprehensively studied. We therefore used a combination of single-molecule long-read sequencing technology and polyadenylation site sequencing (PAS-seq) to re-annotate the bamboo genome, and identify genome-wide alternative splicing (AS) and alternative polyadenylation (APA) in the rhizome system. In total, 145 522 mapped full-length non-chimeric (FLNC) reads were analyzed, resulting in the correction of 2241 mis-annotated genes and the identification of 8091 previously unannotated loci. Notably, more than 42 280 distinct splicing isoforms were derived from 128 667 intron-containing full-length FLNC reads, including a large number of AS events associated with rhizome systems. In addition, we characterized 25 069 polyadenylation sites from 11 450 genes, 6311 of which have APA sites. Further analysis of intronic polyadenylation revealed that LTR/Gypsy and LTR/Copia were two major transposable elements within the intronic polyadenylation region. Furthermore, this study provided a quantitative atlas of poly(A) usage. Several hundred differential poly(A) sites in the rhizome-root system were identified. Taken together, these results suggest that post-transcriptional regulation may potentially have a vital role in the underground rhizome-root system.",28493303,,10.1111/tpj.13597,87
Detection of isoforms and genomic alterations by high-throughput full-length single-cell RNA sequencing in ovarian cancer,"Understanding the complex background of cancer requires genotype-phenotype information in single-cell resolution. Here, we perform long-read single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on clinical samples from three ovarian cancer patients presenting with omental metastasis and increase the PacBio sequencing depth to 12,000 reads per cell. Our approach captures 152,000 isoforms, of which over 52,000 were not previously reported. Isoform-level analysis accounting for non-coding isoforms reveals 20% overestimation of protein-coding gene expression on average. We also detect cell type-specific isoform and poly-adenylation site usage in tumor and mesothelial cells, and find that mesothelial cells transition into cancer-associated fibroblasts in the metastasis, partly through the TGF-β/miR-29/Collagen axis. Furthermore, we identify gene fusions, including an experimentally validated IGF2BP2::TESPA1 fusion, which is misclassified as high TESPA1 expression in matched short-read data, and call mutations confirmed by targeted NGS cancer gene panel results. With these findings, we envision long-read scRNA-seq to become increasingly relevant in oncology and personalized medicine.",38012143,PMC10682465,10.1038/s41467-023-43387-9,5
Long-read trio sequencing of individuals with unsolved intellectual disability,"Long-read sequencing (LRS) has the potential to comprehensively identify all medically relevant genome variation, including variation commonly missed by short-read sequencing (SRS) approaches. To determine this potential, we performed LRS around 15×-40× genome coverage using the Pacific Biosciences Sequel I System for five trios. The respective probands were diagnosed with intellectual disability (ID) whose etiology remained unresolved after SRS exomes and genomes. Systematic assessment of LRS coverage showed that ~35 Mb of the human reference genome was only accessible by LRS and not SRS. Genome-wide structural variant (SV) calling yielded on average 28,292 SV calls per individual, totaling 12.9 Mb of sequence. Trio-based analyses which allowed to study segregation, showed concordance for up to 95% of these SV calls across the genome, and 80% of the LRS SV calls were not identified by SRS. De novo mutation analysis did not identify any de novo SVs, confirming that these are rare events. Because of high sequence coverage, we were also able to call single nucleotide substitutions. On average, we identified 3 million substitutions per genome, with a Mendelian inheritance concordance of up to 97%. Of these, ~100,000 were located in the ~35 Mb of the genome that was only captured by LRS. Moreover, these variants affected the coding sequence of 64 genes, including 32 known Mendelian disease genes. Our data show the potential added value of LRS compared to SRS for identifying medically relevant genome variation.",33257779,PMC8115091,10.1038/s41431-020-00770-0,20
Comparison Analysis of Different DNA Extraction Methods on Suitability for Long-Read Metagenomic Nanopore Sequencing,"Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) is a novel useful strategy that is increasingly used for pathogens detection in clinic. Some emerging mNGS technologies with long-read ability are useful to decrease sequencing time and increase diagnosed accuracy, which is of great significance in rapid pathogen diagnosis. Reliable DNA extraction is considered critical for the success of sequencing; hence, there is thus an urgent need of gentle DNA extraction method to get unbiased and more integrate DNA from all kinds of pathogens. In this study, we systematically compared three DNA extraction methods (enzymatic cell lysis based on MetaPolyzyme, mechanical cell lysis based on bead beating, and the control method without pre-cell lysis, respectively) by assessing DNA yield, integrity, and the microbial diversity based on long-read nanopore sequencing of urine samples with microbial infections. Compared with the control method, the enzymatic-based method increased the average length of microbial reads by a median of 2.1-fold [Inter Quartile Range (IQR), 1.7-2.5; maximum, 4.8) in 18 of the 20 samples and the mapped reads proportion of specific species by a median of 11.8-fold (Inter Quartile Range (IQR), 6.9-32.2; maximum, 79.27]. Moreover, it provided fully (20 of 20) consistent diagnosed results to the clinical culture and more representative microbial profiles (P< 0.05), which all strongly proves the excellent performance of enzymatic-based method in long-read mNGS-based pathogen identification and potential diseases diagnosis of microbiome related.",35837476,PMC9273838,10.3389/fcimb.2022.919903,4
Long-read DNA sequencing fully characterized chromothripsis in a patient with Langer-Giedion syndrome and Cornelia de Lange syndrome-4,"Chromothripsis is a type of chaotic complex genomic rearrangement caused by a single event of chromosomal shattering and repair processes. Chromothripsis is known to cause rare congenital diseases when it occurs in germline cells, however, current genome analysis technologies have difficulty in detecting and deciphering chromothripsis. It is possible that this type of complex rearrangement may be overlooked in rare-disease patients whose genetic diagnosis is unsolved. We applied long read nanopore sequencing and our recently developed analysis pipeline dnarrange to a patient who has a reciprocal chromosomal translocation t(8;18)(q22;q21) as a result of chromothripsis between the two chromosomes, and fully characterize the complex rearrangements at the translocation site. The patient genome was evidently shattered into 19 fragments, and rejoined into derivative chromosomes in a random order and orientation. The reconstructed patient genome indicates loss of five genomic regions, which all overlap with microarray-detected copy number losses. We found that two disease-related genes RAD21 and EXT1 were lost by chromothripsis. These two genes could fully explain the disease phenotype with facial dysmorphisms and bone abnormality, which is likely a contiguous gene syndrome, Cornelia de Lange syndrome type IV (CdLs-4) and atypical Langer-Giedion syndrome (LGS), also known as trichorhinophalangeal syndrome type II (TRPSII). This provides evidence that our approach based on long read sequencing can fully characterize chromothripsis in a patient's genome, which is important for understanding the phenotype of disease caused by complex genomic rearrangement.",32296131,PMC7324355,10.1038/s10038-020-0754-6,15
Comparative whole genome DNA methylation profiling across cattle tissues reveals global and tissue-specific methylation patterns,"Background:Efforts to improve animal health, and understand genetic bases for production, may benefit from a comprehensive analysis of animal genomes and epigenomes. Although DNA methylation has been well studied in humans and other model species, its distribution patterns and regulatory impacts in cattle are still largely unknown. Here, we present the largest collection of cattle DNA methylation epigenomic data to date.Results:Using Holstein cattle, we generated 29 whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) datasets for 16 tissues, 47 corresponding RNA-seq datasets, and 2 whole genome sequencing datasets. We did read mapping and DNA methylation calling based on two different cattle assemblies, demonstrating the high quality of the long-read-based assembly markedly improved DNA methylation results. We observed large differences across cattle tissues in the methylation patterns of global CpG sites, partially methylated domains (PMDs), hypomethylated regions (HMRs), CG islands (CGIs), and common repeats. We detected that each tissue had a distinct set of PMDs, which showed tissue-specific patterns. Similar to human PMD, cattle PMDs were often linked to a general decrease of gene expression and a decrease in active histone marks and related to long-range chromatin organizations, like topologically associated domains (TADs). We tested a classification of the HMRs based on their distributions relative to transcription start sites (TSSs) and detected tissue-specific TSS-HMRs and genes that showed strong tissue effects. When performing cross-species comparisons of paired genes (two opposite strand genes with their TSS located in the same HMR), we found out they were more consistently co-expressed among human, mouse, sheep, goat, yak, pig, and chicken, but showed lower consistent ratios in more divergent species. We further used these WGBS data to detect 50,023 experimentally supported CGIs across bovine tissues and found that they might function as a guard against C-to-T mutations for TSS-HMRs. Although common repeats were often heavily methylated, some young Bov-A2 repeats were hypomethylated in sperm and could affect the promoter structures by exposing potential transcription factor binding sites.Conclusions:This study provides a comprehensive resource for bovine epigenomic research and enables new discoveries about DNA methylation and its role in complex traits.",32631327,PMC7339546,10.1186/s12915-020-00793-5,25
The clinical implementation of copy number detection in the age of next-generation sequencing,"The role of copy number variants (CNVs) in disease is now well established. In parallel NGS technologies, such as long-read technologies, there is continual development and data analysis methods continue to be refined. Clinical exome sequencing data is now a reality for many diagnostic laboratories in both congenital genetics and oncology. This provides the ability to detect and report both SNVs and structural variants, including CNVs, using a single assay for a wide range of patient cohorts. Areas covered: Currently, whole-genome sequencing is mainly restricted to research applications and clinical utility studies. Furthermore, detecting the full-size spectrum of CNVs as well as somatic events remains difficult for both exome and whole-genome sequencing. As a result, the full extent of genomic variants in an individual's genome is still largely unknown. Recently, new sequencing technologies have been introduced which maintain the long-range genomic context, aiding the detection of CNVs and structural variants. Expert commentary: The development of long-read sequencing promises to resolve many CNV and SV detection issues but is yet to become established. The current challenge for clinical CNV detection is how to fully exploit all the data which is generated by high throughput sequencing technologies.",30221560,,10.1080/14737159.2018.1523723,4
cDNA Library Enrichment of Full Length Transcripts for SMRT Long Read Sequencing,"The utility of genome assemblies does not only rely on the quality of the assembled genome sequence, but also on the quality of the gene annotations. The Pacific Biosciences Iso-Seq technology is a powerful support for accurate eukaryotic gene model annotation as it allows for direct readout of full-length cDNA sequences without the need for noisy short read-based transcript assembly. We propose the implementation of the TeloPrime Full Length cDNA Amplification kit to the Pacific Biosciences Iso-Seq technology in order to enrich for genuine full-length transcripts in the cDNA libraries. We provide evidence that TeloPrime outperforms the commonly used SMARTer PCR cDNA Synthesis Kit in identifying transcription start and end sites in Arabidopsis thaliana. Furthermore, we show that TeloPrime-based Pacific Biosciences Iso-Seq can be successfully applied to the polyploid genome of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) not only to efficiently annotate gene models, but also to identify novel transcription sites, gene homeologs, splicing isoforms and previously unidentified gene loci.",27327613,PMC4915659,10.1371/journal.pone.0157779,31
The human ribosomal DNA array is composed of highly homogenized tandem clusters,"The structure of the human ribosomal DNA (rDNA) cluster has traditionally been hard to analyze owing to its highly repetitive nature. However, the recent development of long-read sequencing technology, such as Oxford Nanopore sequencing, has enabled us to study the large-scale structure of the genome. Using this technology, we found that human cells have a quite regular rDNA structure. Although each human rDNA copy has some variations in its noncoding region, contiguous copies of rDNA are similar, suggesting that homogenization through gene conversion frequently occurs between copies. Analysis of rDNA methylation by Nanopore sequencing further showed that all the noncoding regions are heavily methylated, whereas about half of the coding regions are clearly unmethylated. The ratio of unmethylated copies, which are speculated to be transcriptionally active, was lower in individuals with a higher rDNA copy number, suggesting that there is a mechanism that keeps the active copy number stable. In addition, the rDNA in progeroid syndrome patient cells with reduced DNA repair activity had more unstable copies compared with control normal cells, although the rate was much lower than previously reported using a fiber-FISH method. Collectively, our results clarify the view of rDNA stability and transcription regulation in human cells, indicating the presence of mechanisms for both homogenizations to ensure sequence quality and maintenance of active copies for cellular functions.",34407983,PMC8559705,10.1101/gr.275838.121,25
De novo genome assembly and comparative genomics for the colonial ascidian Botrylloides violaceus,"Ascidians have the potential to reveal fundamental biological insights related to coloniality, regeneration, immune function, and the evolution of these traits. This study implements a hybrid assembly technique to produce a genome assembly and annotation for the botryllid ascidian, Botrylloides violaceus. A hybrid genome assembly was produced using Illumina, Inc. short and Oxford Nanopore Technologies long-read sequencing technologies. The resulting assembly is comprised of 831 contigs, has a total length of 121 Mbp, N50 of 1 Mbp, and a BUSCO score of 96.1%. Genome annotation identified 13 K protein-coding genes. Comparative genomic analysis with other tunicates reveals patterns of conservation and divergence within orthologous gene families even among closely related species. Characterization of the Wnt gene family, encoding signaling ligands involved in development and regeneration, reveals conserved patterns of subfamily presence and gene copy number among botryllids.

"Rapid protein evolution, organellar reductions, and invasive intronic elements in the marine aerobic parasite dinoflagellate Amoebophrya spp","Background:Dinoflagellates are aquatic protists particularly widespread in the oceans worldwide. Some are responsible for toxic blooms while others live in symbiotic relationships, either as mutualistic symbionts in corals or as parasites infecting other protists and animals. Dinoflagellates harbor atypically large genomes (~ 3 to 250 Gb), with gene organization and gene expression patterns very different from closely related apicomplexan parasites. Here we sequenced and analyzed the genomes of two early-diverging and co-occurring parasitic dinoflagellate Amoebophrya strains, to shed light on the emergence of such atypical genomic features, dinoflagellate evolution, and host specialization.Results:We sequenced, assembled, and annotated high-quality genomes for two Amoebophrya strains (A25 and A120), using a combination of Illumina paired-end short-read and Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) MinION long-read sequencing approaches. We found a small number of transposable elements, along with short introns and intergenic regions, and a limited number of gene families, together contribute to the compactness of the Amoebophrya genomes, a feature potentially linked with parasitism. While the majority of Amoebophrya proteins (63.7% of A25 and 59.3% of A120) had no functional assignment, we found many orthologs shared with Dinophyceae. Our analyses revealed a strong tendency for genes encoded by unidirectional clusters and high levels of synteny conservation between the two genomes despite low interspecific protein sequence similarity, suggesting rapid protein evolution. Most strikingly, we identified a large portion of non-canonical introns, including repeated introns, displaying a broad variability of associated splicing motifs never observed among eukaryotes. Those introner elements appear to have the capacity to spread over their respective genomes in a manner similar to transposable elements. Finally, we confirmed the reduction of organelles observed in Amoebophrya spp., i.e., loss of the plastid, potential loss of a mitochondrial genome and functions.Conclusion:These results expand the range of atypical genome features found in basal dinoflagellates and raise questions regarding speciation and the evolutionary mechanisms at play while parastitism was selected for in this particular unicellular lineage.",33407428,PMC7789003,10.1186/s12915-020-00927-9,20
Real-Time Nanopore Q20+ Sequencing Enables Extremely Fast and Accurate Core Genome MLST Typing and Democratizes Access to High-Resolution Bacterial Pathogen Surveillance,"Next-generation whole-genome sequencing is essential for high-resolution surveillance of bacterial pathogens, for example, during outbreak investigations or for source tracking and escape variant analysis. However, current global sequencing and bioinformatic bottlenecks and a long time to result with standard technologies demand new approaches. In this study, we investigated whether novel nanopore Q20+ long-read chemistry enables standardized and easily accessible high-resolution typing combined with core genome multilocus sequence typing (cgMLST). We set high requirements for discriminatory power by using the slowly evolving bacterium Bordetella pertussis as a model pathogen. Our results show that the increased raw read accuracy enables the description of epidemiological scenarios and phylogenetic linkages at the level of gold-standard short reads. The same was true for our variant analysis of vaccine antigens, resistance genes, and virulence factors, demonstrating that nanopore sequencing is a legitimate competitor in the area of next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based high-resolution bacterial typing. Furthermore, we evaluated the parameters for the fastest possible analysis of the data. By combining the optimized processing pipeline with real-time basecalling, we established a workflow that allows for highly accurate and extremely fast high-resolution typing of bacterial pathogens while sequencing is still in progress. Along with advantages such as low costs and portability, the approach suggested here might democratize modern bacterial typing, enabling more efficient infection control globally.",36988494,PMC10117118,10.1128/jcm.01631-22,7
"Long-read sequencing and de novo genome assembly of Ammopiptanthus nanus, a desert shrub","Background:Ammopiptanthus nanus is a rare broad-leaved shrub that is found in the desert and arid regions of Central Asia. This plant species exhibits extremely high tolerance to drought and freezing and has been used in abiotic tolerance research in plants. As a relic of the tertiary period, A. nanus is of great significance to plant biogeographic research in the ancient Mediterranean region. Here, we report a draft genome assembly using the Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) platform and gene annotation for A. nanus.Findings:A total of 64.72 Gb of raw PacBio sequel reads were generated from four 20-kb libraries. After filtering, 64.53 Gb of clean reads were obtained, giving 72.59× coverage depth. Assembly using Canu gave an assembly length of 823.74 Mb, with a contig N50 of 2.76 Mb. The final size of the assembled A. nanus genome was close to the 889 Mb estimated by k-mer analysis. The gene annotation completeness was evaluated using Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs; 1,327 of the 1,440 conserved genes (92.15%) could be found in the A. nanus assembly. Genome annotation revealed that 74.08% of the A. nanus genome is composed of repetitive elements and 53.44% is composed of long terminal repeat elements. We predicted 37,188 protein-coding genes, of which 96.53% were functionally annotated.Conclusions:The genomic sequences of A. nanus could be a valuable source for comparative genomic analysis in the legume family and will be useful for understanding the phylogenetic relationships of the Thermopsideae and the evolutionary response of plant species to the Qinghai Tibetan Plateau uplift.",29917074,PMC6048559,10.1093/gigascience/giy074,16
"A chromosomal-level reference genome of the widely utilized Coccidioides posadasii laboratory strain ""Silveira""","Coccidioidomycosis is a common fungal disease that is endemic to arid and semi-arid regions of both American continents. Coccidioides immitis and Coccidioides posadasii are the etiological agents of the disease, also known as Valley Fever. For several decades, the C. posadasii strain Silveira has been used widely in vaccine studies, is the source strain for production of diagnostic antigens, and is a widely used experimental strain for functional studies. In 2009, the genome was sequenced using Sanger sequencing technology, and a draft assembly and annotation were made available. In this study, the genome of the Silveira strain was sequenced using single molecule real-time sequencing PacBio technology, assembled into chromosomal-level contigs, genotyped, and the genome was reannotated using sophisticated and curated in silico tools. This high-quality genome sequencing effort has improved our understanding of chromosomal structure, gene set annotation, and lays the groundwork for identification of structural variants (e.g. transversions, translocations, and copy number variants), assessment of gene gain and loss, and comparison of transposable elements in future phylogenetic and population genomics studies.",35137016,PMC8982387,10.1093/g3journal/jkac031,9
Hercules: a profile HMM-based hybrid error correction algorithm for long reads,"Choosing whether to use second or third generation sequencing platforms can lead to trade-offs between accuracy and read length. Several types of studies require long and accurate reads. In such cases researchers often combine both technologies and the erroneous long reads are corrected using the short reads. Current approaches rely on various graph or alignment based techniques and do not take the error profile of the underlying technology into account. Efficient machine learning algorithms that address these shortcomings have the potential to achieve more accurate integration of these two technologies. We propose Hercules, the first machine learning-based long read error correction algorithm. Hercules models every long read as a profile Hidden Markov Model with respect to the underlying platform's error profile. The algorithm learns a posterior transition/emission probability distribution for each long read to correct errors in these reads. We show on two DNA-seq BAC clones (CH17-157L1 and CH17-227A2) that Hercules-corrected reads have the highest mapping rate among all competing algorithms and have the highest accuracy when the breadth of coverage is high. On a large human CHM1 cell line WGS data set, Hercules is one of the few scalable algorithms; and among those, it achieves the highest accuracy.",30124947,PMC6265270,10.1093/nar/gky724,12
Genomic dynamics of species and mobile genetic elements in a prolonged blaIMP-4-associated carbapenemase outbreak in an Australian hospital,"Background:Hospital outbreaks of carbapenemase-producing organisms, such as blaIMP-4-containing organisms, are an increasing threat to patient safety.Objectives:To investigate the genomic dynamics of a 10 year (2006-15) outbreak of blaIMP-4-containing organisms in a burns unit in a hospital in Sydney, Australia.Methods:All carbapenem-non-susceptible or MDR clinical isolates (2006-15) and a random selection of equivalent or ESBL-producing environmental isolates (2012-15) were sequenced [short-read (Illumina), long-read (Oxford Nanopore Technology)]. Sequence data were used to assess genetic relatedness of isolates (Mash; mapping and recombination-adjusted phylogenies), perform in silico typing (MLST, resistance genes and plasmid replicons) and reconstruct a subset of blaIMP plasmids for comparative plasmid genomics.Results:A total of 46/58 clinical and 67/96 environmental isolates contained blaIMP-4. All blaIMP-4-positive organisms contained five or more other resistance genes. Enterobacter cloacae was the predominant organism, with 12 other species mainly found in either the environment or patients, some persisting despite several cleaning methods. On phylogenetic analysis there were three genetic clusters of E. cloacae containing both clinical and environmental isolates, and an additional four clusters restricted to either reservoir. blaIMP-4 was mostly found as part of a cassette array (blaIMP-4-qacG2-aacA4-catB3) in a class 1 integron within a previously described IncM2 plasmid (pEl1573), with almost complete conservation of this cassette across the species over the 10 years. Several other plasmids were also implicated, including an IncF plasmid backbone not previously widely described in association with blaIMP-4.Conclusions:Genetic backgrounds disseminating blaIMP-4 can persist, diversify and evolve amongst both human and environmental reservoirs during a prolonged outbreak despite intensive prevention efforts.",31960024,PMC7069471,10.1093/jac/dkz526,16
High-resolution annotation of the mouse preimplantation embryo transcriptome using long-read sequencing,"The transcriptome of the preimplantation mouse embryo has been previously annotated by short-read sequencing, with limited coverage and accuracy. Here we utilize a low-cell number transcriptome based on the Smart-seq2 method to perform long-read sequencing. Our analysis describes additional novel transcripts and complexity of the preimplantation transcriptome, identifying 2280 potential novel transcripts from previously unannotated loci and 6289 novel splicing isoforms from previously annotated genes. Notably, these novel transcripts and isoforms with transcription start sites are enriched for an active promoter modification, H3K4me3. Moreover, we generate a more complete and precise transcriptome by combining long-read and short-read data during early embryogenesis. Based on this approach, we identify a previously undescribed isoform of Kdm4dl with a modified mRNA reading frame and a novel noncoding gene designated XLOC_004958. Depletion of Kdm4dl or XLOC_004958 led to abnormal blastocyst development. Thus, our data provide a high-resolution and more precise transcriptome during preimplantation mouse embryogenesis.",32461551,PMC7253418,10.1038/s41467-020-16444-w,15
Measuring the tail: Methods for poly(A) tail profiling,"The 3'-end poly(A) tail is an important and potent feature of most mRNA molecules that affects mRNA fate and translation efficiency. Polyadenylation is a posttranscriptional process that occurs in the nucleus by canonical poly(A) polymerases (PAPs). In some specific instances, the poly(A) tail can also be extended in the cytoplasm by noncanonical poly(A) polymerases (ncPAPs). This epitranscriptomic regulation of mRNA recently became one of the most interesting aspects in the field. Advances in RNA sequencing technologies and software development have allowed the precise measurement of poly(A) tails, identification of new ncPAPs, expansion of the function of known enzymes, discovery and a better understanding of the physiological role of tail heterogeneity, and recognition of a correlation between tail length and RNA translatability. Here, we summarize the development of polyadenylation research methods, including classic low-throughput approaches, Illumina-based genome-wide analysis, and advanced state-of-art techniques that utilize long-read third-generation sequencing with Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore Technologies platforms. A boost in technical opportunities over recent decades has allowed a better understanding of the regulation of gene expression at the mRNA level.

An identification protocol for ESBL-producing Gram-negative bacteria bloodstream infections using a MinION nanopore sequencer,"Purpose:The new third-generation sequencing platform MinION is an attractive maintenance-free and disposable portable tool that can perform long-read and real-time sequencing. In this study, we validated this technology for the identification of pathogens from positive blood culture (BC) bottles.Methodology:A total of 38 positive BC bottles were collected from patients with bloodstream infections, and 18 isolates of Gram-negative (GN) bacteria and 20 isolates of Gram-positive (GP) bacteria were identified from these using 16S rRNA sequencing and then used in this study. DNA was extracted from each aliquot using an extraction protocol that combined glass bead beating and chemical lysis. Up to 200 ng of each purified DNA sample was processed for library preparation and whole-genome sequencing was performed on up to 12 samples through a single MinION flow cell.Results:All GN bacteria identifications made by MinION sequencing for 30 min using the What's In My Pot? (WIMP) workflow via EPI2ME on the basis of the most frequent classified reads were consistent with those made by 16S rRNA sequencing. On the other hand, for GP bacteria specimens, the identification results for 16S rRNA sequencing and MinION were only in agreement in 12 out of 20 (60.0 %) cases. ARMA analysis was able to detect extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-associated genes among various antimicrobial resistance-related genes.Conclusion:We demonstrated the potential of the MinION sequencer for the identification of GN bacteria from positive BC bottles and the confirmation of an ESBL phenotype. This innovative sequence technology and its application could lead to a breakthrough in the diagnosis of infectious diseases.",31237534,,10.1099/jmm.0.001024,12
"Chromosome-level genome assemblies of Cutaneotrichosporon spp. (Trichosporonales, Basidiomycota) reveal imbalanced evolution between nucleotide sequences and chromosome synteny","Background:Since DNA information was first used in taxonomy, barcode sequences such as the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region have greatly aided fungal identification; however, a barcode sequence alone is often insufficient. Thus, multi-gene- or whole-genome-based methods were developed. We previously isolated Basidiomycota yeasts classified in the Trichosporonales. Some strains were described as Cutaneotrichosporon cavernicola and C. spelunceum, whereas strain HIS471 remained unidentified. We analysed the genomes of these strains to elucidate their taxonomic relationship and genetic diversity.Results:The long-read-based assembly resulted in chromosome-level draft genomes consisting of seven chromosomes and one mitochondrial genome. The genome of strain HIS471 has more than ten chromosome inversions or translocations compared to the type strain of C. cavernicola despite sharing identical ITS barcode sequences and displaying an average nucleotide identity (ANI) above 93%. Also, the chromosome synteny between C. cavernicola and the related species, C. spelunceum, showed significant rearrangements, whereas the ITS sequence identity exceeds 98.6% and the ANI is approximately 82%. Our results indicate that the relative evolutionary rates of barcode sequences, whole-genome nucleotide sequences, and chromosome synteny in Cutaneotrichosporon significantly differ from those in the model yeast Saccharomyces.Conclusions:Our results revealed that the relative evolutionary rates of nucleotide sequences and chromosome synteny are different among fungal clades, likely because different clades have diverse mutation/repair rates and distinct selection pressures on their genomic sequences and syntenic structures. Because diverse syntenic structures can be a barrier to meiotic recombination and may lead to speciation, the non-linear relationships between nucleotide and synteny diversification indicate that sequence-level distances at the barcode or whole-genome level are not sufficient for delineating species boundaries.",37821828,PMC10568926,10.1186/s12864-023-09718-2,1
DMD exon 2 duplication due to a complex genomic rearrangement is associated with a somatic mosaicism,"We report the case of a patient with dystrophinopathy caused by DMD exon 2 duplication, showing marked asymmetric muscle atrophy. Immunostaining of the biopsied muscle tissue showed a mosaic staining, suggesting a somatic mosaicism. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis showed only one breakpoint, and long-read whole-genome sequencing revealed the entire structure of the rearranged sequence. The complex rearrangement was composed of two tandem duplications: one showed a microhomology near the breakpoint, suggesting a microhomology-mediated mechanism, whereas the other was associated with flanking short tandem repeats. The long-read sequencing also suggested the presence of a wild-type nonduplicated sequence, supporting somatic mosaicism. Whereas complementary DNA and western blot analyses were not useful, droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) analysis showed an average copy number of 1.61, enabling accurate estimation of the proportion of cells containing the duplication. Long-read sequencing and ddPCR analysis were useful for revealing the rearrangements and the precise copy number.",35093299,,10.1016/j.nmd.2021.12.004,3
Long-Read Single Molecule Sequencing to Resolve Tandem Gene Copies: The Mst77Y Region on the Drosophila melanogaster Y Chromosome,"The autosomal gene Mst77F of Drosophila melanogaster is essential for male fertility. In 2010, Krsticevic et al. (Genetics 184: 295-307) found 18 Y-linked copies of Mst77F (""Mst77Y""), which collectively account for 20% of the functional Mst77F-like mRNA. The Mst77Y genes were severely misassembled in the then-available genome assembly and were identified by cloning and sequencing polymerase chain reaction products. The genomic structure of the Mst77Y region and the possible existence of additional copies remained unknown. The recent publication of two long-read assemblies of D. melanogaster prompted us to reinvestigate this challenging region of the Y chromosome. We found that the Illumina Synthetic Long Reads assembly failed in the Mst77Y region, most likely because of its tandem duplication structure. The PacBio MHAP assembly of the Mst77Y region seems to be very accurate, as revealed by comparisons with the previously found Mst77Y genes, a bacterial artificial chromosome sequence, and Illumina reads of the same strain. We found that the Mst77Y region spans 96 kb and originated from a 3.4-kb transposition from chromosome 3L to the Y chromosome, followed by tandem duplications inside the Y chromosome and invasion of transposable elements, which account for 48% of its length. Twelve of the 18 Mst77Y genes found in 2010 were confirmed in the PacBio assembly, the remaining six being polymerase chain reaction-induced artifacts. There are several identical copies of some Mst77Y genes, coincidentally bringing the total copy number to 18. Besides providing a detailed picture of the Mst77Y region, our results highlight the utility of PacBio technology in assembling difficult genomic regions such as tandemly repeated genes.",25858959,PMC4478544,10.1534/g3.115.017277,25
Detecting PKD1 variants in polycystic kidney disease patients by single-molecule long-read sequencing,"A genetic diagnosis of autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is challenging due to allelic heterogeneity, high GC content, and homology of the PKD1 gene with six pseudogenes. Short-read next-generation sequencing approaches, such as whole-genome sequencing and whole-exome sequencing, often fail at reliably characterizing complex regions such as PKD1. However, long-read single-molecule sequencing has been shown to be an alternative strategy that could overcome PKD1 complexities and discriminate between homologous regions of PKD1 and its pseudogenes. In this study, we present the increased power of resolution for complex regions using long-read sequencing to characterize a cohort of 19 patients with ADPKD. Our approach provided high sensitivity in identifying PKD1 pathogenic variants, diagnosing 94.7% of the patients. We show that reliable screening of ADPKD patients in a single test without interference of PKD1 homologous sequences, commonly introduced by residual amplification of PKD1 pseudogenes, by direct long-read sequencing is now possible. This strategy can be implemented in diagnostics and is highly suitable to sequence and resolve complex genomic regions that are of clinical relevance.",28378423,PMC5488171,10.1002/humu.23223,22
MIRUReader: MIRU-VNTR typing directly from long sequencing reads,Summary:Mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit-variable number tandem repeat (MIRU-VNTR) typing is widely used to genotype Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex in epidemiological studies for tracking tuberculosis transmission. Recent long-read sequencing technologies from Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore Technologies can produce reads that are long enough to cover the entire repeat regions in each MIRU-VNTR locus which was previously not possible using the short reads from Illumina high-throughput sequencing technologies. We thus developed MIRUReader for MIRU-VNTR typing directly from long sequence reads.Availability and implementation:Source code and documentation for MIRUReader program is freely available at https://github.com/phglab/MIRUReader.Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.,31603462,,10.1093/bioinformatics/btz771,8
A survey of transcriptome complexity using PacBio single-molecule real-time analysis combined with Illumina RNA sequencing for a better understanding of ricinoleic acid biosynthesis in Ricinus communis,"Background:Ricinus communis is a highly economically valuable oil crop plant from the spurge family, Euphorbiaceae. However, the available reference genomes are incomplete and to date studies on ricinoleic acid biosynthesis at the transcriptional level are limited.Results:In this study, we combined PacBio single-molecule long read isoform and Illumina RNA sequencing to identify the alternative splicing (AS) events, novel isoforms, fusion genes, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and alternative polyadenylation (APA) sites to unveil the transcriptomic complexity of castor beans and identify critical genes related to ricinoleic acid biosynthesis. Here, we identified 11,285 AS-variants distributed in 21,448 novel genes and detected 520 fusion genes, 320 lncRNAs and 9511 (APA-sites). Furthermore, a total of 6067, 5983 and 4058 differentially expressed genes between developing beans of the R. communis lines 349 and 1115 with extremely different oil content were identified at 7, 14 and 21 days after flowering, respectively. Specifically, 14, 18 and 11 DEGs were annotated encoding key enzymes related to ricinoleic acid biosynthesis reflecting the higher castor oil content of 1115 compared than 349. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR further validated fifteen of these DEGs at three-time points.Conclusion:Our results significantly improved the existed gene models of R. communis, and a putative model of key genes was built to show the differences between strains 349 and 1115, illustrating the molecular mechanism of castor oil biosynthesis. A multi-transcriptome database and candidate genes were provided to further improve the level of ricinoleic acid in transgenic crops.",31170917,PMC6555039,10.1186/s12864-019-5832-9,15
Extending partial haplotypes to full genome haplotypes using chromosome conformation capture data,"Motivation:Complex interactions among alleles often drive differences in inherited properties including disease predisposition. Isolating the effects of these interactions requires phasing information that is difficult to measure or infer. Furthermore, prevalent sequencing technologies used in the essential first step of determining a haplotype limit the range of that step to the span of reads, namely hundreds of bases. With the advent of pseudo-long read technologies, observable partial haplotypes can span several orders of magnitude more. Yet, measuring whole-genome-single-individual haplotypes remains a challenge. A different view of whole genome measurement addresses the 3D structure of the genome-with great development of Hi-C techniques in recent years. A shortcoming of current Hi-C, however, is the difficulty in inferring information that is specific to each of a pair of homologous chromosomes.Results:In this work, we develop a robust algorithmic framework that takes two measurement derived datasets: raw Hi-C and partial short-range haplotypes, and constructs the full-genome haplotype as well as phased diploid Hi-C maps. By analyzing both data sets together we thus bridge important gaps in both technologies-from short to long haplotypes and from un-phased to phased Hi-C. We demonstrate that our method can recover ground truth haplotypes with high accuracy, using measured biological data as well as simulated data. We analyze the impact of noise, Hi-C sequencing depth and measured haplotype lengths on performance. Finally, we use the inferred 3D structure of a human genome to point at transcription factor targets nuclear co-localization.Availability and implementation:The implementation available at https://github.com/YakhiniGroup/SpectraPhContact:zohar.yakhini@gmail.comSupplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",27587675,,10.1093/bioinformatics/btw453,11
Single-molecule Sequencing of an Animal Mitochondrial Genome Reveals Chloroplast-like Architecture and Repeat-mediated Recombination,"Recent advances in long-read sequencing technology have allowed for single-molecule sequencing of entire mitochondrial genomes, opening the door for direct investigation of the mitochondrial genome architecture and recombination. We used PacBio sequencing to reassemble mitochondrial genomes from two species of New Zealand freshwater snails, Potamopyrgus antipodarum and Potamopyrgus estuarinus. These assemblies revealed a ∼1.7 kb structure within the mitochondrial genomes of both species that was previously undetected by an assembly of short reads and likely corresponding to a large noncoding region commonly present in the mitochondrial genomes. The overall architecture of these Potamopyrgus mitochondrial genomes is reminiscent of the chloroplast genomes of land plants, harboring a large single-copy (LSC) region and a small single-copy (SSC) region separated by a pair of inverted repeats (IRa and IRb). Individual sequencing reads that spanned across the Potamopyrgus IRa-SSC-IRb structure revealed the occurrence of a ""flip-flop"" recombination. We also detected evidence for two distinct IR haplotypes and recombination between them in wild-caught P. estuarinus, as well as extensive intermolecular recombination between single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the LSC region. The chloroplast-like architecture and repeat-mediated mitochondrial recombination we describe here raise fundamental questions regarding the origins and commonness of inverted repeats in cytoplasmic genomes and their role in mitochondrial genome evolution.",36625177,PMC9874032,10.1093/molbev/msad007,5
A chromosomal level genome sequence for Quasipaa spinosa (Dicroglossidae) reveals chromosomal evolution and population diversity,"Quasipaa spinosa is an Asian commercial Dicroglossidae species noted for its spiny chest found in adult males. Here, we report the first chromosomal level Q. spinosa genome employing PacBio long read sequencing and high-resolution chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) technology. The total length of the final assembled genome was 2,839,292,578 bp, with contig N50 of 3.79 Mb and scaffold N50 of 327.44 Mb. Approximately 99.30% of the length of the assembled genome sequences were anchored to 13 chromosomes with the assistance of Hi-C reads. A total of 26,173 protein-coding genes were predicted, and 95.98% of the genes were functionally annotated. The annotated genes covered a total of 92.10% of the complete vertebrate core gene set according to the BUSCO pipeline evaluation. Approximately 41 million years ago, Q. spinosa began to diverge from its dicroglossid sister taxon Nanorana parkeri. The Q. spinosa genome revealed obvious chromosomal fissions compared with Xenopus tropicalis, which probably represented a specific chromosome evolutionary history within frogs. Population analysis showed that Chinese Q. spinosa could be divided into eastern and western genetic clusters, with the western population showing higher diversity than the eastern population. The effective population size of Q. spinosa showed a continuously decreasing trend from one million years ago to 10,000 years ago. In summary, this study sheds light on Q. spinosa evolution and population differentiation, providing a valuable genomic resource for further biological and genetic studies on this species, and other closely related frog taxa.",34837460,,10.1111/1755-0998.13560,3
Accurate Typing of Human Leukocyte Antigen Class I Genes by Oxford Nanopore Sequencing,"Oxford Nanopore Technologies' MinION has expanded the current DNA sequencing toolkit by delivering long read lengths and extreme portability. The MinION has the potential to enable expedited point-of-care human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing, an assay routinely used to assess the immunologic compatibility between organ donors and recipients, but the platform's high error rate makes it challenging to type alleles with accuracy. We developed and validated accurate typing of HLA by Oxford nanopore (Athlon), a bioinformatic pipeline that i) maps nanopore reads to a database of known HLA alleles, ii) identifies candidate alleles with the highest read coverage at different resolution levels that are represented as branching nodes and leaves of a tree structure, iii) generates consensus sequences by remapping the reads to the candidate alleles, and iv) calls the final diploid genotype by blasting consensus sequences against the reference database. Using two independent data sets generated on the R9.4 flow cell chemistry, Athlon achieved a 100% accuracy in class I HLA typing at the two-field resolution.",29625249,PMC6039791,10.1016/j.jmoldx.2018.02.006,13
Direct sequencing of insect symbionts via nanopore adaptive sampling,"Insect symbionts can alter their host phenotype and their effects can range from beneficial to pathogenic. Moreover, many insects exhibit co-infections, making their study more challenging. Less than 1% of insect species have high-quality referenced genomes available and fewer still also have their symbionts sequenced. Two methods are commonly used to sequence symbionts: whole-genome sequencing to concomitantly capture the host and bacterial genomes, or isolation of the symbiont's genome before sequencing. These methods are limited when dealing with rare or poorly characterized symbionts. Long-read technology is an important tool to generate high-quality genomes as they can overcome high levels of heterozygosity, repeat content, and transposable elements that confound short-read methods. Oxford Nanopore (ONT) adaptive sampling allows a sequencing instrument to select or reject sequences in real time. We describe a method based on ONT adaptive sampling (subtractive) approach that readily permitted the sequencing of the complete genomes of mitochondria, Buchnera and its plasmids (pLeu, pTrp), and Wolbachia genomes in two aphid species, Aphis glycines and Pentalonia nigronervosa. Adaptive sampling is able to retrieve organelles such as mitochondria and symbionts that have high representation in their hosts such as Buchnera and Wolbachia, but is less successful at retrieving symbionts in low concentrations.",37926187,,10.1016/j.cois.2023.101135,0
Transition From PCR-Ribotyping to Whole Genome Sequencing Based Typing ofClostridioides difficile,"Clostridioides difficilecauses nosocomial outbreaks which can lead to severe and even life-threatening colitis. Rapid molecular diagnostic tests allow the identification of toxin-producing, potentially hypervirulent strains, which is critical for patient management and infection control. PCR-ribotyping has been used for decades as the reference standard to investigate transmission in suspected outbreaks. However, the introduction of whole genome sequencing (WGS) for molecular epidemiology provides a realistic alternative to PCR-ribotyping. In this transition phase it is crucial to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the two technologies, and to assess their correlation. We aimed to investigate ribotype prediction from WGS data, and options for analysis at different levels of analytical granularity. Ribotypes cannot be directly determined from short read Illumina sequence data as the rRNA operons including the ribotype-defining ISR fragments collapse in genome assemblies, and comparison with traditional PCR-ribotyping results becomes impossible. Ribotype extraction from long read Oxford nanopore data also requires optimization. We have compared WGS-based typing with PCR-ribotyping in nearly 300 clinical and environmental isolates from Switzerland, and in addition from the Enterobase database (n=1778). Our results show that while multi-locus sequence type (MLST) often correlates with a specific ribotype, the agreement is not complete, and for some ribotypes the resolution is insufficient. Using core genome MLST (cgMLST) analysis, there is an improved resolution and ribotypes can often be predicted within clusters, using cutoffs of 30-50 allele differences. The exceptions are ribotypes within known ribotype complexes such as RT078/RT106, where the genome differences in cgMLST do not reflect the ribotype segregation. We show that different ribotype clusters display different degrees of diversity, which could be important for the definition of ribotype cluster specific cutoffs. WGS-based analysis offers the ultimate resolution to the SNP level, enabling exploration of patient-to-patient transmission. PCR-ribotyping does not sufficiently discriminate to prove nosocomial transmission with certainty. We discuss the associated challenges and opportunities in a switch to WGS from conventional ribotyping forC. difficile.",34141631,PMC8204696,10.3389/fcimb.2021.681518,9
Near-chromosome level genome assembly of the fruit pest Drosophila suzukii using long-read sequencing,"Over the past decade, the spotted wing Drosophila, Drosophila suzukii, has invaded Europe and America and has become a major agricultural pest in these areas, thereby prompting intense research activities to better understand its biology. Two draft genome assemblies already exist for this species but contain pervasive assembly errors and are highly fragmented, which limits their values. Our purpose here was to improve the assembly of the D. suzukii genome and to annotate it in a way that facilitates comparisons with D. melanogaster. For this, we generated PacBio long-read sequencing data and assembled a novel, high-quality D. suzukii genome assembly. It is one of the largest Drosophila genomes, notably because of the expansion of its repeatome. We found that despite 16 rounds of full-sib crossings the D. suzukii strain that we sequenced has maintained high levels of polymorphism in some regions of its genome. As a consequence, the quality of the assembly of these regions was reduced. We explored possible origins of this high residual diversity, including the presence of structural variants and a possible heterogeneous admixture pattern of North American and Asian ancestry. Overall, our assembly and annotation constitute a high-quality genomic resource that can be used for both high-throughput sequencing approaches, as well as manipulative genetic technologies to study D. suzukii.",32641717,PMC7343843,10.1038/s41598-020-67373-z,21
PacBio long read-assembled draft genome of Pythium insidiosum strain Pi-S isolated from a Thai patient with pythiosis,"Objectives:Pythium insidiosum is the causative agent of pythiosis, a difficult-to-treat condition, in humans and animals worldwide. Biological information about this filamentous microorganism is sparse. Genomes of several P. insidiosum strains were sequenced using the Illumina short-read NGS platform, producing incomplete genome sequence data. PacBio long-read platform was employed to obtain a better-quality genome of Pythium insidiosum. The obtained genome data could promote basic research on the pathogen's biology and pathogenicity.Data description:gDNA sample was extracted from the P. insidiosum strain Pi-S for whole-genome sequencing by PacBio long-read NGS platform. Raw reads were assembled using CANU (v2.1), polished using ARROW (SMRT link version 5.0.1), aligned with the original raw PacBio reads using pbmm2 (v1.2.1), consensus sequence checked using ARROW, and gene predicted using Funannotate pipeline (v1.7.4). The genome completion was assessed using BUSCO (v4.0.2). As a result, 840 contigs (maximum length: 1.3 Mb; N50: 229.9 Kb; L50: 70) were obtained. Sequence assembly showed a genome size of 66.7 Mb (178x coverage; 57.2% G-C content) that contained 20,375 ORFs. A BUSCO-based assessment revealed 85.5% genome completion. All assembled contig sequences have been deposited in the NCBI database under the accession numbers BBXB02000001 - BBXB02000840.",37833791,PMC10576409,10.1186/s13104-023-06532-7,0
Comprehensive analysis of structural variants in breast cancer genomes using single-molecule sequencing,"Improved identification of structural variants (SVs) in cancer can lead to more targeted and effective treatment options as well as advance our basic understanding of the disease and its progression. We performed whole-genome sequencing of the SKBR3 breast cancer cell line and patient-derived tumor and normal organoids from two breast cancer patients using Illumina/10x Genomics, Pacific Biosciences (PacBio), and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing. We then inferred SVs and large-scale allele-specific copy number variants (CNVs) using an ensemble of methods. Our findings show that long-read sequencing allows for substantially more accurate and sensitive SV detection, with between 90% and 95% of variants supported by each long-read technology also supported by the other. We also report high accuracy for long reads even at relatively low coverage (25×-30×). Furthermore, we integrated SV and CNV data into a unifying karyotype-graph structure to present a more accurate representation of the mutated cancer genomes. We find hundreds of variants within known cancer-related genes detectable only through long-read sequencing. These findings highlight the need for long-read sequencing of cancer genomes for the precise analysis of their genetic instability.",32887686,PMC7545150,10.1101/gr.260497.119,52
Long-read sequencing to understand genome biology and cell function,"Determining the sequence of DNA and RNA molecules has a huge impact on the understanding of cell biology and function. Recent advancements in next-generation short-read sequencing (NGS) technologies, drops in cost and a resolution down to the single-cell level shaped our current view on genome structure and function. Third-generation sequencing (TGS) methods further complete the knowledge about these processes based on long reads and the ability to analyze DNA or RNA at single molecule level. Long-read sequencing provides additional possibilities to study genome architecture and the composition of highly complex regions and to determine epigenetic modifications of nucleotide bases at a genome-wide level. We discuss the principles and advancements of long-read sequencing and its applications in genome biology.",32629027,,10.1016/j.biocel.2020.105799,13
metaFlye: scalable long-read metagenome assembly using repeat graphs,"Long-read sequencing technologies have substantially improved the assemblies of many isolate bacterial genomes as compared to fragmented short-read assemblies. However, assembling complex metagenomic datasets remains difficult even for state-of-the-art long-read assemblers. Here we present metaFlye, which addresses important long-read metagenomic assembly challenges, such as uneven bacterial composition and intra-species heterogeneity. First, we benchmarked metaFlye using simulated and mock bacterial communities and show that it consistently produces assemblies with better completeness and contiguity than state-of-the-art long-read assemblers. Second, we performed long-read sequencing of the sheep microbiome and applied metaFlye to reconstruct 63 complete or nearly complete bacterial genomes within single contigs. Finally, we show that long-read assembly of human microbiomes enables the discovery of full-length biosynthetic gene clusters that encode biomedically important natural products.",33020656,PMC10699202,10.1038/s41592-020-00971-x,268
Identification and Characterization of Splicing Defects by Single-Molecule Real-Time Sequencing Technology (PacBio),"Although DNA-sequencing is the most effective procedure to achieve a molecular diagnosis in genetic diseases, complementary RNA analyses are often required.Reverse-Transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is still a valuable option when the clinical phenotype and/or available DNA-test results address the diagnosis toward a gene of interest or when the splicing effect of a single variant needs to be assessed.We use Single-Molecule Real-Time sequencing to detect and characterize splicing defects and single nucleotide variants in well-known disease genes (DMD, NF1, TTN). After proper optimization, the procedure could be used in the diagnostic setting, simplifying the workflow of cDNA analysis.",32597815,,10.3233/JND-200523,5
Cataloging Plant Genome Structural Variations,"Structural variation (SV) is a type of genetic variation identified through the comparison of genome structures which often have direct and significant associations with phenotypic variations. Building on the next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, research on plant structural variations are gaining momentum and have revolutionized our view on the functional impact of the 'hidden' diversity that were largely understudied before. Herein, we first describe the current state of plant genomic SV research based on NGS and in particular focus on the biological insights gained from the large-scale identification of various types of plant SVs. Specific examples are chosen to demonstrate the genetic basis for phenotype diversity in model plant and major agricultural crops. Additionally, development of new genomic mapping technologies, including optical mapping and long read sequencing, as well as improved computational algorithms associated with these technologies have helped to pinpoint the exact nature and location of genomic SVs with much better resolution and precision. Future direction of plant research on SVs should focus on the population level to build a comprehensive catalog of SVs, leading to full assessment of their impact on biological diversity.",28885182,,10.21775/cimb.027.181,5
Full-length transcriptome sequencing reveals extreme incomplete annotation of the goat genome,"Despite recent advances in generating high-quality reference genome assemblies, the genome sequences for most livestock species, including goats, are still poorly annotated. Single-molecule long-read sequencing has greatly facilitated gene annotation by obtaining full-length transcripts. In this study, we generated full-length transcriptome data for samples from abomasum (n = 2) and testicle (n = 1), using PacBio Iso-Seq technology. We further combined these data with published data from abomasum (5ZY, SRR8618141) to evaluate and improve the gene annotation of the goat genome. We identified 14.5-16.3% of novel genes per sample from the four Iso-Seq datasets. At the transcript level, 40.6% of them were novel, including 29.7% novel transcripts from known genes and 10.9% from novel genes. We further verified the expression of novel genes in four additional RNA-seq data and found that the expression level of novel genes was significantly lower than that of known genes, indicating that the lowly expressed genes tend to be missed in the current genome annotation. This study shows the superiority of full-length transcriptome data in gene annotation, and more such data are required to improve the gene annotation for goat genome and other species.",36849788,,10.1111/age.13311,1
Chromosome-level genome assembly of Asian yellow pond turtle (Mauremys mutica) with temperature-dependent sex determination system,"Knowledge of sex determination has important implications in physiology, ecology and genetics, but the evolutionary mechanisms of sex determination systems in turtles have not been fully elucidated, due to a lack of reference genomes. Here, we generate a high-quality genome assembly of Asian yellow pond turtle (Mauremys mutica) using continuous long-read (PacBio platform), Illumina, and high-throughput chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) technologies. The M. mutica haplotype has a genome size of 2.23 Gb with a contig N50 of 8.53 Mb and scaffold N50 of 141.98 Mb. 99.98% sequences of the total assembly are anchored to 26 pseudochromosomes. Comparative genomics analysis indicated that the lizard-snake-tuatara clade diverged from the bird-crocodilian-turtle clade at approximately 267.0-312.3 Mya. Intriguingly, positive selected genes are mostly enriched in the calcium signaling pathway and neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, which are involved in the process of temperature-dependent sex determination. These findings provide important evolutionary insights into temperature-dependent sex determination system.",35550586,PMC9098631,10.1038/s41598-022-12054-2,7
"Genomic analysis of 495 vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium reveals broad dissemination of a vanA plasmid in more than 19 clones from Copenhagen, Denmark","Objectives:From 2012 to 2014, there has been a huge increase in vancomycin-resistant (vanA) Enterococcus faecium (VREfm) in Copenhagen, Denmark, with 602 patients infected or colonized with VREfm in 2014 compared with just 22 in 2012. The objective of this study was to describe the genetic epidemiology of VREfm to assess the contribution of clonal spread and horizontal transfer of the vanA transposon (Tn1546) and plasmid in the dissemination of VREfm in hospitals.Methods:VREfm from Copenhagen, Denmark (2012-14) were whole-genome sequenced. The clonal structure was determined and the structure of Tn1546-like transposons was characterized. One VREfm isolate belonging to the largest clonal group was sequenced using long-read technology to close a 37 kb vanA plasmid.Results:Phylogeny revealed a polyclonal structure where 495 VREfm isolates were divided into 13 main groups and 7 small groups. The majority of the isolates were located in three groups (n = 44, 100 and 218) and clonal spread of VREfm between wards and hospitals was identified. Five Tn1546-like transposon types were identified. A dominant truncated transposon (type 4, 92%) was spread across all but one VREfm group. The closed vanA plasmid was highly covered by reads from isolates containing the type 4 transposon.Conclusions:This study suggests that it was the dissemination of the type 4 Tn1546-like transposon and plasmid via horizontal transfer to multiple populations of E. faecium, followed by clonal spread of new VREfm clones, that contributed to the increase in and diversity of VREfm in Danish hospitals.",27605596,,10.1093/jac/dkw360,18
An update of the salmon louse (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) reference genome assembly,"Salmon lice have plagued the salmon farming industry and have negatively impacted salmon populations in the wild. In response, researchers have generated high density genetic maps, genome assemblies, transcriptomes, and whole-genome resequencing data to better understand this parasite. In this study, we used long-read sequencing technology to update the previous genome assemblies of Atlantic Ocean salmon lice with a more contiguous assembly and a more comprehensive gene catalog of Pacific Ocean salmon lice. We were also able to further characterize genomic features previously identified from other studies by using published resequenced genomes of 25 Atlantic and 15 Pacific salmon lice. One example was further characterizing the ZW sex chromosomes. For both the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean salmon lice subspecies, we found that the female W-chromosome is only a small fraction of the Z-chromosome and that the vast majority of the W and Z-chromosome do not contain conserved regions (i.e. pseudoautosomal regions). However, conserved orthologous protein sequences can still be identified between the W- and Z-chromosomes.",35404448,PMC9157166,10.1093/g3journal/jkac087,0
Robust long-read native DNA sequencing using the ONT CsgG Nanopore system,"Background:The ability to obtain long read lengths during DNA sequencing has several potentially important practical applications. Especially long read lengths have been reported using the Nanopore sequencing method, currently commercially available from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT). However, early reports have demonstrated only limited levels of combined throughput and sequence accuracy. Recently, ONT released a new CsgG pore sequencing system as well as a 250b/s translocation chemistry with potential for improvements.Methods:We made use of such components on ONTs miniature 'MinION' device and sequenced native genomic DNA obtained from the near haploid cancer cell line HAP1. Analysis of our data was performed utilising recently described computational tools tailored for nanopore/long-read sequencing outputs, and here we present our key findings.Results:From a single sequencing run, we obtained ~240,000 high-quality mapped reads, comprising a total of ~2.3 billion bases. A mean read length of 9.6kb and an N50 of ~17kb was achieved, while sequences mapped to reference with a mean identity of 85%. Notably, we obtained ~68X coverage of the mitochondrial genome and were able to achieve a mean consensus identity of 99.8% for sequenced mtDNA reads.Conclusions:With improved sequencing chemistries already released and higher-throughput instruments in the pipeline, this early study suggests that ONT CsgG-based sequencing may be a useful option for potential practical long-read applications.",28503666,PMC5426553,10.12688/wellcomeopenres.11246.3,24
PacBio single-molecule long-read sequencing shed new light on the complexity of the Carex breviculmis transcriptome,"Background:Carex L., a grass genus commonly known as sedges, is distributed worldwide and contributes constructively to turf management, forage production, and ecological conservation. The development of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies has considerably improved our understanding of transcriptome complexity of Carex L. and provided a valuable genetic reference. However, the current transcriptome is not satisfactory mainly because of the enormous difficulty in obtaining full-length transcripts.Results:In this study, we employed PacBio single-molecule long-read sequencing (SMRT) technology for whole-transcriptome profiling in Carex breviculmis. We generated 60,353 high-confidence non-redundant transcripts with an average length of 2302-bp. A total of 3588 alternative splicing events, and 1273 long non-coding RNAs were identified. Furthermore, 40,347 complete coding sequences were predicted, providing an informative reference transcriptome. In addition, the transcriptional regulation mechanism of C. breviculmis in response to shade stress was further explored by mapping the NGS data to the reference transcriptome constructed by SMRT sequencing.Conclusions:This study provided a full-length reference transcriptome of C. breviculmis using the SMRT sequencing method for the first time. The transcriptome atlas obtained will not only facilitate future functional genomics studies but also pave the way for further selective and genic engineering breeding projects for C. breviculmis.",31664898,PMC6821003,10.1186/s12864-019-6163-6,12
Complete Sequence of a 641-kb Insertion of Mitochondrial DNA in the Arabidopsis thaliana Nuclear Genome,"Intracellular transfers of mitochondrial DNA continue to shape nuclear genomes. Chromosome 2 of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana contains one of the largest known nuclear insertions of mitochondrial DNA (numts). Estimated at over 600 kb in size, this numt is larger than the entire Arabidopsis mitochondrial genome. The primary Arabidopsis nuclear reference genome contains less than half of the numt because of its structural complexity and repetitiveness. Recent data sets generated with improved long-read sequencing technologies (PacBio HiFi) provide an opportunity to finally determine the accurate sequence and structure of this numt. We performed a de novo assembly using sequencing data from recent initiatives to span the Arabidopsis centromeres, producing a gap-free sequence of the Chromosome 2 numt, which is 641 kb in length and has 99.933% nucleotide sequence identity with the actual mitochondrial genome. The numt assembly is consistent with the repetitive structure previously predicted from fiber-based fluorescent in situ hybridization. Nanopore sequencing data indicate that the numt has high levels of cytosine methylation, helping to explain its biased spectrum of nucleotide sequence divergence and supporting previous inferences that it is transcriptionally inactive. The original numt insertion appears to have involved multiple mitochondrial DNA copies with alternative structures that subsequently underwent an additional duplication event within the nuclear genome. This work provides insights into numt evolution, addresses one of the last unresolved regions of the Arabidopsis reference genome, and represents a resource for distinguishing between highly similar numt and mitochondrial sequences in studies of transcription, epigenetic modifications, and de novo mutations.",35446419,PMC9071559,10.1093/gbe/evac059,12
Tracking Alternatively Spliced Isoforms from Long Reads by SpliceHunter,"Alternative splicing increases the functional complexity of a genome by generating multiple isoforms and potentially proteins from the same gene. Vast amounts of alternative splicing events are routinely detected by short read deep sequencing technologies but their functional interpretation is hampered by an uncertain transcript context. Emerging long-read sequencing technologies provide a more complete picture of full-length transcript sequences. We introduce SpliceHunter, a tool for the computational interpretation of long reads generated by for example Pacific Biosciences instruments. SpliceHunter defines and tracks isoforms and novel transcription units across time points, compares their splicing pattern to a reference annotation, and translates them into potential protein sequences.",29508290,,10.1007/978-1-4939-7710-9_5,3
Genome structural variation in human evolution,"Structural variation (SV) is a large difference (typically >100 bp) in the genomic structure of two genomes and includes both copy number variation and variation that does not change copy number of a genomic region, such as an inversion. Improved reference genomes, combined with widespread genome sequencing using short-read sequencing technology, and increasingly using long-read sequencing, have reignited interest in SV. Recent large-scale studies and functional focused analyses have highlighted the role of SV in human evolution. In this review, we highlight human-specific SVs involved in changes in the brain, population-specific SVs that affect response to the environment, including adaptation to diet and infectious diseases, and summarise the contribution of archaic hominin admixture to present-day human SV.",34284881,,10.1016/j.tig.2021.06.015,28
"A genome resource for Acacia, Australia's largest plant genus","Acacia (Leguminosae, Caesalpinioideae, mimosoid clade) is the largest and most widespread genus of plants in the Australian flora, occupying and dominating a diverse range of environments, with an equally diverse range of forms. For a genus of its size and importance, Acacia currently has surprisingly few genomic resources. Acacia pycnantha, the golden wattle, is a woody shrub or tree occurring in south-eastern Australia and is the country's floral emblem. To assemble a genome for A. pycnantha, we generated long-read sequences using Oxford Nanopore Technology, 10x Genomics Chromium linked reads, and short-read Illumina sequences, and produced an assembly spanning 814 Mb, with a scaffold N50 of 2.8 Mb, and 98.3% of complete Embryophyta BUSCOs. Genome annotation predicted 47,624 protein-coding genes, with 62.3% of the genome predicted to comprise transposable elements. Evolutionary analyses indicated a shared genome duplication event in the Caesalpinioideae, and conflict in the relationships between Cercis (subfamily Cercidoideae) and subfamilies Caesalpinioideae and Papilionoideae (pea-flowered legumes). Comparative genomics identified a suite of expanded and contracted gene families in A. pycnantha, and these were annotated with both GO terms and KEGG functional categories. One expanded gene family of particular interest is involved in flowering time and may be associated with the characteristic synchronous flowering of Acacia. This genome assembly and annotation will be a valuable resource for all studies involving Acacia, including the evolution, conservation, breeding, invasiveness, and physiology of the genus, and for comparative studies of legumes.",36240205,PMC9565413,10.1371/journal.pone.0274267,3
A hidden layer of structural variation in transposable elements reveals potential genetic modifiers in human disease-risk loci,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been highly informative in discovering disease-associated loci but are not designed to capture all structural variations in the human genome. Using long-read sequencing data, we discovered widespread structural variation within SINE-VNTR-Alu(SVA) elements, a class of great ape-specific transposable elements with gene-regulatory roles, which represents a major source of structural variability in the human population. We highlight the presence of structurally variable SVAs (SV-SVAs) in neurological disease-associated loci, and we further associate SV-SVAs to disease-associated SNPs and differential gene expression using luciferase assays and expression quantitative trait loci data. Finally, we genetically deleted SV-SVAs in theBIN1andCD2APAlzheimer's disease-associated risk loci and in theBCKDKParkinson's disease-associated risk locus and assessed multiple aspects of their gene-regulatory influence in a human neuronal context. Together, this study reveals a novel layer of genetic variation in transposable elements that may contribute to identification of the structural variants that are the actual drivers of disease associations of GWAS loci.",35332097,PMC8997352,10.1101/gr.275515.121,8
Benchmark datasets for SARS-CoV-2 surveillance bioinformatics,"Background:Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has spread globally and is being surveilled with an international genome sequencing effort. Surveillance consists of sample acquisition, library preparation, and whole genome sequencing. This has necessitated a classification scheme detailing Variants of Concern (VOC) and Variants of Interest (VOI), and the rapid expansion of bioinformatics tools for sequence analysis. These bioinformatic tools are means for major actionable results: maintaining quality assurance and checks, defining population structure, performing genomic epidemiology, and inferring lineage to allow reliable and actionable identification and classification. Additionally, the pandemic has required public health laboratories to reach high throughput proficiency in sequencing library preparation and downstream data analysis rapidly. However, both processes can be limited by a lack of a standardized sequence dataset.Methods:We identified six SARS-CoV-2 sequence datasets from recent publications, public databases and internal resources. In addition, we created a method to mine public databases to identify representative genomes for these datasets. Using this novel method, we identified several genomes as either VOI/VOC representatives or non-VOI/VOC representatives. To describe each dataset, we utilized a previously published datasets format, which describes accession information and whole dataset information. Additionally, a script from the same publication has been enhanced to download and verify all data from this study.Results:The benchmark datasets focus on the two most widely used sequencing platforms: long read sequencing data from the Oxford Nanopore Technologies platform and short read sequencing data from the Illumina platform. There are six datasets: three were derived from recent publications; two were derived from data mining public databases to answer common questions not covered by published datasets; one unique dataset representing common sequence failures was obtained by rigorously scrutinizing data that did not pass quality checks. The dataset summary table, data mining script and quality control (QC) values for all sequence data are publicly available on GitHub: https://github.com/CDCgov/datasets-sars-cov-2.Discussion:The datasets presented here were generated to help public health laboratories build sequencing and bioinformatics capacity, benchmark different workflows and pipelines, and calibrate QC thresholds to ensure sequencing quality. Together, improvements in these areas support accurate and timely outbreak investigation and surveillance, providing actionable data for pandemic management. Furthermore, these publicly available and standardized benchmark data will facilitate the development and adjudication of new pipelines.",36093336,PMC9454940,10.7717/peerj.13821,2
Benchmarking of next and third generation sequencing technologies and their associated algorithms forde novogenome assembly,"Genome assemblers are computational tools forde novogenome assembly, based on a plenitude of primary sequencing data. The quality of genome assemblies is estimated by their contiguity and the occurrences of misassemblies (duplications, deletions, translocations or inversions). The rapid development of sequencing technologies has enabled the rise of novelde novogenome assembly strategies. The ultimate goal of such strategies is to utilise the features of each sequencing platform in order to address the existing weaknesses of each sequencing type and compose a complete and correct genome map. In the present study, the hybrid strategy, which is based on Illumina short paired‑end reads and Nanopore long reads, was benchmarked using MaSuRCA and Wengan assemblers. Moreover, the long‑read assembly strategy, which is based on Nanopore reads, was benchmarked using Canu or PacBio HiFi reads were benchmarked using Hifiasm and HiCanu. The assemblies were performed on a computational cluster with limited computational resources. Their outputs were evaluated in terms of accuracy and computational performance. PacBio HiFi assembly strategy outperforms the other ones, while Hi‑C scaffolding, which is based on chromatin 3D structure, is required in order to increase continuity, accuracy and completeness when large and complex genomes, such as the human one, are assembled. The use of Hi‑C data is also necessary while using the hybrid assembly strategy. The results revealed that HiFi sequencing enabled the rise of novel algorithms which require less genome coverage than that of the other strategies making the assembly a less computationally demanding task. Taken together, these developments may lead to the democratisation of genome assembly projects which are now approachable by smaller labs with limited technical and financial resources.",33537807,PMC7893683,10.3892/mmr.2021.11890,12
A variant selection framework for genome graphs,"Motivation:Variation graph representations are projected to either replace or supplement conventional single genome references due to their ability to capture population genetic diversity and reduce reference bias. Vast catalogues of genetic variants for many species now exist, and it is natural to ask which among these are crucial to circumvent reference bias during read mapping.Results:In this work, we propose a novel mathematical framework for variant selection, by casting it in terms of minimizing variation graph size subject to preserving paths of length α with at most δ differences. This framework leads to a rich set of problems based on the types of variants [e.g. single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), indels or structural variants (SVs)], and whether the goal is to minimize the number of positions at which variants are listed or to minimize the total number of variants listed. We classify the computational complexity of these problems and provide efficient algorithms along with their software implementation when feasible. We empirically evaluate the magnitude of graph reduction achieved in human chromosome variation graphs using multiple α and δ parameter values corresponding to short and long-read resequencing characteristics. When our algorithm is run with parameter settings amenable to long-read mapping (α = 10 kbp, δ = 1000), 99.99% SNPs and 73% SVs can be safely excluded from human chromosome 1 variation graph. The graph size reduction can benefit downstream pan-genome analysis.Availability and implementation:: https://github.com/AT-CG/VF.Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",34252945,PMC8336592,10.1093/bioinformatics/btab302,3
A highly contiguous reference genome for the Steller's jay (Cyanocitta stelleri),"The Steller's jay is a familiar bird of western forests from Alaska south to Nicaragua. Here, we report a draft reference assembly for the species generated from PacBio HiFi long-read and Omni-C chromatin-proximity sequencing data as part of the California Conservation Genomics Project (CCGP). Sequenced reads were assembled into 352 scaffolds totaling 1.16 Gb in length. Assembly metrics indicate a highly contiguous and complete assembly with a contig N50 of 7.8 Mb, scaffold N50 of 25.8 Mb, and BUSCO completeness score of 97.2%. Repetitive elements span 16.6% of the genome including nearly 90% of the W chromosome. Compared with high-quality assemblies from other members of the family Corvidae, the Steller's jay genome contains a larger proportion of repetitive elements than 4 crow species (Corvus), but a lower proportion of repetitive elements than the California scrub-jay (Aphelocoma californica). This reference genome will serve as an essential resource for future studies on speciation, local adaptation, phylogeography, and conservation genetics in this species of significant biological interest.",37395718,PMC10445514,10.1093/jhered/esad042,2
Novel viral splicing events and open reading frames revealed by long-read direct RNA sequencing of adenovirus transcripts,"Adenovirus is a common human pathogen that relies on host cell processes for transcription and processing of viral RNA and protein production. Although adenoviral promoters, splice junctions, and polyadenylation sites have been characterized using low-throughput biochemical techniques or short read cDNA-based sequencing, these technologies do not fully capture the complexity of the adenoviral transcriptome. By combining Illumina short-read and nanopore long-read direct RNA sequencing approaches, we mapped transcription start sites and RNA cleavage and polyadenylation sites across the adenovirus genome. In addition to confirming the known canonical viral early and late RNA cassettes, our analysis of splice junctions within long RNA reads revealed an additional 35 novel viral transcripts that meet stringent criteria for expression. These RNAs include fourteen new splice junctions which lead to expression of canonical open reading frames (ORFs), six novel ORF-containing transcripts, and 15 transcripts encoding for messages that could alter protein functions through truncation or fusion of canonical ORFs. In addition, we detect RNAs that bypass canonical cleavage sites and generate potential chimeric proteins by linking distinct gene transcription units. Among these chimeric proteins we detected an evolutionarily conserved protein containing the N-terminus of E4orf6 fused to the downstream DBP/E2A ORF. Loss of this novel protein, E4orf6/DBP, was associated with aberrant viral replication center morphology and poor viral spread.

Long-read sequencing and de novo genome assemblies reveal complex chromosome end structures caused by telomere dysfunction at the single nucleotide level,"Karyotype change and subsequent evolution is triggered by chromosome fusion and rearrangement events, which often occur when telomeres become dysfunctional. Telomeres protect linear chromosome ends from DNA damage responses (DDRs), and telomere dysfunction may result in genome instability. However, the complex chromosome end structures and the other possible consequences of telomere dysfunction have rarely been resolved at the nucleotide level due to the lack of the high-throughput methods needed to analyse these highly repetitive regions. Here we applied long-read sequencing technology to Caenorhabditis elegans survivor lines that emerged after telomere dysfunction. The survivors have preserved traces of DDRs in their genomes and our data revealed that variants generated by telomere dysfunction are accumulated along all chromosomes. The reconstruction of the chromosome end structures through de novo genome assemblies revealed diverse types of telomere damage processing at the nucleotide level. When telomeric repeats were totally eroded by telomere dysfunction, DDRs were mostly terminated by chromosome fusion events. We also partially reconstructed the most complex end structure and its DDR signatures, which would have been accumulated via multiple cell divisions. These finely resolved chromosome end structures suggest possible mechanisms regarding the repair processes after telomere dysfunction, providing insights into chromosome evolution in nature.",33693840,PMC8034613,10.1093/nar/gkab141,7
Rapid host strain improvement by in vivo rearrangement of a synthetic yeast chromosome,"Synthetic biology tools, such as modular parts and combinatorial DNA assembly, are routinely used to optimise the productivity of heterologous metabolic pathways for biosynthesis or substrate utilisation, yet it is well established that host strain background is just as important for determining productivity. Here we report that in vivo combinatorial genomic rearrangement of Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast with a synthetic chromosome V can rapidly generate new, improved host strains with genetic backgrounds favourable to diverse heterologous pathways, including those for violacein and penicillin biosynthesis and for xylose utilisation. We show how the modular rearrangement of synthetic chromosomes by SCRaMbLE can be easily determined using long-read nanopore sequencing and we explore experimental conditions that optimise diversification and screening. This synthetic genome approach to metabolic engineering provides productivity improvements in a fast, simple and accessible way, making it a valuable addition to existing strain improvement techniques.",29789540,PMC5964169,10.1038/s41467-018-03143-w,49
A guide for the diagnosis of rare and undiagnosed disease: beyond the exome,"Rare diseases affect 30 million people in the USA and more than 300-400 million worldwide, often causing chronic illness, disability, and premature death. Traditional diagnostic techniques rely heavily on heuristic approaches, coupling clinical experience from prior rare disease presentations with the medical literature. A large number of rare disease patients remain undiagnosed for years and many even die without an accurate diagnosis. In recent years, gene panels, microarrays, and exome sequencing have helped to identify the molecular cause of such rare and undiagnosed diseases. These technologies have allowed diagnoses for a sizable proportion (25-35%) of undiagnosed patients, often with actionable findings. However, a large proportion of these patients remain undiagnosed. In this review, we focus on technologies that can be adopted if exome sequencing is unrevealing. We discuss the benefits of sequencing the whole genome and the additional benefit that may be offered by long-read technology, pan-genome reference, transcriptomics, metabolomics, proteomics, and methyl profiling. We highlight computational methods to help identify regionally distant patients with similar phenotypes or similar genetic mutations. Finally, we describe approaches to automate and accelerate genomic analysis. The strategies discussed here are intended to serve as a guide for clinicians and researchers in the next steps when encountering patients with non-diagnostic exomes.",35220969,PMC8883622,10.1186/s13073-022-01026-w,75
Nanopore sequencing of single-cell transcriptomes with scCOLOR-seq,"Here we describe single-cell corrected long-read sequencing (scCOLOR-seq), which enables error correction of barcode and unique molecular identifier oligonucleotide sequences and permits standalone cDNA nanopore sequencing of single cells. Barcodes and unique molecular identifiers are synthesized using dimeric nucleotide building blocks that allow error detection. We illustrate the use of the method for evaluating barcode assignment accuracy, differential isoform usage in myeloma cell lines, and fusion transcript detection in a sarcoma cell line.",34211161,PMC8668430,10.1038/s41587-021-00965-w,36
Combining 16S rRNA gene variable regions enables high-resolution microbial community profiling,"Background:Most of our knowledge about the remarkable microbial diversity on Earth comes from sequencing the 16S rRNA gene. The use of next-generation sequencing methods has increased sample number and sequencing depth, but the read length of the most widely used sequencing platforms today is quite short, requiring the researcher to choose a subset of the gene to sequence (typically 16-33% of the total length). Thus, many bacteria may share the same amplified region, and the resolution of profiling is inherently limited. Platforms that offer ultra-long read lengths, whole genome shotgun sequencing approaches, and computational frameworks formerly suggested by us and by others all allow different ways to circumvent this problem yet suffer various shortcomings. There is a need for a simple and low-cost 16S rRNA gene-based profiling approach that harnesses the short read length to provide a much larger coverage of the gene to allow for high resolution, even in harsh conditions of low bacterial biomass and fragmented DNA.Results:This manuscript suggests Short MUltiple Regions Framework (SMURF), a method to combine sequencing results from different PCR-amplified regions to provide one coherent profiling. The de facto amplicon length is the total length of all amplified regions, thus providing much higher resolution compared to current techniques. Computationally, the method solves a convex optimization problem that allows extremely fast reconstruction and requires only moderate memory. We demonstrate the increase in resolution by in silico simulations and by profiling two mock mixtures and real-world biological samples. Reanalyzing a mock mixture from the Human Microbiome Project achieved about twofold improvement in resolution when combing two independent regions. Using a custom set of six primer pairs spanning about 1200 bp (80%) of the 16S rRNA gene, we were able to achieve ~ 100-fold improvement in resolution compared to a single region, over a mock mixture of common human gut bacterial isolates. Finally, the profiling of a Drosophila melanogaster microbiome using the set of six primer pairs provided a ~ 100-fold increase in resolution and thus enabling efficient downstream analysis.Conclusions:SMURF enables the identification of near full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences in microbial communities, having resolution superior compared to current techniques. It may be applied to standard sample preparation protocols with very little modifications. SMURF also paves the way to high-resolution profiling of low-biomass and fragmented DNA, e.g., in the case of formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded samples, fossil-derived DNA, or DNA exposed to other degrading conditions. The approach is not restricted to combining amplicons of the 16S rRNA gene and may be applied to any set of amplicons, e.g., in multilocus sequence typing (MLST).",29373999,PMC5787238,10.1186/s40168-017-0396-x,85
Short arms of human acrocentric chromosomes and the completion of the human genome sequence,"The complete, ungapped sequence of the short arms of human acrocentric chromosomes (SAACs) is still unknown almost 20 years after the near completion of the Human Genome Project. Yet these short arms of Chromosomes 13, 14, 15, 21, and 22 contain the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) genes, which are of paramount importance for human biology. The sequences of SAACs show an extensive variation in the copy number of the various repetitive elements, the full extent of which is currently unknown. In addition, the full spectrum of repeated sequences, their organization, and the low copy number functional elements are also unknown. The Telomere-to-Telomere (T2T) Project using mainly long-read sequence technology has recently completed the assembly of the genome from a hydatidiform mole, CHM13, and has thus established a baseline reference for further studies on the organization, variation, functional annotation, and impact in human disorders of all the previously unknown genomic segments, including the SAACs. The publication of the initial results of the T2T Project will update and improve the reference genome for a better understanding of the evolution and function of the human genome.",35361624,PMC8997349,10.1101/gr.275350.121,7
Efficient Recovery of Complete Gut Viral Genomes by Combined Short- and Long-Read Sequencing,"Current metagenome assembled human gut phage catalogs contained mostly fragmented genomes. Here, comprehensive gut virome detection procedure is developed involving virus-like particle (VLP) enrichment from ≈500 g feces and combined sequencing of short- and long-read. Applied to 135 samples, a Chinese Gut Virome Catalog (CHGV) is assembled consisting of 21,499 non-redundant viral operational taxonomic units (vOTUs) that are significantly longer than those obtained by short-read sequencing and contained ≈35% (7675) complete genomes, which is ≈nine times more than those in the Gut Virome Database (GVD, ≈4%, 1,443). Interestingly, the majority (≈60%, 13,356) of the CHGV vOTUs are obtained by either long-read or hybrid assemblies, with little overlap with those assembled from only the short-read data. With this dataset, vast diversity of the gut virome is elucidated, including the identification of 32% (6,962) novel vOTUs compare to public gut virome databases, dozens of phages that are more prevalent than the crAssphages and/or Gubaphages, and several viral clades that are more diverse than the two. Finally, the functional capacities are also characterized of the CHGV encoded proteins and constructed a viral-host interaction network to facilitate future research and applications.",38240578,PMC10987132,10.1002/advs.202305818,1
The genetic and epigenetic landscape of theArabidopsiscentromeres,"Centromeres attach chromosomes to spindle microtubules during cell division and, despite this conserved role, show paradoxically rapid evolution and are typified by complex repeats. We used long-read sequencing to generate the Col-CENArabidopsis thalianagenome assembly that resolves all five centromeres. The centromeres consist of megabase-scale tandemly repeated satellite arrays, which support CENTROMERE SPECIFIC HISTONE H3 (CENH3) occupancy and are densely DNA methylated, with satellite variants private to each chromosome. CENH3 preferentially occupies satellites that show the least amount of divergence and occur in higher-order repeats. The centromeres are invaded byATHILAretrotransposons, which disrupt genetic and epigenetic organization. Centromeric crossover recombination is suppressed, yet low levels of meiotic DNA double-strand breaks occur that are regulated by DNA methylation. We propose thatArabidopsiscentromeres are evolving through cycles of satellite homogenization and retrotransposon-driven diversification.",34762468,PMC10164409,10.1126/science.abi7489,110
Phased diploid genome assembly with single-molecule real-time sequencing,"While genome assembly projects have been successful in many haploid and inbred species, the assembly of noninbred or rearranged heterozygous genomes remains a major challenge. To address this challenge, we introduce the open-source FALCON and FALCON-Unzip algorithms (https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/FALCON/) to assemble long-read sequencing data into highly accurate, contiguous, and correctly phased diploid genomes. We generate new reference sequences for heterozygous samples including an F1 hybrid of Arabidopsis thaliana, the widely cultivated Vitis vinifera cv. Cabernet Sauvignon, and the coral fungus Clavicorona pyxidata, samples that have challenged short-read assembly approaches. The FALCON-based assemblies are substantially more contiguous and complete than alternate short- or long-read approaches. The phased diploid assembly enabled the study of haplotype structure and heterozygosities between homologous chromosomes, including the identification of widespread heterozygous structural variation within coding sequences.",27749838,PMC5503144,10.1038/nmeth.4035,870
Disentangling oncogenic amplicons in esophageal adenocarcinoma,"Esophageal adenocarcinoma is a prominent example of cancer characterized by frequent amplifications in oncogenes. However, the mechanisms leading to amplicons that involve breakage-fusion-bridge cycles and extrachromosomal DNA are poorly understood. Here, we use 710 esophageal adenocarcinoma cases with matched samples and patient-derived organoids to disentangle complex amplicons and their associated mechanisms. Short-read sequencing identifies ERBB2, MYC, MDM2, and HMGA2 as the most frequent oncogenes amplified in extrachromosomal DNAs. We resolve complex extrachromosomal DNA and breakage-fusion-bridge cycles amplicons by integrating of de-novo assemblies and DNA methylation in nine long-read sequenced cases. Complex amplicons shared between precancerous biopsy and late-stage tumor, an enrichment of putative enhancer elements and mobile element insertions are potential drivers of complex amplicons' origin. We find that patient-derived organoids recapitulate extrachromosomal DNA observed in the primary tumors and single-cell DNA sequencing capture extrachromosomal DNA-driven clonal dynamics across passages. Prospectively, long-read and single-cell DNA sequencing technologies can lead to better prediction of clonal evolution in esophageal adenocarcinoma.",38744814,PMC11094127,10.1038/s41467-024-47619-4,0
Characterization and complexity of transcriptome in Gymnocypris przewalskii using single-molecule long-read sequencing and RNA-seq,"The Tibetan Schizothoracinae fish Gymnocypris przewalskii has the ability to adapt to the extreme plateau environment, making it an ideal biological material for evolutionary biology research. However, the lack of well-annotated reference genomes has limited the study of the molecular genetics of G. przewalskii. To characterize its transcriptome features, we first used long-read sequencing technology in combination with RNA-seq for transcriptomic analysis. A total of 159,053 full-length (FL) transcripts were captured by Iso-Seq, having a mean length of 3,445 bp with N50 value of 4,348. Of all FL transcripts, 145,169 were well-annotated in the public database and 134,537 contained complete open reading frames. There were 4,149 pairs of alternative splicing events, of which three randomly selected were defined by RT-PCR and sequencing, and 13,293 long non-coding RNAs detected, based on all-vs.-all BLAST. A total of 118,185 perfect simple sequence repeats were identified from FL transcripts. The FL transcriptome might provide basis for further research of G. przewalskii.",33989386,PMC8320875,10.1093/dnares/dsab005,0
Long-read sequencing identified a causal structural variant in an exome-negative case and enabled preimplantation genetic diagnosis,"Background:For a proportion of individuals judged clinically to have a recessive Mendelian disease, only one heterozygous pathogenic variant can be found from clinical whole exome sequencing (WES), posing a challenge to genetic diagnosis and genetic counseling. One possible reason is the limited ability to detect disease causal structural variants (SVs) from short reads sequencing technologies. Long reads sequencing can produce longer reads (typically 1000 bp or longer), therefore offering greatly improved ability to detect SVs that may be missed by short-read sequencing.Results:Here we describe a case study, where WES identified only one heterozygous pathogenic variant for an individual suspected to have glycogen storage disease type Ia (GSD-Ia), which is an autosomal recessive disease caused by bi-allelic mutations in theG6PCgene. Through Nanopore long-read whole-genome sequencing, we identified a 7.1 kb deletion covering two exons on the other allele, suggesting that complex structural variants (SVs) may explain a fraction of cases when the second pathogenic allele is missing from WES on recessive diseases. Both breakpoints of the deletion are within Alu elements, and we designed Sanger sequencing and quantitative PCR assays based on the breakpoints for preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) for the family planning on another child. Four embryos were obtained after in vitro fertilization (IVF), and an embryo without deletion inG6PCwas transplanted after PGD and was confirmed by prenatal diagnosis, postnatal diagnosis, and subsequent lack of disease symptoms after birth.Conclusions:In summary, we present one of the first examples of using long-read sequencing to identify causal yet complex SVs in exome-negative patients, which subsequently enabled successful personalized PGD.",30279644,PMC6162922,10.1186/s41065-018-0069-1,31
Direct long-read RNA sequencing identifies a subset of questionable exitrons likely arising from reverse transcription artifacts,"Resistance to CD19-directed immunotherapies in lymphoblastic leukemia has been attributed, among other factors, to several aberrant CD19 pre-mRNA splicing events, including recently reported excision of a cryptic intron embedded within CD19 exon 2. While ""exitrons"" are known to exist in hundreds of human transcripts, we discovered, using reporter assays and direct long-read RNA sequencing (dRNA-seq), that the CD19 exitron is an artifact of reverse transcription. Extending our analysis to publicly available datasets, we identified dozens of questionable exitrons, dubbed ""falsitrons,"" that appear only in cDNA-seq, but never in dRNA-seq. Our results highlight the importance of dRNA-seq for transcript isoform validation.",34183059,PMC8240250,10.1186/s13059-021-02411-1,12
Structural variants involved in high-altitude adaptation detected using single-molecule long-read sequencing,"Structural variants (SVs), accounting for a larger fraction of the genome than SNPs/InDels, are an important pool of genetic variation, enabling environmental adaptations. Here, we perform long-read sequencing data of 320 Tibetan and Han samples and show that SVs are highly involved in high-altitude adaptation. We expand the landscape of global SVs, apply robust models of selection and population differentiation combining SVs, SNPs and InDels, and use epigenomic analyses to predict enhancers, target genes and biological functions. We reveal diverse Tibetan-specific SVs affecting the regulatory circuitry of biological functions, including the hypoxia response, energy metabolism and pulmonary function. We find a Tibetan-specific deletion disrupts a super-enhancer and downregulates EPAS1 using enhancer reporter, cellular knock-out and DNA pull-down assays. Our study expands the global SV landscape, reveals the role of gene-regulatory circuitry rewiring in human adaptation, and illustrates the diverse functional roles of SVs in human biology.",38092772,PMC10719358,10.1038/s41467-023-44034-z,2
Re-examination of two diatom reference genomes using long-read sequencing,"Background:The marine diatoms Thalassiosira pseudonana and Phaeodactylum tricornutum are valuable model organisms for exploring the evolution, diversity and ecology of this important algal group. Their reference genomes, published in 2004 and 2008, respectively, were the product of traditional Sanger sequencing. In the case of T. pseudonana, optical restriction site mapping was employed to further clarify and contextualize chromosome-level scaffolds. While both genomes are considered highly accurate and reasonably contiguous, they still contain many unresolved regions and unordered/unlinked scaffolds.Results:We have used Oxford Nanopore Technologies long-read sequencing to update and validate the quality and contiguity of the T. pseudonana and P. tricornutum genomes. Fine-scale assessment of our long-read derived genome assemblies allowed us to resolve previously uncertain genomic regions, further characterize complex structural variation, and re-evaluate the repetitive DNA content of both genomes. We also identified 1862 previously undescribed genes in T. pseudonana. In P. tricornutum, we used transposable element detection software to identify 33 novel copia-type LTR-RT insertions, indicating ongoing activity and rapid expansion of this superfamily as the organism continues to be maintained in culture. Finally, Bionano optical mapping of P. tricornutum chromosomes was combined with long-read sequence data to explore the potential of long-read sequencing and optical mapping for resolving haplotypes.Conclusion:Despite its potential to yield highly contiguous scaffolds, long-read sequencing is not a panacea. Even for relatively small nuclear genomes such as those investigated herein, repetitive DNA sequences cause problems for current genome assembly algorithms. Determining whether a long-read derived genomic assembly is 'better' than one produced using traditional sequence data is not straightforward. Our revised reference genomes for P. tricornutum and T. pseudonana nevertheless provide additional insight into the structure and evolution of both genomes, thereby providing a more robust foundation for future diatom research.",34030633,PMC8147415,10.1186/s12864-021-07666-3,9
Computational approaches and challenges for identification and annotation of non-coding RNAs using RNA-Seq,"Significant innovations in next-generation sequencing techniques and bioinformatics tools have impacted our appreciation and understanding of RNA. Practical RNASeq applications have evolved in conjunction with sequence technology and bioinformatic tool advances. In this review, we explained various computational resources, tools, and bioinformatics analyses advancement for small and large non-coding RNAs.

Evaluation of next-generation sequencing performance for in vitro detection of viruses in biological products,"Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) can detect nucleic acid sequences in a massively parallel sequencing. This technology is expected to be widely applied for the detection of viral contamination in biologics. The recently published ICH-Q5A (R2) draft indicates that NGS could be an alternative or supplement to in vitro viral tests. To examine the performance of NGS for the in vitro detection of viruses, adenovirus type 5 (Ad5), a model virus, was inoculated into Vero cells, which are the most popular indicator cells for the detection of adventitious viruses in the in vitro test. Total RNA extracted from the Vero cells infected with Ad5 was serially diluted with that from non-infected Vero cells, and each sample was analyzed using short- or long-read NGSs. The limits of detection of both NGS methods were almost the same and both methods were sensitive enough to detect viral sequences as long as there was at least one copy in one assay. Although the multiplexing in NGS carries the risk of cross-contamination among the samples, which could lead to false positives, this technology has the potential to become a rapid and sensitive method for detecting adventitious agents in biologics.",38103398,,10.1016/j.biologicals.2023.101739,0
"Genome Resources for the Ex-Type ofPhytophthora citricola, and Well-Authenticated Isolates ofP. hibernalis,P. nicotianae, andP. syringae","Phytophthorais one of the most important genera of plant pathogens, with many members causing high economic losses worldwide. To build robust molecular identification systems, it is very important to have information from well-authenticated specimens and, in preference, the ex-type specimens. The reference genomes of well-authenticated specimens form a critical foundation for genetics, biological research, and diagnostic applications. In this study, we describe four draftPhytophthoragenome resources for the ex-type ofPhytophthora citricolaBL34 (P0716 WPC) (118 contigs for 50 Mb), and well-authenticated specimens ofP. syringaeBL57G (P10330 WPC) (591 contigs for 75 Mb),P. hibernalisBL41G (P3822 WPC) (404 contigs for 84 Mb), andP. nicotianaeBL162 (P6303 WPC) (3,984 contigs for 108 Mb) generated with MinION long-read high-throughput sequencing technology (Oxford Nanopore Technologies).

Integrated analysis of whole genome and transcriptome sequencing reveals a frameshift mutation associated with recessive embryonic lethality in Holstein cattle,"Embryo loss is an important factor affecting fertility in dairy production. HH2 was identified as a haplotype on chromosome 1 associated with embryonic lethality in Holstein cattle. In the current study, both short- and long-read WGS was performed on four carriers and four non-carriers of HH2 to screen for variants in concordance with HH2 haplotype status. Sequence variation analysis revealed five putative functional variants of protein-coding genes, including a frameshift mutation (g.107172616delT) in intraflagellar transport protein 80 (IFT80) gene. Transcriptome analysis of whole blood indicated that no gene exhibited significantly differential expression or allele-specific expression between carriers and non-carriers in the candidate region. This evidence points to g.107172616delT as the highest priority causative mutation for HH2. Protein prediction reveals that the frameshift mutation results in a premature stop codon to reduce the peptide chain from 760 to 383 amino acids and greatly alters the structure and function of IFT80 protein. Our results demonstrate that the use of a combination of multiple high-throughput sequencing technologies is an efficient strategy to screen for the candidate causative mutations responsible for Mendelian traits, including genetic disorders.",34873723,,10.1111/age.13160,0
"Chromosomal-level assembly of the blood clam, Scapharca (Anadara) broughtonii, using long sequence reads and Hi-C","Background:The blood clam, Scapharca (Anadara) broughtonii, is an economically and ecologically important marine bivalve of the family Arcidae. Efforts to study their population genetics, breeding, cultivation, and stock enrichment have been somewhat hindered by the lack of a reference genome. Herein, we report the complete genome sequence of S. broughtonii, a first reference genome of the family Arcidae.Findings:A total of 75.79 Gb clean data were generated with the Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore platforms, which represented approximately 86× coverage of the S. broughtonii genome. De novo assembly of these long reads resulted in an 884.5-Mb genome, with a contig N50 of 1.80 Mb and scaffold N50 of 45.00 Mb. Genome Hi-C scaffolding resulted in 19 chromosomes containing 99.35% of bases in the assembled genome. Genome annotation revealed that nearly half of the genome (46.1%) is composed of repeated sequences, while 24,045 protein-coding genes were predicted and 84.7% of them were annotated.Conclusions:We report here a chromosomal-level assembly of the S. broughtonii genome based on long-read sequencing and Hi-C scaffolding.

Toward Cytogenomics: Technical Assessment of Long-Read Nanopore Whole-Genome Sequencing for Detecting Large Chromosomal Alterations in Mantle Cell Lymphoma,"The current advances and success of next-generation sequencing hold the potential for the transition of cancer cytogenetics toward comprehensive cytogenomics. However, the conventional use of short reads impedes the resolution of chromosomal aberrations. Thus, this study evaluated the detection and reproducibility of extensive copy number alterations and chromosomal translocations using long-read Oxford Nanopore Technologies whole-genome sequencing compared with short-read Illumina sequencing. Using the mantle cell lymphoma cell line Granta-519, almost 99% copy-number reproducibility at the 100-kilobase resolution between replicates was demonstrated, with 98% concordance to Illumina. Collectively, the performance of copy number calling from 1.5 million to 7.5 million long reads was comparable to 1 billion Illumina-based reads (50× coverage). Expectedly, the long-read resolution of canonical translocation t(11;14)(q13;q32) was superior, with a sequence similarity of 89% to the already published CCND1/IGH junction (9× coverage), spanning up to 69 kilobases. The cytogenetic profile of Granta-519 was in general agreement with the literature and karyotype, although several differences remained unresolved. In conclusion, contemporary long-read sequencing is primed for future cytogenomics or sequencing-guided cytogenetics. The combined strength of long- and short-read sequencing is apparent, where the high-precision junctional mapping complements and splits paired-end reads. The potential is emphasized by the flexible single-sample genomic data acquisition of Oxford Nanopore Technologies with the high resolution of allelic imbalances using Illumina short-read sequencing.",37683892,,10.1016/j.jmoldx.2023.08.004,1
Targeted next-generation sequencing and long-read HiFi sequencing provide novel insights into clinically significant KLF1 variants,"Background:Krüppel-like factor 1 (KLF1), a crucial erythroid transcription factor, plays a significant role in various erythroid changes and haemolytic diseases. The rare erythrocyte Lutheran inhibitor (In(Lu)) blood group phenotype serves as an effective model for identifying KLF1 hypomorphic and loss-of-function variants. In this study, we aimed to analyse the genetic background of the In(Lu) phenotype in a population-based sample group by high-throughput technologies to find potentially clinically significant KLF1 variants.Results:We included 62 samples with In(Lu) phenotype, screened from over 300,000 Chinese blood donors. Among them, 36 samples were sequenced using targeted Next Generation Sequencing (NGS), whereas 19 samples were sequenced using High Fidelity (HiFi) technology. In addition, seven samples were simply sequenced using Sanger sequencing. A total of 29 hypomorphic or loss-of-function variants of KLF1 were identified, 21 of which were newly discovered. All new variants discovered by targeted NGS or HiFi sequencing were validated through Sanger sequencing, and the obtained results were found to be consistent. The KLF1 haplotypes of all new variants were further confirmed using clone sequencing or HiFi sequencing. The lack of functional KLF1 variants detected in the four samples indicates the presence of additional regulatory mechanisms. In addition, some samples exhibited BCAM polymorphisms, which encodes antigens of the Lutheran (LU) blood group system. However, no BCAM mutations which leads to the absence of LU proteins were detected.Conclusions:High-throughput sequencing methods, particularly HiFi sequencing, were introduced for the first time into genetic analysis of the In(Lu) phenotype. Targeted NGS and HiFi sequencing demonstrated the accuracy of the results, providing additional advantages such as simultaneous analysis of other blood group genes and clarification of haplotypes. Using the In(Lu) phenotype, a powerful model for identifying hypomorphic or loss-of-function KLF1 variants, numerous novel variants have been detected, which have contributed to the comprehensive understanding of KLF1. These clinically significant KLF1 mutations can serve as a valuable reference for the diagnosis of related blood cell diseases.",38429690,PMC10908068,10.1186/s12864-024-10148-x,0
The SAMBA tool uses long reads to improve the contiguity of genome assemblies,"Third-generation sequencing technologies can generate very long reads with relatively high error rates. The lengths of the reads, which sometimes exceed one million bases, make them invaluable for resolving complex repeats that cannot be assembled using shorter reads. Many high-quality genome assemblies have already been produced, curated, and annotated using the previous generation of sequencing data, and full re-assembly of these genomes with long reads is not always practical or cost-effective. One strategy to upgrade existing assemblies is to generate additional coverage using long-read data, and add that to the previously assembled contigs. SAMBA is a tool that is designed to scaffold and gap-fill existing genome assemblies with additional long-read data, resulting in substantially greater contiguity. SAMBA is the only tool of its kind that also computes and fills in the sequence for all spanned gaps in the scaffolds, yielding much longer contigs. Here we compare SAMBA to several similar tools capable of re-scaffolding assemblies using long-read data, and we show that SAMBA yields better contiguity and introduces fewer errors than competing methods. SAMBA is open-source software that is distributed at https://github.com/alekseyzimin/masurca.",35120119,PMC8849508,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009860,12

We sequenced two wolf lichens using one flow cell per sample, generating 17.1 Gbps for Letharia lupina and 14.3 Gbps for Letharia columbiana. The resulting L. lupina genome is one of the most contiguous lichen genomes available to date, with 49.2 Mbp contained on 31 contigs. The L. columbiana genome, while less contiguous, is still relatively high quality, with 52.3 Mbp on a total of 161 contigs. Each thallus for both species contained multiple distinct haplotypes, a phenomenon that has rarely been empirically demonstrated. The Oxford Nanopore sequencing technologies are robust and effective when applied to complex symbioses, and have the potential to fundamentally transform our understanding of fungal genetics.",32504651,,10.1016/j.ygeno.2020.06.006,11
An evolution of Nanopore next-generation sequencing technology: implications for medical microbiology and public health,"Next-generation sequencing has evolved as a powerful tool, with applications that extend from diagnosis to public health surveillance and outbreak investigations. Short-read sequencing, using primarily Illumina chemistry, has been the prevailing approach. Single-molecule sensing and long-read sequencing using Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) has witnessed a breakthrough in the evolution of the technology, performance, and applications in the past few years. In this issue of theJournal of Clinical Microbiology, Bogaerts et al. (https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.01576-23) describe the utility of the latest ONT sequencing technology, the R10.4.1, in bacterial outbreak investigations. The authors demonstrate that ONT R10.4.1 technology can be comparable to Illumina sequencing for single-nucleotide polymorphism-based phylogeny. The authors emphasize that the reproducibility between ONT and Illumina technologies could facilitate collaborations among laboratories utilizing different sequencing platforms for outbreak investigations.",38563782,,10.1128/jcm.00246-24,0
The Genome Sequence of the OctocoralParamuricea clavata- A Key Resource To Study the Impact of Climate Change in the Mediterranean,"The octocoral,Paramuricea clavata, is a habitat-forming anthozoan with a key ecological role in rocky benthic and biodiversity-rich communities in the Mediterranean and Eastern Atlantic. Shallow populations ofP. clavatain the North-Western Mediterranean are severely affected by warming-induced mass mortality events (MMEs). These MMEs have differentially impacted individuals and populations ofP. clavata(i.e., varied levels of tissue necrosis and mortality rates) over thousands of kilometers of coastal areas. The eco-evolutionary processes, including genetic factors, contributing to these differential responses remain to be characterized. Here, we sequenced aP. clavataindividual with short and long read technologies, producing 169.98 Gb of Illumina paired-end and 3.55 Gb of Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) reads. We obtained ade novogenome assembly accounting for 607 Mb in 64,145 scaffolds. The contig and scaffold N50s are 19.15 Kb and 23.92 Kb, respectively. Despite of the low contiguity of the assembly, its gene completeness is relatively high, including 75.8% complete and 9.4% fragmented genes out of the 978 metazoan genes contained in the metazoa_odb9 database. A total of 62,652 protein-coding genes have been annotated. This assembly is one of the few octocoral genomes currently available. This is undoubtedly a valuable resource for characterizing the genetic bases of the differential responses to thermal stress and for the identification of thermo-resistant individuals and populations. Overall, having the genome ofP. clavatawill facilitate studies of various aspects of its evolutionary ecology and elaboration of effective conservation plans such as active restoration to overcome the threats of global change.",32660973,PMC7467007,10.1534/g3.120.401371,1
"Deficiency of Adenosine Deaminase 2 (DADA2): Hidden Variants, Reduced Penetrance, and Unusual Inheritance","Purpose:Deficiency of adenosine deaminase 2 (DADA2) is an autosomal recessive disorder that manifests with fever, early-onset vasculitis, strokes, and hematologic dysfunction. This study aimed to identify disease-causing variants by conventional Sanger and whole exome sequencing in two families suspected to have DADA2 and non-confirmatory genotypes. ADA2 enzymatic assay confirmed the clinical diagnosis of DADA2. Molecular diagnosis was important to accurately identify other family members at risk.Methods:We used a variety of sequencing technologies, ADA2 enzymatic testing, and molecular methods including qRT-PCR and MLPA.Results:Exome sequencing identified heterozygosity for the known pathogenic variant ADA2: c.1358A>G, p.Tyr453Cys in a 14-year-old female with a history of ischemic strokes, livedo, and vasculitis. No second pathogenic variant could be identified. ADA2 enzymatic testing in combination with quantitative RT-PCR suggested a loss-of-function allele. Subsequent genome sequencing identified a canonical splice site variant, c.-47+2T>C, within the 5'UTR of ADA2. Two of her unaffected siblings were found to carry the same two pathogenic variants. A homozygous 800-bp duplication comprising exon 7 of ADA2 was identified in a 5-year-old female with features consistent with Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA). The duplication was missed by Sanger sequencing of ADA2, chromosomal microarray, and exome sequencing but was detected by MLPA in combination with long-read PCR sequencing. The exon 7 duplication was also identified in her non-symptomatic father and younger sister.Conclusions:ADA2 pathogenic variants may not be detected by conventional sequencing and genetic testing and may require the incorporation of additional diagnostic methods. A definitive molecular diagnosis is crucial for all family members to make informed treatment decisions.",32638197,PMC7416912,10.1007/s10875-020-00817-3,17
Clonal distribution of BCR-ABL1 mutations and splice isoforms by single-molecule long-read RNA sequencing,"Background:The evolution of mutations in the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene transcript renders CML patients resistant to tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) based therapy. Thus screening for BCR-ABL1 mutations is recommended particularly in patients experiencing poor response to treatment. Herein we describe a novel approach for the detection and surveillance of BCR-ABL1 mutations in CML patients.Methods:To detect mutations in the BCR-ABL1 transcript we developed an assay based on the Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) sequencing technology, which allows for single-molecule long-read sequencing of BCR-ABL1 fusion transcript molecules. Samples from six patients with poor response to therapy were analyzed both at diagnosis and follow-up. cDNA was generated from total RNA and a 1,6 kb fragment encompassing the BCR-ABL1 transcript was amplified using long range PCR. To estimate the sensitivity of the assay, a serial dilution experiment was performed.Results:Over 10,000 full-length BCR-ABL1 sequences were obtained for all samples studied. Through the serial dilution analysis, mutations in CML patient samples could be detected down to a level of at least 1%. Notably, the assay was determined to be sufficiently sensitive even in patients harboring a low abundance of BCR-ABL1 levels. The PacBio sequencing successfully identified all mutations seen by standard methods. Importantly, we identified several mutations that escaped detection by the clinical routine analysis. Resistance mutations were found in all but one of the patients. Due to the long reads afforded by PacBio sequencing, compound mutations present in the same molecule were readily distinguished from independent alterations arising in different molecules. Moreover, several transcript isoforms of the BCR-ABL1 transcript were identified in two of the CML patients. Finally, our assay allowed for a quick turn around time allowing samples to be reported upon within 2 days.Conclusions:In summary the PacBio sequencing assay can be applied to detect BCR-ABL1 resistance mutations in both diagnostic and follow-up CML patient samples using a simple protocol applicable to routine diagnosis. The method besides its sensitivity, gives a complete view of the clonal distribution of mutations, which is of importance when making therapy decisions.",25880391,PMC4335374,10.1186/s12885-015-1046-y,22
Fast and accurate long-read assembly with wtdbg2,Existing long-read assemblers require thousands of central processing unit hours to assemble a human genome and are being outpaced by sequencing technologies in terms of both throughput and cost. We developed a long-read assembler wtdbg2 (https://github.com/ruanjue/wtdbg2) that is 2-17 times as fast as published tools while achieving comparable contiguity and accuracy. It paves the way for population-scale long-read assembly in future.,31819265,PMC7004874,10.1038/s41592-019-0669-3,575
Plasmodium knowlesi- Clinical Isolate Genome Sequencing to Inform Translational Same-Species Model System for Severe Malaria,"Malaria is responsible for unacceptably high morbidity and mortality, especially in Sub-Saharan African Nations. Malaria is caused by member species' of the genusPlasmodiumand despite concerted and at times valiant efforts, the underlying pathophysiological processes leading to severe disease are poorly understood. Here we describe zoonotic malaria caused byPlasmodium knowlesiand the utility of this parasite as a model system for severe malaria. We present a method to generate long-read third-generationPlasmodiumgenome sequence data from archived clinical samples using the MinION platform. The method and technology are accessible, affordable and data is generated in real-time. We propose that by widely adopting this methodology important information on clinically relevant parasite diversity, including multiple gene family members, from geographically distinct study sites will emerge. Our goal, over time, is to exploit the duality ofP. knowlesias a well-used laboratory model and human pathogen to develop a representative translational model system for severe malaria that is informed by clinically relevant parasite diversity.",33738266,PMC7960762,10.3389/fcimb.2021.607686,2
Next-generation sequencing technologies: An overview,"Since the days of Sanger sequencing, next-generation sequencing technologies have significantly evolved to provide increased data output, efficiencies, and applications. These next generations of technologies can be categorized based on read length. This review provides an overview of these technologies as two paradigms: short-read, or ""second-generation,"" technologies, and long-read, or ""third-generation,"" technologies. Herein, short-read sequencing approaches are represented by the most prevalent technologies, Illumina and Ion Torrent, and long-read sequencing approaches are represented by Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore technologies. All technologies are reviewed along with reported advantages and disadvantages. Until recently, short-read sequencing was thought to provide high accuracy limited by read-length, while long-read technologies afforded much longer read-lengths at the expense of accuracy. Emerging developments for third-generation technologies hold promise for the next wave of sequencing evolution, with the co-existence of longer read lengths and high accuracy.",33745759,,10.1016/j.humimm.2021.02.012,162
Long-Read DNA Sequencing: Recent Advances and Remaining Challenges,"DNA sequencing has revolutionized medicine over recent decades. However, analysis of large structural variation and repetitive DNA, a hallmark of human genomes, has been limited by short-read technology, with read lengths of 100-300 bp. Long-read sequencing (LRS) permits routine sequencing of human DNA fragments tens to hundreds of kilobase pairs in size, using both real-time sequencing by synthesis and nanopore-based direct electronic sequencing. LRS permits analysis of large structural variation and haplotypic phasing in human genomes and has enabled the discovery and characterization of rare pathogenic structural variants and repeat expansions. It has also recently enabled the assembly of a complete, gapless human genome that includes previously intractable regions, such as highly repetitive centromeres and homologous acrocentric short arms. With the addition of protocols for targeted enrichment, direct epigenetic DNA modification detection, and long-range chromatin profiling, LRS promises to launch a new era of understanding of genetic diversity and pathogenic mutations in human populations.",37075062,,10.1146/annurev-genom-101722-103045,10
The Third Revolution in Sequencing Technology,"Forty years ago the advent of Sanger sequencing was revolutionary as it allowed complete genome sequences to be deciphered for the first time. A second revolution came when next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies appeared, which made genome sequencing much cheaper and faster. However, NGS methods have several drawbacks and pitfalls, most notably their short reads. Recently, third-generation/long-read methods appeared, which can produce genome assemblies of unprecedented quality. Moreover, these technologies can directly detect epigenetic modifications on native DNA and allow whole-transcript sequencing without the need for assembly. This marks the third revolution in sequencing technology. Here we review and compare the various long-read methods. We discuss their applications and their respective strengths and weaknesses and provide future perspectives.",29941292,,10.1016/j.tig.2018.05.008,385
Next-Generation Sequencing and Emerging Technologies,"Genetic sequencing technologies are evolving at a rapid pace with major implications for research and clinical practice. In this review, the authors provide an updated overview of next-generation sequencing (NGS) and emerging methodologies. NGS has tremendously improved sequencing output while being more time and cost-efficient in comparison to Sanger sequencing. The authors describe short-read sequencing approaches, such as sequencing by synthesis, ion semiconductor sequencing, and nanoball sequencing. Third-generation long-read sequencing now promises to overcome many of the limitations of short-read sequencing, such as the ability to reliably resolve repeat sequences and large genomic rearrangements. By combining complementary methods with massively parallel DNA sequencing, a greater insight into the biological context of disease mechanisms is now possible. Emerging methodologies, such as advances in nanopore technology, in situ nucleic acid sequencing, and microscopy-based sequencing, will continue the rapid evolution of this area. These new technologies hold many potential applications for hematological disorders, with the promise of precision and personalized medical care in the future.",31096307,,10.1055/s-0039-1688446,84
Genomics in the long-read sequencing era,"Long-read sequencing (LRS) technologies have provided extremely powerful tools to explore genomes. While in the early years these methods suffered technical limitations, they have recently made significant progress in terms of read length, throughput, and accuracy and bioinformatics tools have strongly improved. Here, we aim to review the current status of LRS technologies, the development of novel methods, and the impact on genomics research. We will explore the most impactful recent findings made possible by these technologies focusing on high-resolution sequencing of genomes and transcriptomes and the direct detection of DNA and RNA modifications. We will also discuss how LRS methods promise a more comprehensive understanding of human genetic variation, transcriptomics, and epigenetics for the coming years.",37230864,,10.1016/j.tig.2023.04.006,11
Oxford Nanopore MinION Sequencing and Genome Assembly,"The revolution of genome sequencing is continuing after the successful second-generation sequencing (SGS) technology. The third-generation sequencing (TGS) technology, led by Pacific Biosciences (PacBio), is progressing rapidly, moving from a technology once only capable of providing data for small genome analysis, or for performing targeted screening, to one that promises high quality de novo assembly and structural variation detection for human-sized genomes. In 2014, the MinION, the first commercial sequencer using nanopore technology, was released by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT). MinION identifies DNA bases by measuring the changes in electrical conductivity generated as DNA strands pass through a biological pore. Its portability, affordability, and speed in data production makes it suitable for real-time applications, the release of the long read sequencer MinION has thus generated much excitement and interest in the genomics community. While de novo genome assemblies can be cheaply produced from SGS data, assembly continuity is often relatively poor, due to the limited ability of short reads to handle long repeats. Assembly quality can be greatly improved by using TGS long reads, since repetitive regions can be easily expanded into using longer sequencing lengths, despite having higher error rates at the base level. The potential of nanopore sequencing has been demonstrated by various studies in genome surveillance at locations where rapid and reliable sequencing is needed, but where resources are limited.",27646134,PMC5093776,10.1016/j.gpb.2016.05.004,283
Minimap2: pairwise alignment for nucleotide sequences,"Motivation:Recent advances in sequencing technologies promise ultra-long reads of ∼100 kb in average, full-length mRNA or cDNA reads in high throughput and genomic contigs over 100 Mb in length. Existing alignment programs are unable or inefficient to process such data at scale, which presses for the development of new alignment algorithms.Results:Minimap2 is a general-purpose alignment program to map DNA or long mRNA sequences against a large reference database. It works with accurate short reads of ≥100 bp in length, ≥1 kb genomic reads at error rate ∼15%, full-length noisy Direct RNA or cDNA reads and assembly contigs or closely related full chromosomes of hundreds of megabases in length. Minimap2 does split-read alignment, employs concave gap cost for long insertions and deletions and introduces new heuristics to reduce spurious alignments. It is 3-4 times as fast as mainstream short-read mappers at comparable accuracy, and is ≥30 times faster than long-read genomic or cDNA mappers at higher accuracy, surpassing most aligners specialized in one type of alignment.Availability and implementation:https://github.com/lh3/minimap2.Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",29750242,PMC6137996,10.1093/bioinformatics/bty191,4434
Haplotype-resolved diverse human genomes and integrated analysis of structural variation,"Long-read and strand-specific sequencing technologies together facilitate the de novo assembly of high-quality haplotype-resolved human genomes without parent-child trio data. We present 64 assembled haplotypes from 32 diverse human genomes. These highly contiguous haplotype assemblies (average minimum contig length needed to cover 50% of the genome: 26 million base pairs) integrate all forms of genetic variation, even across complex loci. We identified 107,590 structural variants (SVs), of which 68% were not discovered with short-read sequencing, and 278 SV hotspots (spanning megabases of gene-rich sequence). We characterized 130 of the most active mobile element source elements and found that 63% of all SVs arise through homology-mediated mechanisms. This resource enables reliable graph-based genotyping from short reads of up to 50,340 SVs, resulting in the identification of 1526 expression quantitative trait loci as well as SV candidates for adaptive selection within the human population.",33632895,PMC8026704,10.1126/science.abf7117,254
Single molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing comes of age: applications and utilities for medical diagnostics,"Short read massive parallel sequencing has emerged as a standard diagnostic tool in the medical setting. However, short read technologies have inherent limitations such as GC bias, difficulties mapping to repetitive elements, trouble discriminating paralogous sequences, and difficulties in phasing alleles. Long read single molecule sequencers resolve these obstacles. Moreover, they offer higher consensus accuracies and can detect epigenetic modifications from native DNA. The first commercially available long read single molecule platform was the RS system based on PacBio's single molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing technology, which has since evolved into their RSII and Sequel systems. Here we capsulize how SMRT sequencing is revolutionizing constitutional, reproductive, cancer, microbial and viral genetic testing.",29401301,PMC5861413,10.1093/nar/gky066,237
Direct ITR-to-ITR Nanopore Sequencing of AAV Vector Genomes,"Recombinant adeno-associated viruses (rAAVs) are currently the most prominently investigated vector platform for human gene therapy. The rAAV capsid serves as a potent and efficient vehicle for delivering genetic payloads into the host cell, while the vector genome determines the function and effectiveness of these biotherapies. However, current production schemes yield vectors that may consist of heterogeneous populations, compromising their potencies. The development of next-generation sequencing methods within the past few years have helped investigators profile the diversity and relative abundances of heterogenous species in vector preparations. Specifically, long-read sequencing methods, like single molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing, have been used to uncover truncations, chimeric genomes, and inverted terminal repeat (ITR) mutations in vectors. Unfortunately, these sequencing platforms may be inaccessible to investigators with limited resources, require large amounts of input material, or may require long wait times for sequencing and analyses. Recent advances with nanopore sequencing have helped to bridge the gap for quick and relatively inexpensive long-read sequencing needs. However, their limitations and sample biases are not well-defined for sequencing rAAV. In this study, we explored the capacity for nanopore sequencing to directly interrogate rAAV content to obtain full-length resolution of encapsidated genomes. We found that the nanopore platform can cover the entirety of rAAV genomes from ITR to ITR without the need for pre-fragmentation. However, the accuracy for base calling was low, resulting in a high degree of miscalled bases and false indels. These false indels led to read-length compression; thus, assessing heterogeneity based on read length is not advisable with current nanopore technologies. Nonetheless, nanopore sequencing was able to correctly identify truncation hotspots in single-strand and self-complementary vectors similar to SMRT sequencing. In summary, nanopore sequencing can serve as a rapid and low-cost alternative for proofing AAV vectors.",36178359,PMC9700346,10.1089/hum.2022.143,6
Accurate circular consensus long-read sequencing improves variant detection and assembly of a human genome,"The DNA sequencing technologies in use today produce either highly accurate short reads or less-accurate long reads. We report the optimization of circular consensus sequencing (CCS) to improve the accuracy of single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing (PacBio) and generate highly accurate (99.8%) long high-fidelity (HiFi) reads with an average length of 13.5 kilobases (kb). We applied our approach to sequence the well-characterized human HG002/NA24385 genome and obtained precision and recall rates of at least 99.91% for single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), 95.98% for insertions and deletions <50 bp (indels) and 95.99% for structural variants. Our CCS method matches or exceeds the ability of short-read sequencing to detect small variants and structural variants. We estimate that 2,434 discordances are correctable mistakes in the 'genome in a bottle' (GIAB) benchmark set. Nearly all (99.64%) variants can be phased into haplotypes, further improving variant detection. De novo genome assembly using CCS reads alone produced a contiguous and accurate genome with a contig N50 of >15 megabases (Mb) and concordance of 99.997%, substantially outperforming assembly with less-accurate long reads.",31406327,PMC6776680,10.1038/s41587-019-0217-9,632
An update on the neurological short tandem repeat expansion disorders and the emergence of long-read sequencing diagnostics,"Background:Short tandem repeat (STR) expansion disorders are an important cause of human neurological disease. They have an established role in more than 40 different phenotypes including the myotonic dystrophies, Fragile X syndrome, Huntington's disease, the hereditary cerebellar ataxias, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia.Main body:STR expansions are difficult to detect and may explain unsolved diseases, as highlighted by recent findings including: the discovery of a biallelic intronic 'AAGGG' repeat in RFC1 as the cause of cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, and vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS); and the finding of 'CGG' repeat expansions in NOTCH2NLC as the cause of neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease and a range of clinical phenotypes. However, established laboratory techniques for diagnosis of repeat expansions (repeat-primed PCR and Southern blot) are cumbersome, low-throughput and poorly suited to parallel analysis of multiple gene regions. While next generation sequencing (NGS) has been increasingly used, established short-read NGS platforms (e.g., Illumina) are unable to genotype large and/or complex repeat expansions. Long-read sequencing platforms recently developed by Oxford Nanopore Technology and Pacific Biosciences promise to overcome these limitations to deliver enhanced diagnosis of repeat expansion disorders in a rapid and cost-effective fashion.Conclusion:We anticipate that long-read sequencing will rapidly transform the detection of short tandem repeat expansion disorders for both clinical diagnosis and gene discovery.",34034831,PMC8145836,10.1186/s40478-021-01201-x,55
Towards population-scale long-read sequencing,"Long-read sequencing technologies have now reached a level of accuracy and yield that allows their application to variant detection at a scale of tens to thousands of samples. Concomitant with the development of new computational tools, the first population-scale studies involving long-read sequencing have emerged over the past 2 years and, given the continuous advancement of the field, many more are likely to follow. In this Review, we survey recent developments in population-scale long-read sequencing, highlight potential challenges of a scaled-up approach and provide guidance regarding experimental design. We provide an overview of current long-read sequencing platforms, variant calling methodologies and approaches for de novo assemblies and reference-based mapping approaches. Furthermore, we summarize strategies for variant validation, genotyping and predicting functional impact and emphasize challenges remaining in achieving long-read sequencing at a population scale.",34050336,PMC8161719,10.1038/s41576-021-00367-3,95
Comparison of long-read sequencing technologies in interrogating bacteria and fly genomes,"The newest generation of DNA sequencing technology is highlighted by the ability to generate sequence reads hundreds of kilobases in length. Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) have pioneered competitive long read platforms, with more recent work focused on improving sequencing throughput and per-base accuracy. We used whole-genome sequencing data produced by three PacBio protocols (Sequel II CLR, Sequel II HiFi, RS II) and two ONT protocols (Rapid Sequencing and Ligation Sequencing) to compare assemblies of the bacteria Escherichia coli and the fruit fly Drosophila ananassae. In both organisms tested, Sequel II assemblies had the highest consensus accuracy, even after accounting for differences in sequencing throughput. ONT and PacBio CLR had the longest reads sequenced compared to PacBio RS II and HiFi, and genome contiguity was highest when assembling these datasets. ONT Rapid Sequencing libraries had the fewest chimeric reads in addition to superior quantification of E. coli plasmids versus ligation-based libraries. The quality of assemblies can be enhanced by adopting hybrid approaches using Illumina libraries for bacterial genome assembly or polishing eukaryotic genome assemblies, and an ONT-Illumina hybrid approach would be more cost-effective for many users. Genome-wide DNA methylation could be detected using both technologies, however ONT libraries enabled the identification of a broader range of known E. coli methyltransferase recognition motifs in addition to undocumented D. ananassae motifs. The ideal choice of long read technology may depend on several factors including the question or hypothesis under examination. No single technology outperformed others in all metrics examined.",33768248,PMC8495745,10.1093/g3journal/jkab083,17
Canu: scalable and accurate long-read assembly via adaptivek-mer weighting and repeat separation,"Long-read single-molecule sequencing has revolutionized de novo genome assembly and enabled the automated reconstruction of reference-quality genomes. However, given the relatively high error rates of such technologies, efficient and accurate assembly of large repeats and closely related haplotypes remains challenging. We address these issues with Canu, a successor of Celera Assembler that is specifically designed for noisy single-molecule sequences. Canu introduces support for nanopore sequencing, halves depth-of-coverage requirements, and improves assembly continuity while simultaneously reducing runtime by an order of magnitude on large genomes versus Celera Assembler 8.2. These advances result from new overlapping and assembly algorithms, including an adaptive overlapping strategy based ontf-idfweighted MinHash and a sparse assembly graph construction that avoids collapsing diverged repeats and haplotypes. We demonstrate that Canu can reliably assemble complete microbial genomes and near-complete eukaryotic chromosomes using either Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) or Oxford Nanopore technologies and achieves a contig NG50 of >21 Mbp on both human andDrosophila melanogasterPacBio data sets. For assembly structures that cannot be linearly represented, Canu provides graph-based assembly outputs in graphical fragment assembly (GFA) format for analysis or integration with complementary phasing and scaffolding techniques. The combination of such highly resolved assembly graphs with long-range scaffolding information promises the complete and automated assembly of complex genomes.",28298431,PMC5411767,10.1101/gr.215087.116,3267
Transcript Profiling Using Long-Read Sequencing Technologies,"RNA sequencing using next-generation sequencing (NGS, RNA-Seq) technologies is currently the standard approach for gene expression profiling, particularly for large-scale high-throughput studies. NGS technologies comprise short-read RNA-Seq (dominated by Illumina) and long-read RNA-Seq technologies provided by Pacific Bioscience (PacBio) and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT). Although short-read sequencing technologies are the most widely used, long-read technologies are increasingly becoming the standard approach for de novo transcriptome assembly and isoform expression quantification due to the complex nature of the transcriptome which consists of variable lengths of transcripts and multiple alternatively spliced isoforms for most genes. In this chapter, we describe experimental procedures for library preparation, sequencing, and associated data analysis approaches for PacBio and ONT with a major focus on full length cDNA synthesis, de novo transcriptome assembly, and isoform quantification.",29767360,,10.1007/978-1-4939-7834-2_6,33
How do emerging long-read sequencing technologies function in transforming the plant pathology research landscape?,"Long-read sequencing technologies are revolutionizing the sequencing and analysis of plant and pathogen genomes and transcriptomes, as well as contributing to emerging areas of interest in plant-pathogen interactions, disease management techniques, and the introduction of new plant varieties or cultivars. Long-read sequencing (LRS) technologies are progressively being implemented to study plants and pathogens of agricultural importance, which have substantial economic effects. The variability and complexity of the genome and transcriptome affect plant growth, development and pathogen responses. Overcoming the limitations of second-generation sequencing, LRS technology has significantly increased the length of a single contiguous read from a few hundred to millions of base pairs. Because of the longer read lengths, new analysis methods and tools have been developed for plant and pathogen genomics and transcriptomics. LRS technologies enable faster, more efficient, and high-throughput ultralong reads, allowing direct sequencing of genomes that would be impossible or difficult to investigate using short-read sequencing approaches. These benefits include genome assembly in repetitive areas, creating more comprehensive and exact genome determinations, assembling full-length transcripts, and detecting DNA and RNA alterations. Furthermore, these technologies allow for the identification of transcriptome diversity, significant structural variation analysis, and direct epigenetic mark detection in plant and pathogen genomic regions. LRS in plant pathology is found efficient for identifying and characterization of effectors in plants as well as known and unknown plant pathogens. In this review, we investigate how these technologies are transforming the landscape of determination and characterization of plant and pathogen genomes and transcriptomes efficiently and accurately. Moreover, we highlight potential areas of interest offered by LRS technologies for future study into plant-pathogen interactions, disease control strategies, and the development of new plant varieties or cultivars.",35962900,,10.1007/s11103-022-01305-5,3
High-throughput RNA isoform sequencing using programmed cDNA concatenation,"Full-length RNA-sequencing methods using long-read technologies can capture complete transcript isoforms, but their throughput is limited. We introduce multiplexed arrays isoform sequencing (MAS-ISO-seq), a technique for programmably concatenating complementary DNAs (cDNAs) into molecules optimal for long-read sequencing, increasing the throughput >15-fold to nearly 40 million cDNA reads per run on the Sequel IIe sequencer. When applied to single-cell RNA sequencing of tumor-infiltrating T cells, MAS-ISO-seq demonstrated a 12- to 32-fold increase in the discovery of differentially spliced genes.",37291427,,10.1038/s41587-023-01815-7,26
Advancements in long-read genome sequencing technologies and algorithms,"The recent advent of long read sequencing technologies, such as Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and Oxford Nanopore technology (ONT), have led to substantial improvements in accuracy and computational cost in sequencing genomes. However, de novo whole-genome assembly still presents significant challenges related to the quality of the results. Pursuing de novo whole-genome assembly remains a formidable challenge, underscored by intricate considerations surrounding computational demands and result quality. As sequencing accuracy and throughput steadily advance, a continuous stream of innovative assembly tools floods the field. Navigating this dynamic landscape necessitates a reasonable choice of sequencing platform, depth, and assembly tools to orchestrate high-quality genome reconstructions. This comprehensive review delves into the intricate interplay between cutting-edge long read sequencing technologies, assembly methodologies, and the ever-evolving field of genomics. With a focus on addressing the pivotal challenges and harnessing the opportunities presented by these advancements, we provide an in-depth exploration of the crucial factors influencing the selection of optimal strategies for achieving robust and insightful genome assemblies.",38608738,,10.1016/j.ygeno.2024.110842,1
Deciphering Neurodegenerative Diseases Using Long-Read Sequencing,"Neurodegenerative diseases exhibit chronic progressive lesions in the central and peripheral nervous systems with unclear causes. The search for pathogenic mutations in human neurodegenerative diseases has benefited from massively parallel short-read sequencers. However, genomic regions, including repetitive elements, especially with high/low GC content, are far beyond the capability of conventional approaches. Recently, long-read single-molecule DNA sequencing technologies have emerged and enabled researchers to study genomes, transcriptomes, and metagenomes at unprecedented resolutions. The identification of novel mutations in unresolved neurodegenerative disorders, the characterization of causative repeat expansions, and the direct detection of epigenetic modifications on naive DNA by virtue of long-read sequencers will further expand our understanding of neurodegenerative diseases. In this article, we review and compare 2 prevailing long-read sequencing technologies, Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore Technologies, and discuss their applications in neurodegenerative diseases.",34389649,PMC8408508,10.1212/WNL.0000000000012466,10
Identification of full-length circular nucleic acids using long-read sequencing technologies,"Unlike the traditional perception in genomic DNA or linear RNA, circular nucleic acids are a class of functional biomolecules with a circular configuration and are often observed in nature. These circular molecules encompass the full spectrum of size and play an important role in organisms, making circular nucleic acids research worthy. Due to the low abundance of most types of circular nucleic acids and the disadvantages of short-read sequencing platforms, accurate and full-length circular nucleic acid sequencing and identification is difficult. In this review, we have provided insights into full-length circular nucleic acid detection methods using long-read sequencing technologies, with a focus on the experimental and bioinformatics strategies to obtain accurate sequences.",34549740,,10.1039/d1an01147b,0
Comparison of long-read sequencing technologies in the hybrid assembly of complex bacterial genomes,"Illumina sequencing allows rapid, cheap and accurate whole genome bacterial analyses, but short reads (<300 bp) do not usually enable complete genome assembly. Long-read sequencing greatly assists with resolving complex bacterial genomes, particularly when combined with short-read Illumina data (hybrid assembly). However, it is not clear how different long-read sequencing methods affect hybrid assembly accuracy. Relative automation of the assembly process is also crucial to facilitating high-throughput complete bacterial genome reconstruction, avoiding multiple bespoke filtering and data manipulation steps. In this study, we compared hybrid assemblies for 20 bacterial isolates, including two reference strains, using Illumina sequencing and long reads from either Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) or SMRT Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) sequencing platforms. We chose isolates from the familyEnterobacteriaceae, as these frequently have highly plastic, repetitive genetic structures, and complete genome reconstruction for these species is relevant for a precise understanding of the epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance. Wede novoassembled genomes using the hybrid assembler Unicycler and compared different read processing strategies, as well as comparing to long-read-only assembly with Flye followed by short-read polishing with Pilon. Hybrid assembly with either PacBio or ONT reads facilitated high-quality genome reconstruction, and was superior to the long-read assembly and polishing approach evaluated with respect to accuracy and completeness. Combining ONT and Illumina reads fully resolved most genomes without additional manual steps, and at a lower consumables cost per isolate in our setting. Automated hybrid assembly is a powerful tool for complete and accurate bacterial genome assembly.",31483244,PMC6807382,10.1099/mgen.0.000294,115
Single-cell and spatial transcriptomics: Bridging current technologies with long-read sequencing,"Single-cell technologies have transformed biomedical research over the last decade, opening up new possibilities for understanding cellular heterogeneity, both at the genomic and transcriptomic level. In addition, more recent developments of spatial transcriptomics technologies have made it possible to profile cells in their tissue context. In parallel, there have been substantial advances in sequencing technologies, and the third generation of methods are able to produce reads that are tens of kilobases long, with error rates matching the second generation short reads. Long reads technologies make it possible to better map large genome rearrangements and quantify isoform specific abundances. This further improves our ability to characterize functionally relevant heterogeneity. Here, we show how researchers have begun to combine single-cell, spatial transcriptomics, and long-read technologies, and how this is resulting in powerful new approaches to profiling both the genome and the transcriptome. We discuss the achievements so far, and we highlight remaining challenges and opportunities.",38368637,,10.1016/j.mam.2024.101255,1
Long-read sequencing for molecular diagnostics in constitutional genetic disorders,"Long-read sequencing (LRS) has been around for more than a decade, but widespread adoption of the technology has been slow due to the perceived high error rates and high sequencing cost. This is changing due to the recent advancements to produce highly accurate sequences and the reducing costs. LRS promises significant improvement over short read sequencing in four major areas: (1) better detection of structural variation (2) better resolution of highly repetitive or nonunique regions (3) accurate long-range haplotype phasing and (4) the detection of base modifications natively from the sequencing data. Several successful applications of LRS have demonstrated its ability to resolve molecular diagnoses where short-read sequencing fails to identify a cause. However, the argument for increased diagnostic yield from LRS remains to be validated. Larger cohort studies may be required to establish the realistic boundaries of LRS's clinical utility and analytical validity, as well as the development of standards for clinical applications. We discuss the limitations of the current standard of care, and contrast with the applications and advantages of two major LRS platforms, PacBio and Oxford Nanopore, for molecular diagnostics of constitutional disorders, and present a critical argument about the potential of LRS in diagnostic settings.",36086952,PMC9561063,10.1002/humu.24465,8
The newest Oxford Nanopore R10.4.1 full-length 16S rRNA sequencing enables the accurate resolution of species-level microbial community profiling,"The long-read amplicon provides a species-level solution for the community. With the improvement of nanopore flowcells, the accuracy of Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) R10.4.1 has been substantially enhanced, with an average of approximately 99%. To evaluate its effectiveness on amplicons, three types of microbiomes were analyzed by 16S ribosomal RNA (hereinafter referred to as ""16S"") amplicon sequencing using Novaseq, Pacbio sequel II, and Nanopore PromethION platforms (R9.4.1 and R10.4.1) in the current study. We showed the error rate, recall, precision, and bias index in the mock sample. The error rate of ONT R10.4.1 was greatly reduced, with a better recall in the case of the synthetic community. Meanwhile, in different types of environmental samples, ONT R10.4.1 analysis resulted in a composition similar to Pacbio data. We found that classification tools and databases influence ONT data. Based on these results, we conclude that the ONT R10.4.1 16S amplicon can also be used for application in environmental samples. IMPORTANCE The long-read amplicon supplies the community with a species-level solution. Due to the high error rate of nanopore sequencing early on, it has not been frequently used in 16S studies. Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) introduced the R10.4.1 flowcell with Q20+ reagent to achieve more than 99% accuracy as sequencing technology advanced. However, there has been no published study on the performance of commercial PromethION sequencers with R10.4.1 flowcells on 16S sequencing or on the impact of accuracy improvement on taxonomy (R9.4.1 to R10.4.1) using 16S ONT data. In this study, three types of microbiomes were investigated by 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) amplicon sequencing using Novaseq, Pacbio sequel II, and Nanopore PromethION platforms (R9.4.1 and R10.4.1). In the mock sample, we displayed the error rate, recall, precision, and bias index. We observed that the error rate in ONT R10.4.1 is significantly lower, especially when deletions are involved. First and foremost, R10.4.1 and Pacific Bioscience platforms reveal a similar microbiome in environmental samples. This study shows that the R10.4.1 full-length 16S rRNA sequences allow for species identification of environmental microbiota.",37800969,PMC10617388,10.1128/aem.00605-23,5
Long-read sequencing for rare human genetic diseases,"During the past decade, the search for pathogenic mutations in rare human genetic diseases has involved huge efforts to sequence coding regions, or the entire genome, using massively parallel short-read sequencers. However, the approximate current diagnostic rate is <50% using these approaches, and there remain many rare genetic diseases with unknown cause. There may be many reasons for this, but one plausible explanation is that the responsible mutations are in regions of the genome that are difficult to sequence using conventional technologies (e.g., tandem-repeat expansion or complex chromosomal structural aberrations). Despite the drawbacks of high cost and a shortage of standard analytical methods, several studies have analyzed pathogenic changes in the genome using long-read sequencers. The results of these studies provide hope that further application of long-read sequencers to identify the causative mutations in unsolved genetic diseases may expand our understanding of the human genome and diseases. Such approaches may also be applied to molecular diagnosis and therapeutic strategies for patients with genetic diseases in the future.",31558760,,10.1038/s10038-019-0671-8,45
Complex genome assembly based on long-read sequencing,"High-quality genome chromosome-scale sequences provide an important basis for genomics downstream analysis, especially the construction of haplotype-resolved and complete genomes, which plays a key role in genome annotation, mutation detection, evolutionary analysis, gene function research, comparative genomics and other aspects. However, genome-wide short-read sequencing is difficult to produce a complete genome in the face of a complex genome with high duplication and multiple heterozygosity. The emergence of long-read sequencing technology has greatly improved the integrity of complex genome assembly. We review a variety of computational methods for complex genome assembly and describe in detail the theories, innovations and shortcomings of collapsed, semi-collapsed and uncollapsed assemblers based on long reads. Among the three methods, uncollapsed assembly is the most correct and complete way to represent genomes. In addition, genome assembly is closely related to haplotype reconstruction, that is uncollapsed assembly realizes haplotype reconstruction, and haplotype reconstruction promotes uncollapsed assembly. We hope that gapless, telomere-to-telomere and accurate assembly of complex genomes can be truly routinely achieved using only a simple process or a single tool in the future.",35940845,,10.1093/bib/bbac305,8
The application of long-read sequencing in clinical settings,"Long-read DNA sequencing technologies have been rapidly evolving in recent years, and their ability to assess large and complex regions of the genome makes them ideal for clinical applications in molecular diagnosis and therapy selection, thereby providing a valuable tool for precision medicine. In the third-generation sequencing duopoly, Oxford Nanopore Technologies and Pacific Biosciences work towards increasing the accuracy, throughput, and portability of long-read sequencing methods while trying to keep costs low. These trades have made long-read sequencing an attractive tool for use in research and clinical settings. This article provides an overview of current clinical applications and limitations of long-read sequencing and explores its potential for point-of-care testing and health care in remote settings.",37553611,PMC10410870,10.1186/s40246-023-00522-3,10
Long-read sequencing in deciphering human genetics to a greater depth,"Through four decades' development, DNA sequencing has inched into the era of single-molecule sequencing (SMS), or the third-generation sequencing (TGS), as represented by two distinct technical approaches developed independently by Pacific Bioscience (PacBio) and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT). Historically, each generation of sequencing technologies was marked by innovative technological achievements and novel applications. Long reads (LRs) are considered as the most advantageous feature of SMS shared by both PacBio and ONT to distinguish SMS from next-generation sequencing (NGS, or the second-generation sequencing) and Sanger sequencing (the first-generation sequencing). Long reads overcome the limitations of NGS and drastically improves the quality of genome assembly. Besides, ONT also contributes several unique features including ultra-long reads (ULRs) with read length above 300 kb and some close to 1 million bp, direct RNA sequencing and superior portability as made possible by pocket-sized MinION sequencer. Here, we review the history of DNA sequencing technologies and associated applications, with a special focus on the advantages as well as the limitations of ULR sequencing in genome assembly.",31538236,,10.1007/s00439-019-02064-y,34
Comparing genomes recovered from time-series metagenomes using long- and short-read sequencing technologies,"Background:Over the past years, sequencing technologies have expanded our ability to examine novel microbial metabolisms and diversity previously obscured by isolation approaches. Long-read sequencing promises to revolutionize the metagenomic field and recover less fragmented genomes from environmental samples. Nonetheless, how to best benefit from long-read sequencing and whether long-read sequencing can provide recovered genomes of similar characteristics as short-read approaches remains unclear.Results:We recovered metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from the free-living fraction at four-time points during a spring bloom in the North Sea. The taxonomic composition of all MAGs recovered was comparable between technologies. However, differences consisted of higher sequencing depth for contigs and higher genome population diversity in short-read compared to long-read metagenomes. When pairing population genomes recovered from both sequencing approaches that shared ≥ 99% average nucleotide identity, long-read MAGs were composed of fewer contigs, a higher N50, and a higher number of predicted genes when compared to short-read MAGs. Moreover, 88% of the total long-read MAGs carried a 16S rRNA gene compared to only 23% of MAGs recovered from short-read metagenomes. Relative abundances for population genomes recovered using both technologies were similar, although disagreements were observed for high and low GC content MAGs.Conclusions:Our results highlight that short-read technologies recovered more MAGs and a higher number of species than long-read due to an overall higher sequencing depth. Long-read samples produced higher quality MAGs and similar species composition compared to short-read sequencing. Differences in the GC content recovered by each sequencing technology resulted in divergences in the diversity recovered and relative abundance of MAGs within the GC content boundaries.",37179340,PMC10182627,10.1186/s40168-023-01557-3,7
Long-read sequencing improves diagnostic rate in neuromuscular disorders,"Massive parallel sequencing methods, such as exome, genome, and targeted DNA sequencing, have aided molecular diagnosis of genetic diseases in the last 20 years. However, short-read sequencing methods still have several limitations, such inaccurate genome assembly, the inability to detect large structural variants, and variants located in hard-to-sequence regions like highly repetitive areas. The recently emerged PacBio single-molecule real-time (SMRT) and Oxford nanopore technology (ONT) long-read sequencing (LRS) methods have been shown to overcome most of these technical issues, leading to an increase in diagnostic rate. LRS methods are contributing to the detection of repeat expansions in novel disease-causing genes (e.g.,ABCD3,NOTCH2NLCandRILPL1causing an Oculopharyngodistal myopathy orPLIN4causing a Myopathy with rimmed ubiquitin-positive autophagic vacuolation), of structural variants (e.g., inDMD), and of single nucleotide variants in repetitive regions (TTNandNEB). Moreover, these methods have simplified the characterization of the D4Z4 repeats inDUX4, facilitating the diagnosis of Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD). We review recent studies that have used either ONT or PacBio SMRT sequencing methods and discuss different types of variants that have been detected using these approaches in individuals with neuromuscular disorders.",38406378,PMC10883326,10.36185/2532-1900-394,0
"Benchmarking of long-read sequencing, assemblers and polishers for yeast genome","Background:The long reads of the third-generation sequencing significantly benefit the quality of the de novo genome assembly. However, its relatively high single-base error rate has been criticized. Currently, sequencing accuracy and throughput continue to improve, and many advanced tools are constantly emerging. PacBio HiFi sequencing and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) PromethION are two up-to-date platforms with low error rates and ultralong high-throughput reads. Therefore, it is urgently needed to select the appropriate sequencing platforms, depths and genome assembly tools for high-quality genomes in the era of explosive data production.Methods:We performed 455 (7 assemblers with 4 polishing pipelines or without polishing on 13 subsets with different depths) and 88 (4 assemblers with or without polishing on 11 subsets with different depths) de novo assemblies of Yeast S288C on high-coverage ONT and HiFi datasets, respectively. The assembly quality was evaluated by Quality Assessment Tool (QUAST), Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs (BUSCO) and the newly proposed Comprehensive_score (C_score). In addition, we applied four preferable pipelines to assemble the genome of nonreference yeast strains.Results:The assembler plays an essential role in genome construction, especially for low-depth datasets. For ONT datasets, Flye is superior to other tools through C_score evaluation. Polishing by Pilon and Medaka improve accuracy and continuity of the preassemblies, respectively, and their combination pipeline worked well in most quality metrics. For HiFi datasets, Flye and NextDenovo performed better than other tools, and polishing is also necessary. Enough data depth is required for high-quality genome construction by ONT (>80X) and HiFi (>20X) datasets.",35511110,,10.1093/bib/bbac146,12
Newest Methods for Detecting Structural Variations,"A substantial amount of structural variation in the human genome remains uninvestigated due to the limitations of existing technologies, the presence of repetitive sequences, and the complexity of a diploid genome. New technologies have been developed, increasing resolution and appreciation of structural variation and how it affects human diversity and disease. The genetic etiology of most patients with complex disorders such as neurodegenerative brain diseases is not yet elucidated, complicating disease diagnosis, genetic counseling, and understanding of underlying pathological mechanisms needed to develop therapeutic interventions. Here, we focus on innovative progress and opportunities provided by the newest methods such as linked read sequencing, strand-specific sequencing, and long-read sequencing. Finally, we describe a strategy for generating a comprehensive catalog of structural variations across populations.",30902345,,10.1016/j.tibtech.2019.02.003,42
Perspectives and Benefits of High-Throughput Long-Read Sequencing in Microbial Ecology,"Short-read, high-throughput sequencing (HTS) methods have yielded numerous important insights into microbial ecology and function. Yet, in many instances short-read HTS techniques are suboptimal, for example, by providing insufficient phylogenetic resolution or low integrity of assembled genomes. Single-molecule and synthetic long-read (SLR) HTS methods have successfully ameliorated these limitations. In addition, nanopore sequencing has generated a number of unique analysis opportunities, such as rapid molecular diagnostics and direct RNA sequencing, and both Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and nanopore sequencing support detection of epigenetic modifications. Although initially suffering from relatively low sequence quality, recent advances have greatly improved the accuracy of long-read sequencing technologies. In spite of great technological progress in recent years, the long-read HTS methods (PacBio and nanopore sequencing) are still relatively costly, require large amounts of high-quality starting material, and commonly need specific solutions in various analysis steps. Despite these challenges, long-read sequencing technologies offer high-quality, cutting-edge alternatives for testing hypotheses about microbiome structure and functioning as well as assembly of eukaryote genomes from complex environmental DNA samples.",34132589,PMC8357291,10.1128/AEM.00626-21,47
Approaches to long-read sequencing in a clinical setting to improve diagnostic rate,"Over the past decade, advances in genetic testing, particularly the advent of next-generation sequencing, have led to a paradigm shift in the diagnosis of molecular diseases and disorders. Despite our present collective ability to interrogate more than 90% of the human genome, portions of the genome have eluded us, resulting in stagnation of diagnostic yield with existing methodologies. Here we show how application of a new technology, long-read sequencing, has the potential to improve molecular diagnostic rates. Whole genome sequencing by long reads was able to cover 98% of next-generation sequencing dead zones, which are areas of the genome that are not interpretable by conventional industry-standard short-read sequencing. Through the ability of long-read sequencing to unambiguously call variants in these regions, we discovered an immunodeficiency due to a variant in IKBKG in a subject who had previously received a negative genome sequencing result. Additionally, we demonstrate the ability of long-read sequencing to detect small variants on par with short-read sequencing, its superior performance in identifying structural variants, and thirdly, its capacity to determine genomic methylation defects in native DNA. Though the latter technical abilities have been demonstrated, we demonstrate the clinical application of this technology to successfully identify multiple types of variants using a single test.",36210382,PMC9548499,10.1038/s41598-022-20113-x,10
Long reads: their purpose and place,"In recent years long-read technologies have moved from being a niche and specialist field to a point of relative maturity likely to feature frequently in the genomic landscape. Analogous to next generation sequencing, the cost of sequencing using long-read technologies has materially dropped whilst the instrument throughput continues to increase. Together these changes present the prospect of sequencing large numbers of individuals with the aim of fully characterizing genomes at high resolution. In this article, we will endeavour to present an introduction to long-read technologies showing: what long reads are; how they are distinct from short reads; why long reads are useful and how they are being used. We will highlight the recent developments in this field, and the applications and potential of these technologies in medical research, and clinical diagnostics and therapeutics.",29767702,PMC6061690,10.1093/hmg/ddy177,131
TALC: Transcript-level Aware Long-read Correction,Motivation:Long-read sequencing technologies are invaluable for determining complex RNA transcript architectures but are error-prone. Numerous 'hybrid correction' algorithms have been developed for genomic data that correct long reads by exploiting the accuracy and depth of short reads sequenced from the same sample. These algorithms are not suited for correcting more complex transcriptome sequencing data.Results:We have created a novel reference-free algorithm called Transcript-level Aware Long-Read Correction (TALC) which models changes in RNA expression and isoform representation in a weighted De Bruijn graph to correct long reads from transcriptome studies. We show that transcript-level aware correction by TALC improves the accuracy of the whole spectrum of downstream RNA-seq applications and is thus necessary for transcriptome analyses that use long read technology.Availability and implementation:TALC is implemented in C++ and available at https://github.com/lbroseus/TALC.Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.,32910174,,10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa634,9
NanoGalaxy: Nanopore long-read sequencing data analysis in Galaxy,"Background:Long-read sequencing can be applied to generate very long contigs and even completely assembled genomes at relatively low cost and with minimal sample preparation. As a result, long-read sequencing platforms are becoming more popular. In this respect, the Oxford Nanopore Technologies-based long-read sequencing ""nanopore"" platform is becoming a widely used tool with a broad range of applications and end-users. However, the need to explore and manipulate the complex data generated by long-read sequencing platforms necessitates accompanying specialized bioinformatics platforms and tools to process the long-read data correctly. Importantly, such tools should additionally help democratize bioinformatics analysis by enabling easy access and ease-of-use solutions for researchers.Results:The Galaxy platform provides a user-friendly interface to computational command line-based tools, handles the software dependencies, and provides refined workflows. The users do not have to possess programming experience or extended computer skills. The interface enables researchers to perform powerful bioinformatics analysis, including the assembly and analysis of short- or long-read sequence data. The newly developed ""NanoGalaxy"" is a Galaxy-based toolkit for analysing long-read sequencing data, which is suitable for diverse applications, including de novo genome assembly from genomic, metagenomic, and plasmid sequence reads.Conclusions:A range of best-practice tools and workflows for long-read sequence genome assembly has been integrated into a NanoGalaxy platform to facilitate easy access and use of bioinformatics tools for researchers. NanoGalaxy is freely available at the European Galaxy server https://nanopore.usegalaxy.eu with supporting self-learning training material available at https://training.galaxyproject.org.",33068114,PMC7568507,10.1093/gigascience/giaa105,19
Comparison of Long-Read Methods for Sequencing and Assembly of Lepidopteran Pest Genomes,"Lepidopteran species are mostly pests, causing serious annual economic losses. High-quality genome sequencing and assembly uncover the genetic foundation of pest occurrence and provide guidance for pest control measures. Long-read sequencing technology and assembly algorithm advances have improved the ability to timeously produce high-quality genomes. Lepidoptera includes a wide variety of insects with high genetic diversity and heterozygosity. Therefore, the selection of an appropriate sequencing and assembly strategy to obtain high-quality genomic information is urgently needed. This research used silkworm as a model to test genome sequencing and assembly through high-coverage datasets by de novo assemblies. We report the first nearly complete telomere-to-telomere reference genome of silkwormBombyx mori(P50T strain) produced by Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) HiFi sequencing, and highly contiguous and complete genome assemblies of two other silkworm strains by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) or PacBio continuous long-reads (CLR) that were unrepresented in the public database. Assembly quality was evaluated by use of BUSCO, Inspector, and EagleC. It is necessary to choose an appropriate assembler for draft genome construction, especially for low-depth datasets. For PacBio CLR and ONT sequencing, NextDenovo is superior. For PacBio HiFi sequencing, hifiasm is better. Quality assessment is essential for genome assembly and can provide better and more accurate results. For chromosome-level high-quality genome construction, we recommend using 3D-DNA with EagleC evaluation. Our study references how to obtain and evaluate high-quality genome assemblies, and is a resource for biological control, comparative genomics, and evolutionary studies of Lepidopteran pests and related species.",36614092,PMC9820851,10.3390/ijms24010649,8
Comparative assessment of long-read error correction software applied to Nanopore RNA-sequencing data,"Motivation:Nanopore long-read sequencing technology offers promising alternatives to high-throughput short read sequencing, especially in the context of RNA-sequencing. However this technology is currently hindered by high error rates in the output data that affect analyses such as the identification of isoforms, exon boundaries, open reading frames and creation of gene catalogues. Due to the novelty of such data, computational methods are still actively being developed and options for the error correction of Nanopore RNA-sequencing long reads remain limited.Results:In this article, we evaluate the extent to which existing long-read DNA error correction methods are capable of correcting cDNA Nanopore reads. We provide an automatic and extensive benchmark tool that not only reports classical error correction metrics but also the effect of correction on gene families, isoform diversity, bias toward the major isoform and splice site detection. We find that long read error correction tools that were originally developed for DNA are also suitable for the correction of Nanopore RNA-sequencing data, especially in terms of increasing base pair accuracy. Yet investigators should be warned that the correction process perturbs gene family sizes and isoform diversity. This work provides guidelines on which (or whether) error correction tools should be used, depending on the application type.Benchmarking software:https://gitlab.com/leoisl/LR_EC_analyser.",31232449,,10.1093/bib/bbz058,15
Amplification-free long-read sequencing reveals unforeseen CRISPR-Cas9 off-target activity,"Background:One ongoing concern about CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing is that unspecific guide RNA (gRNA) binding may induce off-target mutations. However, accurate prediction of CRISPR-Cas9 off-target activity is challenging. Here, we present SMRT-OTS and Nano-OTS, two novel, amplification-free, long-read sequencing protocols for detection of gRNA-driven digestion of genomic DNA by Cas9 in vitro.Results:The methods are assessed using the human cell line HEK293, re-sequenced at 18x coverage using highly accurate HiFi SMRT reads. SMRT-OTS and Nano-OTS are first applied to three different gRNAs targeting HEK293 genomic DNA, resulting in a set of 55 high-confidence gRNA cleavage sites identified by both methods. Twenty-five of these sites are not reported by off-target prediction software, either because they contain four or more single nucleotide mismatches or insertion/deletion mismatches, as compared with the human reference. Additional experiments reveal that 85% of Cas9 cleavage sites are also found by other in vitro-based methods and that on- and off-target sites are detectable in gene bodies where short-reads fail to uniquely align. Even though SMRT-OTS and Nano-OTS identify several sites with previously validated off-target editing activity in cells, our own CRISPR-Cas9 editing experiments in human fibroblasts do not give rise to detectable off-target mutations at the in vitro-predicted sites. However, indel and structural variation events are enriched at the on-target sites.Conclusions:Amplification-free long-read sequencing reveals Cas9 cleavage sites in vitro that would have been difficult to predict using computational tools, including in dark genomic regions inaccessible by short-read sequencing.",33261648,PMC7706270,10.1186/s13059-020-02206-w,21
Complete sequencing of expanded SAMD12 repeats by long-read sequencing and Cas9-mediated enrichment,"A pentanucleotide TTTCA repeat insertion into a polymorphic TTTTA repeat element in SAMD12 causes benign adult familial myoclonic epilepsy. Although the precise determination of the entire SAMD12 repeat sequence is important for molecular diagnosis and research, obtaining this sequence remains challenging when using conventional genomic/genetic methods, and even short-read and long-read next-generation sequencing technologies have been insufficient. Incomplete information regarding expanded repeat sequences may hamper our understanding of the pathogenic roles played by varying numbers of repeat units, genotype-phenotype correlations, and mutational mechanisms. Here, we report a new approach for the precise determination of the entire expanded repeat sequence and present a workflow designed to improve the diagnostic rates in various repeat expansion diseases. We examined 34 clinically diagnosed benign adult familial myoclonic epilepsy patients, from 29 families using repeat-primed PCR, Southern blot, and long-read sequencing with Cas9-mediated enrichment. Two cases with questionable results from repeat-primed PCR and/or Southern blot were confirmed as pathogenic using long-read sequencing with Cas9-mediated enrichment, resulting in the identification of pathogenic SAMD12 repeat expansions in 76% of examined families (22/29). Importantly, long-read sequencing with Cas9-mediated enrichment was able to provide detailed information regarding the sizes, configurations, and compositions of the expanded repeats. The inserted TTTCA repeat size and the proportion of TTTCA sequences among the overall repeat sequences were highly variable, and a novel repeat configuration was identified. A genotype-phenotype correlation study suggested that the insertion of even short (TTTCA)14 repeats contributed to the development of benign adult familial myoclonic epilepsy. However, the sizes of the overall TTTTA and TTTCA repeat units are also likely to be involved in the pathology of benign adult familial myoclonic epilepsy. Seven unsolved SAMD12-negative cases were investigated using whole-genome long-read sequencing, and infrequent, disease-associated, repeat expansions were identified in two cases. The strategic workflow resolved two questionable SAMD12-positive cases and two previously SAMD12-negative cases, increasing the diagnostic yield from 69% (20/29 families) to 83% (24/29 families). This study indicates the significant utility of long-read sequencing technologies to explore the pathogenic contributions made by various repeat units in complex repeat expansions and to improve the overall diagnostic rate.",33791773,,10.1093/brain/awab021,14
Long-read sequencing settings for efficient structural variation detection based on comprehensive evaluation,"Background:With the rapid development of long-read sequencing technologies, it is possible to reveal the full spectrum of genetic structural variation (SV). However, the expensive cost, finite read length and high sequencing error for long-read data greatly limit the widespread adoption of SV calling. Therefore, it is urgent to establish guidance concerning sequencing coverage, read length, and error rate to maintain high SV yields and to achieve the lowest cost simultaneously.Results:In this study, we generated a full range of simulated error-prone long-read datasets containing various sequencing settings and comprehensively evaluated the performance of SV calling with state-of-the-art long-read SV detection methods. The benchmark results demonstrate that almost all SV callers perform better when the long-read data reach 20× coverage, 20 kbp average read length, and approximately 10-7.5% or below 1% error rates. Furthermore, high sequencing coverage is the most influential factor in promoting SV calling, while it also directly determines the expensive costs.Conclusions:Based on the comprehensive evaluation results, we provide important guidelines for selecting long-read sequencing settings for efficient SV calling. We believe these recommended settings of long-read sequencing will have extraordinary guiding significance in cutting-edge genomic studies and clinical practices.",34772337,PMC8588741,10.1186/s12859-021-04422-y,10
Comparison of long-read methods for sequencing and assembly of a plant genome,"Background:Sequencing technologies have advanced to the point where it is possible to generate high-accuracy, haplotype-resolved, chromosome-scale assemblies. Several long-read sequencing technologies are available, and a growing number of algorithms have been developed to assemble the reads generated by those technologies. When starting a new genome project, it is therefore challenging to select the most cost-effective sequencing technology, as well as the most appropriate software for assembly and polishing. It is thus important to benchmark different approaches applied to the same sample.Results:Here, we report a comparison of 3 long-read sequencing technologies applied to the de novo assembly of a plant genome, Macadamia jansenii. We have generated sequencing data using Pacific Biosciences (Sequel I), Oxford Nanopore Technologies (PromethION), and BGI (single-tube Long Fragment Read) technologies for the same sample. Several assemblers were benchmarked in the assembly of Pacific Biosciences and Nanopore reads. Results obtained from combining long-read technologies or short-read and long-read technologies are also presented. The assemblies were compared for contiguity, base accuracy, and completeness, as well as sequencing costs and DNA material requirements.Conclusions:The 3 long-read technologies produced highly contiguous and complete genome assemblies of M. jansenii. At the time of sequencing, the cost associated with each method was significantly different, but continuous improvements in technologies have resulted in greater accuracy, increased throughput, and reduced costs. We propose updating this comparison regularly with reports on significant iterations of the sequencing technologies.",33347571,PMC7751402,10.1093/gigascience/giaa146,39
CRISPR-based enrichment strategies for targeted sequencing,"The ability to easily produce or procure sequencing data has expanded to be within the reach of most clinics and research laboratories, but the complexity of sequence analysis remains a hurdle for many scientists, and a decline in sequencing cost means that the generation of gratuitous information in a given experiment is a challenge that is more and more often being encountered. To address this issue, methods have been present, some dating to the advent of nucleic acid sequencing, for capturing, targeting, or otherwise enriching specific nucleic acids in order to obtain greater depth of reads from a small portion of sequences within a complex sample. However, many of these methods have been complicated and laborious, relying on the design of hundreds to thousands of oligonucleotide probes, fabrication of microarray chips, and long hybridization times. Here, we review these methods, their benefits and uses, and catalog and discuss the implications of a recent development that has enabled a more efficient and expanded set of tools for enriching nucleic acids - the application of CRISPR technology. This introduction and analysis of the capabilities of new CRISPR-based enrichment strategies shows that it has the potential to expand the scope of enrichment to new possibilities, including the coupling of DNA and RNA targeting with long-read, portable sequencing platforms. Moreover, there are several areas where CRISPR-enrichment is a logical next step to more powerful and simplified sequencing for applications such as diagnostics and environmental monitoring.",33253795,,10.1016/j.biotechadv.2020.107672,14
Computational methods for chromosome-scale haplotype reconstruction,"High-quality chromosome-scale haplotype sequences of diploid genomes, polyploid genomes, and metagenomes provide important insights into genetic variation associated with disease and biodiversity. However, whole-genome short read sequencing does not yield haplotype information spanning whole chromosomes directly. Computational assembly of shorter haplotype fragments is required for haplotype reconstruction, which can be challenging owing to limited fragment lengths and high haplotype and repeat variability across genomes. Recent advancements in long-read and chromosome-scale sequencing technologies, alongside computational innovations, are improving the reconstruction of haplotypes at the level of whole chromosomes. Here, we review recent and discuss methodological progress and perspectives in these areas.",33845884,PMC8040228,10.1186/s13059-021-02328-9,30
Advantages of genome sequencing by long-read sequencer using SMRT technology in medical area,"PacBio RS II is the first commercialized third-generation DNA sequencer able to sequence a single molecule DNA in real-time without amplification. PacBio RS II's sequencing technology is novel and unique, enabling the direct observation of DNA synthesis by DNA polymerase. PacBio RS II confers four major advantages compared to other sequencing technologies: long read lengths, high consensus accuracy, a low degree of bias, and simultaneous capability of epigenetic characterization. These advantages surmount the obstacle of sequencing genomic regions such as high/low G+C, tandem repeat, and interspersed repeat regions. Moreover, PacBio RS II is ideal for whole genome sequencing, targeted sequencing, complex population analysis, RNA sequencing, and epigenetics characterization. With PacBio RS II, we have sequenced and analyzed the genomes of many species, from viruses to humans. Herein, we summarize and review some of our key genome sequencing projects, including full-length viral sequencing, complete bacterial genome and almost-complete plant genome assemblies, and long amplicon sequencing of a disease-associated gene region. We believe that PacBio RS II is not only an effective tool for use in the basic biological sciences but also in the medical/clinical setting.",28364362,PMC5486853,10.1007/s13577-017-0168-8,69
2passtools: two-pass alignment using machine-learning-filtered splice junctions increases the accuracy of intron detection in long-read RNA sequencing,"Transcription of eukaryotic genomes involves complex alternative processing of RNAs. Sequencing of full-length RNAs using long reads reveals the true complexity of processing. However, the relatively high error rates of long-read sequencing technologies can reduce the accuracy of intron identification. Here we apply alignment metrics and machine-learning-derived sequence information to filter spurious splice junctions from long-read alignments and use the remaining junctions to guide realignment in a two-pass approach. This method, available in the software package 2passtools ( https://github.com/bartongroup/2passtools ), improves the accuracy of spliced alignment and transcriptome assembly for species both with and without existing high-quality annotations.",33648554,PMC7919322,10.1186/s13059-021-02296-0,9
Long-read sequencing of the zebrafish genome reorganizes genomic architecture,"Background:Nanopore sequencing technology has revolutionized the field of genome biology with its ability to generate extra-long reads that can resolve regions of the genome that were previously inaccessible to short-read sequencing platforms. Over 50% of the zebrafish genome consists of difficult to map, highly repetitive, low complexity elements that pose inherent problems for short-read sequencers and assemblers.Results:We used long-read nanopore sequencing to generate a de novo assembly of the zebrafish genome and compared our assembly to the current reference genome, GRCz11. The new assembly identified 1697 novel insertions and deletions over one kilobase in length and placed 106 previously unlocalized scaffolds. We also discovered additional sites of retrotransposon integration previously unreported in GRCz11 and observed the expression of these transposable elements in adult zebrafish under physiologic conditions, implying they have active mobility in the zebrafish genome and contribute to the ever-changing genomic landscape.Conclusions:We used nanopore sequencing to improve upon and resolve the issues plaguing the current zebrafish reference assembly, GRCz11. Zebrafish is a prominent model of human disease, and our corrected assembly will be useful for studies relying on interspecies comparisons and precise linkage of genetic events to disease phenotypes.",35144548,PMC8832730,10.1186/s12864-022-08349-3,9
Long-read nanopore sequencing resolves a TMEM231 gene conversion event causing Meckel-Gruber syndrome,"The diagnostic deployment of massively parallel short-read next-generation sequencing (NGS) has greatly improved genetic test availability, speed, and diagnostic yield, particularly for rare inherited disorders. Nonetheless, diagnostic approaches based on short-read sequencing have a poor ability to accurately detect gene conversion events. We report on the genetic analysis of a family in which 3 fetuses had clinical features consistent with the autosomal recessive disorder Meckel-Gruber syndrome (MKS). Targeted NGS of 29 known MKS-associated genes revealed a heterozygous TMEM231 splice donor variant c.929+1A>G. Comparative read-depth analysis, performed to identify a second pathogenic allele, revealed an apparent heterozygous deletion of TMEM231 exon 4. To verify this result we performed single-molecule long-read sequencing of a long-range polymerase chain reaction product spanning this locus. We identified four missense variants that were absent from the short-read dataset due to the preferential mapping of variant-containing reads to a downstream TMEM231 pseudogene. Consistent with the parental segregation analysis, we demonstrate that the single-molecule long reads could be used to show that the variants are arranged in trans. Our experience shows that robust validation of apparent dosage variants remains essential to avoid the pitfalls of short-read sequencing and that new third-generation long-read sequencing technologies can already aid routine clinical care.",31663672,,10.1002/humu.23940,8
NanoPack2: population-scale evaluation of long-read sequencing data,"Summary:Increases in the cohort size in long-read sequencing projects necessitate more efficient software for quality assessment and processing of sequencing data from Oxford Nanopore Technologies and Pacific Biosciences.

Binaries build on musl are available for broad compatibility. NanoPlot and NanoComp are written in Python3.

Targeted Long-Read Sequencing of a Locus Under Long-Term Balancing Selection inCapsella,"Rapid advances in short-read DNA sequencing technologies have revolutionized population genomic studies, but there are genomic regions where this technology reaches its limits. Limitations mostly arise due to the difficulties in assembly or alignment to genomic regions of high sequence divergence and high repeat content, which are typical characteristics for loci under strong long-term balancing selection. Studying genetic diversity at such loci therefore remains challenging. Here, we investigate the feasibility and error rates associated with targeted long-read sequencing of a locus under balancing selection. For this purpose, we generated bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) containing the BrassicaceaeS-locus, a region under strong negative frequency-dependent selection which has previously proven difficult to assemble in its entirety using short reads. We sequenceS-locus BACs with single-molecule long-read sequencing technology and conductde novoassembly of theseS-locus haplotypes. By comparing repeated assemblies resulting from independent long-read sequencing runs on the same BAC clone we do not detect any structural errors, suggesting that reliable assemblies are generated, but we estimate an indel error rate of 5.7×10-5A similar error rate was estimated based on comparison of Illumina short-read sequences and BAC assemblies. Our results show that, untilde novoassembly of multiple individuals using long-read sequencing becomes feasible, targeted long-read sequencing of loci under balancing selection is a viable option with low error rates for single nucleotide polymorphisms or structural variation. We further find that short-read sequencing is a valuable complement, allowing correction of the relatively high rate of indel errors that result from this approach.",29476024,PMC5873921,10.1534/g3.117.300467,3
Solid-state nanopores towards single-molecule DNA sequencing,"Nanopore DNA sequencing offers a new paradigm owing to its extensive potential for long-read, high-throughput detection of nucleotide modification and direct RNA sequencing. Given the remarkable advances in protein nanopore sequencing technology, there is still a strong enthusiasm in exploring alternative nanopore-sequencing techniques, particularly those based on a solid-state nanopore using a semiconductor material. Since solid-state nanopores provide superior material robustness and large-scale integrability with on-chip electronics, they have the potential to surpass the limitations of their biological counterparts. However, there are key technical challenges to be addressed: the creation of an ultrasmall nanopore, fabrication of an ultrathin membrane, control of the ultrafast DNA speed and detection of four nucleotides. Extensive research efforts have been devoted to resolving these issues over the past two decades. In this review, we briefly introduce recent updates regarding solid-state nanopore technologies towards DNA sequencing. It can be envisioned that emerging technologies will offer a brand new future in DNA-sequencing technology.",31420594,,10.1038/s10038-019-0655-8,16
Long-read sequencing for identification of insertion sites in large transposon mutant libraries,"Transposon insertion site sequencing (TIS) is a powerful method for associating genotype to phenotype. However, all TIS methods described to date use short nucleotide sequence reads which cannot uniquely determine the locations of transposon insertions within repeating genomic sequences where the repeat units are longer than the sequence read length. To overcome this limitation, we have developed a TIS method using Oxford Nanopore sequencing technology that generates and uses long nucleotide sequence reads; we have called this method LoRTIS (Long-Read Transposon Insertion-site Sequencing). LoRTIS enabled the unique localisation of transposon insertion sites within long repetitive genetic elements of E. coli, such as the transposase genes of insertion sequences and copies of the ~ 5 kb ribosomal RNA operon. We demonstrate that LoRTIS is reproducible, gives comparable results to short-read TIS methods for essential genes, and better resolution around repeat elements. The Oxford Nanopore sequencing device that we used is cost-effective, small and easily portable. Thus, LoRTIS is an efficient means of uniquely identifying transposon insertion sites within long repetitive genetic elements and can be easily transported to, and used in, laboratories that lack access to expensive DNA sequencing facilities.",35241765,PMC8894413,10.1038/s41598-022-07557-x,1
Long-read sequencing data analysis for yeasts,"Long-read sequencing technologies have become increasingly popular due to their strengths in resolving complex genomic regions. As a leading model organism with small genome size and great biotechnological importance, the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has many isolates currently being sequenced with long reads. However, analyzing long-read sequencing data to produce high-quality genome assembly and annotation remains challenging. Here, we present a modular computational framework named long-read sequencing data analysis for yeasts (LRSDAY), the first one-stop solution that streamlines this process. Starting from the raw sequencing reads, LRSDAY can produce chromosome-level genome assembly and comprehensive genome annotation in a highly automated manner with minimal manual intervention, which is not possible using any alternative tool available to date. The annotated genomic features include centromeres, protein-coding genes, tRNAs, transposable elements (TEs), and telomere-associated elements. Although tailored for S. cerevisiae, we designed LRSDAY to be highly modular and customizable, making it adaptable to virtually any eukaryotic organism. When applying LRSDAY to an S. cerevisiae strain, it takes ∼41 h to generate a complete and well-annotated genome from ∼100× Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) running the basic workflow with four threads. Basic experience working within the Linux command-line environment is recommended for carrying out the analysis using LRSDAY.",29725120,,10.1038/nprot.2018.025,24
What sequencing technologies can teach us about innate immunity,"For years, we have taken a reductionist approach to understanding gene regulation through the study of one gene in one cell at a time. While this approach has been fruitful it is laborious and fails to provide a global picture of what is occurring in complex situations involving tightly coordinated immune responses. The emergence of whole-genome techniques provides a system-level view of a response and can provide a plethora of information on events occurring in a cell from gene expression changes to splicing changes and chemical modifications. As with any technology, this often results in more questions than answers, but this wealth of knowledge is providing us with an unprecedented view of what occurs inside our cells during an immune response. In this review, we will discuss the current RNA-sequencing technologies and what they are helping us learn about the innate immune system.",34747035,PMC8865538,10.1111/imr.13033,1
Plastid Genome Assembly Using Long-read data,"Although plastid genome (plastome) structure is highly conserved across most seed plants, investigations during the past two decades have revealed several disparately related lineages that experienced substantial rearrangements. Most plastomes contain a large inverted repeat and two single-copy regions, and a few dispersed repeats; however, the plastomes of some taxa harbour long repeat sequences (>300 bp). These long repeats make it challenging to assemble complete plastomes using short-read data, leading to misassemblies and consensus sequences with spurious rearrangements. Single-molecule, long-read sequencing has the potential to overcome these challenges, yet there is no consensus on the most effective method for accurately assembling plastomes using long-read data. We generated a pipeline, plastid Genome Assembly Using Long-read data (ptGAUL), to address the problem of plastome assembly using long-read data from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) or Pacific Biosciences platforms. We demonstrated the efficacy of the ptGAUL pipeline using 16 published long-read data sets. We showed that ptGAUL quickly produces accurate and unbiased assemblies using only ~50× coverage of plastome data. Additionally, we deployed ptGAUL to assemble four new Juncus (Juncaceae) plastomes using ONT long reads. Our results revealed many long repeats and rearrangements in Juncus plastomes compared with basal lineages of Poales. The ptGAUL pipeline is available on GitHub: https://github.com/Bean061/ptgaul.",36939021,PMC10354735,10.1111/1755-0998.13787,4
Annotation of Full-Length Long Noncoding RNAs with Capture Long-Read Sequencing (CLS),"Metazoan genomes produce thousands of long-noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), of which just a small fraction have been well characterized. Understanding their biological functions requires accurate annotations, or maps of the precise location and structure of genes and transcripts in the genome. Current lncRNA annotations are limited by compromises between quality and size, with many gene models being fragmentary or uncatalogued. To overcome this, the GENCODE consortium has developed RNA capture long-read sequencing (CLS), an approach combining targeted RNA capture with third-generation long-read sequencing. CLS provides accurate annotations at high-throughput rates. It eliminates the need for noisy transcriptome assembly from short reads, and requires minimal manual curation. The full-length transcript models produced are of quality comparable to present-day manually curated annotations. Here we describe a detailed CLS protocol, from probe design through long-read sequencing to creation of final annotations.",33326074,,10.1007/978-1-0716-1158-6_9,4
Benchmarking of long-read assemblers for prokaryote whole genome sequencing,"Background:Data sets from long-read sequencing platforms (Oxford Nanopore Technologies and Pacific Biosciences) allow for most prokaryote genomes to be completely assembled - one contig per chromosome or plasmid. However, the high per-read error rate of long-read sequencing necessitates different approaches to assembly than those used for short-read sequencing. Multiple assembly tools (assemblers) exist, which use a variety of algorithms for long-read assembly.Methods:We used 500 simulated read sets and 120 real read sets to assess the performance of eight long-read assemblers (Canu, Flye, Miniasm/Minipolish, NECAT, NextDenovo/NextPolish, Raven, Redbean and Shasta) across a wide variety of genomes and read parameters. Assemblies were assessed on their structural accuracy/completeness, sequence identity, contig circularisation and computational resources used.Results:Canu v2.1 produced reliable assemblies and was good with plasmids, but it performed poorly with circularisation and had the longest runtimes of all assemblers tested. Flye v2.8 was also reliable and made the smallest sequence errors, though it used the most RAM. Miniasm/Minipolish v0.3/v0.1.3 was the most likely to produce clean contig circularisation. NECAT v20200803 was reliable and good at circularisation but tended to make larger sequence errors. NextDenovo/NextPolish v2.3.1/v1.3.1 was reliable with chromosome assembly but bad with plasmid assembly. Raven v1.3.0 was reliable for chromosome assembly, though it did not perform well on small plasmids and had circularisation issues. Redbean v2.5 and Shasta v0.7.0 were computationally efficient but more likely to produce incomplete assemblies.Conclusions:Of the assemblers tested, Flye, Miniasm/Minipolish, NextDenovo/NextPolish and Raven performed best overall. However, no single tool performed well on all metrics, highlighting the need for continued development on long-read assembly algorithms.",31984131,PMC6966772,10.12688/f1000research.21782.4,128
Development of a long-read next generation sequencing workflow for improved characterization of fastidious respiratory mycoplasmas,"Mycoplasma cynosandMycoplasma felisare often associated with canine and feline infectious respiratory disease in dogs and cats, respectively. Mycoplasmas have a reduced genome and dearth of many biosynthetic pathways, making them dependent on rich medium for growth. Due to this fastidious nature, mycoplasmas have been historically underdiagnosed. The aim of this study was to develop a cost-effective and accurate sequencing workflow for genotypic characterization of clinical isolates ofM. cynosandM. felisusing a rapid long-read sequencing platform. We explored the following critical aspects of bacterial whole genome sequencing, including: (i) five solid and liquid-based culture approaches based on a specialized media formulation forMycoplasmaculture, (ii) three DNA extraction methods modified for long-read sequencing purposes, and (iii) twode novoassembly platforms, Flye and Canu, as key components of a bioinformatics pipeline. DNA extraction method 1, a solid-phase and column-based kit with enzymatic lysis, provided the best DNA quality and concentration followed by high coverage and sequencing contiguity. This was obtained with a culture volume of 45 ml in modified Hayflick's broth incubated for 48 h. DNA extracted directly from colonies on agar or from small broth volumes (6 ml) did not meet the criteria required for long-read sequencing. Overall, Flye generated more contiguous assemblies than the Canu assembler and was more time efficient. This 4-5 day sample-to-sequence workflow provides the scientific and clinical communities with a more comprehensive tool than laborious conventional methods for complete genomic characterization ofM. cynosandM. felisclinical isolates.",36374163,,10.1099/mic.0.001249,2
A survey of algorithms for the detection of genomic structural variants from long-read sequencing data,"As long-read sequencing technologies are becoming increasingly popular, a number of methods have been developed for the discovery and analysis of structural variants (SVs) from long reads. Long reads enable detection of SVs that could not be previously detected from short-read sequencing, but computational methods must adapt to the unique challenges and opportunities presented by long-read sequencing. Here, we summarize over 50 long-read-based methods for SV detection, genotyping and visualization, and discuss how new telomere-to-telomere genome assemblies and pangenome efforts can improve the accuracy and drive the development of SV callers in the future.",37386186,,10.1038/s41592-023-01932-w,6
Targeted long-read sequencing identifies and characterizes structural variants in cases of inherited platelet disorders,"Background:Genetic diagnosis of inherited platelet disorders (IPDs) is mainly performed by high-throughput sequencing (HTS). These short-read-based sequencing methods sometimes fail to characterize the genetics of the disease.Objectives:To evaluate nanopore long-read DNA sequencing for characterization of structural variants (SVs) in patients with IPDs.Methods:Four patients with a clinical and laboratory diagnosis of Glanzmann thrombasthenia (GT) (P1 and P2) and Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS) (P3 and P4) in whom HTS missed the underlying molecular cause were included. DNA was analyzed by both standard HTS and nanopore sequencing on a MinION device (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) after enrichment of DNA spanning regions covering GT and HPS genes.Results:In patients with GT, HTS identified only 1 heterozygous ITGB3 splice variant c.2301+1G>C in P2. In patients with HPS, a homozygous deletion in HPS5 was suspected in P3, and 2 heterozygous HPS3 variants, c.2464C>T (p.Arg822∗) and a deletion affecting 2 exons, were reported in P4. Nanopore sequencing revealed a complex SV affecting exons 2 to 6 in ITGB3 (deletion-inversion-duplication) in homozygosity in P1 and compound heterozygosity with the splice variant in P2. In the 2 patients with HPS, nanopore defined the length of the SVs, which were characterized at nucleotide resolution. This allowed the identification of repetitive Alu elements at the breakpoints and the design of specific polymerase chain reactions for family screening.Conclusion:The nanopore technology overcomes the limitations of standard short-read sequencing techniques in SV characterization. Using nanopore, we characterized novel defects in ITGB3, HPS5, and HPS3, highlighting the utility of long-read sequencing as an additional diagnostic tool in IPDs.",38007062,,10.1016/j.jtha.2023.11.007,0
Preparation of Mammalian Nascent RNA for Long Read Sequencing,"Long read sequencing technologies now allow high-quality sequencing of RNAs (or their cDNAs) that are hundreds to thousands of nucleotides long. Long read sequences of nascent RNA provide single-nucleotide-resolution information about co-transcriptional RNA processing events-e.g., splicing, folding, and base modifications. Here, we describe how to isolate nascent RNA from mammalian cells through subcellular fractionation of chromatin-associated RNA, as well as how to deplete poly(A)+RNA and rRNA, and, finally, how to generate a full-length cDNA library for use on long read sequencing platforms. This approach allows for an understanding of coordinated splicing status across multi-intron transcripts by revealing patterns of splicing or other RNA processing events that cannot be gained from traditional short read RNA sequencing. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

SVLR: Genome Structural Variant Detection Using Long-Read Sequencing Data,"Genome structural variants (SVs) have great impacts on human phenotype and diversity, and have been linked to numerous diseases. Long-read sequencing technologies arise to make it possible to find SVs of as long as 10,000 nucleotides. Thus, long read-based SV detection has been drawing attention of many recent research projects, and many tools have been developed for long reads to detect SVs recently. In this article, we present a new method, called SVLR, to detect SVs based on long-read sequencing data. Comparing with existing methods, SVLR can detect three new kinds of SVs: block replacements, block interchanges, and translocations. Although these new SVs are structurally more complicated, SVLR achieves accuracies that are comparable with those of the classic SVs. Moreover, for the classic SVs that can be detected by state-of-the-art methods (e.g., SVIM and Sniffles), our experiments demonstrate recall improvements of up to 38% without harming the precisions (i.e., >78%). We also point out three directions to further improve SV detection in the future. Source codes: https://github.com/GWYSDU/SVLR.",33973820,,10.1089/cmb.2021.0048,2
A comprehensive evaluation of long read error correction methods,"Background:Third-generation single molecule sequencing technologies can sequence long reads, which is advancing the frontiers of genomics research. However, their high error rates prohibit accurate and efficient downstream analysis. This difficulty has motivated the development of many long read error correction tools, which tackle this problem through sampling redundancy and/or leveraging accurate short reads of the same biological samples. Existing studies to asses these tools use simulated data sets, and are not sufficiently comprehensive in the range of software covered or diversity of evaluation measures used.Results:In this paper, we present a categorization and review of long read error correction methods, and provide a comprehensive evaluation of the corresponding long read error correction tools. Leveraging recent real sequencing data, we establish benchmark data sets and set up evaluation criteria for a comparative assessment which includes quality of error correction as well as run-time and memory usage. We study how trimming and long read sequencing depth affect error correction in terms of length distribution and genome coverage post-correction, and the impact of error correction performance on an important application of long reads, genome assembly. We provide guidelines for practitioners for choosing among the available error correction tools and identify directions for future research.Conclusions:Despite the high error rate of long reads, the state-of-the-art correction tools can achieve high correction quality. When short reads are available, the best hybrid methods outperform non-hybrid methods in terms of correction quality and computing resource usage. When choosing tools for use, practitioners are suggested to be careful with a few correction tools that discard reads, and check the effect of error correction tools on downstream analysis. Our evaluation code is available as open-source at https://github.com/haowenz/LRECE .",33349243,PMC7751105,10.1186/s12864-020-07227-0,47
Robust and scalable barcoding for massively parallel long-read sequencing,"Nucleic-acid barcoding is an enabling technique for many applications, but its use remains limited in emerging long-read sequencing technologies with intrinsically low raw accuracy. Here, we apply so-called NS-watermark barcodes, whose error correction capability was previously validated in silico, in a proof of concept where we synthesize 3840 NS-watermark barcodes and use them to asymmetrically tag and simultaneously sequence amplicons from two evolutionarily distant species (namely Bordetella pertussis and Drosophila mojavensis) on the ONT MinION platform. To our knowledge, this is the largest number of distinct, non-random tags ever sequenced in parallel and the first report of microarray-based synthesis as a source for large oligonucleotide pools for barcoding. We recovered the identity of more than 86% of the barcodes, with a crosstalk rate of 0.17% (i.e., one misassignment every 584 reads). This falls in the range of the index hopping rate of established, high-accuracy Illumina sequencing, despite the increased number of tags and the relatively low accuracy of both microarray-based synthesis and long-read sequencing. The robustness of NS-watermark barcodes, together with their scalable design and compatibility with low-cost massive synthesis, makes them promising for present and future sequencing applications requiring massive labeling, such as long-read single-cell RNA-Seq.",35538127,PMC9090787,10.1038/s41598-022-11656-0,3
Obtaining Detailed Phage Transcriptomes Using ONT-Cappable-Seq,"Detailed transcription maps of bacteriophages are not usually explored, limiting our understanding of molecular phage biology and restricting their exploitation and engineering. The ONT-cappable-seq method described here brings phage transcriptomics to the accessible nanopore sequencing platform and provides an affordable and more detailed overview of transcriptional features compared to traditional RNA-seq experiments. With ONT-cappable-seq, primary transcripts are specifically capped, enriched, and prepared for long-read sequencing on the nanopore sequencing platform. This enables end-to-end sequencing of unprocessed transcripts covering both phage and host genome, thus providing insight on their operons. The subsequent analysis pipeline makes it possible to rapidly identify the most important transcriptional features such as transcription start and stop sites. The obtained data can thus provide a comprehensive overview of the transcription by your phage of interest.",38526733,,10.1007/978-1-0716-3798-2_14,0
Whole-genome long-read TAPS deciphers DNA methylation patterns at base resolution using PacBio SMRT sequencing technology,"Long-read sequencing provides valuable information on difficult-to-map genomic regions, which can complement short-read sequencing to improve genome assembly, yet limited methods are available to accurately detect DNA methylation over long distances at a whole-genome scale. By combining our recently developed TET-assisted pyridine borane sequencing (TAPS) method, which enables direct detection of 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, with PacBio single-molecule real-time sequencing, we present here whole-genome long-read TAPS (wglrTAPS). To evaluate the performance of wglrTAPS, we applied it to mouse embryonic stem cells as a proof of concept, and an N50 read length of 3.5 kb is achieved. By sequencing wglrTAPS to 8.2× depth, we discovered a significant proportion of CpG sites that were not covered in previous 27.5× short-read TAPS. Our results demonstrate that wglrTAPS facilitates methylation profiling on problematic genomic regions with repetitive elements or structural variations, and also in an allelic manner, all of which are extremely difficult for short-read sequencing methods to resolve. This method therefore enhances applications of third-generation sequencing technologies for DNA epigenetics.",35849350,PMC9561279,10.1093/nar/gkac612,6
Clinical sequencing: From raw data to diagnosis with lifetime value,"High-throughput sequencing (HTS) has revolutionized genetics by enabling the detection of sequence variants at hitherto unprecedented large scale. Despite these advances, however, there are still remaining challenges in the complete coverage of targeted regions (genes, exome or genome) as well as in HTS data analysis and interpretation. Moreover, it is easy to get overwhelmed by the plethora of available methods and tools for HTS. Here, we review the step-by-step process from the generation of sequence data to molecular diagnosis of Mendelian diseases. Highlighting advantages and limitations, this review addresses the current state of (1) HTS technologies, considering targeted, whole-exome, and whole-genome sequencing on short- and long-read platforms; (2) read alignment, variant calling and interpretation; as well as (3) regulatory issues related to genetic counseling, reimbursement, and data storage.",29206278,,10.1111/cge.13190,33
Accurate long-read sequencing allows assembly of the duplicated RHD and RHCE genes harboring variants relevant to blood transfusion,"Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have transformed medical genetics. However, short-read lengths pose a limitation on identification of structural variants, sequencing repetitive regions, phasing of distant nucleotide changes, and distinguishing highly homologous genomic regions. Long-read sequencing technologies may offer improvements in the characterization of genes that are currently difficult to assess. We used a combination of targeted DNA capture, long-read sequencing, and a customized bioinformatics pipeline to fully assemble the RH region, which harbors variation relevant to red cell donor-recipient mismatch, particularly among patients with sickle cell disease. RHD and RHCE are a pair of duplicated genes located within an ∼175 kb region on human chromosome 1 that have high sequence similarity and frequent structural variations. To achieve the assembly, we utilized palindrome repeats in PacBio SMRT reads to obtain consensus sequences of 2.1 to 2.9 kb average length with over 99% accuracy. We used these long consensus sequences to identify 771 assembly markers and to phase the RHD-RHCE region with high confidence. The dataset enabled direct linkage between coding and intronic variants, phasing of distant SNPs to determine RHD-RHCE haplotypes, and identification of known and novel structural variations along with the breakpoints. A limiting factor in phasing is the frequency of heterozygous assembly markers and therefore was most successful in samples from African Black individuals with increased heterogeneity at the RH locus. Overall, this approach allows RH genotyping and de novo assembly in an unbiased and comprehensive manner that is necessary to expand application of NGS technology to high-resolution RH typing.",34968422,PMC8764270,10.1016/j.ajhg.2021.12.003,2
Structural Variant Detection from Long-Read Sequencing Data with cuteSV,"Structural Variation (SV) represents genomic rearrangements and is strongly associated with human health and disease. Recently, long-read sequencing technologies provide the opportunity to more comprehensive identification of SVs at an ever-high resolution. However, under the circumstance of high sequencing errors and the complexity of SVs, there remains lots of technical issues to be settled. Hence, we propose cuteSV, a sensitive, fast, and scalable alignment-based SV detection approach to complete comprehensive discovery of diverse SVs. The benchmarking results indicate cuteSV is suitable for large-scale genome project since its excellent SV yields and ultra-fast speed. Here, we explain the overall framework for providing a detailed outline for users to apply cuteSV correctly and comprehensively.

Tools and Strategies for Long-Read Sequencing and De Novo Assembly of Plant Genomes,"The commercial release of third-generation sequencing technologies (TGSTs), giving long and ultra-long sequencing reads, has stimulated the development of new tools for assembling highly contiguous genome sequences with unprecedented accuracy across complex repeat regions. We survey here a wide range of emerging sequencing platforms and analytical tools for de novo assembly, provide background information for each of their steps, and discuss the spectrum of available options. Our decision tree recommends workflows for the generation of a high-quality genome assembly when used in combination with the specific needs and resources of a project.",31208890,,10.1016/j.tplants.2019.05.003,31
Improvements in Genomic Technologies: Application to Crop Genomics,"Second-generation sequencing (SGS) has advanced the study of crop genomes and has provided insights into diversity and evolution. However, repetitive DNA sequences in crops often lead to incomplete or erroneous assemblies because SGS reads are too short to fully resolve these repeats. To overcome some of these challenges, long-read sequencing and optical mapping have been developed to produce high-quality assemblies for complex genomes. Previously, high error rates, low throughput, and high costs have limited the adoption of long-read sequencing and optical mapping. However, with recent improvements and the development of novel algorithms, the application of these technologies is increasing. We review the development of long-read sequencing and optical mapping, and assess their application in crop genomics for breeding improved crops.",28284542,,10.1016/j.tibtech.2017.02.009,30
Sequencing Illumina libraries at high accuracy on the ONT MinION using R2C2,"High-throughput short-read sequencing has taken on a central role in research and diagnostics. Hundreds of different assays take advantage of Illumina short-read sequencers, the predominant short-read sequencing technology available today. Although other short-read sequencing technologies exist, the ubiquity of Illumina sequencers in sequencing core facilities and the high capital costs of these technologies have limited their adoption. Among a new generation of sequencing technologies, Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) holds a unique position because the ONT MinION, an error-prone long-read sequencer, is associated with little to no capital cost. Here we show that we can make short-read Illumina libraries compatible with the ONT MinION by using the rolling circle to concatemeric consensus (R2C2) method to circularize and amplify the short library molecules. This results in longer DNA molecules containing tandem repeats of the original short library molecules. This longer DNA is ideally suited for the ONT MinION, and after sequencing, the tandem repeats in the resulting raw reads can be converted into high-accuracy consensus reads with similar error rates to that of the Illumina MiSeq. We highlight this capability by producing and benchmarking RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, and regular and target-enriched Tn5 libraries. We also explore the use of this approach for rapid evaluation of sequencing library metrics by implementing a real-time analysis workflow.",36351772,PMC9808628,10.1101/gr.277031.122,5
Pacybara: accurate long-read sequencing for barcoded mutagenized allelic libraries,"Motivation:Long-read sequencing technologies, an attractive solution for many applications, often suffer from higher error rates. Alignment of multiple reads can improve base-calling accuracy, but some applications, e.g. sequencing mutagenized libraries where multiple distinct clones differ by one or few variants, require the use of barcodes or unique molecular identifiers. Unfortunately, sequencing errors can interfere with correct barcode identification, and a given barcode sequence may be linked to multiple independent clones within a given library.Results:Here we focus on the target application of sequencing mutagenized libraries in the context of multiplexed assays of variant effects (MAVEs). MAVEs are increasingly used to create comprehensive genotype-phenotype maps that can aid clinical variant interpretation. Many MAVE methods use long-read sequencing of barcoded mutant libraries for accurate association of barcode with genotype. Existing long-read sequencing pipelines do not account for inaccurate sequencing or nonunique barcodes. Here, we describe Pacybara, which handles these issues by clustering long reads based on the similarities of (error-prone) barcodes while also detecting barcodes that have been associated with multiple genotypes. Pacybara also detects recombinant (chimeric) clones and reduces false positive indel calls. In three example applications, we show that Pacybara identifies and correctly resolves these issues.Availability and implementation:Pacybara, freely available at https://github.com/rothlab/pacybara, is implemented using R, Python, and bash for Linux. It runs on GNU/Linux HPC clusters via Slurm, PBS, or GridEngine schedulers. A single-machine simplex version is also available.",38569896,PMC11021806,10.1093/bioinformatics/btae182,0
"Overview of structural variation calling: Simulation, identification, and visualization","Structural variation (SV) is a vital part of biological genetic diversity. The simulation and identification with high efficiency and accuracy are considered to be very important. With the continuous development and wide application of various technologies, computer simulation of genomic data has attracted wide attention due to its intuitive and convenient advantages. Meanwhile, there are several high-quality methods used for structural variation identification based on second-generation (short-read) and third-generation (long-read) data. These methods utilize various strategies and compatible aligners and exhibit specific characteristics. In addition, genomic visualization tools use graphical interfaces to visualize the data, which are convenient for data observation, validation, and even for the manual curation of several questionable data. The present study summarized the methods of simulation, identification, and visualization tools for structural variation in the context of sequencing technology development. Overall, this review aimed to offer a more comprehensive understanding of the impact of SV.",35585730,,10.1016/j.compbiomed.2022.105534,2
Beyond assembly: the increasing flexibility of single-molecule sequencing technology,"The maturation of high-throughput short-read sequencing technology over the past two decades has shaped the way genomes are studied. Recently, single-molecule, long-read sequencing has emerged as an essential tool in deciphering genome structure and function, including filling gaps in the human reference genome, measuring the epigenome and characterizing splicing variants in the transcriptome. With recent technological developments, these single-molecule technologies have moved beyond genome assembly and are being used in a variety of ways, including to selectively sequence specific loci with long reads, measure chromatin state and protein-DNA binding in order to investigate the dynamics of gene regulation, and rapidly determine copy number variation. These increasingly flexible uses of single-molecule technologies highlight a young and fast-moving part of the field that is leading to a more accessible era of nucleic acid sequencing.",37161088,PMC10169143,10.1038/s41576-023-00600-1,5
Comprehensive de novo mutation discovery with HiFi long-read sequencing,"Background:Long-read sequencing (LRS) techniques have been very successful in identifying structural variants (SVs). However, the high error rate of LRS made the detection of small variants (substitutions and short indels < 20 bp) more challenging. The introduction of PacBio HiFi sequencing makes LRS also suited for detecting small variation. Here we evaluate the ability of HiFi reads to detect de novo mutations (DNMs) of all types, which are technically challenging variant types and a major cause of sporadic, severe, early-onset disease.Methods:We sequenced the genomes of eight parent-child trios using high coverage PacBio HiFi LRS (~ 30-fold coverage) and Illumina short-read sequencing (SRS) (~ 50-fold coverage). De novo substitutions, small indels, short tandem repeats (STRs) and SVs were called in both datasets and compared to each other to assess the accuracy of HiFi LRS. In addition, we determined the parent-of-origin of the small DNMs using phasing.Results:We identified a total of 672 and 859 de novo substitutions/indels, 28 and 126 de novo STRs, and 24 and 1 de novo SVs in LRS and SRS respectively. For the small variants, there was a 92 and 85% concordance between the platforms. For the STRs and SVs, the concordance was 3.6 and 0.8%, and 4 and 100% respectively. We successfully validated 27/54 LRS-unique small variants, of which 11 (41%) were confirmed as true de novo events. For the SRS-unique small variants, we validated 42/133 DNMs and 8 (19%) were confirmed as true de novo event. Validation of 18 LRS-unique de novo STR calls confirmed none of the repeat expansions as true DNM. Confirmation of the 23 LRS-unique SVs was possible for 19 candidate SVs of which 10 (52.6%) were true de novo events. Furthermore, we were able to assign 96% of DNMs to their parental allele with LRS data, as opposed to just 20% with SRS data.Conclusions:HiFi LRS can now produce the most comprehensive variant dataset obtainable by a single technology in a single laboratory, allowing accurate calling of substitutions, indels, STRs and SVs. The accuracy even allows sensitive calling of DNMs on all variant levels, and also allows for phasing, which helps to distinguish true positive from false positive DNMs.",37158973,PMC10169305,10.1186/s13073-023-01183-6,6
"DNA read count calibration for single-molecule, long-read sequencing","There are many applications in which quantitative information about DNA mixtures with different molecular lengths is important. Gene therapy vectors are much longer than can be sequenced individually via short-read NGS. However, vector preparations may contain smaller DNAs that behave differently during sequencing. We have used two library preparations each for Pacific Biosystems (PacBio) and Oxford Nanopore Technologies NGS to determine their suitability for quantitative assessment of varying sized DNAs. Equimolar length standards were generated from E. coli genomic DNA. Both PacBio library preparations provided a consistent length dependence though with a complex pattern. This method is sufficiently sensitive that differences in genomic copy number between DNA from E. coli grown in exponential and stationary phase conditions could be detected. The transposase-based Oxford Nanopore library preparation provided a predictable length dependence, but the random sequence starts caused the loss of original length information. The ligation-based approach retained length information but read frequency was more variable. Modeling of E. coli versus lambda read frequency via cubic spline smoothing showed that the shorter genome could be used as a suitable internal spike-in for DNAs in the 200 bp to 10 kb range, allowing meaningful QC to be carried out with AAV preparations.",36319642,PMC9626564,10.1038/s41598-022-21606-5,1
Enhanced mixture interpretation with macrohaplotypes based on long-read DNA sequencing,"Deconvoluting mixture samples is one of the most challenging problems confronting DNA forensic laboratories. Efforts have been made to provide solutions regarding mixture interpretation. The probabilistic interpretation of Short Tandem Repeat (STR) profiles has increased the number of complex mixtures that can be analyzed. A portion of complex mixture profiles, particularly for mixtures with a high number of contributors, are still being deemed uninterpretable. Novel forensic markers, such as Single Nucleotide Variants (SNV) and microhaplotypes, also have been proposed to allow for better mixture interpretation. However, these markers have both a lower discrimination power compared with STRs and are not compatible with CODIS or other national DNA databanks worldwide. The short-read sequencing (SRS) technologies can facilitate mixture interpretation by identifying intra-allelic variations within STRs. Unfortunately, the short size of the amplicons containing STR markers and sequence reads limit the alleles that can be attained per STR. The latest long-read sequencing (LRS) technologies can overcome this limitation in some samples in which larger DNA fragments (including both STRs and SNVs) with definitive phasing are available. Based on the LRS technologies, this study developed a novel CODIS compatible forensic marker, called a macrohaplotype, which combines a CODIS STR and flanking variants to offer extremely high number of haplotypes and hence very high discrimination power per marker. The macrohaplotype will substantially improve mixture interpretation capabilities. Based on publicly accessible data, a panel of 20 macrohaplotypes with sizes of ~ 8 k bp and the maximum high discrimination powers were designed. The statistical evaluation demonstrates that these macrohaplotypes substantially outperform CODIS STRs for mixture interpretation, particularly for mixtures with a high number of contributors, as well as other forensic applications. Based on these results, efforts should be undertaken to build a complete workflow, both wet-lab and bioinformatics, to precisely call the variants and generate the macrohaplotypes based on the LRS technologies.",34378071,,10.1007/s00414-021-02679-9,0
Combined Short and Long-Read Sequencing Reveals a Complex Transcriptomic Architecture of African Swine Fever Virus,"African swine fever virus (ASFV) is a large DNA virus belonging to the Asfarviridae family. Despite its agricultural importance, little is known about the fundamental molecular mechanisms of this pathogen. Short-read sequencing (SRS) can produce a huge amount of high-precision sequencing reads for transcriptomic profiling, but it is inefficient for comprehensively annotating transcriptomes. Long-read sequencing (LRS) can overcome some of SRS's limitations, but it also has drawbacks, such as low-coverage and high error rate. The limitations of the two approaches can be surmounted by the combined use of these techniques. In this study, we used Illumina SRS and Oxford Nanopore Technologies LRS platforms with multiple library preparation methods (amplified and direct cDNA sequencings and native RNA sequencing) for constructing the ASFV transcriptomic atlas. This work identified many novel transcripts and transcript isoforms and annotated the precise termini of previously described RNAs. This study identified a novel species of ASFV transcripts, the replication origin-associated RNAs. Additionally, we discovered several nested genes embedded into larger canonical genes. In contrast to the current view that the ASFV transcripts are monocistronic, we detected a significant extent of polycistronism. A multifaceted meshwork of transcriptional overlaps was also discovered.",33808073,PMC8103240,10.3390/v13040579,10
Accurate targeted long-read DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation sequencing with TAPS,"We present long-read Tet-assisted pyridine borane sequencing (lrTAPS) for targeted base-resolution sequencing of DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation in regions up to 10 kb from nanogram-level input. Compatible with both Oxford Nanopore and PacBio Single-Molecule Real-Time (SMRT) sequencing, lrTAPS detects methylation with accuracy comparable to short-read Illumina sequencing but with long-range epigenetic phasing. We applied lrTAPS to sequence difficult-to-map regions in mouse embryonic stem cells and to identify distinct methylation events in the integrated hepatitis B virus genome.",32127008,PMC7053107,10.1186/s13059-020-01969-6,34

We hope that this protocol will help in guiding researchers who are new to the process of long-read sequencing analysis.",35776635,PMC9254108,10.1016/j.xpro.2022.101506,2
"High-molecular weight DNA extraction, clean-up and size selection for long-read sequencing","Rapid advancements in long-read sequencing technologies have transformed read lengths from bps to Mbps, which has enabled chromosome-scale genome assemblies. However, read lengths are now becoming limited by the extraction of pure high-molecular weight DNA suitable for long-read sequencing, which is particularly challenging in plants and fungi. To overcome this, we present a protocol collection; high-molecular weight DNA extraction, clean-up and size selection for long-read sequencing. We optimised a gentle magnetic bead based high-molecular weight DNA extraction, which is presented here in detail. The protocol circumvents spin columns and high-centrifugation, to limit DNA fragmentation. The protocol is scalable based on tissue input, which can be used on many species of plants, fungi, reptiles and bacteria. It is also cost effective compared to kit-based protocols and hence applicable at scale in low resource settings. An optional sorbitol wash is listed and is highly recommended for plant and fungal tissues. To further remove any remaining contaminants such as phenols and polysaccharides, optional DNA clean-up and size selection strategies are given. This protocol collection is suitable for all common long-read sequencing platforms, such as technologies offered by PacBio and Oxford Nanopore. Using these protocols, sequencing on the Oxford Nanopore MinION can achieve read length N50 values of 30-50 kb, with reads exceeding 200 kb and outputs ranging from 15-30 Gbp. This has been routinely achieved with various plant, fungi, animal and bacteria samples.",34264958,PMC8282028,10.1371/journal.pone.0253830,18
MinION-based long-read sequencing and assembly extends theCaenorhabditis elegansreference genome,"Advances in long-read single molecule sequencing have opened new possibilities for 'benchtop' whole-genome sequencing. The Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION is a portable device that uses nanopore technology that can directly sequence DNA molecules. MinION single molecule long sequence reads are well suited for de novo assembly of complex genomes as they facilitate the construction of highly contiguous physical genome maps obviating the need for labor-intensive physical genome mapping. Long sequence reads can also be used to delineate complex chromosomal rearrangements, such as those that occur in tumor cells, that can confound analysis using short reads. Here, we assessed MinION long-read-derived sequences for feasibility concerning: (1) the de novo assembly of a large complex genome, and (2) the elucidation of complex rearrangements. The genomes of twoCaenorhabditis elegansstrains, a wild-type strain and a strain containing two complex rearrangements, were sequenced with MinION. Up to 42-fold coverage was obtained from a single flow cell, and the best pooled data assembly produced a highly contiguous wild-typeC. elegansgenome containing 48 contigs (N50 contig length = 3.99 Mb) covering >99% of the 100,286,401-base reference genome. Further, the MinION-derived genome assembly expanded theC. elegansreference genome by >2 Mb due to a more accurate determination of repetitive sequence elements and assembled the complete genomes of two co-extracted bacteria. MinION long-read sequence data also facilitated the elucidation of complex rearrangements in a mutagenized strain. The sequence accuracy of the MinION long-read contigs (∼98%) was improved using Illumina-derived sequence data to polish the final genome assembly to 99.8% nucleotide accuracy when compared to the reference assembly.",29273626,PMC5793790,10.1101/gr.221184.117,71
Consistent ultra-long DNA sequencing with automated slow pipetting,"Background:Oxford Nanopore Technologies' instruments can sequence reads of great length. Long reads improve sequence assemblies by unambiguously spanning repetitive elements of the genome. Sequencing reads of significant length requires the preservation of long DNA template molecules through library preparation by pipetting reagents as slowly as possible to minimize shearing. This process is time-consuming and inconsistent at preserving read length as even small changes in volumetric flow rate can result in template shearing.Results:We have designed SNAILS (Slow Nucleic Acid Instrument for Long Sequences), a 3D-printable instrument that automates slow pipetting of reagents used in long read library preparation for Oxford Nanopore sequencing. Across six sequencing libraries, SNAILS preserved more reads exceeding 100 kilobases in length and increased its libraries' average read length over manual slow pipetting.Conclusions:SNAILS is a low-cost, easily deployable solution for improving sequencing projects that require reads of significant length. By automating the slow pipetting of library preparation reagents, SNAILS increases the consistency and throughput of long read Nanopore sequencing.",33711930,PMC7953553,10.1186/s12864-021-07500-w,5
Initial Analysis of Structural Variation Detections in Cattle Using Long-Read Sequencing Methods,"Structural variations (SVs), as a great source of genetic variation, are widely distributed in the genome. SVs involve longer genomic sequences and potentially have stronger effects than SNPs, but they are not well captured by short-read sequencing owing to their size and relevance to repeats. Improved characterization of SVs can provide more advanced insight into complex traits. With the availability of long-read sequencing, it has become feasible to uncover the full range of SVs. Here, we sequenced one cattle individual using 10× Genomics (10 × G) linked read, Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) continuous long reads (CLR) and circular consensus sequencing (CCS), as well as Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) PromethION. We evaluated the ability of various methods for SV detection. We identified 21,164 SVs, which amount to 186 Mb covering 7.07% of the whole genome. The number of SVs inferred from long-read-based inferences was greater than that from short reads. The PacBio CLR identified the most of large SVs and covered the most genomes. SVs called with PacBio CCS and ONT data showed high uniformity. The one with the most overlap with the results obtained by short-read data was PB CCS. Together, we found that long reads outperformed short reads in terms of SV detections.",35627213,PMC9142105,10.3390/genes13050828,3
"CaBagE: A Cas9-based Background Elimination strategy for targeted, long-read DNA sequencing","A substantial fraction of the human genome is difficult to interrogate with short-read DNA sequencing technologies due to paralogy, complex haplotype structures, or tandem repeats. Long-read sequencing technologies, such as Oxford Nanopore's MinION, enable direct measurement of complex loci without introducing many of the biases inherent to short-read methods, though they suffer from relatively lower throughput. This limitation has motivated recent efforts to develop amplification-free strategies to target and enrich loci of interest for subsequent sequencing with long reads. Here, we present CaBagE, a method for target enrichment that is efficient and useful for sequencing large, structurally complex targets. The CaBagE method leverages the stable binding of Cas9 to its DNA target to protect desired fragments from digestion with exonuclease. Enriched DNA fragments are then sequenced with Oxford Nanopore's MinION long-read sequencing technology. Enrichment with CaBagE resulted in a median of 116X coverage (range 39-416) of target loci when tested on five genomic targets ranging from 4-20kb in length using healthy donor DNA. Four cancer gene targets were enriched in a single reaction and multiplexed on a single MinION flow cell. We further demonstrate the utility of CaBagE in two ALS patients with C9orf72 short tandem repeat expansions to produce genotype estimates commensurate with genotypes derived from repeat-primed PCR for each individual. With CaBagE there is a physical enrichment of on-target DNA in a given sample prior to sequencing. This feature allows adaptability across sequencing platforms and potential use as an enrichment strategy for applications beyond sequencing. CaBagE is a rapid enrichment method that can illuminate regions of the 'hidden genome' underlying human disease.",33830997,PMC8031414,10.1371/journal.pone.0241253,13
Evaluation of the accuracy of bacterial genome reconstruction with Oxford Nanopore R10.4.1 long-read-only sequencing,"Whole-genome reconstruction of bacterial pathogens has become an important tool for tracking transmission and antimicrobial resistance gene spread, but highly accurate and complete assemblies have largely only historically been achievable using hybrid long- and short-read sequencing. We previously found the Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) R10.4/kit12 flowcell/chemistry produced improved assemblies over the R9.4.1/kit10 combination, however long-read only assemblies contained more errors compared to Illumina-ONT hybrid assemblies. ONT have since released an R10.4.1/kit14 flowcell/chemistry upgrade and recommended the use of Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) during library preparation, both of which reportedly increase accuracy and yield. They have also released updated basecallers trained using native bacterial DNA containing methylation sites intended to fix systematic basecalling errors, including common adenosine (A) to guanine (G) and cytosine (C) to thymine (T) substitutions. To evaluate these improvements, we successfully sequenced four bacterial reference strains, namelyEscherichia coli,Klebsiella pneumoniae,Pseudomonas aeruginosaandStaphylococcus aureus, and nine genetically diverseE. colibloodstream infection-associated isolates from different phylogroups and sequence types, both with and without BSA. These sequences werede novoassembled and compared against Illumina-corrected reference genomes. In this small evaluation of 13 isolates we found that nanopore long-read-only R10.4.1/kit 14 assemblies with updated basecallers trained using bacterial methylated DNA produce accurate assemblies with ≥40×depth, sufficient to be cost-effective compared with hybrid ONT/Illumina sequencing in our setting.",38713194,,10.1099/mgen.0.001246,0
Phasing of de novo mutations using a scaled-up multiple amplicon long-read sequencing approach,"De novo mutations (DNMs) play an important role in severe genetic disorders that reduce fitness. To better understand their role in disease, it is important to determine the parent-of-origin and timing of mutational events that give rise to these mutations, especially in sex-specific developmental disorders such as male infertility. However, currently available short-read sequencing approaches are not ideally suited for phasing, as this requires long continuous DNA strands that span both the DNM and one or more informative single-nucleotide polymorphisms. To overcome these challenges, we optimized and implemented a multiplexed long-read sequencing approach using Oxford Nanopore technologies MinION platform. We focused on improving target amplification, integrating long-read sequenced data with high-quality short-read sequence data, and developing an anchored phasing computational method. This approach handled the inherent phasing challenges of long-range target amplification and the normal accumulation of sequencing error associated with long-read sequencing. In total, 77 of 109 DNMs (71%) were successfully phased and parent-of-origin identified. The majority of phased DNMs were prezygotic (90%), the accuracy of which is highlighted by an average mutant allele frequency of 49.6% and standard error of 0.84%. This study demonstrates the benefits of employing an integrated short-read and long-read sequencing approach for large-scale DNM phasing.",36047340,PMC9826063,10.1002/humu.24450,1

Sequencing technologies and tools for short tandem repeat variation detection,"Short tandem repeats are highly polymorphic and associated with a wide range of phenotypic variation, some of which cause neurodegenerative disease in humans. With advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies, there are novel opportunities to study genetic variation. While available sequencing technologies and bioinformatics tools provide options for mining high-throughput sequencing data, their suitability for analysis of repeat variation is an open question, with tools for quantifying variability in repetitive sequence still in their infancy. We present here a comprehensive survey and empirical evaluation of current sequencing technologies and bioinformatics tools in all stages of an analysis pipeline. While there is not one optimal pipeline to suit all circumstances, we find that the choice of alignment and repeat genotyping tools greatly impacts the accuracy and efficiency by which short tandem repeat variation can be detected. We further note that to detect variation relevant to many repeat diseases, it is essential to choose technologies that offer either long read-lengths or paired-end sequencing, coupled with specific genotyping tools.",24504770,,10.1093/bib/bbu001,14
Accurate spliced alignment of long RNA sequencing reads,"Motivation:Long-read RNA sequencing technologies are establishing themselves as the primary techniques to detect novel isoforms, and many such analyses are dependent on read alignments. However, the error rate and sequencing length of the reads create new challenges for accurately aligning them, particularly around small exons.Results:We present an alignment method uLTRA for long RNA sequencing reads based on a novel two-pass collinear chaining algorithm. We show that uLTRA produces higher accuracy over state-of-the-art aligners with substantially higher accuracy for small exons on simulated and synthetic data. On simulated data, uLTRA achieves an accuracy of about 60% for exons of length 10 nucleotides or smaller and close to 90% accuracy for exons of length between 11 and 20 nucleotides. On biological data where true read location is unknown, we show several examples where uLTRA aligns to known and novel isoforms containing small exons that are not detected with other aligners. While uLTRA obtains its accuracy using annotations, it can also be used as a wrapper around minimap2 to align reads outside annotated regions.Availabilityand implementation:uLTRA is available at https://github.com/ksahlin/ultra.Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",34302453,PMC8665758,10.1093/bioinformatics/btab540,15
Long-Read Whole-Genome Sequencing Using a Nanopore Sequencer and Detection of Structural Variants in Cancer Genomes,"Long-read sequencing technologies enable us to precisely identify structural variants (SVs), which would be occasionally associated with various types of diseases, including cancers. In this section, we introduce experimental and computational procedures for conducting long-read whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of cancer genomes from fresh frozen tissues/cells. We also demonstrate the analysis of SVs in cancer genomes using long-read WGS data from lung cancer cell lines by several representative computational tools, such as cuteSV and Sniffles2, as examples.",36781729,,10.1007/978-1-0716-2996-3_13,1
Assessing the utility of long-read nanopore sequencing for rapid and efficient characterization of mobile element insertions,"Short-read next generation sequencing (NGS) has become the predominant first-line technique used to diagnose patients with rare genetic conditions. Inherent limitations of short-read technology, notably for the detection and characterization of complex insertion-containing variants, are offset by the ability to concurrently screen many disease genes. ""Third-generation"" long-read sequencers are increasingly being deployed as an orthogonal adjunct technology, but their full potential for molecular genetic diagnosis has yet to be exploited. Here, we describe three diagnostic cases in which pathogenic mobile element insertions were refractory to characterization by short-read sequencing. To validate the accuracy of the long-read technology, we first used Sanger sequencing to confirm the integration sites and derive curated benchmark sequences of the variant-containing alleles. Long-read nanopore sequencing was then performed on locus-specific amplicons. Pairwise comparison between these data and the previously determined benchmark alleles revealed 100% identity of the variant-containing sequences. We demonstrate a number of technical advantages over existing wet-laboratory approaches, including in silico size selection of a mixed pool of amplification products, and the relative ease with which an automated informatics workflow can be established. Our findings add to a growing body of literature describing the diagnostic utility of long-read sequencing.",32989232,,10.1038/s41374-020-00489-y,8
Identification and quantification of small exon-containing isoforms in long-read RNA sequencing data,"Small exons are pervasive in transcriptomes across organisms, and their quantification in RNA isoforms is crucial for understanding gene functions. Although long-read RNA-seq based on Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) offers the advantage of covering transcripts in full length, its lower base accuracy poses challenges for identifying individual exons, particularly microexons (≤ 30 nucleotides). Here, we systematically assess small exons quantification in synthetic and human ONT RNA-seq datasets. We demonstrate that reads containing small exons are often not properly aligned, affecting the quantification of relevant transcripts. Thus, we develop a local-realignment method for misaligned exons (MisER), which remaps reads with misaligned exons to the transcript references. Using synthetic and simulated datasets, we demonstrate the high sensitivity and specificity of MisER for the quantification of transcripts containing small exons. Moreover, MisER enabled us to identify small exons with a higher percent spliced-in index (PSI) in neural, particularly neural-regulated microexons, when comparing 14 neural to 16 non-neural tissues in humans. Our work introduces an improved quantification method for long-read RNA-seq and especially facilitates studies using ONT long-reads to elucidate the regulation of genes involving small exons.",37843096,PMC10639058,10.1093/nar/gkad810,2
Completion of draft bacterial genomes by long-read sequencing of synthetic genomic pools,"Background:Illumina technology currently dominates bacterial genomics due to its high read accuracy and low sequencing cost. However, the incompleteness of draft genomes generated by Illumina reads limits their application in comprehensive genomics analyses. Alternatively, hybrid assembly using both Illumina short reads and long reads generated by single molecule sequencing technologies can enable assembly of complete bacterial genomes, yet the high per-genome cost of long-read sequencing limits the widespread use of this approach in bacterial genomics. Here we developed a protocol for hybrid assembly of complete bacterial genomes using miniaturized multiplexed Illumina sequencing and non-barcoded PacBio sequencing of a synthetic genomic pool (SGP), thus significantly decreasing the overall per-genome cost of sequencing.Results:We evaluated the performance of SGP hybrid assembly on the genomes of 20 bacterial isolates with different genome sizes, a wide range of GC contents, and varying levels of phylogenetic relatedness. By improving the contiguity of Illumina assemblies, SGP hybrid assembly generated 17 complete and 3 nearly complete bacterial genomes. Increased contiguity of SGP hybrid assemblies resulted in considerable improvement in gene prediction and annotation. In addition, SGP hybrid assembly was able to resolve repeat elements and identify intragenomic heterogeneities, e.g. different copies of 16S rRNA genes, that would otherwise go undetected by short-read-only assembly. Comprehensive comparison of SGP hybrid assemblies with those generated using multiplexed PacBio long reads (long-read-only assembly) also revealed the relative advantage of SGP hybrid assembly in terms of assembly quality. In particular, we observed that SGP hybrid assemblies were completely devoid of both small (i.e. single base substitutions) and large assembly errors. Finally, we show the ability of SGP hybrid assembly to differentiate genomes of closely related bacterial isolates, suggesting its potential application in comparative genomics and pangenome analysis.Conclusion:Our results indicate the superiority of SGP hybrid assembly over both short-read and long-read assemblies with respect to completeness, contiguity, accuracy, and recovery of small replicons. By lowering the per-genome cost of sequencing, our parallel sequencing and hybrid assembly pipeline could serve as a cost effective and high throughput approach for completing high-quality bacterial genomes.",32727443,PMC7392658,10.1186/s12864-020-06910-6,6
TRiCoLOR: tandem repeat profiling using whole-genome long-read sequencing data,"Background:Tandem repeat sequences are widespread in the human genome, and their expansions cause multiple repeat-mediated disorders. Genome-wide discovery approaches are needed to fully elucidate their roles in health and disease, but resolving tandem repeat variation accurately remains a challenging task. While traditional mapping-based approaches using short-read data have severe limitations in the size and type of tandem repeats they can resolve, recent third-generation sequencing technologies exhibit substantially higher sequencing error rates, which complicates repeat resolution.Results:We developed TRiCoLOR, a freely available tool for tandem repeat profiling using error-prone long reads from third-generation sequencing technologies. The method can identify repetitive regions in sequencing data without a prior knowledge of their motifs or locations and resolve repeat multiplicity and period size in a haplotype-specific manner. The tool includes methods to interactively visualize the identified repeats and to trace their Mendelian consistency in pedigrees.Conclusions:TRiCoLOR demonstrates excellent performance and improved sensitivity and specificity compared with alternative tools on synthetic data. For real human whole-genome sequencing data, TRiCoLOR achieves high validation rates, suggesting its suitability to identify tandem repeat variation in personal genomes.",33034633,PMC7539535,10.1093/gigascience/giaa101,11
Multiplexed Non-barcoded Long-Read Sequencing and Assembling Genomes of Bacillus Strains in Error-Free Simulations,"The generation of genomic data from microorganisms has revolutionized our abilities to understand their biology, but it is still challenging to obtain complete genome sequences of microbes in an automated high-throughput and cost-effective manner. While the advent of second-generation sequencing technologies provided significantly higher throughput, their shorter lengths and more pronounced sequence-context bias led to a shift towards resequencing applications. Recently, single molecule real-time (SMRT) DNA sequencing has been used to generate sequencing reads that are much longer than other sequencing platforms, facilitating de novo genome assembly and genome finishing. Here we introduced a novel multiplex strategy to make full use of the capacity and characteristics of SMRT sequencing in microbe genome assembly. We used error-free simulations to evaluate the practicability of assembling SMRT genomic sequencing data from multiple microbes into finished genomes once at a time. Then we compared the influence of two key factors, including sequencing coverage and read length, on multiplex assembling. Our results showed that long-read genomic sequencing inherently provided the ability to assemble genomic sequencing data from multiple microbes into finished genomes due to its long length. This approach might be helpful for the various groups of microbial genome projects or metagenomics research.",31722044,,10.1007/s00284-019-01808-3,0
Evaluating long-read de novo assembly tools for eukaryotic genomes: insights and considerations,"Background:Assembly algorithm choice should be a deliberate, well-justified decision when researchers create genome assemblies for eukaryotic organisms from third-generation sequencing technologies. While third-generation sequencing by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) and Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) has overcome the disadvantages of short read lengths specific to next-generation sequencing (NGS), third-generation sequencers are known to produce more error-prone reads, thereby generating a new set of challenges for assembly algorithms and pipelines. However, the introduction of HiFi reads, which offer substantially reduced error rates, has provided a promising solution for more accurate assembly outcomes. Since the introduction of third-generation sequencing technologies, many tools have been developed that aim to take advantage of the longer reads, and researchers need to choose the correct assembler for their projects.Results:We benchmarked state-of-the-art long-read de novo assemblers to help readers make a balanced choice for the assembly of eukaryotes. To this end, we used 12 real and 64 simulated datasets from different eukaryotic genomes, with different read length distributions, imitating PacBio continuous long-read (CLR), PacBio high-fidelity (HiFi), and ONT sequencing to evaluate the assemblers. We include 5 commonly used long-read assemblers in our benchmark: Canu, Flye, Miniasm, Raven, and wtdbg2 for ONT and PacBio CLR reads. For PacBio HiFi reads , we include 5 state-of-the-art HiFi assemblers: HiCanu, Flye, Hifiasm, LJA, and MBG. Evaluation categories address the following metrics: reference-based metrics, assembly statistics, misassembly count, BUSCO completeness, runtime, and RAM usage. Additionally, we investigated the effect of increased read length on the quality of the assemblies and report that read length can, but does not always, positively impact assembly quality.Conclusions:Our benchmark concludes that there is no assembler that performs the best in all the evaluation categories. However, our results show that overall Flye is the best-performing assembler for PacBio CLR and ONT reads, both on real and simulated data. Meanwhile, best-performing PacBio HiFi assemblers are Hifiasm and LJA. Next, the benchmarking using longer reads shows that the increased read length improves assembly quality, but the extent to which that can be achieved depends on the size and complexity of the reference genome.",38000912,PMC10673639,10.1093/gigascience/giad100,0
Targeted transcriptome analysis using synthetic long read sequencing uncovers isoform reprograming in the progression of colon cancer,"The characterization of human gene expression is limited by short read lengths, high error rates and large input requirements. Here, we used a synthetic long read (SLR) sequencing approach, LoopSeq, to generate accurate sequencing reads that span full length transcripts using standard short read data. LoopSeq identified isoforms from control samples with 99.4% accuracy and a 0.01% per-base error rate, exceeding the accuracy reported for other long-read technologies. Applied to targeted transcriptome sequencing from colon cancers and their metastatic counterparts, LoopSeq revealed large scale isoform redistributions from benign colon mucosa to primary colon cancer and metastatic cancer and identified several previously unknown fusion isoforms. Strikingly, single nucleotide variants (SNVs) occurred dominantly in specific isoforms and some SNVs underwent isoform switching in cancer progression. The ability to use short reads to generate accurate long-read data as the raw unit of information holds promise as a widely accessible approach in transcriptome sequencing.",33907296,PMC8079361,10.1038/s42003-021-02024-1,9
Vulcan: Improved long-read mapping and structural variant calling via dual-mode alignment,"Background:Long-read sequencing has enabled unprecedented surveys of structural variation across the entire human genome. To maximize the potential of long-read sequencing in this context, novel mapping methods have emerged that have primarily focused on either speed or accuracy. Various heuristics and scoring schemas have been implemented in widely used read mappers (minimap2 and NGMLR) to optimize for speed or accuracy, which have variable performance across different genomic regions and for specific structural variants. Our hypothesis is that constraining read mapping to the use of a single gap penalty across distinct mutational hot spots reduces read alignment accuracy and impedes structural variant detection.Findings:We tested our hypothesis by implementing a read-mapping pipeline called Vulcan that uses two distinct gap penalty modes, which we refer to as dual-mode alignment. The high-level idea is that Vulcan leverages the computed normalized edit distance of the mapped reads via minimap2 to identify poorly aligned reads and realigns them using the more accurate yet computationally more expensive long-read mapper (NGMLR). In support of our hypothesis, we show that Vulcan improves the alignments for Oxford Nanopore Technology long reads for both simulated and real datasets. These improvements, in turn, lead to improved accuracy for structural variant calling performance on human genome datasets compared to either of the read-mapping methods alone.Conclusions:Vulcan is the first long-read mapping framework that combines two distinct gap penalty modes for improved structural variant recall and precision. Vulcan is open-source and available under the MIT License at https://gitlab.com/treangenlab/vulcan.",34561697,PMC8463296,10.1093/gigascience/giab063,8
DNA Methylation Profiling Using Long-Read Single Molecule Real-Time Bisulfite Sequencing (SMRT-BS),"For the past two decades, bisulfite sequencing has been a widely used method for quantitative CpG methylation detection of genomic DNA. Coupled with PCR amplicon cloning, bisulfite Sanger sequencing allows for allele-specific CpG methylation assessment; however, its time-consuming protocol and inability to multiplex has recently been overcome by next-generation bisulfite sequencing techniques. Although high-throughput sequencing platforms have enabled greater accuracy in CpG methylation quantitation as a result of increased bisulfite sequencing depth, most common sequencing platforms generate reads that are similar in length to the typical bisulfite PCR size range (~300-500 bp). Using the Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) sequencing platform, we developed single molecule real-time bisulfite sequencing (SMRT-BS), which is an accurate targeted CpG methylation analysis method capable of a high degree of multiplexing and long read lengths. SMRT-BS is reproducible and was found to be concordant with other lower throughput quantitative CpG methylation methods. Moreover, the ability to sequence up to ~1.5-2.0 kb amplicons, when coupled with an optimized bisulfite-conversion protocol, allows for more thorough assessment of CpG islands and increases the capacity for studying the relationship between single nucleotide variants and allele-specific CpG methylation.",28986786,,10.1007/978-1-4939-7231-9_8,8
Comparison and benchmark of structural variants detected from long read and long-read assembly,"Structural variant (SV) detection is essential for genomic studies, and long-read sequencing technologies have advanced our capacity to detect SVs directly from read or de novo assembly, also known as read-based and assembly-based strategy. However, to date, no independent studies have compared and benchmarked the two strategies. Here, on the basis of SVs detected by 20 read-based and eight assembly-based detection pipelines from six datasets of HG002 genome, we investigated the factors that influence the two strategies and assessed their performance with well-curated SVs. We found that up to 80% of the SVs could be detected by both strategies among different long-read datasets, whereas variant type, size, and breakpoint detected by read-based strategy were greatly affected by aligners. For the high-confident insertions and deletions at non-tandem repeat regions, a remarkable subset of them (82% in assembly-based calls and 93% in read-based calls), accounting for around 4000 SVs, could be captured by both reads and assemblies. However, discordance between two strategies was largely caused by complex SVs and inversions, which resulted from inconsistent alignment of reads and assemblies at these loci. Finally, benchmarking with SVs at medically relevant genes, the recall of read-based strategy reached 77% on 5X coverage data, whereas assembly-based strategy required 20X coverage data to achieve similar performance. Therefore, integrating SVs from read and assembly is suggested for general-purpose detection because of inconsistently detected complex SVs and inversions, whereas assembly-based strategy is optional for applications with limited resources.",37200087,,10.1093/bib/bbad188,0
Ultra-accurate microbial amplicon sequencing with synthetic long reads,"Background:Out of the many pathogenic bacterial species that are known, only a fraction are readily identifiable directly from a complex microbial community using standard next generation DNA sequencing. Long-read sequencing offers the potential to identify a wider range of species and to differentiate between strains within a species, but attaining sufficient accuracy in complex metagenomes remains a challenge.Methods:Here, we describe and analytically validate LoopSeq, a commercially available synthetic long-read (SLR) sequencing technology that generates highly accurate long reads from standard short reads.Results:LoopSeq reads are sufficiently long and accurate to identify microbial genes and species directly from complex samples. LoopSeq perfectly recovered the full diversity of 16S rRNA genes from known strains in a synthetic microbial community. Full-length LoopSeq reads had a per-base error rate of 0.005%, which exceeds the accuracy reported for other long-read sequencing technologies. 18S-ITS and genomic sequencing of fungal and bacterial isolates confirmed that LoopSeq sequencing maintains that accuracy for reads up to 6 kb in length. LoopSeq full-length 16S rRNA reads could accurately classify organisms down to the species level in rinsate from retail meat samples, and could differentiate strains within species identified by the CDC as potential foodborne pathogens.Conclusions:The order-of-magnitude improvement in length and accuracy over standard Illumina amplicon sequencing achieved with LoopSeq enables accurate species-level and strain identification from complex- to low-biomass microbiome samples. The ability to generate accurate and long microbiome sequencing reads using standard short read sequencers will accelerate the building of quality microbial sequence databases and removes a significant hurdle on the path to precision microbial genomics.

Hybrid De Novo Genome Assembly for the Generation of Complete Genomes of Urinary Bacteria using Short- and Long-read Sequencing Technologies,"Complete genome sequences provide valuable data for the understanding of genetic diversity and unique colonization factors of urinary microbes. These data may include mobile genetic elements, such as plasmids and extrachromosomal phage, that contribute to the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance and further complicate treatment of urinary tract infection (UTI). In addition to providing fine resolution of genome structure, complete, closed genomes allow for the detailed comparative genomics and evolutionary analyses. The generation of complete genomes de novo has long been a challenging task due to limitations of available sequencing technology. Paired-end Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) produces high quality short reads often resulting in accurate but fragmented genome assemblies. On the contrary, Nanopore sequencing provides long reads of lower quality normally leading to error-prone complete assemblies. Such errors may hamper genome-wide association studies or provide misleading variant analysis results. Therefore, hybrid approaches combining both short and long reads have emerged as reliable methods to achieve highly accurate closed bacterial genomes. Reported herein is a comprehensive method for the culture of diverse urinary bacteria, species identification by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, extraction of genomic DNA (gDNA), and generation of short and long reads by NGS and Nanopore platforms, respectively. Additionally, this method describes a bioinformatic pipeline of quality control, assembly, and gene prediction algorithms for the generation of annotated complete genome sequences. Combination of bioinformatic tools enables the selection of high quality read data for hybrid genome assembly and downstream analysis. The streamlined approach for the hybrid de novo genome assembly described in this protocol may be adapted for the use in any culturable bacteria.",34487123,,10.3791/62872,8
Exploration of whole genome amplification generated chimeric sequences in long-read sequencing data,"Motivation:Multiple displacement amplification (MDA) has become the most commonly used method of whole genome amplification, generating a vast amount of DNA with higher molecular weight and greater genome coverage. Coupling with long-read sequencing, it is possible to sequence the amplicons of over 20 kb in length. However, the formation of chimeric sequences (chimeras, expressed as structural errors in sequencing data) in MDA seriously interferes with the bioinformatics analysis but its influence on long-read sequencing data is unknown.Results:We sequenced the phi29 DNA polymerase-mediated MDA amplicons on the PacBio platform and analyzed chimeras within the generated data. The 3rd-ChimeraMiner has been constructed as a pipeline for recognizing and restoring chimeras into the original structures in long-read sequencing data, improving the efficiency of using TGS data. Five long-read datasets and one high-fidelity long-read dataset with various amplification folds were analyzed. The result reveals that the mis-priming events in amplification are more frequently occurring than widely perceived, and the propor tion gradually accumulates from 42% to over 78% as the amplification continues. In total, 99.92% of recognized chimeric sequences were demonstrated to be artifacts, whose structures were wrongly formed in MDA instead of existing in original genomes. By restoring chimeras to their original structures, the vast majority of supplementary alignments that introduce false-positive structural variants are recycled, removing 97% of inversions on average and contributing to the analysis of structural variation in MDA-amplified samples. The impact of chimeras in long-read sequencing data analysis should be emphasized, and the 3rd-ChimeraMiner can help to quantify and reduce the influence of chimeras.Availability and implementation:The 3rd-ChimeraMiner is available on GitHub, https://github.com/dulunar/3rdChimeraMiner.",37529913,,10.1093/bib/bbad275,2
Generation and application of pseudo-long reads for metagenome assembly,"Background:Metagenomic assembly using high-throughput sequencing data is a powerful method to construct microbial genomes in environmental samples without cultivation. However, metagenomic assembly, especially when only short reads are available, is a complex and challenging task because mixed genomes of multiple microorganisms constitute the metagenome. Although long read sequencing technologies have been developed and have begun to be used for metagenomic assembly, many metagenomic studies have been performed based on short reads because the generation of long reads requires higher sequencing cost than short reads.Results:In this study, we present a new method called PLR-GEN. It creates pseudo-long reads from metagenomic short reads based on given reference genome sequences by considering small sequence variations existing in individual genomes of the same or different species. When applied to a mock community data set in the Human Microbiome Project, PLR-GEN dramatically extended short reads in length of 101 bp to pseudo-long reads with N50 of 33 Kbp and 0.4% error rate. The use of these pseudo-long reads generated by PLR-GEN resulted in an obvious improvement of metagenomic assembly in terms of the number of sequences, assembly contiguity, and prediction of species and genes.Conclusions:PLR-GEN can be used to generate artificial long read sequences without spending extra sequencing cost, thus aiding various studies using metagenomes.",35579554,PMC9112764,10.1093/gigascience/giac044,3
Is it the time to integrate novel sequencing technologies into clinical practice?,"Purpose of review:The aim of this study was to provide insight into how novel next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques are set to revolutionize clinical practice.Recent findings:Advances in sequencing technologies have focused on improved capture of mutations and reads and cellular resolution. Both short and long read DNA sequencing technology are being refined and combined in novel ways with other multiomic approaches to gain unprecedented biological insight into disease. Single-cell (sc)DNA-seq and integrated scDNA-seq with immunophenotyping provide granular information on disease composition such as clonal hierarchy, co-mutation status, zygosity, clonal diversity and genotype phenotype correlations. These and other techniques can identify rare cell populations providing the opportunity for increased sensitivity in measurable residual disease monitoring and precise characterization of residual clones permitting distinction of leukemic from pre/nonmalignant clones.Summary:Increasing genetics-based mechanistic insights and classification of myeloid diseases along with a decrease in the cost of high-throughput NGS mean novel sequencing technologies are closer to being a reality in standard clinical practice. These technologies are poised to improve diagnostics, our ability to monitor treatment response and minimal residual disease and allow the study of premalignant conditions such as clonal haematopoiesis.",36602939,,10.1097/MOH.0000000000000754,0
Structurally divergent and recurrently mutated regions of primate genomes,"We sequenced and assembled using multiple long-read sequencing technologies the genomes of chimpanzee, bonobo, gorilla, orangutan, gibbon, macaque, owl monkey, and marmoset. We identified 1,338,997 lineage-specific fixed structural variants (SVs) disrupting 1,561 protein-coding genes and 136,932 regulatory elements, including the most complete set of human-specific fixed differences. We estimate that 819.47 Mbp or ∼27% of the genome has been affected by SVs across primate evolution. We identify 1,607 structurally divergent regions wherein recurrent structural variation contributes to creating SV hotspots where genes are recurrently lost (e.g., CARD, C4, and OLAH gene families) and additional lineage-specific genes are generated (e.g., CKAP2, VPS36, ACBD7, and NEK5 paralogs), becoming targets of rapid chromosomal diversification and positive selection (e.g., RGPD gene family). High-fidelity long-read sequencing has made these dynamic regions of the genome accessible for sequence-level analyses within and between primate species.",38428424,,10.1016/j.cell.2024.01.052,2
Nanopore Long Read DNA Sequencing of Protozoan Parasites: Hybrid Genome Assembly of Trypanosoma cruzi,"Due to highly repetitive genome sequences, short-read-based Trypanosoma cruzi genomes are extremely fragmented. Contiguous trypanosomatid genomes assemblies have resulted in the advent of third-generation sequencing technologies. Long reads span several to hundreds of kbps allowing to correct assemblies of repeated and low complexity DNA regions. However, these techniques present higher error rates. Hybrid assembly strategies that combine error-prone long reads with much more accurate Illumina short reads represent a very convenient approach for enhancing genome completeness. Here, we describe how to perform a hybrid assembly for genomic analysis of protozoan pathogens using Illumina and Oxford Nanopore sequencing.",34313980,,10.1007/978-1-0716-1681-9_1,3
Short and long-read genome sequencing methodologies for somatic variant detection; genomic analysis of a patient with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma,"Recent advances in throughput and accuracy mean that the Oxford Nanopore Technologies PromethION platform is a now a viable solution for genome sequencing. Much of the validation of bioinformatic tools for this long-read data has focussed on calling germline variants (including structural variants). Somatic variants are outnumbered many-fold by germline variants and their detection is further complicated by the effects of tumour purity/subclonality. Here, we evaluate the extent to which Nanopore sequencing enables detection and analysis of somatic variation. We do this through sequencing tumour and germline genomes for a patient with diffuse B-cell lymphoma and comparing results with 150 bp short-read sequencing of the same samples. Calling germline single nucleotide variants (SNVs) from specific chromosomes of the long-read data achieved good specificity and sensitivity. However, results of somatic SNV calling highlight the need for the development of specialised joint calling algorithms. We find the comparative genome-wide performance of different tools varies significantly between structural variant types, and suggest long reads are especially advantageous for calling large somatic deletions and duplications. Finally, we highlight the utility of long reads for phasing clinically relevant variants, confirming that a somatic 1.6 Mb deletion and a p.(Arg249Met) mutation involving TP53 are oriented in trans.",33742045,PMC7979876,10.1038/s41598-021-85354-8,10
JTK: targeted diploid genome assembler,"Motivation:Diploid assembly, or determining sequences of homologous chromosomes separately, is essential to elucidate genetic differences between haplotypes. One approach is to call and phase single nucleotide variants (SNVs) on a reference sequence. However, this approach becomes unstable on large segmental duplications (SDs) or structural variations (SVs) because the alignments of reads deriving from these regions tend to be unreliable. Another approach is to use highly accurate PacBio HiFi reads to output diploid assembly directly. Nonetheless, HiFi reads cannot phase homozygous regions longer than their length and require oxford nanopore technology (ONT) reads or Hi-C to produce a fully phased assembly. Is a single long-read sequencing technology sufficient to create an accurate diploid assembly?Results:Here, we present JTK, a megabase-scale diploid genome assembler. It first randomly samples kilobase-scale sequences (called 'chunks') from the long reads, phases variants found on them, and produces two haplotypes. The novel idea of JTK is to utilize chunks to capture SNVs and SVs simultaneously. From 60-fold ONT reads on the HG002 and a Japanese sample, it fully assembled two haplotypes with approximately 99.9% accuracy on the histocompatibility complex (MHC) and the leukocyte receptor complex (LRC) regions, which was impossible by the reference-based approach. In addition, in the LRC region on a Japanese sample, JTK output an assembly of better contiguity than those built from high-coverage HiFi+Hi-C. In the coming age of pan-genomics, JTK would complement the reference-based phasing method to assemble the difficult-to-assemble but medically important regions.Availability and implementation:JTK is available at https://github.com/ban-m/jtk, and the datasets are available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7790310 or JGAS000580 in DDBJ.",37354526,PMC10320103,10.1093/bioinformatics/btad398,0
A comparison of methods for detecting DNA methylation from long-read sequencing of human genomes,"Background:Long-read sequencing can enable the detection of base modifications, such as CpG methylation, in single molecules of DNA. The most commonly used methods for long-read sequencing are nanopore developed by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) and single molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing developed by Pacific Bioscience (PacBio). In this study, we systematically compare the performance of CpG methylation detection from long-read sequencing.Results:We demonstrate that CpG methylation detection from 7179 nanopore-sequenced DNA samples is highly accurate and consistent with 132 oxidative bisulfite-sequenced (oxBS) samples, isolated from the same blood draws. We introduce quality filters for CpGs that further enhance the accuracy of CpG methylation detection from nanopore-sequenced DNA, while removing at most 30% of CpGs. We evaluate the per-site performance of CpG methylation detection across different genomic features and CpG methylation rates and demonstrate how the latest R10.4 flowcell chemistry and base-calling algorithms improve methylation detection from nanopore sequencing. Additionally, we show how the methylation detection of 50 SMRT-sequenced genomes compares to nanopore sequencing and oxBS.Conclusions:This study provides the first systematic comparison of CpG methylation detection tools for long-read sequencing methods. We compare two commonly used computational methods for the detection of CpG methylation in a large number of nanopore genomes, including samples sequenced using the latest R10.4 nanopore flowcell chemistry and 50 SMRT sequenced samples. We provide insights into the strengths and limitations of each sequencing method as well as recommendations for standardization and evaluation of tools designed for genome-scale modified base detection using long-read sequencing.",38468278,PMC10929077,10.1186/s13059-024-03207-9,1
Emerging technologies for prenatal diagnosis: The application of whole genome and RNA sequencing,"DNA sequencing technologies for clinical genetic testing have been rapidly evolving in recent years, and steadily become more important within the field of prenatal diagnostics. This review aims to give an overview of recent developments and to describe how they have the potential to fill the gaps of the currently clinically implemented methods for prenatal diagnosis of various genetic disorders. It has been shown for postnatal testing that whole genome sequencing provides a set of added benefits compared to exome sequencing, and it is to be expected that this will be the case for prenatal testing as well. RNA-sequencing, already used postnatally, can provide valuable complementary data to DNA-based testing, and aid in variant interpretation. While not ready for clinical implementation, emerging technologies such as long-read and Hi-C sequencing analyses might add to the toolbox for interpreting the expanding genetic data sets generated by genome-wide sequencing. Lastly, we also discuss some more practical implications of introducing these emerging technologies, which generate larger and larger genomic data sets, in the prenatal field.",35416301,PMC10014115,10.1002/pd.6146,3
Long-read sequencing and de novo assembly of a Chinese genome,"Short-read sequencing has enabled the de novo assembly of several individual human genomes, but with inherent limitations in characterizing repeat elements. Here we sequence a Chinese individual HX1 by single-molecule real-time (SMRT) long-read sequencing, construct a physical map by NanoChannel arrays and generate a de novo assembly of 2.93 Gb (contig N50: 8.3 Mb, scaffold N50: 22.0 Mb, including 39.3 Mb N-bases), together with 206 Mb of alternative haplotypes. The assembly fully or partially fills 274 (28.4%) N-gaps in the reference genome GRCh38. Comparison to GRCh38 reveals 12.8 Mb of HX1-specific sequences, including 4.1 Mb that are not present in previously reported Asian genomes. Furthermore, long-read sequencing of the transcriptome reveals novel spliced genes that are not annotated in GENCODE and are missed by short-read RNA-Seq. Our results imply that improved characterization of genome functional variation may require the use of a range of genomic technologies on diverse human populations.",27356984,PMC4931320,10.1038/ncomms12065,145
A Comprehensive Guide to Potato Transcriptome Assembly,"We have witnessed a rapid advancement in high-throughput genome sequencing and the maturation of long-read technologies. However, an accurate assembly of polyploid potato genomes still remains challenging. Sequencing the double-monoploid genome of Solanum tuberosum Group Phureja (Xu et al., Nature 475:189-195, 2011) has enabled functional studies of polyploid potato cultivars using RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) technologies, although with the limitation of not covering cultivar-specific gene expression. The accumulated RNA-Seq datasets from these cultivars can be leveraged to assemble tetraploid potato transcriptomes that enable the analysis of genes that are not limited to reference genome annotations. To increase transcriptomes' quality, short-read assemblies are nowadays complemented with full-length transcriptome sequencing using Pacific Biosciences or Oxford Nanopore platforms. In this chapter we give a detailed guide on a pipeline for de novo transcriptome assembly of polyploid potato genotypes and their integration into a pan-transcriptome.",34448160,,10.1007/978-1-0716-1609-3_8,0
"Interrogating the ""unsequenceable"" genomic trinucleotide repeat disorders by long-read sequencing","Microsatellite expansion, such as trinucleotide repeat expansion (TRE), is known to cause a number of genetic diseases. Sanger sequencing and next-generation short-read sequencing are unable to interrogate TRE reliably. We developed a novel algorithm called RepeatHMM to estimate repeat counts from long-read sequencing data. Evaluation on simulation data, real amplicon sequencing data on two repeat expansion disorders, and whole-genome sequencing data generated by PacBio and Oxford Nanopore technologies showed superior performance over competing approaches. We concluded that long-read sequencing coupled with RepeatHMM can estimate repeat counts on microsatellites and can interrogate the ""unsequenceable"" genomic trinucleotide repeat disorders.",28720120,PMC5514472,10.1186/s13073-017-0456-7,39
Gene Fusion Detection and Characterization in Long-Read Cancer Transcriptome Sequencing Data with FusionSeeker,"Gene fusions are prevalent in a wide array of cancer types with different frequencies. Long-read transcriptome sequencing technologies, such as PacBio, Iso-Seq, and Nanopore direct RNA sequencing, provide full-length transcript sequencing reads, which could facilitate detection of gene fusions. In this work, we developed a method, FusionSeeker, to comprehensively characterize gene fusions in long-read cancer transcriptome data and reconstruct accurate fused transcripts from raw reads. FusionSeeker identified gene fusions in both exonic and intronic regions, allowing comprehensive characterization of gene fusions in cancer transcriptomes. Fused transcript sequences were reconstructed with FusionSeeker by correcting sequencing errors in the raw reads through partial order alignment algorithm. Using these accurate transcript sequences, FusionSeeker refined gene fusion breakpoint positions and predicted breakpoints at single bp resolution. Overall, FusionSeeker will enable users to discover gene fusions accurately using long-read data, which can facilitate downstream functional analysis as well as improved cancer diagnosis and treatment.Significance:FusionSeeker is a new method to discover gene fusions and reconstruct fused transcript sequences in long-read cancer transcriptome sequencing data to help identify novel gene fusions important for tumorigenesis and progression.",36318117,PMC9812290,10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-22-1628,5
Dysgu: efficient structural variant calling using short or long reads,"Structural variation (SV) plays a fundamental role in genome evolution and can underlie inherited or acquired diseases such as cancer. Long-read sequencing technologies have led to improvements in the characterization of structural variants (SVs), although paired-end sequencing offers better scalability. Here, we present dysgu, which calls SVs or indels using paired-end or long reads. Dysgu detects signals from alignment gaps, discordant and supplementary mappings, and generates consensus contigs, before classifying events using machine learning. Additional SVs are identified by remapping of anomalous sequences. Dysgu outperforms existing state-of-the-art tools using paired-end or long-reads, offering high sensitivity and precision whilst being among the fastest tools to run. We find that combining low coverage paired-end and long-reads is competitive in terms of performance with long-reads at higher coverage values.",35100420,PMC9122538,10.1093/nar/gkac039,11
"One chromosome, one contig: complete microbial genomes from long-read sequencing and assembly","Like a jigsaw puzzle with large pieces, a genome sequenced with long reads is easier to assemble. However, recent sequencing technologies have favored lowering per-base cost at the expense of read length. This has dramatically reduced sequencing cost, but resulted in fragmented assemblies, which negatively affect downstream analyses and hinder the creation of finished (gapless, high-quality) genomes. In contrast, emerging long-read sequencing technologies can now produce reads tens of kilobases in length, enabling the automated finishing of microbial genomes for under $1000. This promises to improve the quality of reference databases and facilitate new studies of chromosomal structure and variation. We present an overview of these new technologies and the methods used to assemble long reads into complete genomes.",25461581,,10.1016/j.mib.2014.11.014,195
PacBio long-read amplicon sequencing enables scalable high-resolution population allele typing of the complex CYP2D6 locus,"The CYP2D6 enzyme is estimated to metabolize 25% of commonly used pharmaceuticals and is of intense pharmacogenetic interest due to the polymorphic nature of the CYP2D6 gene. Accurate allele typing of CYP2D6 has proved challenging due to frequent copy number variants (CNVs) and paralogous pseudogenes. SNP-arrays, qPCR and short-read sequencing have been employed to interrogate CYP2D6, however these technologies are unable to capture longer range information. Long-read sequencing using the PacBio Single Molecule Real Time (SMRT) sequencing platform has yielded promising results for CYP2D6 allele typing. However, previous studies have been limited in scale and have employed nascent data processing pipelines. We present a robust data processing pipeline ""PLASTER"" for accurate allele typing of SMRT sequenced amplicons. We demonstrate the pipeline by typing CYP2D6 alleles in a large cohort of 377 Solomon Islanders. This pharmacogenetic method will improve drug safety and efficacy through screening prior to drug administration.",35217695,PMC8881578,10.1038/s42003-022-03102-8,6
Single-worm long-read sequencing reveals genome diversity in free-living nematodes,"Obtaining sufficient genetic material from a limited biological source is currently the primary operational bottleneck in studies investigating biodiversity and genome evolution. In this study, we employed multiple displacement amplification (MDA) and Smartseq2 to amplify nanograms of genomic DNA and mRNA, respectively, from individual Caenorhabditis elegans. Although reduced genome coverage was observed in repetitive regions, we produced assemblies covering 98% of the reference genome using long-read sequences generated with Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT). Annotation with the sequenced transcriptome coupled with the available assembly revealed that gene predictions were more accurate, complete and contained far fewer false positives than de novo transcriptome assembly approaches. We sampled and sequenced the genomes and transcriptomes of 13 nematodes from early-branching species in Chromadoria, Dorylaimia and Enoplia. The basal Chromadoria and Enoplia species had larger genome sizes, ranging from 136.6 to 738.8 Mb, compared with those in the other clades. Nine mitogenomes were fully assembled, and displayed a complete lack of synteny to other species. Phylogenomic analyses based on the new annotations revealed strong support for Enoplia as sister to the rest of Nematoda. Our result demonstrates the robustness of MDA in combination with ONT, paving the way for the study of genome diversity in the phylum Nematoda and beyond.",37526286,PMC10450198,10.1093/nar/gkad647,2
Long read isoform sequencing reveals hidden transcriptional complexity between cattle subspecies,"The Iso-Seq method of full-length cDNA sequencing is suitable to quantify differentially expressed genes (DEGs), transcripts (DETs) and transcript usage (DTU). However, the higher cost of Iso-Seq relative to RNA-seq has limited the comparison of both methods. Transcript abundance estimated by RNA-seq and deep Iso-Seq data for fetal liver from two cattle subspecies were compared to evaluate concordance. Inter-sample correlation of gene- and transcript-level abundance was higher within technology than between technologies. Identification of DEGs between the cattle subspecies depended on sequencing method with only 44 genes identified by both that included 6 novel genes annotated by Iso-Seq. There was a pronounced difference between Iso-Seq and RNA-seq results at transcript-level wherein Iso-Seq revealed several magnitudes more transcript abundance and usage differences between subspecies. Factors influencing DEG identification included size selection during Iso-Seq library preparation, average transcript abundance, multi-mapping of RNA-seq reads to the reference genome, and overlapping coordinates of genes. Some DEGs called by RNA-seq alone appear to be sequence duplication artifacts. Among the 44 DEGs identified by both technologies some play a role in immune system, thyroid function and cell growth. Iso-Seq revealed hidden transcriptional complexity in DEGs, DETs and DTU genes between cattle subspecies previously missed by RNA-seq.",36915055,PMC10012480,10.1186/s12864-023-09212-9,3
Applying Genome-Resolved Metagenomics to Deconvolute the Halophilic Microbiome,"In the past decades, the study of microbial life through shotgun metagenomic sequencing has rapidly expanded our understanding of environmental, synthetic, and clinical microbial communities. Here, we review how shotgun metagenomics has affected the field of halophilic microbial ecology, including functional potential reconstruction, virus⁻host interactions, pathway selection, strain dispersal, and novel genome discoveries. However, there still remain pitfalls and limitations from conventional metagenomic analysis being applied to halophilic microbial communities. Deconvolution of halophilic metagenomes has been difficult due to the high G + C content of these microbiomes and their high intraspecific diversity, which has made both metagenomic assembly and binning a challenge. Halophiles are also underrepresented in public genome databases, which in turn slows progress. With this in mind, this review proposes experimental and analytical strategies to overcome the challenges specific to the halophilic microbiome, from experimental designs to data acquisition and the computational analysis of metagenomic sequences. Finally, we speculate about the potential applications of other next-generation sequencing technologies in halophilic communities. RNA sequencing, long-read technologies, and chromosome conformation assays, not initially intended for microbiomes, are becoming available in the study of microbial communities. Together with recent analytical advancements, these new methods and technologies have the potential to rapidly advance the field of halophile research.",30875864,PMC6471235,10.3390/genes10030220,11
A high-throughput multiplexing and selection strategy to complete bacterial genomes,"Background:Bacterial whole-genome sequencing based on short-read technologies often results in a draft assembly formed by contiguous sequences. The introduction of long-read sequencing technologies permits those contiguous sequences to be unambiguously bridged into complete genomes. However, the elevated costs associated with long-read sequencing frequently limit the number of bacterial isolates that can be long-read sequenced. Here we evaluated the recently released 96 barcoding kit from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) to generate complete genomes on a high-throughput basis. In addition, we propose an isolate selection strategy that optimizes a representative selection of isolates for long-read sequencing considering as input large-scale bacterial collections.Results:Despite an uneven distribution of long reads per barcode, near-complete chromosomal sequences (assembly contiguity = 0.89) were generated for 96 Escherichia coli isolates with associated short-read sequencing data. The assembly contiguity of the plasmid replicons was even higher (0.98), which indicated the suitability of the multiplexing strategy for studies focused on resolving plasmid sequences. We benchmarked hybrid and ONT-only assemblies and showed that the combination of ONT sequencing data with short-read sequencing data is still highly desirable (i) to perform an unbiased selection of isolates for long-read sequencing, (ii) to achieve an optimal genome accuracy and completeness, and (iii) to include small plasmids underrepresented in the ONT library.Conclusions:The proposed long-read isolate selection ensures the completion of bacterial genomes that span the genome diversity inherent in large collections of bacterial isolates. We show the potential of using this multiplexing approach to close bacterial genomes on a high-throughput basis.",34891160,PMC8673558,10.1093/gigascience/giab079,7
Nanopore Sequencing and Data Analysis for Base-Resolution Genome-Wide 5-Methylcytosine Profiling,"Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) is currently the gold standard for DNA methylation (5-methylcytosine, 5mC) profiling; however, the destructive nature of sodium bisulfite results in DNA fragmentation and subsequent biases in sequencing data. Such issues have led to the development of bisulfite-free methods for 5mC detection. Nanopore sequencing is a long read nondestructive approach that directly analyzes DNA and RNA fragments in real time. Recently, computational tools have been developed that enable base-resolution detection of 5mC from Oxford Nanopore sequencing data. In this chapter, we provide a detailed protocol for preparation, sequencing, read assembly, and analysis of genome-wide 5mC using Nanopore sequencing technologies.",35103963,,10.1007/978-1-0716-2140-0_5,1
Applications of advanced technologies for detecting genomic structural variation,"Chromosomal structural variation (SV) encompasses a heterogenous class of genetic variants that exerts strong influences on human health and disease. Despite their importance, many structural variants (SVs) have remained poorly characterized at even a basic level, a discrepancy predicated upon the technical limitations of prior genomic assays. However, recent advances in genomic technology can identify and localize SVs accurately, opening new questions regarding SV risk factors and their impacts in humans. Here, we first define and classify human SVs and their generative mechanisms, highlighting characteristics leveraged by various SV assays. We next examine the first-ever gapless assembly of the human genome and the technical process of assembling it, which required third-generation sequencing technologies to resolve structurally complex loci. The new portions of that ""telomere-to-telomere"" and subsequent pangenome assemblies highlight aspects of SV biology likely to develop in the near-term. We consider the strengths and limitations of the most promising new SV technologies and when they or longstanding approaches are best suited to meeting salient goals in the study of human SV in population-scale genomics research, clinical, and public health contexts. It is a watershed time in our understanding of human SV when new approaches are expected to fundamentally change genomic applications.",37931775,,10.1016/j.mrrev.2023.108475,1
Illuminating the dark side of the human transcriptome with long read transcript sequencing,"Background:The human transcriptome annotation is regarded as one of the most complete of any eukaryotic species. However, limitations in sequencing technologies have biased the annotation toward multi-exonic protein coding genes. Accurate high-throughput long read transcript sequencing can now provide additional evidence for rare transcripts and genes such as mono-exonic and non-coding genes that were previously either undetectable or impossible to differentiate from sequencing noise.Results:We developed the Transcriptome Annotation by Modular Algorithms (TAMA) software to leverage the power of long read transcript sequencing and address the issues with current data processing pipelines. TAMA achieved high sensitivity and precision for gene and transcript model predictions in both reference guided and unguided approaches in our benchmark tests using simulated Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and Nanopore sequencing data and real PacBio datasets. By analyzing PacBio Sequel II Iso-Seq sequencing data of the Universal Human Reference RNA (UHRR) using TAMA and other commonly used tools, we found that the convention of using alignment identity to measure error correction performance does not reflect actual gain in accuracy of predicted transcript models. In addition, inter-read error correction can cause major changes to read mapping, resulting in potentially over 6 K erroneous gene model predictions in the Iso-Seq based human genome annotation. Using TAMA's genome assembly based error correction and gene feature evidence, we predicted 2566 putative novel non-coding genes and 1557 putative novel protein coding gene models.Conclusions:Long read transcript sequencing data has the power to identify novel genes within the highly annotated human genome. The use of parameter tuning and extensive output information of the TAMA software package allows for in depth exploration of eukaryotic transcriptomes. We have found long read data based evidence for thousands of unannotated genes within the human genome. More development in sequencing library preparation and data processing are required for differentiating sequencing noise from real genes in long read RNA sequencing data.",33126848,PMC7596999,10.1186/s12864-020-07123-7,62
Long-read sequencing reveals a 4.4 kb tandem repeat region in the mitogenome of Echinococcus granulosus (sensu stricto) genotype G1,"Background:Echinococcus tapeworms cause a severe helminthic zoonosis called echinococcosis. The genus comprises various species and genotypes, of which E. granulosus (sensu stricto) represents a significant global public health and socioeconomic burden. Mitochondrial (mt) genomes have provided useful genetic markers to explore the nature and extent of genetic diversity within Echinococcus and have underpinned phylogenetic and population structure analyses of this genus. Our recent work indicated a sequence gap (> 1 kb) in the mt genomes of E. granulosus genotype G1, which could not be determined by PCR-based Sanger sequencing. The aim of the present study was to define the complete mt genome, irrespective of structural complexities, using a long-read sequencing method.Methods:We extracted high molecular weight genomic DNA from protoscoleces from a single cyst of E. granulosus genotype G1 from a sheep from Australia using a conventional method and sequenced it using PacBio Sequel (long-read) technology, complemented by BGISEQ-500 short-read sequencing. Sequence data obtained were assembled using a recently-developed workflow.Results:We assembled a complete mt genome sequence of 17,675 bp, which is > 4 kb larger than the complete mt genomes known for E. granulosus genotype G1. This assembly includes a previously-elusive tandem repeat region, which is 4417 bp long and consists of ten near-identical 441-445 bp repeat units, each harbouring a 184 bp non-coding region and adjacent regions. We also identified a short non-coding region of 183 bp, which includes an inverted repeat.Conclusions:We report what we consider to be the first complete mt genome of E. granulosus genotype G1 and characterise all repeat regions in this genome. The numbers, sizes, sequences and functions of tandem repeat regions remain to be studied in different isolates of genotype G1 and in other genotypes and species. The discovery of such 'new' repeat elements in the mt genome of genotype G1 by PacBio sequencing raises a question about the completeness of some published genomes of taeniid cestodes assembled from conventional or short-read sequence datasets. This study shows that long-read sequencing readily overcomes the challenges of assembling repeat elements to achieve improved genomes.",31097022,PMC6521400,10.1186/s13071-019-3492-x,24
Exploring the hepatitis C virus genome using single molecule real-time sequencing,"Single molecular real-time (SMRT) sequencing, also called third-generation sequencing, is a novel sequencing technique capable of generating extremely long contiguous sequence reads. While conventional short-read sequencing cannot evaluate the linkage of nucleotide substitutions distant from one another, SMRT sequencing can directly demonstrate linkage of nucleotide changes over a span of more than 20 kbp, and thus can be applied to directly examine the haplotypes of viruses or bacteria whose genome structures are changing in real time. In addition, an error correction method (circular consensus sequencing) has been established and repeated sequencing of a single-molecule DNA template can result in extremely high accuracy. The advantages of long read sequencing enable accurate determination of the haplotypes of individual viral clones. SMRT sequencing has been applied in various studies of viral genomes including determination of the full-length contiguous genome sequence of hepatitis C virus (HCV), targeted deep sequencing of the HCV NS5A gene, and assessment of heterogeneity among viral populations. Recently, the emergence of multi-drug resistant HCV viruses has become a significant clinical issue and has been also demonstrated using SMRT sequencing. In this review, we introduce the novel third-generation PacBio RSII/Sequel systems, compare them with conventional next-generation sequencers, and summarize previous studies in which SMRT sequencing technology has been applied for HCV genome analysis. We also refer to another long-read sequencing platform, nanopore sequencing technology, and discuss the advantages, limitations and future perspectives in using these third-generation sequencers for HCV genome analysis.",31528092,PMC6718035,10.3748/wjg.v25.i32.4661,7
Oxford Nanopore sequencing: new opportunities for plant genomics?,"DNA sequencing was dominated by Sanger's chain termination method until the mid-2000s, when it was progressively supplanted by new sequencing technologies that can generate much larger quantities of data in a shorter time. At the forefront of these developments, long-read sequencing technologies (third-generation sequencing) can produce reads that are several kilobases in length. This greatly improves the accuracy of genome assemblies by spanning the highly repetitive segments that cause difficulty for second-generation short-read technologies. Third-generation sequencing is especially appealing for plant genomes, which can be extremely large with long stretches of highly repetitive DNA. Until recently, the low basecalling accuracy of third-generation technologies meant that accurate genome assembly required expensive, high-coverage sequencing followed by computational analysis to correct for errors. However, today's long-read technologies are more accurate and less expensive, making them the method of choice for the assembly of complex genomes. Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), a third-generation platform for the sequencing of native DNA strands, is particularly suitable for the generation of high-quality assemblies of highly repetitive plant genomes. Here we discuss the benefits of ONT, especially for the plant science community, and describe the issues that remain to be addressed when using ONT for plant genome sequencing.",32459850,PMC7501810,10.1093/jxb/eraa263,26
Are we there yet? Benchmarking low-coverage nanopore long-read sequencing for the assembling of mitochondrial genomes using the vulnerable silky shark Carcharhinus falciformis,"Background:Whole mitochondrial genomes are quickly becoming markers of choice for the exploration of within-species genealogical and among-species phylogenetic relationships. Most often, 'primer walking' or 'long PCR' strategies plus Sanger sequencing or low-pass whole genome sequencing using Illumina short reads are used for the assembling of mitochondrial chromosomes. In this study, we first confirmed that mitochondrial genomes can be sequenced from long reads using nanopore sequencing data exclusively. Next, we examined the accuracy of the long-reads assembled mitochondrial chromosomes when comparing them to a 'gold' standard reference mitochondrial chromosome assembled using Illumina short-reads sequencing.Results:Using a specialized bioinformatics tool, we first produced a short-reads mitochondrial genome assembly for the silky shark C. falciformis with an average base coverage of 9.8x. The complete mitochondrial genome of C. falciformis was 16,705 bp in length and 934 bp shorter than a previously assembled genome (17,639 bp in length) that used bioinformatics tools not specialized for the assembly of mitochondrial chromosomes. Next, low-pass whole genome sequencing using a MinION ONT pocket-sized platform plus customized de-novo and reference-based workflows assembled and circularized a highly accurate mitochondrial genome in the silky shark Carcharhinus falciformis. Indels at the flanks of homopolymer regions explained most of the dissimilarities observed between the 'gold' standard reference mitochondrial genome (assembled using Illumina short reads) and each of the long-reads mitochondrial genome assemblies. Although not completely accurate, mitophylogenomics and barcoding analyses (using entire mitogenomes and the D-Loop/Control Region, respectively) suggest that long-reads assembled mitochondrial genomes are reliable for identifying a sequenced individual, such as C. falciformis, and separating the same individual from others belonging to closely related congeneric species.Conclusions:This study confirms that mitochondrial genomes can be sequenced from long-reads nanopore sequencing data exclusively. With further development, nanopore technology can be used to quickly test in situ mislabeling in the shark fin fishing industry and thus, improve surveillance protocols, law enforcement, and the regulation of this fishery. This study will also assist with the transferring of high-throughput sequencing technology to middle- and low-income countries so that international scientists can explore population genomics in sharks using inclusive research strategies. Lastly, we recommend assembling mitochondrial genomes using specialized assemblers instead of other assemblers developed for bacterial and/or nuclear genomes.",35459089,PMC9027416,10.1186/s12864-022-08482-z,3
Implementation of Nanopore sequencing as a pragmatic workflow for copy number variant confirmation in the clinic,"Background:Diagnosis of rare genetic diseases can be a long, expensive and complex process, involving an array of tests in the hope of obtaining an actionable result. Long-read sequencing platforms offer the opportunity to make definitive molecular diagnoses using a single assay capable of detecting variants, characterizing methylation patterns, resolving complex rearrangements, and assigning findings to long-range haplotypes. Here, we demonstrate the clinical utility of Nanopore long-read sequencing by validating a confirmatory test for copy number variants (CNVs) in neurodevelopmental disorders and illustrate the broader applications of this platform to assess genomic features with significant clinical implications.Methods:We used adaptive sampling on the Oxford Nanopore platform to sequence 25 genomic DNA samples and 5 blood samples collected from patients with known or false-positive copy number changes originally detected using short-read sequencing. Across the 30 samples (a total of 50 with replicates), we assayed 35 known unique CNVs (a total of 55 with replicates) and one false-positive CNV, ranging in size from 40 kb to 155 Mb, and assessed the presence or absence of suspected CNVs using normalized read depth.Results:Across 50 samples (including replicates) sequenced on individual MinION flow cells, we achieved an average on-target mean depth of 9.5X and an average on-target read length of 4805 bp. Using a custom read depth-based analysis, we successfully confirmed the presence of all 55 known CNVs (including replicates) and the absence of one false-positive CNV. Using the same CNV-targeted data, we compared genotypes of single nucleotide variant loci to verify that no sample mix-ups occurred between assays. For one case, we also used methylation detection and phasing to investigate the parental origin of a 15q11.2-q13 duplication with implications for clinical prognosis.Conclusions:We present an assay that efficiently targets genomic regions to confirm clinically relevant CNVs with a concordance rate of 100%. Furthermore, we demonstrate how integration of genotype, methylation, and phasing data from the Nanopore sequencing platform can potentially simplify and shorten the diagnostic odyssey.",37301971,PMC10257846,10.1186/s12967-023-04243-y,2
Comparing assembly strategies for third-generation sequencing technologies across different genomes,"The recent advent of long-read sequencing technologies, such as Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and Oxford Nanopore technology (ONT), has led to substantial accuracy and computational cost improvements. However, de novo whole-genome assembly still presents significant challenges related to the computational cost and the quality of the results. Accordingly, sequencing accuracy and throughput continue to improve, and many tools are constantly emerging. Therefore, selecting the correct sequencing platform, the proper sequencing depth and the assembly tools are necessary to perform high-quality assembly. This paper evaluates the primary assembly reconstruction from recent hybrid and non-hybrid pipelines on different genomes. We find that using PacBio high-fidelity long-read (HiFi) plays an essential role in haplotype construction with respect to ONT reads. However, we observe a substantial improvement in the correctness of the assembly from high-fidelity ONT datasets and combining it with HiFi or short-reads.",37598732,,10.1016/j.ygeno.2023.110700,1
Long-Read Nanopore Sequencing Validated for Human Leukocyte Antigen Class I Typing in Routine Diagnostics,"Matching of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) gene polymorphisms by high-resolution DNA sequence analysis is the gold standard for determining compatibility between patient and donor for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Single-molecule sequencing (PacBio or MinION) is a newest (third) generation sequencing approach. MinION is a nanopore sequencing platform, which provides long targeted DNA sequences. The long reads provide unambiguous phasing, but the initial high error profile prevented its use in high-impact applications, such as HLA typing for HLA matching of donor and recipient in the transplantation setting. Ongoing developments on instrumentation and basecalling software have improved the per-base accuracy of 1D2nanopore reads tremendously. In the current study, two validation panels of samples covering 70 of the 71 known HLA class I allele groups were used to compare third field sequences obtained by MinION, with Sanger sequence-based typing showing a 100% concordance between both data sets. In addition, the first validation panel was used to set the acceptance criteria for the use of MinION in a routine setting. The acceptance criteria were subsequently confirmed with the second validation panel. In summary, the present study describes validation and implementation of nanopore sequencing HLA class I typing method and illustrates that nanopore sequencing technology has advanced to a point where it can be used in routine diagnostics with high accuracy.",32302780,,10.1016/j.jmoldx.2020.04.001,9
The current revolution in transposable element biology enabled by long reads,"Technological advancement in DNA sequencing read-length has drastically changed the quality and completeness of decoded genomes. The aim of this article is not to describe the different technologies of long-read sequencing, or the widely appreciated power of this technology in genome sequencing, assembly, and gene annotation. Instead, in this article, we provide our opinion that with the exception of genome production, transposable element biology is the most radically altered field as a consequence of the advent of long-read sequencing technology. We review how long-reads have been used to answer key questions in transposable element biology, and how in the future long-reads will help elucidate the function of the repetitive fraction of genomes.",32007731,,10.1016/j.pbi.2019.12.012,24
Long-read sequencing across the C9orf72 'GGGGCC' repeat expansion: implications for clinical use and genetic discovery efforts in human disease,"Background:Many neurodegenerative diseases are caused by nucleotide repeat expansions, but most expansions, like the C9orf72 'GGGGCC' (G4C2) repeat that causes approximately 5-7% of all amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) cases, are too long to sequence using short-read sequencing technologies. It is unclear whether long-read sequencing technologies can traverse these long, challenging repeat expansions. Here, we demonstrate that two long-read sequencing technologies, Pacific Biosciences' (PacBio) and Oxford Nanopore Technologies' (ONT), can sequence through disease-causing repeats cloned into plasmids, including the FTD/ALS-causing G4C2repeat expansion. We also report the first long-read sequencing data characterizing the C9orf72 G4C2repeat expansion at the nucleotide level in two symptomatic expansion carriers using PacBio whole-genome sequencing and a no-amplification (No-Amp) targeted approach based on CRISPR/Cas9.Results:Both the PacBio and ONT platforms successfully sequenced through the repeat expansions in plasmids. Throughput on the MinION was a challenge for whole-genome sequencing; we were unable to attain reads covering the human C9orf72 repeat expansion using 15 flow cells. We obtained 8× coverage across the C9orf72 locus using the PacBio Sequel, accurately reporting the unexpanded allele at eight repeats, and reading through the entire expansion with 1324 repeats (7941 nucleotides). Using the No-Amp targeted approach, we attained > 800× coverage and were able to identify the unexpanded allele, closely estimate expansion size, and assess nucleotide content in a single experiment. We estimate the individual's repeat region was > 99% G4C2content, though we cannot rule out small interruptions.Conclusions:Our findings indicate that long-read sequencing is well suited to characterizing known repeat expansions, and for discovering new disease-causing, disease-modifying, or risk-modifying repeat expansions that have gone undetected with conventional short-read sequencing. The PacBio No-Amp targeted approach may have future potential in clinical and genetic counseling environments. Larger and deeper long-read sequencing studies in C9orf72 expansion carriers will be important to determine heterogeneity and whether the repeats are interrupted by non-G4C2content, potentially mitigating or modifying disease course or age of onset, as interruptions are known to do in other repeat-expansion disorders. These results have broad implications across all diseases where the genetic etiology remains unclear.",30126445,PMC6102925,10.1186/s13024-018-0274-4,59
Recent advances in the detection of base modifications using the Nanopore sequencer,"DNA and RNA modifications have important functions, including the regulation of gene expression. Existing methods based on short-read sequencing for the detection of modifications show difficulty in determining the modification patterns of single chromosomes or an entire transcript sequence. Furthermore, the kinds of modifications for which detection methods are available are very limited. The Nanopore sequencer is a single-molecule, long-read sequencer that can directly sequence RNA as well as DNA. Moreover, the Nanopore sequencer detects modifications on long DNA and RNA molecules. In this review, we mainly focus on base modification detection in the DNA and RNA of mammals using the Nanopore sequencer. We summarize current studies of modifications using the Nanopore sequencer, detection tools using statistical tests or machine learning, and applications of this technology, such as analyses of open chromatin, DNA replication, and RNA metabolism.",31602005,PMC7087776,10.1038/s10038-019-0679-0,56
Comparative analysis of metagenomic classifiers for long-read sequencing datasets,"Background:Long reads have gained popularity in the analysis of metagenomics data. Therefore, we comprehensively assessed metagenomics classification tools on the species taxonomic level. We analysed kmer-based tools, mapping-based tools and two general-purpose long reads mappers. We evaluated more than 20 pipelines which use either nucleotide or protein databases and selected 13 for an extensive benchmark. We prepared seven synthetic datasets to test various scenarios, including the presence of a host, unknown species and related species. Moreover, we used available sequencing data from three well-defined mock communities, including a dataset with abundance varying from 0.0001 to 20% and six real gut microbiomes.Results:General-purpose mappers Minimap2 and Ram achieved similar or better accuracy on most testing metrics than best-performing classification tools. They were up to ten times slower than the fastest kmer-based tools requiring up to four times less RAM. All tested tools were prone to report organisms not present in datasets, except CLARK-S, and they underperformed in the case of the high presence of the host's genetic material. Tools which use a protein database performed worse than those based on a nucleotide database. Longer read lengths made classification easier, but due to the difference in read length distributions among species, the usage of only the longest reads reduced the accuracy. The comparison of real gut microbiome datasets shows a similar abundance profiles for the same type of tools but discordance in the number of reported organisms and abundances between types. Most assessments showed the influence of database completeness on the reports.Conclusion:The findings indicate that kmer-based tools are well-suited for rapid analysis of long reads data. However, when heightened accuracy is essential, mappers demonstrate slightly superior performance, albeit at a considerably slower pace. Nevertheless, a combination of diverse categories of tools and databases will likely be necessary to analyse complex samples. Discrepancies observed among tools when applied to real gut datasets, as well as a reduced performance in cases where unknown species or a significant proportion of the host genome is present in the sample, highlight the need for continuous improvement of existing tools. Additionally, regular updates and curation of databases are important to ensure their effectiveness.",38212694,PMC10782538,10.1186/s12859-024-05634-8,2
Nanopore sequencing: Review of potential applications in functional genomics,"Molecular biology has been led by various measurement technologies, and increased throughput has developed omics analysis. The development of massively parallel sequencing technology has enabled access to fundamental molecular data and revealed genomic and transcriptomic signatures. Nanopore sequencers have driven such evolution to the next stage. Oxford Nanopore Technologies Inc. provides a new type of single molecule sequencer using protein nanopore that realizes direct sequencing without DNA synthesizing or amplification. This nanopore sequencer can sequence an ultra-long read limited by the input nucleotide length, or can determine DNA/RNA modifications. Recently, many fields such as medicine, epidemiology, ecology, and education have benefited from this technology. In this review, we explain the features and functions of the nanopore sequencer, introduce various situations where it has been used as a critical technology, and expected future applications.",31037722,,10.1111/dgd.12608,133
The Third-Generation Sequencing Challenge: Novel Insights for the Omic Sciences,"The understanding of the human genome has been greatly improved by the advent of next-generation sequencing technologies (NGS). Despite the undeniable advantages responsible for their widespread diffusion, these methods have some constraints, mainly related to short read length and the need for PCR amplification. As a consequence, long-read sequencers, called third-generation sequencing (TGS), have been developed, promising to overcome NGS. Starting from the first prototype, TGS has progressively ameliorated its chemistries by improving both read length and base-calling accuracy, as well as simultaneously reducing the costs/base. Based on these premises, TGS is showing its potential in many fields, including the analysis of difficult-to-sequence genomic regions, structural variations detection, RNA expression profiling, DNA methylation study, and metagenomic analyses. Protocol standardization and the development of easy-to-use pipelines for data analysis will enhance TGS use, also opening the way for their routine applications in diagnostic contexts.",38785975,PMC11117673,10.3390/biom14050568,0
FMLRC: Hybrid long read error correction using an FM-index,"Background:Long read sequencing is changing the landscape of genomic research, especially de novo assembly. Despite the high error rate inherent to long read technologies, increased read lengths dramatically improve the continuity and accuracy of genome assemblies. However, the cost and throughput of these technologies limits their application to complex genomes. One solution is to decrease the cost and time to assemble novel genomes by leveraging ""hybrid"" assemblies that use long reads for scaffolding and short reads for accuracy.Results:We describe a novel method leveraging a multi-string Burrows-Wheeler Transform with auxiliary FM-index to correct errors in long read sequences using a set of complementary short reads. We demonstrate that our method efficiently produces significantly more high quality corrected sequence than existing hybrid error-correction methods. We also show that our method produces more contiguous assemblies, in many cases, than existing state-of-the-art hybrid and long-read only de novo assembly methods.Conclusion:Our method accurately corrects long read sequence data using complementary short reads. We demonstrate higher total throughput of corrected long reads and a corresponding increase in contiguity of the resulting de novo assemblies. Improved throughput and computational efficiency than existing methods will help better economically utilize emerging long read sequencing technologies.",29426289,PMC5807796,10.1186/s12859-018-2051-3,61
Graphene-based nanopore approaches for DNA sequencing: A literature review,"DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is the blueprint of life as it encodes all genetic information. In genetic disorder such as gene fusion, copy number variation (CNV) and single nucleotide polymorphism, DNA sequencing is used as the gold standard for successful diagnosis. Researchers have been conducting rigorous studies to achieve genome sequence at low cost while maintaining high accuracy and high throughput, as such sequencer devices have been developed which led to the evolvement of this technology. These devices are categorized into first, second, and third DNA sequencing generations. One successful endeavor for DNA sequencing is nanopore sequencing. This specific method is considered desirable due to its ability to achieve DNA sequencing while maintaining the required standards such as low cost, high accuracy, long read length, and high throughput. On the other hand, non-nanopore sequencing techniques require extensive preparation as well as complex algorithms, and are restricted by high cost, small throughput, and small read lengths. In this review, the concepts, history, advances, challenges, applications, and potentials of nanopore sequencing are discussed including techniques and materials used for nanopore production and DNA translocation speed control. Additionally, in light of the importance of the nanopore material configuration and fabrication, graphene which is a common and effective material will be discussed in the context of nanopore fabrication techniques. Finally, this review will shed light on some nanopore-related investigations in the area of molecular biology.",30125881,,10.1016/j.bios.2018.07.072,16
Xdrop: Targeted sequencing of long DNA molecules from low input samples using droplet sorting,"Long-read sequencing can resolve regions of the genome that are inaccessible to short reads, and therefore are ideal for genome-gap closure, solving structural rearrangements and sequencing through repetitive elements. Here we introduce the Xdrop technology: a novel microfluidic-based system that allows for targeted enrichment of long DNA molecules starting from only a few nanograms of DNA. Xdrop is based on the isolation of long DNA fragments in millions of droplets, where the droplets containing a target sequence of interest are fluorescently labeled and sorted using flow cytometry. The final product from the Xdrop procedure is an enriched population of long DNA molecules that can be investigated by sequencing. To demonstrate the capability of Xdrop, we performed enrichment of the human papilloma virus 18 integrated into the genome of human HeLa cells. Analysis of the sequencing reads resolved three HPV18-chr8 integrations at base-pair resolution, and the captured fragments extended up to 30 kb into the human genome at the integration sites. Further, we enriched the complete TP53 locus in a leukemia cell line and could successfully phase coexisting mutations using PacBio sequencing. In summary, our results show that Xdrop is an efficient enrichment technology for studying complex genomic regions.",32516842,PMC7496172,10.1002/humu.24063,19
Multiplexed long-read plasmid validation and analysis using OnRamp,"Recombinant plasmid vectors are versatile tools that have facilitated discoveries in molecular biology, genetics, proteomics, and many other fields. As the enzymatic and bacterial processes used to create recombinant DNA can introduce errors, sequence validation is an essential step in plasmid assembly. Sanger sequencing is the current standard for plasmid validation; however, this method is limited by an inability to sequence through complex secondary structure and lacks scalability when applied to full-plasmid sequencing of multiple plasmids owing to read-length limits. Although high-throughput sequencing does provide full-plasmid sequencing at scale, it is impractical and costly when used outside of library-scale validation. Here, we present Oxford nanopore-based rapid analysis of multiplexed plasmids (OnRamp), an alternative method for routine plasmid validation that combines the advantages of high-throughput sequencing's full-plasmid coverage and scalability with Sanger's affordability and accessibility by leveraging nanopore's long-read sequencing technology. We include customized wet-laboratory protocols for plasmid preparation along with a pipeline designed for analysis of read data obtained using these protocols. This analysis pipeline is deployed on the OnRamp web app, which generates alignments between actual and predicted plasmid sequences, quality scores, and read-level views. OnRamp is designed to be broadly accessible regardless of programming experience to facilitate more widespread adoption of long-read sequencing for routine plasmid validation. Here we describe the OnRamp protocols and pipeline and show our ability to obtain full sequences from pooled plasmids while detecting sequence variation even in regions of high secondary structure at less than half the cost of equivalent Sanger sequencing.",37156622,PMC10317119,10.1101/gr.277369.122,3
SVJedi: genotyping structural variations with long reads,"Motivation:Studies on structural variants (SVs) are expanding rapidly. As a result, and thanks to third generation sequencing technologies, the number of discovered SVs is increasing, especially in the human genome. At the same time, for several applications such as clinical diagnoses, it is important to genotype newly sequenced individuals on well-defined and characterized SVs. Whereas several SV genotypers have been developed for short read data, there is a lack of such dedicated tool to assess whether known SVs are present or not in a new long read sequenced sample, such as the one produced by Pacific Biosciences or Oxford Nanopore Technologies.Results:We present a novel method to genotype known SVs from long read sequencing data. The method is based on the generation of a set of representative allele sequences that represent the two alleles of each structural variant. Long reads are aligned to these allele sequences. Alignments are then analyzed and filtered out to keep only informative ones, to quantify and estimate the presence of each SV allele and the allele frequencies. We provide an implementation of the method, SVJedi, to genotype SVs with long reads. The tool has been applied to both simulated and real human datasets and achieves high genotyping accuracy. We show that SVJedi obtains better performances than other existing long read genotyping tools and we also demonstrate that SV genotyping is considerably improved with SVJedi compared to other approaches, namely SV discovery and short read SV genotyping approaches.Availability and implementation:https://github.com/llecompte/SVJedi.git.Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",32437523,,10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa527,8
Comparison of De Novo Assembly Strategies for Bacterial Genomes,"(1) Background: Short-read sequencing allows for the rapid and accurate analysis of the whole bacterial genome but does not usually enable complete genome assembly. Long-read sequencing greatly assists with the resolution of complex bacterial genomes, particularly when combined with short-read Illumina data. However, it is not clear how different assembly strategies affect genomic accuracy, completeness, and protein prediction. (2) Methods: we compare different assembly strategies forHaemophilus parasuis, which causes Glässer's disease, characterized by fibrinous polyserositis and arthritis, in swine by using Illumina sequencing and long reads from the sequencing platforms of either Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) or SMRT Pacific Biosciences (PacBio). (3) Results: Assembly with either PacBio or ONT reads, followed by polishing with Illumina reads, facilitated high-quality genome reconstruction and was superior to the long-read-only assembly and hybrid-assembly strategies when evaluated in terms of accuracy and completeness. An equally excellent method was correction with Homopolish after the ONT-only assembly, which had the advantage of avoiding hybrid sequencing with Illumina. Furthermore, by aligning transcripts to assembled genomes and their predicted CDSs, the sequencing errors of the ONT assembly were mainly indels that were generated when homopolymer regions were sequenced, thus critically affecting protein prediction. Polishing can fill indels and correct mistakes. (4) Conclusions: The assembly of bacterial genomes can be directly achieved by using long-read sequencing techniques. To maximize assembly accuracy, it is essential to polish the assembly with homologous sequences of related genomes or sequencing data from short-read technology.",34299288,PMC8306402,10.3390/ijms22147668,13
Improved transcriptome assembly using a hybrid of long and short reads with StringTie,"Short-read RNA sequencing and long-read RNA sequencing each have their strengths and weaknesses for transcriptome assembly. While short reads are highly accurate, they are rarely able to span multiple exons. Long-read technology can capture full-length transcripts, but its relatively high error rate often leads to mis-identified splice sites. Here we present a new release of StringTie that performs hybrid-read assembly. By taking advantage of the strengths of both long and short reads, hybrid-read assembly with StringTie is more accurate than long-read only or short-read only assembly, and on some datasets it can more than double the number of correctly assembled transcripts, while obtaining substantially higher precision than the long-read data assembly alone. Here we demonstrate the improved accuracy on simulated data and real data from Arabidopsis thaliana, Mus musculus, and human. We also show that hybrid-read assembly is more accurate than correcting long reads prior to assembly while also being substantially faster. StringTie is freely available as open source software at https://github.com/gpertea/stringtie.",35648784,PMC9191730,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009730,62
Performance assessment of DNA sequencing platforms in the ABRF Next-Generation Sequencing Study,"Assessing the reproducibility, accuracy and utility of massively parallel DNA sequencing platforms remains an ongoing challenge. Here the Association of Biomolecular Resource Facilities (ABRF) Next-Generation Sequencing Study benchmarks the performance of a set of sequencing instruments (HiSeq/NovaSeq/paired-end 2 × 250-bp chemistry, Ion S5/Proton, PacBio circular consensus sequencing (CCS), Oxford Nanopore Technologies PromethION/MinION, BGISEQ-500/MGISEQ-2000 and GS111) on human and bacterial reference DNA samples. Among short-read instruments, HiSeq 4000 and X10 provided the most consistent, highest genome coverage, while BGI/MGISEQ provided the lowest sequencing error rates. The long-read instrument PacBio CCS had the highest reference-based mapping rate and lowest non-mapping rate. The two long-read platforms PacBio CCS and PromethION/MinION showed the best sequence mapping in repeat-rich areas and across homopolymers. NovaSeq 6000 using 2 × 250-bp read chemistry was the most robust instrument for capturing known insertion/deletion events. This study serves as a benchmark for current genomics technologies, as well as a resource to inform experimental design and next-generation sequencing variant calling.",34504351,PMC8985210,10.1038/s41587-021-01049-5,40
Long-Read DNA and RNA Sequencing to Streamline Clinical Genetic Testing and Reduce Barriers to Comprehensive Genetic Testing,"Background:Obtaining a precise molecular diagnosis through clinical genetic testing provides information about disease prognosis or progression, allows accurate counseling about recurrence risk, and empowers individuals to benefit from precision therapies or take part in N-of-1 trials. Unfortunately, more than half of individuals with a suspected Mendelian condition remain undiagnosed after a comprehensive clinical evaluation, and the results of any individual clinical genetic test ordered during a typical evaluation may take weeks or months to return. Furthermore, commonly used technologies, such as short-read sequencing, are limited in the types of disease-causing variation they can identify. New technologies, such as long-read sequencing (LRS), are poised to solve these problems.Content:Recent technical advances have improved accuracy, increased throughput, and decreased the costs of commercially available LRS technologies. This has resolved many historical concerns about the use of LRS in the clinical environment and opened the door to widespread clinical adoption of LRS. Here, we review LRS technology, how it has been used in the research setting to clarify complex variants or identify disease-causing variation missed by prior clinical testing, and how it may be used clinically in the near future.Summary:LRS is unique in that, as a single data source, it has the potential to replace nearly every other clinical genetic test offered today. When analyzed in a stepwise fashion, LRS will simplify laboratory processes, reduce barriers to comprehensive genetic testing, increase the rate of genetic diagnoses, and shorten the amount of time required to make a molecular diagnosis.",38167773,,10.1093/jalm/jfad107,1
"Long-read sequencing revealed cooccurrence, host range, and potential mobility of antibiotic resistome in cow feces","While it is well recognized that the environmental resistome is global, diverse, and augmented by human activities, it has been difficult to assess risk because of the inability to culture many environmental organisms, and it is difficult to evaluate risk from current sequence-based environmental methods. The four most important criteria to determine risk are whether the antibiotic-resistance genes (ARGs) are a complete, potentially functional complement; if they are linked with other resistances; whether they are mobile; and the identity of their host. Long-read sequencing fills this important gap between culture and short sequence-based methods. To address these criteria, we collected feces from a ceftiofur-treated cow, enriched the samples in the presence of antibiotics to favor ARG functionality, and sequenced long reads using Nanopore and PacBio technologies. Multidrug-resistance genes comprised 58% of resistome abundance, but only 0.8% of them were plasmid associated; fluroquinolone-, aminoglycoside-, macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin (MLS)-, and β-lactam-resistance genes accounted for 2.7 to 12.3% of resistome abundance but with 19 to 78% located on plasmids. A variety of plasmid types were assembled, some of which share low similarity to plasmids in current databases. Enterobacteriaceae were dominant hosts of antibiotic-resistant plasmids; physical linkage of extended-spectrum β-lactamase genes (CTX-M,TEM,CMY, andCARB) was largely found with aminoglycoside-, MLS-, tetracycline-, trimethoprim-, phenicol-, sulfonamide-, and mercury-resistance genes. A draft circular chromosome ofVagococcus lutraewas assembled; it carries MLS-, tetracycline- (includingtetMandtetLon an integrative conjugative element), and trimethoprim-resistance genes flanked by many transposase genes and insertion sequences, implying that they remain transferrable.",34161269,PMC8237627,10.1073/pnas.2024464118,6
Plassembler: an automated bacterial plasmid assembly tool,"Summary:With recent advances in sequencing technologies, it is now possible to obtain near-perfect complete bacterial chromosome assemblies cheaply and efficiently by combining a long-read-first assembly approach with short-read polishing. However, existing methods for assembling bacterial plasmids from long-read-first assemblies often misassemble or even miss bacterial plasmids entirely and accordingly require manual curation. Plassembler was developed to provide a tool that automatically assembles and outputs bacterial plasmids using a hybrid assembly approach. It achieves increased accuracy and computational efficiency compared to the existing gold standard tool Unicycler by removing chromosomal reads from the input read sets using a mapping approach.Availability and implementation:Plassembler is implemented in Python and is installable as a bioconda package using 'conda install -c bioconda plassembler'. The source code is available on GitHub at https://github.com/gbouras13/plassembler.

Challenges of Single-Molecule DNA Sequencing with Solid-State Nanopores,"A powerful DNA sequencing tool with high accuracy, long read length and high-throughput would be required more and more for decoding the complicated genetic code. Solid-state nanopore has attracted many researchers for its promising future as a next-generation DNA sequencing platform due to the processability, the robustness and the large-scale integratability. While the diverse materials have been widely explored for a solid-state nanopore, silicon nitride (Si3N4) is especially preferable from the viewpoint of mass production based on semiconductor fabrication process. Here, as a nanopore sensing mechanism, we focused on the ionic blockade current method which is the most developed technique. We also highlight the main challenges of Si3N4nanopore-based DNA sequencer that should be addressed: the fabrication of ultra-small nanopore and ultra-thin membrane, the modulation of DNA translocation speed and the detection of base-specific signals. In this chapter, we discuss the recent progress relating to solid-state nanopore DNA sequencing, which helps to provide a comprehensive information about the current technical situation.",30968365,,10.1007/978-981-13-6037-4_9,3
De novo assembly of human genome at single-cell levels,"Genome assembly has been benefited from long-read sequencing technologies with higher accuracy and higher continuity. However, most human genome assembly require large amount of DNAs from homogeneous cell lines without keeping cell heterogeneities, since cell heterogeneity could profoundly affect haplotype assembly results. Herein, using single-cell genome long-read sequencing technology (SMOOTH-seq), we have sequenced K562 and HG002 cells on PacBio HiFi and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) platforms and conducted de novo genome assembly. For the first time, we have completed the human genome assembly with high continuity (with NG50 of ∼2 Mb using 95 individual K562 cells) at single-cell levels, and explored the impact of different assemblers and sequencing strategies on genome assembly. With sequencing data from 30 diploid individual HG002 cells of relatively high genome coverage (average coverage ∼41.7%) on ONT platform, the NG50 can reach over 1.3 Mb. Furthermore, with the assembled genome from K562 single-cell dataset, more complete and accurate set of insertion events and complex structural variations could be identified. This study opened a new chapter on the practice of single-cell genome de novo assembly.",35819189,PMC9303314,10.1093/nar/gkac586,11
Pitfalls of haplotype phasing from amplicon-based long-read sequencing,"The long-read sequencers from Pacific Bioscience (PacBio) and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) offer the opportunity to phase mutations multiple kilobases apart directly from sequencing reads. In this study, we used long-range PCR with ONT and PacBio sequencing to phase two variants 9 kb apart in the RET gene. We also re-analysed data from a recent paper which had apparently successfully used ONT to phase clinically important haplotypes at the CYP2D6 and HLA loci. From these analyses, we demonstrate PCR-chimera formation during PCR amplification and reference alignment bias are pitfalls that need to be considered when attempting to phase variants using amplicon-based long-read sequencing technologies. These methodological pitfalls need to be avoided if the opportunities provided by long-read sequencers are to be fully exploited.",26883533,PMC4756330,10.1038/srep21746,34
Metabarcoding using nanopore long-read sequencing for the unbiased characterization of apicomplexan haemoparasites,"Apicomplexan haemoparasites generate significant morbidity and mortality in humans and other animals, particularly in many low-to-middle income countries. Malaria caused by Plasmodium remains responsible for some of the highest numbers of annual deaths of any human pathogen, whilst piroplasmids, such as Babesia and Theileria can have immense negative economic effects through livestock loss. Diagnosing haemoparasites via traditional methods like microscopy is challenging due to low-level and transient parasitaemia. PCR-based diagnostics overcome these limitations by being both highly sensitive and specific, but they may be unable to accurately detect coinfections or identify novel species. In contrast, next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based methods can characterize all pathogens from a group of interest concurrently, although, the short-read platforms previously used have been limited in the taxonomic resolution achievable. Here, we used Oxford Nanopore Technologies' (ONT) long-read MinION™ sequencer to conduct apicomplexan haemoparasite metabarcoding via sequencing the near full-length 18S ribosomal RNA gene, demonstrating its ability to detect Babesia, Hepatozoon, Neospora, Plasmodium, Theileria and Toxoplasma species. This method was tested on blood-extracted DNA from 100 dogs and the results benchmarked against qPCR and Illumina-based metabarcoding. For two common haemoparasites, nanopore sequencing performed as well as qPCR (kappa agreement statistics > 0.98), whilst also detecting one pathogen, Hepatozoon felis, missed by the other techniques. The long-reads obtained by nanopore sequencing provide an improved species-level taxonomic resolution whilst the method's broad applicability mean it can be used to explore apicomplexan communities from diverse mammalian hosts, on a portable sequencer that easily permits adaptation to field use.",37837372,,10.1111/1755-0998.13878,2
Navigating the pitfalls of mapping DNA and RNA modifications,"Chemical modifications to nucleic acids occur across the kingdoms of life and carry important regulatory information. Reliable high-resolution mapping of these modifications is the foundation of functional and mechanistic studies, and recent methodological advances based on next-generation sequencing and long-read sequencing platforms are critical to achieving this aim. However, mapping technologies may have limitations that sometimes lead to inconsistent results. Some of these limitations are technical in nature and specific to certain types of technology. Here, however, we focus on common (yet not always widely recognized) pitfalls that are shared among frequently used mapping technologies and discuss strategies to help technology developers and users mitigate their effects. Although the emphasis is primarily on DNA modifications, RNA modifications are also discussed.",36653550,PMC10722219,10.1038/s41576-022-00559-5,4
Sequencing of individual barcoded cDNAs using Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore Technologies reveals platform-specific error patterns,"Long-read transcriptomics require understanding error sources inherent to technologies. Current approaches cannot compare methods for an individual RNA molecule. Here, we present a novel platform-comparison method that combines barcoding strategies and long-read sequencing to sequence cDNA copies representing an individual RNA molecule on both Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT). We compare these long-read pairs in terms of sequence content and isoform patterns. Although individual read pairs show high similarity, we find differences in (1) aligned length, (2) transcription start site (TSS), (3) polyadenylation site (poly(A)-site) assignment, and (4) exon-intron structures. Overall, 25% of read pairs disagree on either TSS, poly(A)-site, or splice site. Intron-chain disagreement typically arises from alignment errors of microexons and complicated splice sites. Our single-molecule technology comparison reveals that inconsistencies are often caused by sequencing error-induced inaccurate ONT alignments, especially to downstream GUNNGU donor motifs. However, annotation-disagreeing upstream shifts in NAGNAG acceptors in ONT are often confirmed by PacBio and are thus likely real. In both barcoded and nonbarcoded ONT reads, we find that intron number and proximity of GU/AGs better predict inconsistencies with the annotation than read quality alone. We summarize these findings in an annotation-based algorithm for spliced alignment correction that improves subsequent transcript construction with ONT reads.",35301264,PMC8997348,10.1101/gr.276405.121,10
Evaluation of haplotype-aware long-read error correction with hifieval,"Summary:The PacBio High-Fidelity (HiFi) sequencing technology produces long reads of >99% in accuracy. It has enabled the development of a new generation of de novo sequence assemblers, which all have sequencing error correction (EC) as the first step. As HiFi is a new data type, this critical step has not been evaluated before. Here, we introduced hifieval, a new command-line tool for measuring over- and under-corrections produced by EC algorithms. We assessed the accuracy of the EC components of existing HiFi assemblers on the CHM13 and the HG002 datasets and further investigated the performance of EC methods in challenging regions such as homopolymer regions, centromeric regions, and segmental duplications. Hifieval will help HiFi assemblers to improve EC and assembly quality in the long run.Availability and implementation:The source code is available at https://github.com/magspho/hifieval.",37851384,PMC10612404,10.1093/bioinformatics/btad631,2
"Rapid, multiplexed, whole genome and plasmid sequencing of foodborne pathogens using long-read nanopore technology","U.S. public health agencies have employed next-generation sequencing (NGS) as a tool to quickly identify foodborne pathogens during outbreaks. Although established short-read NGS technologies are known to provide highly accurate data, long-read sequencing is still needed to resolve highly-repetitive genomic regions and genomic arrangement, and to close the sequences of bacterial chromosomes and plasmids. Here, we report the use of long-read nanopore sequencing to simultaneously sequence the entire chromosome and plasmid of Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Bareilly and Escherichia coli O157:H7. We developed a rapid and random sequencing approach coupled with de novo genome assembly within a customized data analysis workflow that uses publicly-available tools. In sequencing runs as short as four hours, using the MinION instrument, we obtained full-length genomes with an average identity of 99.87% for Salmonella Bareilly and 99.89% for E. coli in comparison to the respective MiSeq references. These nanopore-only assemblies provided readily available information on serotype, virulence factors, and antimicrobial resistance genes. We also demonstrate the potential of nanopore sequencing assemblies for rapid preliminary phylogenetic inference. Nanopore sequencing provides additional advantages as very low capital investment and footprint, and shorter (10 hours library preparation and sequencing) turnaround time compared to other NGS technologies.",31704961,PMC6841976,10.1038/s41598-019-52424-x,25
A practical assembly guideline for genomes with various levels of heterozygosity,"Although current long-read sequencing technologies have a long-read length that facilitates assembly for genome reconstruction, they have high sequence errors. While various assemblers with different perspectives have been developed, no systematic evaluation of assemblers with long reads for diploid genomes with varying heterozygosity has been performed. Here, we evaluated a series of processes, including the estimation of genome characteristics such as genome size and heterozygosity, de novo assembly, polishing, and removal of allelic contigs, using six genomes with various heterozygosity levels. We evaluated five long-read-only assemblers (Canu, Flye, miniasm, NextDenovo and Redbean) and five hybrid assemblers that combine short and long reads (HASLR, MaSuRCA, Platanus-allee, SPAdes and WENGAN) and proposed a concrete guideline for the construction of haplotype representation according to the degree of heterozygosity, followed by polishing and purging haplotigs, using stable and high-performance assemblers: Redbean, Flye and MaSuRCA.",37798248,PMC10555665,10.1093/bib/bbad337,0

De novo assembly strategies have evolved with changes in DNA sequencing technologies and have been through at least 3 phases: (1) short-read only, (2) short- and long-read hybrid, and (3) long-read only assemblies. Each of the phases has its own error model. We hypothesized that hidden short-read scaffolding errors and erroneous long-read contigs degrade the quality of short- and long-read hybrid assemblies. We assembled the genome of Trematomus borchgrevinki from data generated during each of the 3 phases and assessed the quality problems we encountered. We developed strategies such as k-mer-assembled region replacement, parameter optimization, and long-read sampling to address the error models. We demonstrated that a k-mer-based strategy improved short-read assemblies as measured by Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Ortholog while mate-pair libraries introduced hidden scaffolding errors and perturbed Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Ortholog scores. Furthermore, we found that although hybrid assemblies can generate higher contiguity they tend to suffer from lower quality. In addition, we found long-read-only assemblies can be optimized for contiguity by subsampling length-restricted raw reads. Our results indicate that long-read contig assembly is the current best choice and that assemblies from phase I and phase II were of lower quality.",35904764,PMC9635638,10.1093/g3journal/jkac192,7
Recent advancement of NGS technologies to detect active transposable elements in plants,"Background:Unlike peoples' belief that transposable elements (TEs) are ""junk DNAs"" or ""genomic parasites"", TEs are essential genomic elements that bring about genetic diversity and enable evolution of a species. In fact, transposons are major constituent of chromosome in crop genomes, particularly in major cereal crops, the primary type of which is long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposon. Since TE mobilization can be controlled by specific environmental stimulation and as the result can generate novel genetic variations, it has been suggested that controlled mobilization of TEs can be a plausible method for crop breeding. To achieve this goal, series of sequencing techniques have been recently established to identify TEs that are active in mobility. These methods target and detect extrachromosomal DNAs (ecDNAs), which are final products of integration. The newly identified TEs by these methods exhibit strong transpositional activity which can generate novel genetic diversity and provide useful breeding resources.Conclusions:In this mini review, we summarize and introduce ALE-seq, mobilome-seq, and VLP DNA-seq techniques employed to detect active TEs in plants.",33555503,,10.1007/s13258-021-01040-z,8
Validation of Genomic Structural Variants Through Long Sequencing Technologies,"Although numerous algorithms have been developed to identify large chromosomal rearrangements (i.e., genomic structural variants, SVs), there remains a dearth of approaches to evaluate their results. This is significant, as the accurate identification of SVs is still an outstanding problem whereby no single algorithm has been shown to be able to achieve high sensitivity and specificity across different classes of SVs. The method introduced in this chapter, VaPoR, is specifically designed to evaluate the accuracy of SV predictions using third-generation long sequences. This method uses a recurrence approach and collects direct evidence from raw reads thus avoiding computationally costly whole genome assembly. This chapter would describe in detail as how to apply this tool onto different data types.",30039374,,10.1007/978-1-4939-8666-8_15,0
Identification and characterization of occult human-specific LINE-1 insertions using long-read sequencing technology,"Long Interspersed Element-1 (LINE-1) retrotransposition contributes to inter- and intra-individual genetic variation and occasionally can lead to human genetic disorders. Various strategies have been developed to identify human-specific LINE-1 (L1Hs) insertions from short-read whole genome sequencing (WGS) data; however, they have limitations in detecting insertions in complex repetitive genomic regions. Here, we developed a computational tool (PALMER) and used it to identify 203 non-reference L1Hs insertions in the NA12878 benchmark genome. Using PacBio long-read sequencing data, we identified L1Hs insertions that were absent in previous short-read studies (90/203). Approximately 81% (73/90) of the L1Hs insertions reside within endogenous LINE-1 sequences in the reference assembly and the analysis of unique breakpoint junction sequences revealed 63% (57/90) of these L1Hs insertions could be genotyped in 1000 Genomes Project sequences. Moreover, we observed that amplification biases encountered in single-cell WGS experiments led to a wide variation in L1Hs insertion detection rates between four individual NA12878 cells; under-amplification limited detection to 32% (65/203) of insertions, whereas over-amplification increased false positive calls. In sum, these data indicate that L1Hs insertions are often missed using standard short-read sequencing approaches and long-read sequencing approaches can significantly improve the detection of L1Hs insertions present in individual genomes.",31853540,PMC7026601,10.1093/nar/gkz1173,44
"Nanopore Sequencing for Mycobacterium tuberculosis: a Critical Review of the Literature, New Developments, and Future Opportunities","The next-generation, short-read sequencing technologies that generate comprehensive, whole-genome data with single nucleotide resolution have already advanced tuberculosis diagnosis, treatment, surveillance, and source investigation. Their high costs, tedious and lengthy processes, and large equipment remain major hurdles for research use in high tuberculosis burden countries and implementation into routine care. The portable next-generation sequencing devices developed by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) are attractive alternatives due to their long-read sequence capability, compact low-cost hardware, and continued improvements in accuracy and throughput. A systematic review of the published literature demonstrated limited uptake of ONT sequencing in tuberculosis research and clinical care. Of the 12 eligible articles presenting ONT sequencing data on at least one Mycobacterium tuberculosis sample, four addressed software development for long-read ONT sequencing data with potential applications for M. tuberculosis. Only eight studies presented results of ONT sequencing of M. tuberculosis, of which five performed whole-genome and three did targeted sequencing. Based on these findings, we summarize the standard processes, reflect on the current limitations of ONT sequencing technology, and the research needed to overcome the main hurdles. The low capital cost, portable nature and continued improvement in the performance of ONT sequencing make it an attractive option for sequencing for research and clinical care, but limited data are available on its application in the tuberculosis field. Important research investment is needed to unleash the full potential of ONT sequencing for tuberculosis research and care.",34133895,PMC8769739,10.1128/JCM.00646-21,17
Evaluation of strategies for the assembly of diverse bacterial genomes using MinION long-read sequencing,"Background:Short-read sequencing technologies have made microbial genome sequencing cheap and accessible. However, closing genomes is often costly and assembling short reads from genomes that are repetitive and/or have extreme %GC content remains challenging. Long-read, single-molecule sequencing technologies such as the Oxford Nanopore MinION have the potential to overcome these difficulties, although the best approach for harnessing their potential remains poorly evaluated.Results:We sequenced nine bacterial genomes spanning a wide range of GC contents using Illumina MiSeq and Oxford Nanopore MinION sequencing technologies to determine the advantages of each approach, both individually and combined. Assemblies using only MiSeq reads were highly accurate but lacked contiguity, a deficiency that was partially overcome by adding MinION reads to these assemblies. Even more contiguous genome assemblies were generated by using MinION reads for initial assembly, but these assemblies were more error-prone and required further polishing. This was especially pronounced when Illumina libraries were biased, as was the case for our strains with both high and low GC content. Increased genome contiguity dramatically improved the annotation of insertion sequences and secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters, likely because long-reads can disambiguate these highly repetitive but biologically important genomic regions.Conclusions:Genome assembly using short-reads is challenged by repetitive sequences and extreme GC contents. Our results indicate that these difficulties can be largely overcome by using single-molecule, long-read sequencing technologies such as the Oxford Nanopore MinION. Using MinION reads for assembly followed by polishing with Illumina reads generated the most contiguous genomes with sufficient accuracy to enable the accurate annotation of important but difficult to sequence genomic features such as insertion sequences and secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters. The combination of Oxford Nanopore and Illumina sequencing can therefore cost-effectively advance studies of microbial evolution and genome-driven drug discovery.",30626323,PMC6325685,10.1186/s12864-018-5381-7,74
A Nanopore Sequencing Course for Graduate School Curriculum,"The high-throughput long-read sequencing has become affordable enough for any molecular biology lab to utilize genome sequencing in their research. Complete genome sequencing and assembly of bacterial genomes is one such application which is powerful yet simple enough for anyone without advanced molecular biology or bioinformatics skills to conduct on his/her own. High-throughput sequencing will eventually become a basic routine tool in molecular biology labs just like polymerase chain reaction and electrophoresis in a near future. To assist the use of such nanopore sequencing technologies, we designed a graduate school course to learn both the experimental and bioinformatic skills of complete bacterial genome sequencing and assembly.",36781725,,10.1007/978-1-0716-2996-3_9,0
QAlign: aligning nanopore reads accurately using current-level modeling,"Motivation:Efficient and accurate alignment of DNA/RNA sequence reads to each other or to a reference genome/transcriptome is an important problem in genomic analysis. Nanopore sequencing has emerged as a major sequencing technology and many long-read aligners have been designed for aligning nanopore reads. However, the high error rate makes accurate and efficient alignment difficult. Utilizing the noise and error characteristics inherent in the sequencing process properly can play a vital role in constructing a robust aligner. In this article, we design QAlign, a pre-processor that can be used with any long-read aligner for aligning long reads to a genome/transcriptome or to other long reads. The key idea in QAlign is to convert the nucleotide reads into discretized current levels that capture the error modes of the nanopore sequencer before running it through a sequence aligner.Results:We show that QAlign is able to improve alignment rates from around 80% up to 90% with nanopore reads when aligning to the genome. We also show that QAlign improves the average overlap quality by 9.2, 2.5 and 10.8% in three real datasets for read-to-read alignment. Read-to-transcriptome alignment rates are improved from 51.6% to 75.4% and 82.6% to 90% in two real datasets.Availability and implementation:https://github.com/joshidhaivat/QAlign.git.Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",33051648,PMC8097683,10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa875,7
Extraction and selection of high-molecular-weight DNA for long-read sequencing from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii,"Recent advances in long-read sequencing technologies have enabled the complete assembly of eukaryotic genomes from telomere to telomere by allowing repeated regions to be fully sequenced and assembled, thus filling the gaps left by previous short-read sequencing methods. Furthermore, long-read sequencing can also help characterizing structural variants, with applications in the fields of genome evolution or cancer genomics. For many organisms, the main bottleneck to sequence long reads remains the lack of robust methods to obtain high-molecular-weight (HMW) DNA. For this purpose, we developed an optimized protocol to extract DNA suitable for long-read sequencing from the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, based on CTAB/phenol extraction followed by a size selection step for long DNA molecules. We provide validation results for the extraction protocol, as well as statistics obtained with Oxford Nanopore Technologies sequencing.",38330024,PMC10852265,10.1371/journal.pone.0297014,0
BlockPolish: accurate polishing of long-read assembly via block divide-and-conquer,"Long-read sequencing technology enables significant progress in de novo genome assembly. However, the high error rate and the wide error distribution of raw reads result in a large number of errors in the assembly. Polishing is a procedure to fix errors in the draft assembly and improve the reliability of genomic analysis. However, existing methods treat all the regions of the assembly equally while there are fundamental differences between the error distributions of these regions. How to achieve very high accuracy in genome assembly is still a challenging problem. Motivated by the uneven errors in different regions of the assembly, we propose a novel polishing workflow named BlockPolish. In this method, we divide contigs into blocks with low complexity and high complexity according to statistics of aligned nucleotide bases. Multiple sequence alignment is applied to realign raw reads in complex blocks and optimize the alignment result. Due to the different distributions of error rates in trivial and complex blocks, two multitask bidirectional Long short-term memory (LSTM) networks are proposed to predict the consensus sequences. In the whole-genome assemblies of NA12878 assembled by Wtdbg2 and Flye using Nanopore data, BlockPolish has a higher polishing accuracy than other state-of-the-arts including Racon, Medaka and MarginPolish & HELEN. In all assemblies, errors are predominantly indels and BlockPolish has a good performance in correcting them. In addition to the Nanopore assemblies, we further demonstrate that BlockPolish can also reduce the errors in the PacBio assemblies. The source code of BlockPolish is freely available on Github (https://github.com/huangnengCSU/BlockPolish).",34619757,,10.1093/bib/bbab405,0
PacBio sequencing output increased through uniform and directional fivefold concatenation,"Advances in sequencing technology have allowed researchers to sequence DNA with greater ease and at decreasing costs. Main developments have focused on either sequencing many short sequences or fewer large sequences. Methods for sequencing mid-sized sequences of 600-5,000 bp are currently less efficient. For example, the PacBio Sequel I system yields ~ 100,000-300,000 reads with an accuracy per base pair of 90-99%. We sought to sequence several DNA populations of ~ 870 bp in length with a sequencing accuracy of 99% and to the greatest depth possible. We optimised a simple, robust method to concatenate genes of ~ 870 bp five times and then sequenced the resulting DNA of ~ 5,000 bp by PacBioSMRT long-read sequencing. Our method improved upon previously published concatenation attempts, leading to a greater sequencing depth, high-quality reads and limited sample preparation at little expense. We applied this efficient concatenation protocol to sequence nine DNA populations from a protein engineering study. The improved method is accompanied by a simple and user-friendly analysis pipeline, DeCatCounter, to sequence medium-length sequences efficiently at one-fifth of the cost.",34508117,PMC8433307,10.1038/s41598-021-96829-z,9
Analysis of Splicing Regulation by Third-Generation Sequencing,"In Metazoa, the diversity of transcripts produced by the RNA Polymerase II is generated essentially through post-transcriptional processing of the nascent transcripts. The regulation of exon inclusion by alternative splicing is one of the main sources of this diversity, which leads to the expansion of the proteome. The portfolio of alternative transcripts remains largely underestimated. Improvement of the sequencing technologies has enhanced the characterization of RNA isoforms and led to the perpetual incrementation of gene expression diversity. Here, we describe a high throughput approach to assess in-depth the splicing regulation of target gene(s) using the third-generation sequencing (TGS) technologies.",35895260,,10.1007/978-1-0716-2521-7_6,0
Identification and Genotyping of Transposable Element Insertions From Genome Sequencing Data,"Transposable element (TE) mobilization is a significant source of genomic variation and has been associated with various human diseases. The exponential growth of population-scale whole-genome sequencing and rapid innovations in long-read sequencing technologies provide unprecedented opportunities to study TE insertions and their functional impact in human health and disease.

Here, we review computational approaches to detecting and genotyping TE insertions using short- and long-read sequencing and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",32662945,PMC8906366,10.1002/cphg.102,9
Nanopore ultra-long read sequencing technology for antimicrobial resistance detection in Mannheimia haemolytica,"Disruptive innovations in long-range, cost-effective direct template nucleic acid sequencing are transforming clinical and diagnostic medicine. A multidrug resistant strain and a pan-susceptible strain of Mannheimia haemolytica, isolated from pneumonic bovine lung samples, were sequenced at 146× and 111× coverage, respectively with Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION. De novo assembly produced a complete genome for the non-resistant strain and a nearly complete assembly for the drug resistant strain. Functional annotation using RAST (Rapid Annotations using Subsystems Technology), CARD (Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database) and ResFinder databases identified genes conferring resistance to different classes of antibiotics including β-lactams, tetracyclines, lincosamides, phenicols, aminoglycosides, sulfonamides and macrolides. Resistance phenotypes of the M. haemolytica strains were determined by minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the antibiotics. Sequencing with a highly portable MinION device corresponded to MIC assays with most of the antimicrobial resistant determinants being identified with as few as 5437 reads, except for the genes responsible for resistance to Fluoroquinolones. The resulting quality assemblies and AMR gene annotation highlight the efficiency of ultra-long read, whole-genome sequencing (WGS) as a valuable tool in diagnostic veterinary medicine.",30849421,,10.1016/j.mimet.2019.03.001,13
Expanding an expanded genome: long-read sequencing of Trypanosoma cruzi,"Although the genome of Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease, was first made available in 2005, with additional strains reported later, the intrinsic genome complexity of this parasite (the abundance of repetitive sequences and genes organized in tandem) has traditionally hindered high-quality genome assembly and annotation. This also limits diverse types of analyses that require high degrees of precision. Long reads generated by third-generation sequencing technologies are particularly suitable to address the challenges associated with T. cruzi's genome since they permit direct determination of the full sequence of large clusters of repetitive sequences without collapsing them. This, in turn, not only allows accurate estimation of gene copy numbers but also circumvents assembly fragmentation. Here, we present the analysis of the genome sequences of two T. cruzi clones: the hybrid TCC (TcVI) and the non-hybrid Dm28c (TcI), determined by PacBio Single Molecular Real-Time (SMRT) technology. The improved assemblies herein obtained permitted us to accurately estimate gene copy numbers, abundance and distribution of repetitive sequences (including satellites and retroelements). We found that the genome of T. cruzi is composed of a 'core compartment' and a 'disruptive compartment' which exhibit opposite GC content and gene composition. Novel tandem and dispersed repetitive sequences were identified, including some located inside coding sequences. Additionally, homologous chromosomes were separately assembled, allowing us to retrieve haplotypes as separate contigs instead of a unique mosaic sequence. Finally, manual annotation of surface multigene families, mucins and trans-sialidases allows now a better overview of these complex groups of genes.",29708484,PMC5994713,10.1099/mgen.0.000177,78
Microbial diversity characterization of seawater in a pilot study using Oxford Nanopore Technologies long-read sequencing,"Objective:Currently the majority of non-culturable microbes in sea water are yet to be discovered, Nanopore offers a solution to overcome the challenging tasks to identify the genomes and complex composition of oceanic microbiomes. In this study we evaluate the utility of Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing to characterize microbial diversity in seawater from multiple locations. We compared the microbial species diversity of retrieved environmental samples from two different locations and time points.Results:With only three ONT flow cells we were able to identify thousands of organisms, including bacteriophages, from which a large part at species level. It was possible to assemble genomes from environmental samples with Flye. In several cases this resulted in > 1 Mbp contigs and in the particular case of a Thioglobus singularis species it even produced a near complete genome. k-mer analysis reveals that a large part of the data represents species of which close relatives have not yet been deposited to the database. These results show that our approach is suitable for scalable genomic investigations such as monitoring oceanic biodiversity and provides a new platform for education in biodiversity.",33531031,PMC7852107,10.1186/s13104-021-05457-3,3
Genome-wide methylation patterns from canine nanopore assemblies,"Recent advances in long-read sequencing have enabled the creation of reference-quality genome assemblies for multiple individuals within a species. In particular, 8 long-read genome assemblies have recently been published for the canine model (dogs and wolves). These assemblies were created using a range of sequencing and computational approaches, with only limited comparisons described among subsets of the assemblies. Here we present 3 high-quality de novo reference assemblies based upon Oxford Nanopore long-read sequencing: 2 Bernese Mountain Dogs (BD & OD) and a Cairn terrier (CA611). These breeds are of particular interest due to the enrichment of unresolved genetic disorders. Leveraging advancement in software technologies, we utilized published data of Labrador Retriever (Yella) to generate a new assembly, resulting in a ∼280-fold increase in continuity (N50 size of 91 kbp vs 25.75 Mbp). In conjunction with these 4 new assemblies, we uniformly assessed 8 existing assemblies for generalized quality metrics, sequence divergence, and a detailed BUSCO assessment. We identified a set of ∼400 conserved genes during the BUSCO analysis missing in all assemblies. Genome-wide methylation profiles were generated from the nanopore sequencing, resulting in broad concordance with existing whole-genome and reduced-representation bisulfite sequencing, while highlighting superior overage of mobile elements. These analyses demonstrate the ability of Nanopore sequencing to resolve the sequence and epigenetic profile of canine genomes.",37681359,PMC10627269,10.1093/g3journal/jkad203,1
Finding long tandem repeats in long noisy reads,"Motivation:Long tandem repeat expansions of more than 1000 nt have been suggested to be associated with diseases, but remain largely unexplored in individual human genomes because read lengths have been too short. However, new long-read sequencing technologies can produce single reads of 10 000 nt or more that can span such repeat expansions, although these long reads have high error rates, of 10-20%, which complicates the detection of repetitive elements. Moreover, most traditional algorithms for finding tandem repeats are designed to find short tandem repeats (<1000 nt) and cannot effectively handle the high error rate of long reads in a reasonable amount of time.Results:Here, we report an efficient algorithm for solving this problem that takes advantage of the length of the repeat. Namely, a long tandem repeat has hundreds or thousands of approximate copies of the repeated unit, so despite the error rate, many short k-mers will be error-free in many copies of the unit. We exploited this characteristic to develop a method for first estimating regions that could contain a tandem repeat, by analyzing the k-mer frequency distributions of fixed-size windows across the target read, followed by an algorithm that assembles the k-mers of a putative region into the consensus repeat unit by greedily traversing a de Bruijn graph. Experimental results indicated that the proposed algorithm largely outperformed Tandem Repeats Finder, a widely used program for finding tandem repeats, in terms of sensitivity.Availability and implementation:https://github.com/morisUtokyo/mTR.",33031558,PMC8097686,10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa865,2
An efficient error correction algorithm using FM-index,"Background:High-throughput sequencing offers higher throughput and lower cost for sequencing a genome. However, sequencing errors, including mismatches and indels, may be produced during sequencing. Because, errors may reduce the accuracy of subsequent de novo assembly, error correction is necessary prior to assembly. However, existing correction methods still face trade-offs among correction power, accuracy, and speed.Results:We develop a novel overlap-based error correction algorithm using FM-index (called FMOE). FMOE first identifies overlapping reads by aligning a query read simultaneously against multiple reads compressed by FM-index. Subsequently, sequencing errors are corrected by k-mer voting from overlapping reads only. The experimental results indicate that FMOE has highest correction power with comparable accuracy and speed. Our algorithm performs better in long-read than short-read datasets when compared with others. The assembly results indicated different algorithms has its own strength and weakness, whereas FMOE is good for long or good-quality reads.Conclusions:FMOE is freely available at https://github.com/ythuang0522/FMOC .",29179672,PMC5704532,10.1186/s12859-017-1940-1,1
Genetic Biomonitoring and Biodiversity Assessment Using Portable Sequencing Technologies: Current Uses and Future Directions,"We live in an era of unprecedented biodiversity loss, affecting the taxonomic composition of ecosystems worldwide. The immense task of quantifying human imprints on global ecosystems has been greatly simplified by developments in high-throughput DNA sequencing technology (HTS). Approaches like DNA metabarcoding enable the study of biological communities at unparalleled detail. However, current protocols for HTS-based biodiversity exploration have several drawbacks. They are usually based on short sequences, with limited taxonomic and phylogenetic information content. Access to expensive HTS technology is often restricted in developing countries. Ecosystems of particular conservation priority are often remote and hard to access, requiring extensive time from field collection to laboratory processing of specimens. The advent of inexpensive mobile laboratory and DNA sequencing technologies show great promise to facilitate monitoring projects in biodiversity hot-spots around the world. Recent attention has been given to portable DNA sequencing studies related to infectious organisms, such as bacteria and viruses, yet relatively few studies have focused on applying these tools to Eukaryotes, such as plants and animals. Here, we outline the current state of genetic biodiversity monitoring of higher Eukaryotes using Oxford Nanopore Technology's MinION portable sequencing platform, as well as summarize areas of recent development.",31671909,PMC6895800,10.3390/genes10110858,26
Characterization of Fecal Microbiota with Clinical Specimen Using Long-Read and Short-Read Sequencing Platform,"Accurate and rapid identification of microbiotic communities using 16S ribosomal (r)RNA sequencing is a critical task for expanding medical and clinical applications. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is widely considered a practical approach for direct application to communities without the need for in vitro culturing. In this report, a comparative evaluation of short-read (Illumina) and long-read (Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT)) platforms toward 16S rRNA sequencing with the same batch of total genomic DNA extracted from fecal samples is presented. Different 16S gene regions were amplified, bar-coded, and sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq and ONT MinION sequencers and corresponding kits. Mapping of the sequenced amplicon using MinION to the entire 16S rRNA gene was analyzed with the cloud-based EPI2ME algorithm. V3-V4 reads generated using MiSeq were aligned by applying the CLC genomics workbench. More than 90% of sequenced reads generated using distinct sequencers were accurately classified at the genus or species level. The misclassification of sequenced reads at the species level between the two approaches was less substantial as expected. Taken together, the comparative results demonstrate that MinION sequencing platform coupled with the corresponding algorithm could function as a practicable strategy in classifying bacterial community to the species level.",32993155,PMC7582668,10.3390/ijms21197110,11

Ultralow-input single-tube linked-read library method enables short-read second-generation sequencing systems to routinely generate highly accurate and economical long-range sequencing information,"Long-range sequencing information is required for haplotype phasing, de novo assembly, and structural variation detection. Current long-read sequencing technologies can provide valuable long-range information but at a high cost with low accuracy and high DNA input requirements. We have developed a single-tube Transposase Enzyme Linked Long-read Sequencing (TELL-seq) technology, which enables a low-cost, high-accuracy, and high-throughput short-read second-generation sequencer to generate over 100 kb of long-range sequencing information with as little as 0.1 ng input material. In a PCR tube, millions of clonally barcoded beads are used to uniquely barcode long DNA molecules in an open bulk reaction without dilution and compartmentation. The barcoded linked-reads are used to successfully assemble genomes ranging from microbes to human. These linked-reads also generate megabase-long phased blocks and provide a cost-effective tool for detecting structural variants in a genome, which are important to identify compound heterozygosity in recessive Mendelian diseases and discover genetic drivers and diagnostic biomarkers in cancers.",32540955,PMC7370886,10.1101/gr.260380.119,47
VeChat: correcting errors in long reads using variation graphs,"Error correction is the canonical first step in long-read sequencing data analysis. Current self-correction methods, however, are affected by consensus sequence induced biases that mask true variants in haplotypes of lower frequency showing in mixed samples. Unlike consensus sequence templates, graph-based reference systems are not affected by such biases, so do not mistakenly mask true variants as errors. We present VeChat, as an approach to implement this idea: VeChat is based on variation graphs, as a popular type of data structure for pangenome reference systems. Extensive benchmarking experiments demonstrate that long reads corrected by VeChat contain 4 to 15 (Pacific Biosciences) and 1 to 10 times (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) less errors than when being corrected by state of the art approaches. Further, using VeChat prior to long-read assembly significantly improves the haplotype awareness of the assemblies. VeChat is an easy-to-use open-source tool and publicly available at https://github.com/HaploKit/vechat .",36333324,PMC9636371,10.1038/s41467-022-34381-8,6
Efficient detection and assembly of non-reference DNA sequences with synthetic long reads,"Recent pan-genome studies have revealed an abundance of DNA sequences in human genomes that are not present in the reference genome. A lion's share of these non-reference sequences (NRSs) cannot be reliably assembled or placed on the reference genome. Improvements in long-read and synthetic long-read (aka linked-read) technologies have great potential for the characterization of NRSs. While synthetic long reads require less input DNA than long-read datasets, they are algorithmically more challenging to use. Except for computationally expensive whole-genome assembly methods, there is no synthetic long-read method for NRS detection. We propose a novel integrated alignment-based and local assembly-based algorithm, Novel-X, that uses the barcode information encoded in synthetic long reads to improve the detection of such events without a whole-genome de novo assembly. Our evaluations demonstrate that Novel-X finds many non-reference sequences that cannot be found by state-of-the-art short-read methods. We applied Novel-X to a diverse set of 68 samples from the Polaris HiSeq 4000 PGx cohort. Novel-X discovered 16 691 NRS insertions of size &gt; 300 bp (total length 18.2 Mb). Many of them are population specific or may have a functional impact.",35924489,PMC9561269,10.1093/nar/gkac653,3
High resolution annotation of zebrafish transcriptome using long-read sequencing,"With the emergence of zebrafish as an important model organism, a concerted effort has been made to study its transcriptome. This effort is limited, however, by gaps in zebrafish annotation, which are especially pronounced concerning transcripts dynamically expressed during zygotic genome activation (ZGA). To date, short-read sequencing has been the principal technology for zebrafish transcriptome annotation. In part because these sequence reads are too short for assembly methods to resolve the full complexity of the transcriptome, the current annotation is rudimentary. By providing direct observation of full-length transcripts, recently refined long-read sequencing platforms can dramatically improve annotation coverage and accuracy. Here, we leveraged the SMRT platform to study the transcriptome of zebrafish embryos before and after ZGA. Our analysis revealed additional novelty and complexity in the zebrafish transcriptome, identifying 2539 high-confidence novel transcripts that originated from previously unannotated loci and 1835 high-confidence new isoforms in previously annotated genes. We validated these findings using a suite of computational approaches including structural prediction, sequence homology, and functional conservation analyses, as well as by confirmatory transcript quantification with short-read sequencing data. Our analyses provided insight into new homologs and paralogs of functionally important proteins and noncoding RNAs, isoform switching occurrences, and different classes of novel splicing events. Several novel isoforms representing distinct splicing events were validated through PCR experiments, including the discovery and validation of a novel 8-kb transcript spanning multiplemir-430elements, an important driver of early development. Our study provides a significantly improved zebrafish transcriptome annotation resource.",30061115,PMC6120630,10.1101/gr.223586.117,33
Long-read RNA sequencing of Pacific abalone Haliotis discus hannai reveals innate immune system responses to environmental stress,"Haliotis discus hannai is a commercially important mollusk species, and the abalone aquaculture sector has been jeopardized by deteriorating environmental circumstances such as bacterial infection and thermal stress during the hot summers. However, due to a paucity of genetic information, such as transcriptome resources, our understanding of their stress adaptation is restricted. In this research, using single-molecule long-read (SMRT) sequencing technology, a library composed of ten tissues (i.e., haemocytes, gills, muscle, hepatopancreas, digestive tract, mantle, mucous gland, ovary, testis and head) was constructed and sequenced. In all, 41,855 high-quality unique transcripts, among which 24,778 were successfully annotated. Additionally, 13,463 SSRs, 1,169 transcription factors, and 18,124 lncRNAs were identified in H. discus hannai transcriptome. Furthermore, multiple immune-related transcripts were identified according to KEGG annotation, and a portion of these transcripts were mapped into several classical immune-related pathways, including the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway and Toll-like receptor signaling pathway. Additionally, 24 typical sequences related to the immunity pathway were detected by RT-PCR; the results showed that most of the immune-related genes showed significantly high expression at 72 h after bacterial challenges and thermal stress, especially the expression level of genes in gills was significantly higher than that in haemocytes under V. parahaemolyticus stress at 24 h. At the same time. The analysis of alternative splicing identified several innate immunity-related functions genes, including CD109 and caspase 2. These results suggest that the complex immune system, particularly the powerful innate immunity system, was crucial for H. discus hannai response to numerous environmental challenges.",35122948,,10.1016/j.fsi.2022.01.042,0
Comprehensive profiling of circular RNAs with nanopore sequencing and CIRI-long,"Reconstructing the sequence of circular RNAs (circRNAs) from short RNA sequencing reads has proved challenging given the similarity of circRNAs and their corresponding linear messenger RNAs. Previous sequencing methods were unable to achieve high-throughput detection of full-length circRNAs. Here we describe a protocol for enrichment and full-length sequencing of circRNA isoforms using nanopore technology. Circular reverse transcription and size selection achieves a 20-fold higher enrichment of circRNAs from total RNA compared to previous methods. We developed an algorithm, called circRNA identifier using long-read sequencing data (CIRI-long), to reconstruct the sequence of circRNAs. The workflow was validated with simulated data and by comparison to Illumina sequencing as well as quantitative real-time RT-PCR. We used CIRI-long to analyze adult mouse brain samples and systematically profile circRNAs, including mitochondria-derived and transcriptional read-through circRNAs. We identified a new type of intronic self-ligated circRNA that exhibits special splicing and expression patterns. Our method takes advantage of nanopore long reads and enables unbiased reconstruction of full-length circRNA sequences.",33707777,,10.1038/s41587-021-00842-6,71
From contigs towards chromosomes: automatic improvement of long read assemblies (ILRA),"Recent advances in long read technologies not only enable large consortia to aim to sequence all eukaryotes on Earth, but they also allow individual laboratories to sequence their species of interest with relatively low investment. Long read technologies embody the promise of overcoming scaffolding problems associated with repeats and low complexity sequences, but the number of contigs often far exceeds the number of chromosomes and they may contain many insertion and deletion errors around homopolymer tracts. To overcome these issues, we have implemented the ILRA pipeline to correct long read-based assemblies. Contigs are first reordered, renamed, merged, circularized, or filtered if erroneous or contaminated. Illumina short reads are used subsequently to correct homopolymer errors. We successfully tested our approach by improving the genome sequences of Homo sapiens, Trypanosoma brucei, and Leptosphaeria spp., and by generating four novel Plasmodium falciparum assemblies from field samples. We found that correcting homopolymer tracts reduced the number of genes incorrectly annotated as pseudogenes, but an iterative approach seems to be required to correct more sequencing errors. In summary, we describe and benchmark the performance of our new tool, which improved the quality of novel long read assemblies up to 1 Gbp. The pipeline is available at GitHub: https://github.com/ThomasDOtto/ILRA.",37406192,PMC10359078,10.1093/bib/bbad248,2
Microbial Identification Using rRNA Operon Region: Database and Tool for Metataxonomics with Long-Read Sequence,"Recent development of long-read sequencing platforms has enabled researchers to explore bacterial community structure through analysis of full-length 16S rRNA gene (∼1,500 bp) or 16S-ITS-23S rRNA operon region (∼4,300 bp), resulting in higher taxonomic resolution than short-read sequencing platforms. Despite the potential of long-read sequencing in metagenomics, resources and protocols for this technology are scarce. Here, we describe MIrROR, the database and analysis tool for metataxonomics using the bacterial 16S-ITS-23S rRNA operon region. We collected 16S-ITS-23S rRNA operon sequences extracted from bacterial genomes from NCBI GenBank and performed curation. A total of 97,781 16S-ITS-23S rRNA operon sequences covering 9,485 species from 43,653 genomes were obtained. For user convenience, we provide an analysis tool based on a mapping strategy that can be used for taxonomic profiling with MIrROR database. To benchmark MIrROR, we compared performance against publicly available databases and tool with mock communities and simulated data sets. Our platform showed promising results in terms of the number of species covered and the accuracy of classification. To encourage active 16S-ITS-23S rRNA operon analysis in the field, BLAST function and taxonomic profiling results with 16S-ITS-23S rRNA operon studies, which have been reported as BioProject on NCBI are provided. MIrROR (http://mirror.egnome.co.kr/) will be a useful platform for researchers who want to perform high-resolution metagenome analysis with a cost-effective sequencer such as MinION from Oxford Nanopore Technologies.IMPORTANCEMetabarcoding is a powerful tool to investigate community diversity in an economic and efficient way by amplifying a specific gene marker region. With the advancement of long-read sequencing technologies, the field of metabarcoding has entered a new phase. The technologies have brought a need for development in several areas, including new markers that long-read can cover, database for the markers, tools that reflect long-read characteristics, and compatibility with downstream analysis tools. By constructing MIrROR, we met the need for a database and tools for the 16S-ITS-23S rRNA operon region, which has recently been shown to have sufficient resolution at the species level. Bacterial community analysis using the 16S-ITS-23S rRNA operon region with MIrROR will provide new insights from various research fields.",35352997,PMC9045266,10.1128/spectrum.02017-21,9
Construction of a trio-based structural variation panel utilizing activated T lymphocytes and long-read sequencing technology,"Long-read sequencing technology enable better characterization of structural variants (SVs). To adapt the technology to population-scale analyses, one critical issue is to obtain sufficient amount of high-molecular-weight genomic DNA. Here, we propose utilizing activated T lymphocytes, which can be established efficiently in a biobank to stably supply high-grade genomic DNA sufficiently. We conducted nanopore sequencing of 333 individuals constituting 111 trios with high-coverage long-read sequencing data (depth 22.2x, N50 of 25.8 kb) and identified 74,201 SVs. Our trio-based analysis revealed that more than 95% of the SVs were concordant with Mendelian inheritance. We also identified SVs associated with clinical phenotypes, all of which appear to be stably transmitted from parents to offspring. Our data provide a catalog of SVs in the general Japanese population, and the applied approach using the activated T-lymphocyte resource will contribute to biobank-based human genetic studies focusing on SVs at the population scale.",36127505,PMC9489684,10.1038/s42003-022-03953-1,3
Long-read sequencing identified intronic repeat expansions inSAMD12from Chinese pedigrees affected with familial cortical myoclonic tremor with epilepsy,"Background:The locus for familial cortical myoclonic tremor with epilepsy (FCMTE) has long been mapped to 8q24 in linkage studies, but the causative mutations remain unclear. Recently, expansions of intronic TTTCA and TTTTA repeat motifs withinSAMD12were found to be involved in the pathogenesis of FCMTE in Japanese pedigrees. We aim to identify the causative mutations of FCMTE in Chinese pedigrees.Methods:We performed genetic linkage analysis by microsatellite markers in a five-generation Chinese pedigree with 55 members. We also used array-comparative genomic hybridisation (CGH) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies (whole-exome sequencing, capture region deep sequencing and whole-genome sequencing) to identify the causative mutations in the disease locus. Recently, we used low-coverage (~10×) long-read genome sequencing (LRS) on the PacBio Sequel and Oxford Nanopore platforms to identify the causative mutations, and used repeat-primed PCR for validation of the repeat expansions.Results:Linkage analysis mapped the disease locus to 8q23.3-24.23. Array-CGH and NGS failed to identify causative mutations in this locus. LRS identified the intronic TTTCA and TTTTA repeat expansions inSAMD12as the causative mutations, thus corroborating the recently published results in Japanese pedigrees.Conclusions:We identified the pentanucleotide repeat expansion inSAMD12as the causative mutation in Chinese FCMTE pedigrees. Our study also suggested that LRS is an effective tool for molecular diagnosis of genetic disorders, especially for neurological diseases that cannot be positively diagnosed by conventional clinical microarray and NGS technologies.",30194086,,10.1136/jmedgenet-2018-105484,43
LAMSA: fast split read alignment with long approximate matches,"Motivation:Read length is continuously increasing with the development of novel high-throughput sequencing technologies, which has enormous potentials on cutting-edge genomic studies. However, longer reads could more frequently span the breakpoints of structural variants (SVs) than that of shorter reads. This may greatly influence read alignment, since most state-of-the-art aligners are designed for handling relatively small variants in a co-linear alignment framework. Meanwhile, long read alignment is still not as efficient as that of short reads, which could be also a bottleneck for the upcoming wide application.Results:We propose long approximate matches-based split aligner (LAMSA), a novel split read alignment approach. It takes the advantage of the rareness of SVs to implement a specifically designed two-step strategy. That is, LAMSA initially splits the read into relatively long fragments and co-linearly align them to solve the small variations or sequencing errors, and mitigate the effect of repeats. The alignments of the fragments are then used for implementing a sparse dynamic programming-based split alignment approach to handle the large or non-co-linear variants. We benchmarked LAMSA with simulated and real datasets having various read lengths and sequencing error rates, the results demonstrate that it is substantially faster than the state-of-the-art long read aligners; meanwhile, it also has good ability to handle various categories of SVs.Availability and implementation:LAMSA is available at https://github.com/hitbc/LAMSA CONTACT: Ydwang@hit.edu.cnSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",27667793,,10.1093/bioinformatics/btw594,16
LongQC: A Quality Control Tool for Third Generation Sequencing Long Read Data,"We propose LongQC as an easy and automated quality control tool for genomic datasets generated by third generation sequencing (TGS) technologies such as Oxford Nanopore technologies (ONT) and SMRT sequencing from Pacific Bioscience (PacBio). Key statistics were optimized for long read data, and LongQC covers all major TGS platforms. LongQC processes and visualizes those statistics automatically and quickly.",32041730,PMC7144081,10.1534/g3.119.400864,61
Annotated bacterial chromosomes from frame-shift-corrected long-read metagenomic data,"Background:Short-read sequencing technologies have long been the work-horse of microbiome analysis. Continuing technological advances are making the application of long-read sequencing to metagenomic samples increasingly feasible.Results:We demonstrate that whole bacterial chromosomes can be obtained from an enriched community, by application of MinION sequencing to a sample from an EBPR bioreactor, producing 6 Gb of sequence that assembles into multiple closed bacterial chromosomes. We provide a simple pipeline for processing such data, which includes a new approach to correcting erroneous frame-shifts.Conclusions:Advances in long-read sequencing technology and corresponding algorithms will allow the routine extraction of whole chromosomes from environmental samples, providing a more detailed picture of individual members of a microbiome.",30992083,PMC6469205,10.1186/s40168-019-0665-y,37
HINGE: long-read assembly achieves optimal repeat resolution,"Long-read sequencing technologies have the potential to produce gold-standard de novo genome assemblies, but fully exploiting error-prone reads to resolve repeats remains a challenge. Aggressive approaches to repeat resolution often produce misassemblies, and conservative approaches lead to unnecessary fragmentation. We present HINGE, an assembler that seeks to achieve optimal repeat resolution by distinguishing repeats that can be resolved given the data from those that cannot. This is accomplished by adding ""hinges"" to reads for constructing an overlap graph where only unresolvable repeats are merged. As a result, HINGE combines the error resilience of overlap-based assemblers with repeat-resolution capabilities of de Bruijn graph assemblers. HINGE was evaluated on the long-read bacterial data sets from the NCTC project. HINGE produces more finished assemblies than Miniasm and the manual pipeline of NCTC based on the HGAP assembler and Circlator. HINGE also allows us to identify 40 data sets where unresolvable repeats prevent the reliable construction of a unique finished assembly. In these cases, HINGE outputs a visually interpretable assembly graph that encodes all possible finished assemblies consistent with the reads, while other approaches such as the NCTC pipeline and FALCON either fragment the assembly or resolve the ambiguity arbitrarily.",28320918,PMC5411769,10.1101/gr.216465.116,35
Sequencing DNA with nanopores: Troubles and biases,"Oxford Nanopore Technologies' (ONT) long read sequencers offer access to longer DNA fragments than previous sequencer generations, at the cost of a higher error rate. While many papers have studied read correction methods, few have addressed the detailed characterization of observed errors, a task complicated by frequent changes in chemistry and software in ONT technology. The MinION sequencer is now more stable and this paper proposes an up-to-date view of its error landscape, using the most mature flowcell and basecaller. We studied Nanopore sequencing error biases on both bacterial and human DNA reads. We found that, although Nanopore sequencing is expected not to suffer from GC bias, it is a crucial parameter with respect to errors. In particular, low-GC reads have fewer errors than high-GC reads (about 6% and 8% respectively). The error profile for homopolymeric regions or regions with short repeats, the source of about half of all sequencing errors, also depends on the GC rate and mainly shows deletions, although there are some reads with long insertions. Another interesting finding is that the quality measure, although over-estimated, offers valuable information to predict the error rate as well as the abundance of reads. We supplemented this study with an analysis of a rapeseed RNA read set and shown a higher level of errors with a higher level of deletion in these data. Finally, we have implemented an open source pipeline for long-term monitoring of the error profile, which enables users to easily compute various analysis presented in this work, including for future developments of the sequencing device. Overall, we hope this work will provide a basis for the design of better error-correction methods.",34597327,PMC8486125,10.1371/journal.pone.0257521,132
R2C2+UMI: Combining concatemeric consensus sequencing with unique molecular identifiers enables ultra-accurate sequencing of amplicons on Oxford Nanopore Technologies sequencers,"The sequencing of PCR amplicons is a core application of high-throughput sequencing technology. Using unique molecular identifiers (UMIs), individual amplified molecules can be sequenced to very high accuracy on an Illumina sequencer. However, Illumina sequencers have limited read length and are therefore restricted to sequencing amplicons shorter than 600bp unless using inefficient synthetic long-read approaches. Native long-read sequencers from Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore Technologies can, using consensus read approaches, match or exceed Illumina quality while achieving much longer read lengths. Using a circularization-based concatemeric consensus sequencing approach (R2C2) paired with UMIs (R2C2+UMI) we show that we can sequence ~550nt antibody heavy-chain (IGH) and ~1500nt 16S amplicons at accuracies up to and exceeding Q50 (<1 error in 100,0000 sequenced bases), which exceeds accuracies of UMI-supported Illumina paired sequencing as well as synthetic long-read approaches.",37662385,PMC10473586,10.1101/2023.08.19.553937,0
