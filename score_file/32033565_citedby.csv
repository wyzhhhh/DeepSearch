32033565,Opportunities and challenges in long-read sequencing data analysis.,10.1186/s13059-020-1935-5,"Long-read technologies are overcoming early limitations in accuracy and        throughput, broadening their application domains in genomics. Dedicated analysis        tools that take into account the characteristics of long-read data are thus        required, but the fast pace of development of such tools can be overwhelming. To        assist in the design and analysis of long-read sequencing projects, we review the        current landscape of available tools and present an online interactive database,        long-read-tools.org, to facilitate their browsing.

38792764,Improving Bacterial Metagenomic Research through Long-Read Sequencing.,10.3390/microorganisms12050935,"Metagenomic sequencing analysis is central to investigating microbial communities        in clinical and environmental studies. Short-read sequencing remains the primary        approach for metagenomic research; however, long-read sequencing may offer        advantages of improved metagenomic assembly and resolved taxonomic        identification. To compare the relative performance for metagenomic studies, we        simulated short- and long-read datasets using increasingly complex metagenomes        comprising 10, 20, and 50 microbial taxa. Additionally, we used an empirical        dataset of paired short- and long-read data generated from mouse fecal pellets to        assess real-world performance. We compared metagenomic assembly quality,        taxonomic classification, and metagenome-assembled genome (MAG) recovery rates.        We show that long-read sequencing data significantly improve taxonomic        classification and assembly quality. Metagenomic assemblies using simulated long        reads were more complete and more contiguous with higher rates of MAG recovery.        This resulted in more precise taxonomic classifications. Principal component        analysis of empirical data demonstrated that sequencing technology affects        compositional results as samples clustered by sequence type, not sample type.        Overall, we highlight strengths of long-read metagenomic sequencing for        microbiome studies, including improving the accuracy of classification and        relative abundance estimates. These results will aid researchers when considering        which sequencing approaches to use for metagenomic projects.",PMC11124196,Microorganisms,101625893
38785975,The Third-Generation Sequencing Challenge: Novel Insights for the Omic Sciences.,10.3390/biom14050568,"The understanding of the human genome has been greatly improved by the advent of        next-generation sequencing technologies (NGS). Despite the undeniable advantages        responsible for their widespread diffusion, these methods have some constraints,        mainly related to short read length and the need for PCR amplification. As a        consequence, long-read sequencers, called third-generation sequencing (TGS), have        been developed, promising to overcome NGS. Starting from the first prototype, TGS        has progressively ameliorated its chemistries by improving both read length and        base-calling accuracy, as well as simultaneously reducing the costs/base. Based        on these premises, TGS is showing its potential in many fields, including the        analysis of difficult-to-sequence genomic regions, structural variations        detection, RNA expression profiling, DNA methylation study, and metagenomic        analyses. Protocol standardization and the development of easy-to-use pipelines        for data analysis will enhance TGS use, also opening the way for their routine        applications in diagnostic contexts.",PMC11117673,Biomolecules,101596414

While alignment-based methods are generally slower,        k-mer-based taxonomic classifiers can overcome this limitation, potentially at        the expense of lower sensitivity for strains and species that are not in the        database. RESULTS: We present MetageNN, a memory-efficient long-read taxonomic        classifier that is robust to sequencing errors and missing genomes. MetageNN is a        neural network model that uses short k-mer profiles of sequences to reduce the        impact of distribution shifts on error-prone long reads. Benchmarking MetageNN        against other machine learning approaches for taxonomic classification (GeNet)        showed substantial improvements with long-read data (20% improvement in F1        score). By utilizing nanopore sequencing data, MetageNN exhibits improved        sensitivity in situations where the reference database is incomplete. It        surpasses the alignment-based MetaMaps and MEGAN-LR, as well as the k-mer-based        Kraken2 tools, with improvements of 100%, 36%, and 23% respectively at the        read-level analysis. Notably, at the community level, MetageNN consistently        demonstrated higher sensitivities than the previously mentioned tools.        Furthermore, MetageNN requires < 1/4th of the database storage used by Kraken2,        MEGAN-LR and MMseqs2 and is > 7× faster than MetaMaps and GeNet and > 2× faster        than MEGAN-LR and MMseqs2. CONCLUSION: This proof of concept work demonstrates        the utility of machine-learning-based methods for taxonomic classification using        long reads.

Furthermore, few dedicated tools exist for plasmid assembly, especially        for de novo assembly. Here, we evaluated short-read, long-read, and hybrid (both        short and long reads) de novo assembly pipelines across three replicates of a        24-plasmid library. Consistent with previous characterizations of each sequencing        technology, short-read assemblies had frequent issues resolving GC-rich regions,        and long-read assemblies commonly had small insertions and deletions, especially        in repetitive regions. The hybrid approach facilitated the most consistent        assembly generation. Although Sanger sequencing can be used to verify specific        regions, it requires a reference sequence to design primers, emphasizing the need        for accurate de novo plasmid assembly tools.

To address the effect of read length on genome assembly        quality, gene prediction and annotation, we compared genome assemblers and        sequencing technologies with four strains of the ectomycorrhizal fungus Laccaria        trichodermophora. By analysing the predicted repertoire of carbohydrate enzymes,        we investigated the effects of assembly quality on functional inferences.        Libraries were generated using three different sequencing platforms (Illumina        Next-Seq, Mi-Seq and PacBio Sequel), and genomes were assembled using single and        hybrid assemblies/libraries. Long reads or hybrid assemby resolved the collapsing        of repeated regions, but the nuclear heterozygous versions remained unresolved.        In dikaryotic fungi, each cell includes two nuclei and each nucleus has        differences not only in allelic gene version but also in gene composition and        synteny.

METHODS: We        recruited patients from Moorfields Eye Hospital (London, UK) and Buenos Aires,        Argentina, who were diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa and found to have        biallelic variants in PHYH, with at least one being c.678+5G>T.

RESULTS: Four patients provided a blood sample. One patient had        isolated retinitis pigmentosa and three had mild extraocular findings. Blood        phytanic acid levels were normal in two patients, mildly elevated in one, and        markedly high in the fourth. Retinal evaluation showed an intact ellipsoid zone        as well as preserved autofluorescence in the macular region in three of the four        patients.

The in-frame nature        of this may be in keeping with a mild presentation and higher prevalence in the        general population.

Chloroplast genomes are commonly used in evolutionary studies        and taxonomic identification and are increasingly becoming a target for crop        improvement studies. As DNA sequencing becomes more affordable, researchers are        collecting vast swathes of high-quality whole-genome sequence data from        laboratory and field settings alike. Whole tissue read libraries sequenced with        the primary goal of understanding the nuclear genome will inadvertently contain        many reads derived from the chloroplast genome. These whole-genome, whole-tissue        read libraries can additionally be used to assemble chloroplast genomes with        little to no extra cost. While several tools exist that make use of short-read        second generation and third-generation long-read sequencing data for chloroplast        genome assembly, these tools may have complex installation steps, inadequate        error reporting, poor expandability, and/or lack scalability.

In        this study, we conducted an integrative analysis by combining PacBio single        molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing with short reads Illumina RNA-seq. Our study        revealed that cisplatin-induced dormant and reactivated cancer cells exhibited a        noteworthy reduction in gene transcripts and alternative splicing events.        Particularly, the differential alternative splicing events were found to be        overlapping with the differentially expression genes and enriched in genes        related to cell cycle and cell division.

We created the assembly using the hybrid approach        implemented in MaSuRCA, achieving a contiguous 51.34 Mb chromosomal-scale        scaffolding enabling identification of structural variations. The AUGUSTUS        pipeline predicted 8060 genes, and BUSCO deemed the genomes 99% complete; 6278        (78%) genes were annotated with Pfam domains, and 1395 genes were assigned        GO-terms. Comparing E. tenella strains (APU2, US isolate and Houghton, UK        isolate) derived Houghton strain of E. tenella revealed 62,905 high stringency        differences, of which 45,322 are single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (0.088%).        The rate of transitions/transversions among the SNPs are 1.63 ts/tv.

However, the initial investment for acquiring next-generation        sequencing platforms and the need for bioinformatic skills represented an        obstacle for the widespread use of WGS. Long-reading technologies, such as the        one developed by Oxford Nanopore Technologies, can be easily implemented with a        minor initial investment and with simple protocols that can be performed with        basic laboratory equipment. METHODS: Herein, we report a simple MinION        Galaxy-based workflow with analysis parameters that allow its implementation in        food safety laboratories with limited computer resources and without previous        knowledge in bioinformatics for rapid Salmonella serotyping, virulence, and        identification of antimicrobial resistance genes. For that purpose, the single        use Flongle flow cells, along with the MinION Mk1B for WGS, and the        community-driven web-based analysis platform Galaxy for bioinformatic analysis        was used. Three strains belonging to three different serotypes, monophasic S.        Typhimurium, S. Grancanaria, and S. Senftenberg, were sequenced.

We exploit chromosome-scale genome assemblies to show the nature of        genomic expansion, structural variation, and chromosomal rearrangements from rice        and Brachypodium, to diploids in the tribe Aveneae (e.g., Avena longiglumis,        2n = 2x = 14; 3,961 Mb assembled to 3,850 Mb in chromosomes). RESULTS: Most of        the Avena chromosome arms show relatively uniform expansion over the 10-fold to        15-fold genome-size increase. Apart from non-coding sequence diversification and        accumulation around the centromeres, blocks of genes are not interspersed with        blocks of repeats, even in subterminal regions. As in the tribe Triticeae, blocks        of conserved synteny are seen between the analyzed species with chromosome        fusion, fission, and nesting (insertion) events showing deep evolutionary        conservation of chromosome structure during genomic expansion. Unexpectedly, the        terminal gene-rich chromosomal segments (representing about 50 Mb) show        translocations between chromosomes during speciation, with homogenization of        genome-specific repetitive elements within the tribe Aveneae. Newly-formed        intergenomic translocations of similar extent are found in the hexaploid A.        sativa. CONCLUSIONS: The study provides insight into evolutionary mechanisms and        speciation in the BOP clade, which is valuable for measurement of biodiversity,        development of a clade-wide pangenome, and exploitation of genomic diversity        through breeding programs in Poaceae.",PMC10704644,BMC plant biology,100967807

To study drug resistance mutations        and parasite population dynamics, whole-genome sequencing of patient blood        samples is commonly performed. However, the predominance of human DNA in these        samples imposes the need for time-consuming laboratory procedures to enrich        Plasmodium DNA. We used the Oxford Nanopore Technologies' adaptive sampling        feature to circumvent this problem and enrich Plasmodium reads directly during        the sequencing run. We demonstrate that adaptive nanopore sequencing efficiently        enriches Plasmodium reads, which simplifies and shortens the timeline from blood        collection to parasite sequencing. In addition, we show that the obtained data        can be used for monitoring genetic markers, or to generate nearly complete        genomes.

In recent years, the        microbiological evaluation of raw milk has been investigated in-depth using        next-generation sequencing approaches such as metataxonomic analysis. Despite        this, host DNA is a major concern in the shotgun metagenomic sequencing of        microbial communities in milk samples, and it represents a big challenge. In this        study, we aimed to evaluate different methods for host DNA depletion and/or        microbial DNA enrichment and assess the use of PCR-based whole genome        amplification in milk samples with high somatic cell count (SCC) by using short-        and long-read sequencing technologies. Our results evidenced that DNA extraction        performed differently in terms of host DNA removal, impacting metagenome        composition and functional profiles.. Moreover, the ratio of SCC/bacteria        ultimately impacts microbial DNA yield, and samples with low SCC (SCC below        100,000 cells/mL) are the most problematic. When milk samples with high SCC (SCC        above 200,000 cells/mL) underwent multiple-displacement amplification (MDA), we        successfully recovered high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), and        long-read sequencing was feasible even for samples with low DNA concentration. By        associating MDA and short-read sequencing, we recovered two times more MAGs than        in untreated samples, and an ongoing co-infection not reported by traditional        methods was detected for mastitis pathogen. Overall, this new approach will        improve the detection of mastitis-associated microorganisms and make it possible        to examine host-microbiome interactions in bovine        mastitis.IMPORTANCENext-generation sequencing technologies have been widely used        to gain new insights into the diversity of the microbial community of milk        samples and dairy products for different purposes such as microbial safety,        profiling of starter cultures, and host-microbiome interactions. Milk is a        complex food matrix, and additionally, the presence of host nucleic acid        sequences is considered a contaminant in untargeted high-throughput sequencing        studies. Therefore, genomic-centric metagenomic studies of milk samples focusing        on the health-disease status in dairy cattle are still scarce, which makes it        difficult to evaluate the microbial ecophysiology of bovine hindmilk.

This study focused        on the mapping of stripe rust resistance gene YR63 from a Portuguese hexaploid        wheat landrace AUS27955 of the Watkins Collection. RESULTS: YR63 exhibits        resistance to a broad spectrum of Pst races from Australia, Africa, Asia, Europe,        Middle East and South America. It was mapped to the short arm of chromosome 7B,        between two single nucleotide polymorphic (SNP) markers sunCS_YR63 and sunCS_67,        positioned at 0.8 and 3.7 Mb, respectively, in the Chinese Spring genome assembly        v2.1. We characterised YR63 locus using an integrated approach engaging targeted        genotyping-by-sequencing (tGBS), mutagenesis, resistance gene enrichment and        sequencing (MutRenSeq), RNA sequencing (RNASeq) and comparative genomic analysis        with tetraploid (Zavitan and Svevo) and hexaploid (Chinese Spring) wheat genome        references and 10+ hexaploid wheat genomes. YR63 is positioned at a hot spot        enriched with multiple nucleotide-binding and leucine rich repeat (NLR) and        kinase domain encoding genes, known widely for defence against pests and diseases        in plants and animals. Detection of YR63 within these gene clusters is not        possible through short-read sequencing due to high homology between members.        However, using the sequence of a NLR member we were successful in detecting a        closely linked SNP marker for YR63 and validated on a panel of Australian bread        wheat, durum and triticale cultivars. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights YR63 as        a valuable source for resistance against Pst in Australia and elsewhere.

We recently developed FRASER, a denoising        autoencoder-based method that outperformed alternative methods of detecting        aberrant splicing. However, because FRASER's three splice metrics are partially        redundant and tend to be sensitive to sequencing depth, we introduce here a more        robust intron-excision metric, the intron Jaccard index, that combines the        alternative donor, alternative acceptor, and intron-retention signal into a        single value. Moreover, we optimized model parameters and filter cutoffs by using        candidate rare-splice-disrupting variants as independent evidence. On 16,213 GTEx        samples, our improved algorithm, FRASER 2.0, called typically 10 times fewer        splicing outliers while increasing the proportion of candidate        rare-splice-disrupting variants by 10-fold and substantially decreasing the        effect of sequencing depth on the number of reported outliers. To lower the        multiple-testing correction burden, we introduce an option to select the genes to        be tested for each sample instead of a transcriptome-wide approach. This option        can be particularly useful when prior information, such as candidate variants or        genes, is available. Application on 303 rare-disease samples confirmed the        relative reduction in the number of outlier calls for a slight loss of        sensitivity; FRASER 2.0 recovered 22 out of 26 previously identified pathogenic        splicing cases with default cutoffs and 24 when multiple-testing correction was        limited to OMIM genes containing rare variants. Altogether, these methodological        improvements contribute to more effective RNA-seq-based rare diagnostics by        drastically reducing the amount of splicing outlier calls per sample at minimal        loss of sensitivity.",PMC10716352,American journal of human genetics,0370475

While third-generation sequencing by        Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) and Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) has overcome        the disadvantages of short read lengths specific to next-generation sequencing        (NGS), third-generation sequencers are known to produce more error-prone reads,        thereby generating a new set of challenges for assembly algorithms and pipelines.        However, the introduction of HiFi reads, which offer substantially reduced error        rates, has provided a promising solution for more accurate assembly outcomes.        Since the introduction of third-generation sequencing technologies, many tools        have been developed that aim to take advantage of the longer reads, and        researchers need to choose the correct assembler for their projects. RESULTS: We        benchmarked state-of-the-art long-read de novo assemblers to help readers make a        balanced choice for the assembly of eukaryotes. To this end, we used 12 real and        64 simulated datasets from different eukaryotic genomes, with different read        length distributions, imitating PacBio continuous long-read (CLR), PacBio        high-fidelity (HiFi), and ONT sequencing to evaluate the assemblers. We include 5        commonly used long-read assemblers in our benchmark: Canu, Flye, Miniasm, Raven,        and wtdbg2 for ONT and PacBio CLR reads. For PacBio HiFi reads , we include 5        state-of-the-art HiFi assemblers: HiCanu, Flye, Hifiasm, LJA, and MBG. Evaluation        categories address the following metrics: reference-based metrics, assembly        statistics, misassembly count, BUSCO completeness, runtime, and RAM usage.        Additionally, we investigated the effect of increased read length on the quality        of the assemblies and report that read length can, but does not always,        positively impact assembly quality. CONCLUSIONS: Our benchmark concludes that        there is no assembler that performs the best in all the evaluation categories.        However, our results show that overall Flye is the best-performing assembler for        PacBio CLR and ONT reads, both on real and simulated data. Meanwhile,        best-performing PacBio HiFi assemblers are Hifiasm and LJA. Next, the        benchmarking using longer reads shows that the increased read length improves        assembly quality, but the extent to which that can be achieved depends on the        size and complexity of the reference genome.",PMC10673639,GigaScience,101596872

RESULTS: Nanopore long-read sequencing showed that seven out of eight        patient samples displayed either integrated or episomal high-risk HPV sequences.        Out of these seven samples, four displayed verifiable integration events upon        bioinformatic analysis. Integration confirmation experiments were designed for        all four samples using PCR-based methods. Sanger sequencing was also performed.        Four distinct HPV integration patterns were identified: concatemer chromosomal        integration in a single chromosome, bi-chromosomal concatemer integration, single        chromosome complete integration and bi-chromosomal complete integration. HPV        concatemer integration also proved more common than full HPV integration events.        CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Long-read sequencing technologies can be effectively        used to assess HPV integration patterns in OPSCC tumors. Clinically, more        research should be conducted on the prognostication value of high-risk HPV        integration in OPSCC tumors using long-read sequencing technology.",PMC10616875,Frontiers in oncology,101568867

Yet this potential is not fully realized due to inherent limitations of        current long-read assembly methods and underdeveloped approaches to integrate        short-read data. Here, we critically compare the existing methods and develop a        new integrative approach to characterize a particularly challenging pool of        low-abundance long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) transcripts from short- and long-read        sequencing in two distinct cell lines. Our analysis reveals severe limitations in        each of the sequencing platforms. For short-read assemblies, coverage declines at        transcript termini resulting in ambiguous ends, and uneven low coverage results        in segmentation of a single transcript into multiple transcripts. Conversely,        long-read sequencing libraries lack depth and strand-of-origin information in        cDNA-based methods, culminating in erroneous assembly and quantitation of        transcripts. We also discover a cDNA synthesis artifact in long-read datasets        that markedly impacts the identity and quantitation of assembled transcripts.        Towards remediating these problems, we develop a computational pipeline to        ""strand"" long-read cDNA libraries that rectifies inaccurate mapping and assembly        of long-read transcripts. Leveraging the strengths of each platform and our        computational stranding, we also present and benchmark a hybrid assembly approach        that drastically increases the sensitivity and accuracy of full-length transcript        assembly on the correct strand and improves detection of biological features of        the transcriptome. When applied to a challenging set of under-annotated and        cell-type variable lncRNA, our method resolves the segmentation problem of        short-read sequencing and the depth problem of long-read sequencing, resulting in        the assembly of coherent transcripts with precise 5' and 3' ends.

A common approach to deal with this uncertainty is finding ""safe""        partial solutions (e.g. contigs) which are common to all solutions. Previous        research on safety has focused on polynomially time solvable problems, whereas        many successful and natural models are NP-hard to solve, leaving a lack of        ""safety tools"" for such problems. We propose the first method for computing all        safe solutions for an NP-hard problem, ""minimum flow decomposition"" (MFD). We        obtain our results by developing a ""safety test"" for paths based on a general        integer linear programming (ILP) formulation. Moreover, we provide        implementations with practical optimizations aimed to reduce the total ILP time,        the most efficient of these being based on a recursive group-testing procedure.        RESULTS: Experimental results on transcriptome datasets show that all safe paths        for MFDs correctly recover up to 90% of the full RNA transcripts, which is at        least 25% more than previously known safe paths. Moreover, despite the        NP-hardness of the problem, we can report all safe paths for 99.8% of the over        27 000 non-trivial graphs of this dataset in only 1.5 h.

Carrier screening is        essential to facilitate prenatal counseling and testing. However, when        individuals with elevated HbA2 do not have an identifiable HBB disease-associated        variant, there is ambiguity on risk to their offspring. METHODS: We describe a        case report of a proband with elevated HbA2, no identifiable HBB        disease-associated variant, whose partner was a beta thalassemia carrier. Through        clinical HBB gene sequencing, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification        (MLPA) analysis, as well as targeted Nanopore long read sequencing of selected        genes, we performed a complete analysis of HBB including the promoter region,        5'UTR and coding gene sequence, as well as evaluation for potential modifier        variants and other rare structural variants. RESULTS: This process identified        that the proband was heterozygous for KLF1:c.544T>C (p.Phe182Leu), a potential        functional polymorphism previously known to be associated with benign elevated        HbA2 levels. The presence of disease variants in the HBB locus was excluded.        CONCLUSION: This finding provided clarity and enabled family planning for the        proband and her family.",PMC10767580,Molecular genetics & genomic medicine,101603758

Analysis of the expression of virus        circRNAs showed that they had low expression levels in most cells or tissues and        showed strong expression heterogeneity. Analysis of the splicing of virus        circRNAs showed that they used a much higher proportion of non-canonical        back-splicing signals compared to those in animals and plants, and mainly used        the A5SS (alternative 5' splice site) in alternative-splicing.

37704952,A systematic comparison of human mitochondrial genome assembly tools.,10.1186/s12859-023-05445-3,"BACKGROUND: Mitochondria are the cell organelles that produce most of the        chemical energy required to power the cell's biochemical reactions. Despite being        a part of a eukaryotic host cell, the mitochondria contain a separate genome        whose origin is linked with the endosymbiosis of a prokaryotic cell by the host        cell and encode independent genomic information throughout their genomes.        Mitochondrial genomes accommodate essential genes and are regularly utilized in        biotechnology and phylogenetics. Various assemblers capable of generating        complete mitochondrial genomes are being continuously developed. These tools        often use whole-genome sequencing data as an input containing reads from the        mitochondrial genome. Till now, no published work has explored the systematic        comparison of all the available tools for assembling human mitochondrial genomes        using short-read sequencing data. This evaluation is required to identify the        best tool that can be well-optimized for small-scale projects or even        national-level research. RESULTS: In this study, we have tested the mitochondrial        genome assemblers for both simulated datasets and whole genome sequencing (WGS)        datasets of humans. For the highest computational setting of 16 computational        threads with the simulated dataset having 1000X read depth, MitoFlex took the        least execution time of 69 s, and IOGA took the longest execution time of 1278 s.        NOVOPlasty utilized the least computational memory of approximately 0.098 GB for        the same setting, whereas IOGA utilized the highest computational memory of        11.858 GB. In the case of WGS datasets for humans, GetOrganelle and MitoFlex        performed the best in capturing the SNPs information with a mean F1-score of        0.919 at the sequencing depth of 10X. MToolBox and NOVOPlasty performed        consistently across all sequencing depths with a mean F1 score of 0.897 and        0.890, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the overall performance metrics and        consistency in assembly quality for all sequencing data, MToolBox performed the        best. However, NOVOPlasty was the second fastest tool in execution time despite        being single-threaded, and it utilized the least computational resources among        all the assemblers when tested on simulated datasets. Therefore, NOVOPlasty may        be more practical when there is a significant sample size and a lack of        computational resources. Besides, as long-read sequencing gains popularity,        mitochondrial genome assemblers must be developed to use long-read sequencing        data.",PMC10498642,BMC bioinformatics,100965194

METHODS: Longitudinal specimens from 3        individuals during and following pregnancy (approximately 7 months between time        points) were also investigated. HBV RNA extracted from 16 serum samples obtained        from 13 patients (73.3% female, 84.6% Asian) was sequenced and serum HBV RNA        isoform detection and quantification were performed using three bioinformatic        workflows; FLAIR, RATTLE, and a GraphMap-based workflow within the Galaxy        application. A spike-in RNA variant (SIRV) control mix was used to assess run        quality and coverage. The proportionality of transcript isoforms was based on        total HBV reads determined by each workflow. RESULTS: All chosen isoform        detection workflows showed high agreement in transcript proportionality and        composition for most samples. HBV pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) was the most frequently        observed transcript isoform (93.8% of patient samples), while other detected        transcripts included pgRNA spliced variants, 3' truncated variants and HBx mRNA,        depending on the isoform detection method.

The annotations were benchmarked for structural traits and sequence        similarity. RESULTS: Benchmarks that reflect gene structures, reciprocal        similarity search alignments, and mono-exonic/multi-exonic gene counts provide a        more complete view of annotation accuracy. Transcripts derived from RNA-read        alignments alone are not sufficient for genome annotation. Gene prediction        workflows that combine evidence-based and ab initio approaches are recommended,        and a combination of short and long reads can improve genome annotation. Adding        protein evidence from de novo assemblies, genome-guided transcriptome assemblies,        or full-length proteins from OrthoDB generates more putative false positives as        implemented in the current workflows. Post-processing with functional and        structural filters is highly recommended. DISCUSSION: While the annotation of        non-model plant genomes remains complex, this study provides recommendations for        inputs and methodological approaches. We discuss a set of best practices to        generate an optimal plant genome annotation and present a more robust set of        metrics to evaluate the resulting predictions.",PMC10439824,Applications in plant sciences,101590473
37596530,"Comparing antimicrobial resistant genes and phenotypes across multiple sequencing        platforms and assays for Enterobacterales clinical isolates.",10.1186/s12866-023-02975-x,"INTRODUCTION: Whole genome sequencing (WGS) of bacterial isolates can be used to        identify antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes. Previous studies have shown that        genotype-based AMR has variable accuracy for predicting carbapenem resistance in        carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE); however, the majority of these        studies used short-read platforms (e.g. Illumina) to generate sequence data. In        this study, our objective was to determine whether Oxford Nanopore Technologies        (ONT) long-read WGS would improve detection of carbapenem AMR genes with respect        to short-read only WGS for nine clinical CRE samples. We measured the minimum        inhibitory breakpoint (MIC) using two phenotype assays (MicroScan and ETEST) for        six antibiotics, including two carbapenems (meropenem and ertapenem) and four        non-carbapenems (gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, cefepime, and        trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole). We generated short-read data using the Illumina        NextSeq and long-read data using the ONT MinION. Four assembly methods were        compared: ONT-only assembly; ONT-only assembly plus short-read polish;        ONT + short-read hybrid assembly plus short-read polish; short-read only        assembly. RESULTS: Consistent with previous studies, our results suggest that the        hybrid assembly produced the highest quality results as measured by gene        completeness and contig circularization. However, ONT-only methods had minimal        impact on the detection of AMR genes and plasmids compared to short-read methods,        although, notably, differences in gene copy number differed between methods. All        four assembly methods showed identical presence/absence of the blaKPC-2        carbapenemase gene for all samples. The two phenotype assays showed 100%        concordant results for the non-carbapenems, but only 65% concordance for the two        carbapenems. The presence/absence of AMR genes was 100% concordant with AMR        phenotypes for all four non-carbapenem drugs, although only 22%-50% sensitivity        for the carbapenems. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these findings suggest that the lack        of complete correspondence between CRE AMR genotype and phenotype for        carbapenems, while concerning, is independent of sequencing platform/assembly        method.",PMC10436404,BMC microbiology,100966981

Based on 24 phenotypic traits of 271        representative cultivars, the transcript profiles of 119 cultivars were obtained,        which indicated abundant genetic variation in tree peony. In total, 86        GWAS-related cis-eQTLs and 3188 trans-eQTL gene pairs were found to be associated        with the numbers of petals, stamens, and carpels.

Although inbred strains are        typically better suited for such studies due to minimal genetic variability,        outbred stocks confer practical advantages over inbred strains, such as improved        breeding performance and low cost. Knowledge of the full genetic variability of        CD-1 would make it more useful in toxicology, pharmacology, and fundamental        biomedical research. RESULTS: We performed deep genomic DNA sequencing of CD-1        mice and used the data to identify genome-wide SNPs, indels, and germline        transposable elements relative to the mm10 reference genome. We used multiple        genome-wide sequencing data types and previously published CD-1 SNPs to validate        our called variants. We used the called variants to construct a strain-specific        CD-1 reference genome, which we show can improve mappability and reduce        experimental biases from genome-wide sequencing data derived from CD-1 mice.        Based on previously published ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq data, we find evidence that        genetic variation between CD-1 mice can lead to alterations in transcription        factor binding. We also identified a number of variants in the coding region of        genes which could have effects on translation of genes.

The        latter include point pathogenic variants and large-scale        deletions/rearrangements. MtDNA molecules with the wild type or a variant        sequence can exist together in a single cell, a condition known as mtDNA        heteroplasmy. MtDNA single point mutations are typically detected by means of        Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) based on short reads which, however, are limited        for the identification of structural mtDNA alterations. Recently, new NGS        technologies based on long reads have been released, allowing to obtain sequences        of several kilobases in length; this approach is suitable for detection of        structural alterations affecting the mitochondrial genome. In the present work we        illustrate the optimization of two sequencing protocols based on long-read Oxford        Nanopore Technology to detect mtDNA structural alterations.

Here, we        describe the genomic characteristics of Trypoxylus dichotomus nudivirus (TdNV),        which represents a new Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus (OrNV) strain, isolated from        infected T. dichotomus in the Republic of Korea. We examined factors derived by        the cross-species infection of OrNV from nucleotide levels to the whole genome        level. Our genomic analysis study suggests that TdNV-Korea is highly conserved        with other OrNVs in terms of genomic structures and genome size. Our        investigation of the genomic structure revealed that TdNV-Korea has the least        number of open reading frames (ORFs) of all available OrNV genomes; three        hypothetical genes were notably absent only in TdNV-Korea. In addition, the        genomic alteration of the nudivirus core genes discloses that various amino acid        mutations caused by single-nucleotide polymorphism and short indels        (insertion/deletion) were found in most of the nudivirus core genes of        TdNV-Korea.

In the context of airway viral infection,        BRD4-specific inhibitors (BRD4i) block the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines        and prevent downstream epithelial plasticity. Although the chromatin modifying        functions of BRD4 in inducible gene expression have been extensively        investigated, its roles in post-transcriptional regulation are not well        understood. Given BRD4's interaction with the transcriptional elongation complex        and spliceosome, we hypothesize that BRD4 is a functional regulator of mRNA        processing. METHODS: To address this question, we combine data-independent        analysis - parallel accumulation-serial fragmentation (diaPASEF) with        RNA-sequencing to achieve deep and integrated coverage of the proteomic and        transcriptomic landscapes of human small airway epithelial cells exposed to viral        challenge and treated with BRD4i. RESULTS: We discover that BRD4 regulates        alternative splicing of key genes, including Interferon-related Developmental        Regulator 1 (IFRD1) and X-Box Binding Protein 1 (XBP1), related to the innate        immune response and the unfolded protein response (UPR). We identify requirement        of BRD4 for expression of serine-arginine splicing factors, splicosome components        and the Inositol-Requiring Enzyme 1 IREα affecting immediate early innate        response and the UPR.

One such region is the highly polymorphic CYP2D loci,        containing CYP2D6, a clinically relevant pharmacogene contributing to the        metabolism of >20% of common drugs, and two highly similar pseudogenes, CYP2D7        and CYP2D8. Multiple complex SVs, including CYP2D6/CYP2D7-derived hybrid genes        are known to occur in different configurations and frequencies across populations        and are difficult to detect and characterize accurately. This can lead to        incorrect enzyme activity assignment and impact drug dosing recommendations,        often disproportionally affecting underrepresented populations. To improve CYP2D6        genotyping accuracy, we developed a PCR-free CRISPR-Cas9 based enrichment method        for targeted long-read sequencing that fully characterizes the entire        CYP2D6-CYP2D7-CYP2D8 loci.

Twenty DNA samples were        genotyped for HLA-A, -B, and -C; 11 samples were from individuals of different        ethnicity and nine were from Thai individuals. Two primer sets, a commercial set        and a published set, were used to amplify the HLA-A, -B, and -C genes. HLA-typing        tools that used different algorithms were applied and compared.

Flex-sweep detects        sweeps up to 0.125*4Ne generations old, including those that are weak, soft,        and/or incomplete; it can also detect strong, complete sweeps up to 0.25*4Ne        generations old. We apply Flex-sweep to the 1000 Genomes Yoruba data set and, in        addition to recovering previously identified sweeps, show that sweeps        disproportionately occur within genic regions and are close to regulatory        regions. In addition, we show that virus-interacting proteins (VIPs) are strongly        enriched for selective sweeps, recapitulating previous results that demonstrate        the importance of viruses as a driver of adaptive evolution in humans.",PMC10287538,Molecular biology and evolution,8501455

Long-read sequencing platforms offer the opportunity to make        definitive molecular diagnoses using a single assay capable of detecting        variants, characterizing methylation patterns, resolving complex rearrangements,        and assigning findings to long-range haplotypes. Here, we demonstrate the        clinical utility of Nanopore long-read sequencing by validating a confirmatory        test for copy number variants (CNVs) in neurodevelopmental disorders and        illustrate the broader applications of this platform to assess genomic features        with significant clinical implications. METHODS: We used adaptive sampling on the        Oxford Nanopore platform to sequence 25 genomic DNA samples and 5 blood samples        collected from patients with known or false-positive copy number changes        originally detected using short-read sequencing. Across the 30 samples (a total        of 50 with replicates), we assayed 35 known unique CNVs (a total of 55 with        replicates) and one false-positive CNV, ranging in size from 40 kb to 155 Mb, and        assessed the presence or absence of suspected CNVs using normalized read depth.        RESULTS: Across 50 samples (including replicates) sequenced on individual MinION        flow cells, we achieved an average on-target mean depth of 9.5X and an average        on-target read length of 4805 bp. Using a custom read depth-based analysis, we        successfully confirmed the presence of all 55 known CNVs (including replicates)        and the absence of one false-positive CNV. Using the same CNV-targeted data, we        compared genotypes of single nucleotide variant loci to verify that no sample        mix-ups occurred between assays. For one case, we also used methylation detection        and phasing to investigate the parental origin of a 15q11.2-q13 duplication with        implications for clinical prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: We present an assay that        efficiently targets genomic regions to confirm clinically relevant CNVs with a        concordance rate of 100%. Furthermore, we demonstrate how integration of        genotype, methylation, and phasing data from the Nanopore sequencing platform can        potentially simplify and shorten the diagnostic odyssey.",PMC10257846,Journal of translational medicine,101190741

We used long-read PacBio single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing        technology to sequence whole genomes and targeted regions for haplotyping. We        identified 17 co-infections with SARS-CoV-2 strains belonging to different clades        in 6829 samples sequenced between January and October, 2022 (prevalence 0.25%).        There were 3 Delta/Omicron co-infections and 14 Omicron/Omicron co-infections (4        cases of 21K/21L, 1 case of 21L/22A, 2 cases of 21L/22B, 4 cases of 22A/22B, 2        cases of 22B/22C and 1 case of 22B/22E).

Moreover, we optimized        model parameters and filter cutoffs using candidate rare splice-disrupting        variants as independent evidence. On 16,213 GTEx samples, our improved algorithm        called typically 10 times fewer splicing outliers while increasing the proportion        of candidate rare splice-disrupting variants by 10 fold and substantially        decreasing the effect of sequencing depth on the number of reported outliers.        Application on 303 rare disease samples confirmed the reduction fold-change of        the number of outlier calls for a slight loss of sensitivity (only 2 out of 22        previously identified pathogenic splicing cases not recovered).

These two strains shared true-positive genetic variants that        were introduced during strain generation. In addition, both strains contained        common and distinguishable variants induced by DNA damage, possibly leading to        false-positive estimation. We obtained accurate and noisy long reads from both        strains using high-fidelity (HiFi) and continuous long-read (CLR) sequencing        platforms, and compared the variant calling performance of the two platforms.        HiFi identified a 1.65-fold higher number of true-positive variants on average,        with 60% fewer false-positive variants, than CLR did. We also compared read-based        and assembly-based variant calling methods in combination with subsampling of        various sequencing depths and demonstrated that variant calling after genome        assembly was particularly effective for detection of large insertions, even with        10 × sequencing depth of accurate long-read sequencing data.

36927511,"Highly accurate long reads are crucial for realizing the potential of        biodiversity genomics.",10.1186/s12864-023-09193-9,"BACKGROUND: Generating the most contiguous, accurate genome assemblies given        available sequencing technologies is a long-standing challenge in genome science.        With the rise of long-read sequencing, assembly challenges have shifted from        merely increasing contiguity to correctly assembling complex, repetitive regions        of interest, ideally in a phased manner. At present, researchers largely choose        between two types of long read data: longer, but less accurate sequences, or        highly accurate, but shorter reads (i.e., >Q20 or 99% accurate). To better        understand how these types of long-read data as well as scale of data (i.e., mean        length and sequencing depth) influence genome assembly outcomes, we compared        genome assemblies for a caddisfly, Hesperophylax magnus, generated with longer,        but less accurate, Oxford Nanopore (ONT) R9.4.1 and highly accurate PacBio HiFi        (HiFi) data. Next, we expanded this comparison to consider the influence of        highly accurate long-read sequence data on genome assemblies across 6750 plant        and animal genomes. For this broader comparison, we used HiFi data as a surrogate        for highly accurate long-reads broadly as we could identify when they were used        from GenBank metadata. RESULTS: HiFi reads outperformed ONT reads in all assembly        metrics tested for the caddisfly data set and allowed for accurate assembly of        the repetitive ~ 20 Kb H-fibroin gene. Across plants and animals, genome        assemblies that incorporated HiFi reads were also more contiguous. For plants,        the average HiFi assembly was 501% more contiguous (mean contig N50 = 20.5 Mb)        than those generated with any other long-read data (mean contig N50 = 4.1 Mb).        For animals, HiFi assemblies were 226% more contiguous (mean contig        N50 = 20.9 Mb) versus other long-read assemblies (mean contig N50 = 9.3 Mb). In        plants, we also found limited evidence that HiFi may offer a unique solution for        overcoming genomic complexity that scales with assembly size. CONCLUSIONS: Highly        accurate long-reads generated with HiFi or analogous technologies represent a key        tool for maximizing genome assembly quality for a wide swath of plants and        animals. This finding is particularly important when resources only allow for one        type of sequencing data to be generated. Ultimately, to realize the promise of        biodiversity genomics, we call for greater uptake of highly accurate long-reads        in future studies.",PMC10018877,BMC genomics,100965258

However, no consensus        exists regarding the optimal diagnostic care pathway to adopt after negative        results with standard approaches. Methods: In 15 unsolved individuals clinically        diagnosed with recognizable OMIM diseases but with negative or inconclusive        first-line genetic results, we explored the utility of a multi-step approach        using several novel omics technologies to establish a molecular diagnosis.        Inclusion criteria included a clinical autosomal recessive disease diagnosis and        single heterozygous pathogenic variant in the gene of interest identified by        first-line analysis (60%-9/15) or a clinical diagnosis of an X-linked recessive        or autosomal dominant disease with no causative variant identified (40%-6/15). We        performed a multi-step analysis involving short-read genome sequencing (srGS) and        complementary approaches such as mRNA sequencing (mRNA-seq), long-read genome        sequencing (lrG), or optical genome mapping (oGM) selected according to the        outcome of the GS analysis. Results: SrGS alone or in combination with additional        genomic and/or transcriptomic technologies allowed us to resolve 87% of        individuals by identifying single nucleotide variants/indels missed by first-line        targeted tests, identifying variants affecting transcription, or structural        variants sometimes requiring lrGS or oGM for their characterization.

36879189,INSnet: a method for detecting insertions based on deep learning network.,10.1186/s12859-023-05216-0,"BACKGROUND: Many studies have shown that structural variations (SVs) strongly        impact human disease. As a common type of SV, insertions are usually associated        with genetic diseases. Therefore, accurately detecting insertions is of great        significance. Although many methods for detecting insertions have been proposed,        these methods often generate some errors and miss some variants. Hence,        accurately detecting insertions remains a challenging task. RESULTS: In this        paper, we propose a method named INSnet to detect insertions using a deep        learning network. First, INSnet divides the reference genome into continuous        sub-regions and takes five features for each locus through alignments between        long reads and the reference genome. Next, INSnet uses a depthwise separable        convolutional network. The convolution operation extracts informative features        through spatial information and channel information. INSnet uses two attention        mechanisms, the convolutional block attention module (CBAM) and efficient channel        attention (ECA) to extract key alignment features in each sub-region. In order to        capture the relationship between adjacent subregions, INSnet uses a gated        recurrent unit (GRU) network to further extract more important SV signatures.        After predicting whether a sub-region contains an insertion through the previous        steps, INSnet determines the precise site and length of the insertion. The source        code is available from GitHub at https://github.com/eioyuou/INSnet . CONCLUSION:        Experimental results show that INSnet can achieve better performance than other        methods in terms of F1 score on real datasets.",PMC9990265,BMC bioinformatics,100965194

The        HERV-K (HML-2) subgroup is the youngest HERV clade with the highest degree of        coding competence. Its expression is associated with inflammation-related        diseases. However, the precise HML-2 loci, stimuli, and signaling pathways        involved in these associations are not well understood or defined. To elucidate        HML-2 expression on a locus-specific level, we used the retroelement sequencing        tools TEcount and Telescope to analyze publicly available transcriptome        sequencing (RNA-seq) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) sequencing data        sets of macrophages treated with a wide range of agonists. We found that        macrophage polarization significantly correlates with modulation of the        expression of specific HML-2 proviral loci. Further analysis demonstrated that        the provirus HERV-K102, located in an intergenic region of locus 1q22,        constituted the majority of the HML-2 derived transcripts following        pro-inflammatory (M1) polarization and was upregulated explicitly in response to        interferon gamma (IFN-γ) signaling. We found that signal transducer and activator        of transcription 1 and interferon regulatory factor 1 interact with a solo long        terminal repeat (LTR) located upstream of HERV-K102, termed LTR12F, following        IFN-γ signaling. Using reporter constructs, we demonstrated that LTR12F is        critical for HERV-K102 upregulation by IFN-γ. In THP1-derived macrophages,        knockdown of HML-2 or knockout of MAVS, an adaptor of RNA-sensing pathways,        significantly downregulated genes containing interferon-stimulated response        elements (ISREs) in their promoters, suggesting an intermediate role of HERV-K102        in the switch from IFN-γ signaling to the activation of type I interferon        expression and, therefore, in a positive feedback loop to enhance        pro-inflammatory signaling. IMPORTANCE The human endogenous retrovirus group K        subgroup, HML-2, is known to be elevated in a long list of        inflammation-associated diseases. However, a clear mechanism for HML-2        upregulation in response to inflammation has not been defined. In this study, we        identify a provirus of the HML-2 subgroup, HERV-K102, which is significantly        upregulated and constitutes the majority of the HML-2 derived transcripts in        response to pro-inflammatory activation of macrophages. Moreover, we identify the        mechanism of HERV-K102 upregulation and demonstrate that HML-2 expression        enhances interferon-stimulated response element activation. We also demonstrate        that this provirus is elevated in vivo and correlates with interferon gamma        signaling activity in cutaneous leishmaniasis patients. This study provides key        insights into the HML-2 subgroup and suggests that it may participate in        enhancing pro-inflammatory signaling in macrophages and probably other immune        cells.",PMC10100713,Microbiology spectrum,101634614

The        mycobiome (fungal microbiome) is considered part of the rare biosphere but is        still a critical component in health. Next generation sequencing has improved our        understanding of fungi in the gut, but methodological challenges remain. Biases        are introduced during DNA isolation, primer design and choice, polymerase        selection, sequencing platform selection, and data analyses, as fungal reference        databases are often incomplete or contain erroneous sequences. METHODS: Here, we        compared the accuracy of taxonomic identifications and abundances from mycobiome        analyses which vary among three commonly selected target gene regions (18S, ITS1,        or ITS2) and the reference database (UNITE - ITS1, ITS2 and SILVA - 18S). We        analyze multiple communities including individual fungal isolates, a mixed mock        community created from five common fungal isolates found in weanling piglet        feces, a purchased commercial fungal mock community, and piglet fecal samples. In        addition, we calculated gene copy numbers for the 18S, ITS1, and ITS2 regions of        each of the five isolates from the piglet fecal mock community to determine        whether copy number affects abundance estimates. Finally, we determined the        abundance of taxa from several iterations of our in-house fecal community to        assess the effects of community composition on taxon abundance. RESULTS: Overall,        no marker-database combination consistently outperformed the others. Internal        transcribed space markers were slightly superior to 18S in the identification of        species in tested communities, but Lichtheimia corymbifera, a common member of        piglet gut communities, was not amplified by ITS1 and ITS2 primers. Thus, ITS        based abundance estimates of taxa in piglet mock communities were skewed while        18S marker profiles were more accurate. Kazachstania slooffiae displayed the most        stable copy numbers (83-85) while L. corymbifera displayed significant        variability (90-144) across gene regions.

Plasmid-mediated        colistin resistance, in particular the mcr-1 gene, has been identified and WGS is        the go-to method in identifying plasmids carrying mcr-1 genes. The goal of this        study is to demonstrate the use of optical DNA mapping (ODM), a fast, efficient        and amplification-free technique, to characterize plasmids carrying mcr-1.        METHODS: ODM is a single-molecule technique, which we have demonstrated can be        used for identifying plasmids harbouring antibiotic resistance genes. We here        applied the technique to plasmids isolated from 12 clinical Enterobacterales        isolates from patients at a major hospital in Thailand and verified our results        using Nanopore long-read sequencing.

NanoSTR showed 100% concordance with the expected        genotypes using error-free simulated data, and also achieved >85% concordance        using the standard samples (containing autosomal and Y-chromosomal loci) with        MinION sequencing platform, respectively. NanoSTR showed high performance for        detection of target STR markers. Although NanoSTR needs further optimization and        development, it is useful as an analytical method for the detection of STR loci        by nanopore sequencing. This method adds to the toolbox for nanopore-based STR        analysis and expands the applications of nanopore sequencing in scientific        research and clinical scenarios.

Sequencing approaches that rely on HMW DNA have been limited        to larger organisms or pools of multiple individuals, but recent advances have        allowed for sequencing from individuals of small-bodied organisms. Here, we use        HMW DNA sequencing with PacBio long reads and TELL-Seq linked reads to assemble        and annotate the genome from a single individual feather louse (Brueelia        nebulosa) from a European Starling (Sturnus vulgaris). We assembled a genome with        a relatively high scaffold N50 (637 kb) and with BUSCO scores (96.1%) comparable        to louse genomes assembled from pooled individuals. We annotated a number of        genes (10,938) similar to the human louse (Pediculus humanus) genome.        Additionally, calling phased variants revealed that the Brueelia genome is more        heterozygous (∼1%) then expected for a highly obligate and dispersal-limited        parasite. We also assembled and annotated the mitochondrial genome and primary        endosymbiont (Sodalis) genome from the individual louse, which showed evidence        for heteroplasmy in the mitogenome and a reduced genome size in the endosymbiont        compared to its free-living relative. Our study is a valuable demonstration of        the capability to obtain high-quality genomes from individual small, nonmodel        organisms.

In the case of crop species, previous        research aimed to elucidate the changing patterns of repetitive sequences,        single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and small InDels during domestication to        explain morphological evolution and adaptation to different environments.        Additionally, structural variations (SVs) encompassing larger stretches of DNA        are more likely to alter gene expression levels leading to phenotypic variation        affecting plant phenotypes and stress resistance. Previous studies on SVs in rice        were hampered by reliance on short-read sequencing limiting the quantity and        quality of SV identification, while SV data are currently only available for        cultivated rice, with wild rice largely uncharacterized. Here, we generated two        genome assemblies for O. rufipogon using long-read sequencing and provide        insights on the evolutionary pattern and effect of SVs on morphological traits        during rice domestication. RESULTS: In this study, we identified 318,589 SVs in        cultivated and wild rice populations through a comprehensive analysis of 13        high-quality rice genomes and found that wild rice genomes contain 49% of unique        SVs and an average of 1.76% of genes were lost during rice domestication. These        SVs were further genotyped for 649 rice accessions, their evolutionary pattern        during rice domestication and potential association with the diversity of        important agronomic traits were examined. Genome-wide association studies between        these SVs and nine agronomic traits identified 413 candidate causal variants,        which together affect 361 genes. An 824-bp deletion in japonica rice, which        encodes a serine carboxypeptidase family protein, is shown to be associated with        grain length. CONCLUSIONS: We provide relatively accurate and complete SV        datasets for cultivated and wild rice accessions, especially in TE-rich regions,        by comparing long-read sequencing data for 13 representative varieties.

The        long-range information in the multi-end reads is beneficial in phasing        complicated spliced isoforms, but assembly algorithms that leverage such        information are lacking. Here we introduce Scallop2, a reference-based assembler        optimized for multi-end RNA-seq data. The algorithmic core of Scallop2 consists        of three steps: (1) using an algorithm to ""bridge"" multi-end reads into        single-end phasing paths in the context of a splice graph, (2) employing a method        to refine erroneous splice graphs by utilizing multi-end reads that fail to        bridge, and (3) piping the refined splice graph and the bridged phasing paths        into an algorithm that integrates multiple phase-preserving decompositions.        Tested on 561 cells in two Smart-seq3 datasets and on 10 Illumina paired-end        RNA-seq samples, Scallop2 substantially improves the assembly accuracy compared        to two popular assemblers StringTie2 and Scallop.",PMC9879047,Nature computational science,101775476

In airway viral infection, non-toxic BRD4-specific inhibitors        (BRD4i) block the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and prevent downstream        remodeling. Although the chromatin modifying functions of BRD4 in inducible gene        expression have been extensively investigated, its roles in post-transcriptional        regulation are not as well understood. Based on its interaction with the        transcriptional elongation complex and spliceosome, we hypothesize that BRD4 is a        functional regulator of mRNA processing. To address this question, we combine        data-independent analysis - parallel accumulation-serial fragmentation (diaPASEF)        with RNA-sequencing to achieve deep and integrated coverage of the proteomic and        transcriptomic landscapes of human small airway epithelial cells exposed to viral        challenge and treated with BRD4i. The transcript-level data was further        interrogated for alternative splicing analysis, and the resulting data sets were        correlated to identify pathways subject to post-transcriptional regulation. We        discover that BRD4 regulates alternative splicing of key genes, including        Interferon-related Developmental Regulator 1 ( IFRD1 ) and X-Box Binding Protein        1 ( XBP1 ), related to the innate immune response and the unfolded protein        response, respectively.

In particular, P. yoelii is an especially good model for investigating        the mosquito and liver stages of parasite development because key attributes        closely resemble those of P. falciparum . Because of its importance to malaria        research, in 2002 the 17XNL strain of P. yoelii was the first rodent malaria        parasite to be sequenced. While sequencing and assembling this genome was a        breakthrough effort, the final assembly consisted of >5000 contiguous sequences        that impacted the creation of annotated gene models. While other important rodent        malaria parasite genomes have been sequenced and annotated since then, including        the related P. yoelii 17X strain, the 17XNL strain has not.

Loss-of-function mutations in        the FLG exon 3 have been associated with skin diseases. The identification of        causative mutations is challenging, due to the high sequence homology within its        exon 3 (12,753 bp), which includes 10 to 12 filaggrin tandem repeats. With this        study we aimed to obtain the whole FLG exon 3 sequence through PacBio technology,        once 13-kb amplicons have been generated. METHODS AND RESULTS: For the        preparation of SMRTbell libraries to be sequenced using PacBio technology, we        focused on optimizing a 2-step long-range PCR protocol to generate 13-kb        amplicons covering the whole FLG exon 3 sequence. The performance of three        long-range DNA polymerases was assessed in an attempt to improve the PCR        conditions required for the enzymes to function properly. We focused on        optimization of the input template DNA concentration and thermocycling parameters        to correctly amplify the entire FLG exon 3 sequence, minimizing non-specific        amplification.

Accurate genome assembly is crucial to understanding chromosome        evolution of species, such as dikaryotic fungi. Rust fungi (Pucciniales) in        dikaryons represent the largest group of plant pathogens, but the evolutionary        process of adaptive radiation in Pucciniales remains poorly understood. Here, we        report a gapless genome for the wheat leaf rust fungus Puccinia triticina        determined using PacBio high-fidelity (HiFi) sequencing. This gapless assembly        contains two sets of chromosomes, showing that one contig represents one        chromosome. Comparisons of homologous chromosomes between the phased haplotypes        revealed that highly frequent small-scale sequence divergence shapes haplotypic        variation. Genome analyses of Puccinia triticina along with other rusts revealed        that recent transposable element bursts and extensive segmental gene duplications        synergistically highlight the evolution of chromosome structures. Comparative        analysis of chromosomes indicated that frequent chromosomal rearrangements may        act as a major contributor to rapid radiation of Pucciniales. This study presents        the first gapless, phased assembly for a dikaryotic rust fungus and provides        insights into adaptive evolution and species radiation in Pucciniales.

Chromosome evolution        plays an important role in adaptive evolution. Accurate chromosome-scale assembly        is required to understand the role of chromosome evolution in Pucciniales. We        took advantage of HiFi sequencing to construct a gapless, phased genome for        Puccinia triticina. Further analyses revealed that the evolution of chromosome        structures in rust lineage is shaped by the combination of transposable element        bursts and segmental gene duplications. Chromosome comparisons of Puccinia        triticina and other rusts suggested that frequent chromosomal arrangements may        make remarkable contributions to high species diversity of rust fungi.

While many of the variants are        neutral, some can lead to higher transmissibility or virulence. Accurate assembly        of complete viral genomes enables the identification of underlying variants,        which are essential for studying virus evolution and elucidating the relationship        between genotypes and virus properties. Recently, third-generation sequencing        platforms such as Nanopore sequencers have been used for real-time virus        sequencing for Ebola, Zika, coronavirus disease 2019, etc. However, their high        per-base error rate prevents the accurate reconstruction of the viral genome.        RESULTS: In this work, we introduce a new tool, AccuVIR, for viral genome        assembly and polishing using error-prone long reads. It can better distinguish        sequencing errors from true variants based on the key observation that sequencing        errors can disrupt the gene structures of viruses, which usually have a high        density of coding regions. Our experimental results on both simulated and real        third-generation sequencing data demonstrated its superior performance on        generating more accurate viral genomes than generic assembly or polish tools.        AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The source code and the documentation of AccuVIR        are available at https://github.com/rainyrubyzhou/AccuVIR.

Male reproductive tissues, such as        accessory glands (AGs), are hotspots for recruitment of novel genes that diverge        rapidly even among closely related species/populations. These genes synthesize        seminal fluid proteins that often affect post-copulatory sexual selection-they        can mediate male-male sperm competition, ejaculate-female interactions that        modify female remating and even influence reproductive incompatibilities among        diverging species/populations. Although de novo transcriptomics has facilitated        gene discovery in non-model organisms, reproductive gene discovery is still        challenging without a reference database as they are often novel and bear no        homology to known proteins. Here, we use reference-free GridION long-read        transcriptomics, from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), to discover novel AG        genes and characterize their expression in the widespread dung fly, Sepsis        punctum. Despite stark population differences in male reproductive traits (e.g.:        Body size, testes size, and sperm length) as well as female re-mating, the male        AG genes and their secretions of S. punctum are still unknown. We implement a de        novo ONT transcriptome pipeline incorporating quality-filtering and rigorous        error-correction procedures, and we evaluate gene sequence and gene expression        results against high-quality Illumina short-read data. We discover        highly-expressed reproductive genes in AG transcriptomes of S. punctum consisting        of 40 high-quality and high-confidence ONT genes that cross-verify against        Illumina genes, among which 26 are novel and specific to S. punctum. Novel genes        account for an average of 81% of total gene expression and may be functionally        relevant in seminal fluid protein production. For instance, 80% of genes encoding        secretory proteins account for 74% total gene expression. In addition, median        sequence similarities of ONT nucleotide and protein sequences match        within-Illumina sequence similarities. Read-count based expression quantification        in ONT is congruent with Illumina's Transcript per Million (TPM), both in overall        pattern and within functional categories. Rapid genomic innovation followed by        recruitment of de novo genes for high expression in S. punctum AG tissue, a        pattern observed in other insects, could be a likely mechanism of evolution of        these genes. The study also demonstrates the feasibility of adapting ONT        transcriptomics for gene discovery in non-model systems.",PMC9768217,Frontiers in genetics,101560621

In more recent years, the impact of epigenetic influences,        such as DNA methylation, is becoming more appreciated. Aberrant DNA methylation        has been implicated in many types of cancers, influencing cell type, state,        transcriptional regulation, and genomic stability to name a few. Traditionally,        large populations of cells from the tissue of interest are coalesced for        analysis, producing averaged methylome data. Considering the inherent        heterogeneity of cancer, analysing populations of cells as a whole denies the        ability to discover novel aberrant methylation patterns, identify subpopulations,        and trace cell lineages.

A yaws        eradication campaign on Lihir Island in Papua New Guinea utilizing mass drug        administration (MDA) of azithromycin initially reduced but failed to eradicate        yaws; IU rates remained constant throughout the study. Using 16S rRNA gene        sequencing, we previously determined that Streptococcus pyogenes was associated        with some cases of IU. Here, we applied shotgun metagenomics to the same samples        we analyzed previously by 16S rRNA sequencing to verify this result, identify        additional IU-associated microorganisms, and determine why S. pyogenes-associated        IU might have persisted after MDA of azithromycin. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL        FINDINGS: We sequenced DNA extracted from 244 CU specimens separated into four        groups based upon microorganism-specific PCR results (HD+, TP+, TP+HD+, and        TP-HD- or IU). S. pyogenes was enriched in IU (24.71% relative abundance [RA])        specimens compared to other ulcer sub-groups, confirming our prior results. We        bioinformatically identified the emm (M protein gene) types found in the S.        pyogenes IU specimens and found matches to emm156 and emm166. Only ~39% of IU        specimens contained detectable S. pyogenes, suggesting that additional organisms        could be associated with IU. In the sub-set of S. pyogenes-negative IU specimens,        Criibacterium bergeronii, a member of the Peptostreptococcaceae, and        Fusobacterium necrophorum (7.07% versus 0.00% RA and 2.18% versus 0.00% RA,        respectively), were enriched compared to the S. pyogenes-positive sub-set.        Although a broad range of viruses were detected in the CU specimens, none were        specifically associated with IU. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our observations        confirm the association of S. pyogenes with IU in yaws-endemic areas, and suggest        that additional anaerobic bacteria, but not other microorganisms, may be        associated with this syndrome.

Long-read portable sequencers have significant        potential advantages over established short-read sequencers due to portability,        speed, and lower cost. The applicability of short reads random sequencing for        direct detection of pathogens in clinical poultry samples has been previously        demonstrated. Here we demonstrate the feasibility of long read random sequencing        approaches to identify disease agents in clinical samples. Experimental        oropharyngeal swab samples (n = 12) from chickens infected with infectious        bronchitis virus (IBV), avian influenza virus (AIV) and Mycoplasma synoviae (MS)        and field-collected clinical oropharyngeal swab samples (n = 11) from Kenyan live        bird markets previously testing positive for Newcastle disease virus (NDV) were        randomly sequenced on the MinION platform and results validated by comparing to        real time PCR and short read random sequencing in the Illumina MiSeq platform. In        the swabs from experimental infections, each of three agents in every        RT-qPCR-positive sample (Ct range 19-34) was detectable within 1 h on the MinION        platform, except for AIV one agent in one sample (Ct = 36.21).

A key step        post-sequencing is basecalling, the process of converting raw electrical signals        produced by the sequencing device into nucleotide sequences. This is challenging        as current basecallers are primarily based on mixtures of model species for        training. Here we utilise both ONT PromethION and higher accuracy PacBio Sequel        II HiFi sequencing on two plants, Phebalium stellatum and Xanthorrhoea johnsonii,        to train species-specific basecaller models with the aim of improving per-base        accuracy. We investigate sequencing accuracies achieved by ONT basecallers and        assess accuracy gains by training single-species and species-specific basecaller        models. We also evaluate accuracy gains from ONT's improved flowcells (R10.4,        FLO-PRO112) and sequencing kits (SQK-LSK112). For the truth dataset for both        model training and accuracy assessment, we developed highly accurate, contiguous        diploid reference genomes with PacBio Sequel II HiFi reads. RESULTS: Basecalling        with ONT Guppy 5 and 6 super-accurate gave almost identical results, attaining        read accuracies of 91.96% and 94.15%. Guppy's plant-specific model gave highly        mixed results, attaining read accuracies of 91.47% and 96.18%. Species-specific        basecalling models improved read accuracy, attaining 93.24% and 95.16% read        accuracies. R10.4 sequencing kits also improve sequencing accuracy, attaining        read accuracies of 95.46% (super-accurate) and 96.87% (species-specific).        CONCLUSIONS: The use of a single mixed-species basecaller model, such as ONT        Guppy super-accurate, may be reducing the accuracy of nanopore sequencing, due to        conflicting genome biology within the training dataset and study species.        Training of single-species and genome-specific basecaller models improves read        accuracy.

In addition, cancer-specific AS is potentially an        effective target of personalized cancer therapeutics. However, detecting AS        events remains a challenging task, especially if these AS events are novel. This        is exacerbated by the fact that existing transcriptome annotation databases are        far from being comprehensive, especially with regard to cancer-specific AS.        Additionally, traditional sequencing technologies are severely limited by the        short length of the generated reads, which rarely spans more than a single splice        junction site. Given these challenges, transcriptomic long-read (LR) sequencing        presents a promising potential for the detection and discovery of AS. We present        Freddie, a computational annotation-independent isoform discovery and detection        tool. Freddie takes as input transcriptomic LR sequencing of a sample alongside        its genomic split alignment and computes a set of isoforms for the given sample.        It then partitions the input reads into sets that can be processed independently        and in parallel. For each partition, Freddie segments the genomic alignment of        the reads into canonical exon segments. The goal of this segmentation is to be        able to represent any potential isoform as a subset of these canonical exons.        This segmentation is formulated as an optimization problem and is solved with a        dynamic programming algorithm. Then, Freddie reconstructs the isoforms by jointly        clustering and error-correcting the reads using the canonical segmentation as a        succinct representation. The clustering and error-correcting step is formulated        as an optimization problem-the Minimum Error Clustering into Isoforms (MErCi)        problem-and is solved using integer linear programming (ILP). We compare the        performance of Freddie on simulated datasets with other isoform detection tools        with varying dependence on annotation databases.

We also run Freddie on a transcriptomic LR dataset generated in-house        from a prostate cancer cell line with a matched short-read RNA-seq dataset.        Freddie results in isoforms with a higher short-read cross-validation rate than        the other tested tools.

We demonstrated the efficiency of this approach by correctly        assembling and annotating all exons from the chicken SCO-spondin gene (containing        more than 105 exons), including the identification of missing genes in the        chicken reference annotations by homology assignments. CONCLUSIONS: Our method        helps to improve the current transcriptome annotation of the chicken brain. Our        pipeline, implemented on Anaconda/Nextflow and Docker is an easy-to-use package        that can be applied to a broad range of species, tissues, and research areas        helping to improve and reconcile current annotations.

The red to black hues        are caused by the accumulation of anthocyanins, while their absence results in        yellow, orange or green fruits. In Prunus, MYB10 genes are determinants for        anthocyanin accumulation. In peach, QTLs for red plant organ traits map in an LG3        region with three MYB10 copies (PpMYB10.1, PpMYB10.2 and PpMYB10.3). In Japanese        plum the gene copy number in this region differs with respect to peach: there are        at least three copies of PsMYB10.1, with the expression of one of them        (PsMYB10.1a) correlating with fruit skin color. The objective of this study was        to determine a possible role of LG3-PsMYB10 genes in the natural variability of        the flesh color trait and to develop a molecular marker for marker-assisted        selection (MAS). We explored the variability within the LG3-PsMYB10 region using        long-range sequences obtained in previous studies through CRISPR-Cas9 enrichment        sequencing. We found that the PsMYB10.2 gene was only expressed in red flesh        fruits. Its role in promoting anthocyanin biosynthesis was validated by transient        overexpression in Japanese plum fruits. The analysis of long-range sequences        identified an LTR retrotransposon in the promoter of the expressed PsMYB10.2 gene        that explained the trait in 93.1% of the 145 individuals analyzed. We hypothesize        that the LTR retrotransposon may promote the PsMYB10.2 expression and activate        the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway.

Selection generally maintains high MHC variation        because the spectrum of recognized pathogens depends on MHC polymorphism. Novel        alleles favoured by selection originate by interallelic recombination or de novo        mutations but may also be acquired by introgression from related species.        However, the extent and prevalence of MHC introgression remain an open question.        In this study, we tested for MHC introgression in six hybrid zones formed by six        Triturus newt species. We sequenced and genotyped the polymorphic second exons of        the MHC class I and II genes and compared their interspecific similarity at        various distances from the centre of the hybrid zone. We found evidence for        introgression of both MHC classes in the majority of examined hybrid zones, with        support for a more substantial class I introgression. Furthermore, the overall        MHC allele sharing outside of hybrid zones was elevated between pairs of Triturus        species with abutting ranges, regardless of the phylogenetic distance between        them. No effect of past hybrid zone movement on MHC allele sharing was found.        Finally, using previously published genome-wide data, we demonstrated that MHC        introgression was more extensive than genome-wide introgression, supporting its        adaptive potential. Our study thus provides evidence for the prevalence of MHC        introgression across multiple Triturus hybrid zones, indicating that MHC        introgression between divergent hybridizing species may be widespread and        adaptive.",PMC10108261,Molecular ecology,9214478

Other methods, such as next-generation short read sequencing or        PCR assays, are limited in their capabilities to detect or characterize        structural variants. However, the existing software for nanopore sequencing data        analysis still reports incomplete variant sets, which also contain erroneous        calls, a considerable obstacle for the molecular diagnosis or accurate genotyping        of populations. METHODS: We compared multiple factors affecting variant calling,        such as reference genome version, aligner (minimap2, NGMLR, and lra) choice, and        variant caller combinations (Sniffles, CuteSV, SVIM, and NanoVar), to find the        optimal group of tools for calling large (>50 kb) deletions and duplications,        using data from seven patients exhibiting gross gene defects on SERPINC1 and from        a reference variant set as the control. The goal was to obtain the most complete,        yet reasonably specific group of large variants using a single cell of PromethION        sequencing, which yielded lower depth coverage than short-read sequencing. We        also used a custom method for the statistical analysis of the coverage value to        refine the resulting datasets.

In addition, they can cause        genetic disorders by altering gene expression and generating structural        variations (SVs). The development and rapid technological advances in        next-generation sequencing (NGS) have led to new perspectives on detecting        retrotransposon-mediated SVs, especially insertions. Moreover, various        computational methods have been developed based on NGS data to precisely detect        the insertions and deletions in the human genome. Therefore, this review        discusses details about the recently studied and utilized NGS technologies and        the effective computational approaches for discovering retrotransposons through        it. The final part covers a diverse range of computational methods for detecting        retrotransposon insertions with human NGS data. This review will give researchers        insights into understanding the TEs and how to investigate them and find        connections with research interests.",PMC9605557,"Life (Basel, Switzerland)",101580444
36273825,"Detection of Transgene Location in the CYP2A13/2B6/2F1-transgenic Mouse Model        using Optical Genome Mapping Technology.",10.1124/dmd.122.001090,"Most transgenic mouse models are generated through random integration of the        transgene. The location of the transgene provides valuable information for        assessing potential effects of the transgenesis on the host and for designing        genotyping protocols that can amplify across the integration site, but it is        challenging to identify. Here, we report the successful utility of optical genome        mapping technology to identify the transgene insertion site in a        CYP2A13/2B6/2F1-transgenic mouse model, which produces three human cytochrome        P450 (P450) enzymes (CYP2A13, CYP2B6, and CYP2F1) that are encoded by neighboring        genes on human chromosome 19. These enzymes metabolize many drugs, respiratory        toxicants, and chemical carcinogens. Initial efforts to identify candidate        insertion sites by whole genome sequencing was unsuccessful, apparently because        the transgene is located in a region of the mouse genome that contains highly        repetitive sequences. Subsequent utility of the optical genome mapping approach,        which compares genome-wide marker distribution between the transgenic mouse        genome and a reference mouse (GRCm38) or human (GRCh38) genome, localized the        insertion site to mouse chromosome 14, between two marker positions at 4451324        base pair and 4485032 base pair. A transgene-mouse genome junction sequence was        further identified through long-polymerase chain reaction amplification and DNA        sequencing at GRCm38 Chr.14:4484726. The transgene insertion (∼2.4 megabase pair)        contained 5-7 copies of the human transgenes, which replaced a 26.9-33.4 kilobase        pair mouse genomic region, including exons 1-4 of Gm3182, a predicted and highly        redundant gene. Finally, the sequencing results enabled the design of a new        genotyping protocol that can distinguish between hemizygous and homozygous        CYP2A13/2B6/2F1-transgenic mice. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This study characterizes        the genomic structure of, and provides a new genotyping method for, a transgenic        mouse model that expresses three human P450 enzymes, CYP2A13, CYP2B6, and CYP2F1,        that are important in xenobiotic metabolism and toxicity. The demonstrated        success in applying the optical genome mapping technology for identification of        transgene insertion sites should encourage others to do the same for other        transgenic models generated through random integration, including most of the        currently available human P450 transgenic mouse models.",PMC9832375,Drug metabolism and disposition: the biological fate of chemicals,9421550

We analyzed large        deletion events in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) using        different methods, including clonal genotyping, droplet digital polymerase chain        reaction, single-molecule real-time sequencing with unique molecular identifier,        and long-amplicon sequencing assay. Our results show that large deletions of up        to several thousand bases occur with high frequencies at the Cas9 on-target cut        sites on the HBB (11.7 to 35.4%), HBG (14.3%), and BCL11A (13.2%) genes in HSPCs        and the PD-1 (15.2%) gene in T cells.

Simulating both with and without sequencing error for        both the Illumina and Oxford Nanopore platforms, we evaluated commonly used        classification tools including Kraken2, Bracken and Centrifuge, utilizing mini (8        GB) and standard (30-50 GB) databases. Bracken with the standard database        performed best, the median percentage of reads across both sequencing platforms        identified correctly to the species level was 97.8% (IQR 92.7:99.0) [range        5:100]. For Kraken2 with a mini database, a commonly used combination, median        species-level identification was 86.4% (IQR 50.5:93.7) [range 4.3:100].        Classification performance varied by species, with Escherichia coli being more        challenging to classify correctly (probability of reads being assigned to the        correct species: 56.1-96.0%, varying by tool used). Human read misclassification        was negligible. By filtering out shorter Nanopore reads we found performance        similar or superior to Illumina sequencing, despite higher sequencing error        rates.

However, it        still has many gaps and errors, and does not represent a biological genome as it        is a blend of multiple individuals(3,4). Recently, a high-quality        telomere-to-telomere reference, CHM13, was generated with the latest long-read        technologies, but it was derived from a hydatidiform mole cell line with a nearly        homozygous genome(5). To address these limitations, the Human Pangenome Reference        Consortium formed with the goal of creating high-quality, cost-effective, diploid        genome assemblies for a pangenome reference that represents human genetic        diversity(6). Here, in our first scientific report, we determined which        combination of current genome sequencing and assembly approaches yield the most        complete and accurate diploid genome assembly with minimal manual curation.        Approaches that used highly accurate long reads and parent-child data with        graph-based haplotype phasing during assembly outperformed those that did not.        Developing a combination of the top-performing methods, we generated our first        high-quality diploid reference assembly, containing only approximately four gaps        per chromosome on average, with most chromosomes within ±1% of the length of        CHM13. Nearly 48% of protein-coding genes have non-synonymous amino acid changes        between haplotypes, and centromeric regions showed the highest diversity.

Here, we        systematically identify the locations of RASRs in species with multiple        complete-sequenced genomes and investigate potential mediating biological        mechanisms. We found that 247 of 313 species contained sequences with at least        one large (>50 Kb) inversion in their sequence comparisons, and the aggregated        inversion distances away from symmetry were normally distributed with a mean of        zero. Many inversions that were offset from dnaA were found to be centered on a        different marker for the OriC Instances of flanking repeats provide evidence that        breaks formed during the replication process could be repaired to opposing        positions.

It has been demonstrated that, besides the major canonical transcripts,        the viral genome also codes for noncanonical RNA molecules. While the structural        characterizations have revealed a detailed transcriptomic architecture of the        virus, the kinetic studies provided poor and often misleading results on the        dynamics of both the viral and host transcripts due to the low temporal        resolution of the infection event and the low virus/cell ratio (multiplicity of        infection [MOI] = 0.1) applied for the infection. It has never been tested        whether the alteration in the host gene expressions is caused by aging of the        cells or by the viral infection. FINDINGS: In this study, we used Oxford        Nanopore's direct cDNA and direct RNA sequencing methods for the generation of a        high-coverage, high temporal resolution transcriptomic dataset of SARS-CoV-2 and        of the primate host cells, using a high infection titer (MOI = 5). Sixteen        sampling time points ranging from 1 to 96 hours with a varying time resolution        and 3 biological replicates were used in the experiment. In addition, for each        infected sample, corresponding noninfected samples were employed. The raw reads        were mapped to the viral and to the host reference genomes, resulting in        49,661,499 mapped reads (54,62 Gbs). The genome of the viral isolate was also        sequenced and phylogenetically classified. CONCLUSIONS: This dataset can serve as        a valuable resource for profiling the SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome dynamics, the        virus-host interactions, and the RNA base modifications. Comparison of expression        profiles of the host gene in the virally infected and in noninfected cells at        different time points allows making a distinction between the effect of the aging        of cells in culture and the viral infection.

Both processes are known to target genes of the major        histocompatibility complex (MHC), a gene family encoding cell-surface proteins        that display pathogen peptides to the immune system. The MHC is also a model for        understanding processes such as gene duplication and trans-species allele        sharing. The class II MHC protein is a heterodimer whose peptide-binding groove        is encoded by an MHC-IIA gene and an MHC-IIB gene. However, our literature review        found that class II MHC papers on infectious disease or sexual selection included        IIA data only 18% and 9% of the time, respectively. To assess whether greater        emphasis on MHC-IIA is warranted, we analysed MHC-IIA sequence data from 50        species of vertebrates (fish, amphibians, birds, mammals) to test for        polymorphism and positive selection. We found that the number of MHC-IIA alleles        within a species was often high, and covaried with sample size and number of        MHC-IIA genes assayed. While MHC-IIA variability tended to be lower than that of        MHC-IIB, the difference was only ~25%, with ~3 fewer IIA alleles than IIB.        Furthermore, the unexpectedly high MHC-IIA variability showed clear signatures of        positive selection in most species, and positive selection on MHC-IIA was        stronger in fish than in other surveyed vertebrate groups. Our findings        underscore that MHC-IIA can be an important target of selection.

In the present        review, the current information on the classical and alternative methods used for        isolation and identification of L. monocytogenes in food have been described.        Although these techniques are usually simple, standardized, inexpensive, and are        routinely used in many food testing laboratories, several alternative        molecular-based approaches for the bacteria detection in food and food production        environments have been developed. They are characterized by the high sample        throughput, a short time of analysis, and cost-effectiveness. However, these        methods are important for the routine testing toward the presence and number of        L. monocytogenes, but are not suitable for characteristics and typing of the        bacterial isolates, which are crucial in the study of listeriosis infections. For        these purposes, novel approaches, with a high discriminatory power to genetically        distinguish the strains during epidemiological studies, have been developed,        e.g., whole-genome sequence-based techniques such as NGS which provide an        opportunity to perform comparison between strains of the same species.

We detected the strongest similarity        among the sequencing platforms at the gene level compared to exon-based and        isoform-based. Furthermore, the exon-based strategy discovered many differential        exon usage (DEU) events, mostly in a platform-dependent manner and in        non-differentially expressed genes.

Outputs        of ScanExitronLR can be used in downstream analyses of differential exitron        splicing. In addition, ScanExitronLR optionally reports exitron annotations such        as truncation or frameshift type, nonsense-mediated decay status and Pfam domain        interruptions.

Examples of regions with duplicated genes with relevant roles in        agricultural traits are found in many crops. In both duplicated and        non-duplicated genes, much of the variability in agronomic traits is caused by        large as well as small and middle scale structural variants (SVs), which        highlights the relevance of the identification and characterization of complex        variability between genomes for plant breeding. RESULTS: Here we improve and        demonstrate the use of CRISPR-Cas9 enrichment combined with long-read sequencing        technology to resolve the MYB10 region in the linkage group 3 (LG3) of Japanese        plum (Prunus salicina). This region, which has a length from 90 to 271 kb        according to the P. salicina genomes available, is associated with fruit color        variability in Prunus species. We demonstrate the high complexity of this region,        with homology levels between Japanese plum varieties comparable to those between        Prunus species. We cleaved MYB10 genes in five plum varieties using the Cas9        enzyme guided by a pool of crRNAs. The barcoded fragments were then pooled and        sequenced in a single MinION Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) run, yielding        194 Mb of sequence. The enrichment was confirmed by aligning the long reads to        the plum reference genomes, with a mean read on-target value of 4.5% and a depth        per sample of 11.9x. From the alignment, 3261 SNPs and 287 SVs were called and        phased. A de novo assembly was constructed for each variety, which also allowed        detection, at the haplotype level, of the variability in this region.        CONCLUSIONS: CRISPR-Cas9 enrichment is a versatile and powerful tool for        long-read targeted sequencing even on highly duplicated and/or polymorphic        genomic regions, being especially useful when a reference genome is not        available.

In this study, methods are presented to obtain complete bacterial        genomes from human saliva using complementary Oxford Nanopore (ONT) and Illumina        sequencing. Applied to 3 human saliva samples, these methods resulted in 11        complete bacterial genomes: 3 Saccharibacteria clade G6 (also known as Ca.        Nanogingivalaceae HMT-870), 1 Saccharibacteria clade G1 HMT-348, 2 Rothia        mucilaginosa, 2 Actinomyces graevenitzii, 1 Mogibacterium diversum, 1        Lachnospiraceae HMT-096, and 1 Lancefieldella parvula; and one circular        chromosome of Ruminococcaceae HMT-075 (which likely has at least 2 chromosomes).        The 4 Saccharibacteria genomes, as well as the Actinomyces graeventizii genomes,        represented the first complete genomes from their respective bacterial taxa.        Aside from the complete genomes, the assemblies contained 147 contigs of over        500,000 bp each and thousands of smaller contigs, together representing a myriad        of additional draft genomes including many which are likely nearly complete.

Our study analysed the nuclear and        cytoplasmic, poly(A) and total transcriptomes of mouse livers collected over the        course of a day. These data provide a genome-wide temporal inventory of        enrichment in subcellular RNA, and revealed specific signatures of splicing,        nuclear export and cytoplasmic mRNA stability related to transcript and gene        lengths. Combined with a mathematical model describing rhythmic RNA profiles, we        could test the rhythmicity of export rates and cytoplasmic degradation rates of        approximately 1400 genes. With nuclear export times usually much shorter than        cytoplasmic half-lives, we found that nuclear export contributes to the        modulation and generation of rhythmic profiles of 10% of the cycling nuclear        mRNAs.

We hypothesized that hidden short-read scaffolding errors and        erroneous long-read contigs degrade the quality of short- and long-read hybrid        assemblies. We assembled the genome of Trematomus borchgrevinki from data        generated during each of the 3 phases and assessed the quality problems we        encountered. We developed strategies such as k-mer-assembled region replacement,        parameter optimization, and long-read sampling to address the error models. We        demonstrated that a k-mer-based strategy improved short-read assemblies as        measured by Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Ortholog while mate-pair libraries        introduced hidden scaffolding errors and perturbed Benchmarking Universal        Single-Copy Ortholog scores.

Although long thought to have no        biological significance, advances in DNA sequencing and analytical technologies        have enabled precise characterization of TEs and confirmed their ubiquitous        presence across all forms of life. These findings have ignited intense debates        over their biological significance. The available evidence now supports the        notion that TEs exert major influence over many biological aspects of organismal        life. Transposable elements contribute significantly to the evolution of the        genome by giving rise to genetic variations in both active and passive modes. Due        to their intrinsic nature of mobility within the genome, TEs primarily cause gene        disruption and large-scale genomic alterations including inversions, deletions,        and duplications. Besides genomic instability, growing evidence also points to        many physiologically important functions of TEs, such as gene regulation through        cis-acting control elements and modulation of the transcriptome through        epigenetic control. In this review, we discuss the latest evidence demonstrating        the impact of TEs on genome stability and the underling mechanisms, including        those developed to mitigate the deleterious impact of TEs on genomic stability        and human health.

Humans start out as single-cell zygotes and undergo fission        and differentiation to develop into multicellular organisms. Before fertilisation        and during development, the cellular genome acquires hundreds of mutations that        propagate down the cell lineage. Whether germline or somatic in nature, some of        these mutations may have significant genotypic impact and lead to diseased        cellular phenotypes, either systemically or confined to a tissue. Single-cell        sequencing enables the detection and monitoring of the genotype and the        consequent molecular phenotypes at a cellular resolution. It offers powerful        tools to compare the cellular lineage between 'normal' and 'diseased' conditions        and to establish genotype-phenotype relationships. By preserving cellular        heterogeneity, single-cell sequencing, unlike bulk-sequencing, allows the        detection of even small, diseased subpopulations of cells within an otherwise        normal tissue. Indeed, the characterisation of biopsies with cellular resolution        can provide a mechanistic view of the disease. While single-cell approaches are        currently used mainly in basic research, it can be expected that applications of        these technologies in the clinic may aid the detection, diagnosis and eventually        the treatment of rare genetic diseases as well as cancer.

The agreements at genus level        between culture and 16S Nanopore, Nanopore WGS, and Illumina WGS were 75%, 100%,        and 78%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Whole genome sequencing has higher        sensitivity and provides a viable alternative to culture and 16S sequencing for        detecting potential pathogens in endophthalmitis. Moreover, WGS has the ability        to detect other potential pathogens in culture-negative cases. Whilst Nanopore        and Illumina WGS provide comparable data, nanopore sequencing provides potential        for cost-effective point-of-care diagnostics.",PMC9850836,American journal of ophthalmology,0370500

While short reads are highly accurate,        they are rarely able to span multiple exons. Long-read technology can capture        full-length transcripts, but its relatively high error rate often leads to        mis-identified splice sites. Here we present a new release of StringTie that        performs hybrid-read assembly. By taking advantage of the strengths of both long        and short reads, hybrid-read assembly with StringTie is more accurate than        long-read only or short-read only assembly, and on some datasets it can more than        double the number of correctly assembled transcripts, while obtaining        substantially higher precision than the long-read data assembly alone. Here we        demonstrate the improved accuracy on simulated data and real data from        Arabidopsis thaliana, Mus musculus, and human. We also show that hybrid-read        assembly is more accurate than correcting long reads prior to assembly while also        being substantially faster.

Patients with airways disease, including COPD and bronchiectasis, are        at increased risks of pulmonary mycoses and its associated complications.        Frequent use of antibiotics and corticosteroids coupled with impaired host        defenses predispose patients to fungal colonization and airway persistence, which        are associated with negative clinical consequences. Notably, Aspergillus species        remain the best-studied fungal pathogen and induce a broad spectrum of clinical        manifestations in COPD and bronchiectasis ranging from colonization and        sensitization to more invasive disease. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has        gained prominence in the field of respiratory infection, and in some cases is        beginning to act as a viable alternative to traditional culture. NGS has        revolutionized our understanding of airway microbiota and in particular fungi.

Herein, dynamic        changes in AsA content at six different stages of A. latifolia fruit development        and ripening were determined. AsA content of A. latifolia fruit reached 1108.76 ±        35.26 mg 100 g(-1) FW at full maturity. A high-quality, full-length (FL)        transcriptome of A. latifolia was successfully constructed for the first time        using third-generation sequencing technology.

Our study presents a high-quality        chromosome-scale genome assembly of striped catfish (Pangasianodon        hypophthalmus), a commercially important species cultured mainly in Vietnam,        integrating HiFi reads and Hi-C data. A 788.4 Mb genome containing 381 scaffolds        with an N50 length of 21.8 Mb has been obtained from HiFi reads. These scaffolds        have been further ordered and clustered into 30 chromosome groups, ranging from        1.4 to 57.6 Mb, based on Hi-C data.

Nearly half the genes contain introns, but the        impact of alternative splicing in gene regulation and proteome diversification        remains largely unexplored. Here we leverage Oxford Nanopore Technologies native        RNA sequencing (dRNA), as well as ribosome profiling data, to uncover the full        range of polyadenylated transcripts and translated open reading frames. We        identify 332 alternative isoforms affecting the coding sequences of 262 different        genes, 97 of which occur at frequencies higher than 20%, indicating that        functional alternative splicing in S. pombe is more prevalent than previously        suspected. Intron retention events make about 80% of the cases; these events may        be involved in the regulation of gene expression and, in some cases, generate        novel protein isoforms, as supported by ribosome profiling data in 18 of the        intron retention isoforms. One example is the rpl22 gene, in which intron        retention is associated with the translation of a protein of only 13 amino acids.        We also find that lowly expressed transcripts tend to have longer poly(A) tails        than highly expressed transcripts, highlighting an interdependence between        poly(A) tail length and transcript expression level.

However, characterizing STRs in human genomes using LRS on a large        population scale has not been reported. Methods: We conducted the large LRS-based        STR analysis in 193 unrelated samples of the Chinese population and performed        genome-wide profiling of STR variation in the human genome. The repeat dynamic        index (RDI) was introduced to evaluate the variability of STR. We sourced the        expression data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression to explore the tissue        specificity of highly variable STRs related genes across tissues. Enrichment        analyses were also conducted to identify potential functional roles of the high        variable STRs. Results: This study reports the large-scale analysis of human STR        variation by LRS and offers a reference STR database based on the LRS dataset. We        found that the disease-associated STRs (dSTRs) and STRs associated with the        expression of nearby genes (eSTRs) were highly variable in the general        population. Moreover, tissue-specific expression analysis showed that those        highly variable STRs related genes presented the highest expression level in        brain tissues, and enrichment pathways analysis found those STRs are involved in        synaptic function-related pathways. Conclusion: Our study profiled the        genome-wide landscape of STR using LRS and highlighted the highly variable STRs        in the human genome, which provide a valuable resource for studying the role of        STRs in human disease and complex traits.",PMC9117641,Frontiers in genetics,101560621

Long reads        generally produce draft genome assemblies with lower base quality, which must be        corrected with a genome polishing step. Hybrid genome polishing solutions can        greatly improve the quality of long-read genome assemblies by utilizing more        accurate short reads to validate bases and correct errors. Currently available        hybrid polishing methods rely on read alignments, and are therefore        memory-intensive and do not scale well to large genomes.

Here we assess the viability of using Nanopore sequencing for epidemiology        by performing a comparison with DNA methylation quantified using the most        comprehensive microarray available, the Illumina EPIC array. We implemented a        CRISPR-Cas9 targeted sequencing approach in concert with Nanopore sequencing to        profile DNA methylation in three genomic regions to attempt to rediscover genomic        positions that existing technologies have shown are differentially methylated in        tobacco smokers. Using Nanopore sequencing reads, DNA methylation was quantified        at 1779 CpGs across three regions, providing a finer resolution of DNA        methylation patterns compared to the EPIC array. The correlation of estimated        levels of DNA methylation between platforms was high. Furthermore, we identified        12 CpGs where hypomethylation was significantly associated with smoking status,        including 10 within the AHRR gene. In summary, Nanopore sequencing is a valid        option for identifying genomic loci where large differences in DNAm are        associated with a phenotype and has the potential to advance our understanding of        the role differential methylation plays in the etiology of complex disease.",PMC9476619,Human molecular genetics,9208958

RESULTS: We developed QuasiSeq using a novel signature-based        self-tuning clustering method, SigClust, to profile viral mixtures with high        accuracy and sensitivity. QuasiSeq can correctly identify quasispecies even using        low-quality sequencing reads (accuracy <80%) and produce quasispecies sequences        with high accuracy (≥99.55%). Using high-quality circular consensus sequencing        reads, QuasiSeq can produce quasispecies sequences with 100% accuracy. QuasiSeq        has higher sensitivity and specificity than similar published software. Moreover,        the requirement of the computational resource can be controlled by the size of        the signature, which makes it possible to handle big sequencing data for rare        quasispecies discovery.

The analysis of RNA viromes reaffirms the abundance of lytic        (+) ssRNA viruses of the order Picornavirales, but also reveals other (+) ssRNA        viruses, including RNA bacteriophages, as important constituents of extracellular        RNA viral communities.

More than 1000 fungal genomes have        been submitted to sequence databases, mostly obtained through second generation        short-read DNA sequencing. As a result, highly fragmented genome drafts have        typically been obtained. However, with the emergence of third generation        long-read DNA sequencing, the assembly challenge can be overcome and highly        contiguous assemblies obtained. Such attractive results, however, are extremely        dependent on the ability to extract highly purified high molecular weight (HMW)        DNA. Extraction of such DNA is currently a significant challenge for all species        with cell walls, not least fungi. In this study, four isolates of filamentous        ascomycetes (Apiospora pterospermum, Aspergillus sp. (subgen. Cremei),        Aspergillus westerdijkiae, and Penicillium aurantiogriseum) were used to develop        extraction and purification methods that result in HMW DNA suitable for third        generation sequencing. We have tested and propose two straightforward extraction        methods based on treatment with either a commercial kit or traditional        phenol-chloroform extraction both in combination with a single commercial        purification method that result in high quality HMW DNA from filamentous        ascomycetes.

At present, there are no universal primers available for        alphacoronaviruses and that, since these viruses have diverse strains, new        primers specific to the target strain must be continuously developed for        sequencing.

Given the diversity in the size and type of SVs present in tumours, the        accurate detection and interpretation of SVs in tumours is challenging. New        classes of complex structural events in tumours are discovered frequently, and        the definitions of the genomic consequences of complex events are constantly        being refined. Detailed analyses of short-read whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data        from large tumour cohorts facilitate the interrogation of SVs at orders of        magnitude greater scale and depth. However, the inherent technical limitations of        short-read WGS prevent us from accurately detecting and investigating the impact        of all the SVs present in tumours. The expanded use of long-read WGS will be        critical for improving the accuracy of SV detection, and in fully resolving        complex SV events, both of which are crucial for determining the impact of SVs on        tumour progression and clinical outcome. Despite the present limitations, we        demonstrate that SVs play an important role in tumourigenesis. In particular, SVs        contribute significantly to late-stage tumour development and to intratumoural        heterogeneity. The evolutionary trajectories of SVs represent a window into the        clonal dynamics in tumours, a comprehensive understanding of which will be vital        for influencing patient outcomes in the future. Recent findings have highlighted        many clinical applications of SVs in cancer, from early detection to biomarkers        for treatment response and prognosis. As the methods to detect and interpret SVs        improve, elucidating the full breadth of the complex SV landscape and determining        how these events modulate tumour evolution will improve our understanding of        cancer biology and our ability to capitalise on the utility of SVs in the        clinical management of cancer patients. © 2022 The Authors.

Despite the        potential of long-read sequencing in metagenomics, resources and protocols for        this technology are scarce. Here, we describe MIrROR, the database and analysis        tool for metataxonomics using the bacterial 16S-ITS-23S rRNA operon region. We        collected 16S-ITS-23S rRNA operon sequences extracted from bacterial genomes from        NCBI GenBank and performed curation. A total of 97,781 16S-ITS-23S rRNA operon        sequences covering 9,485 species from 43,653 genomes were obtained. For user        convenience, we provide an analysis tool based on a mapping strategy that can be        used for taxonomic profiling with MIrROR database.

The distinctive microbial communities in oceanic trench sediments        are expected because of the extremely high pressure and V-shape topology that        caused the isolation from the other marine sediments. However, they have only        been primarily targeted using 'universal' primers that provide variable        performances for different environments. It is necessary to design specific        primers to improve the detection resolution of unique microbial groups in oceanic        trenches.

However, despite being widely used, the currently available        C. briggsae reference genome is substantially less complete and structurally        accurate than the C. elegans reference genome.

Rust fungi are such        species with two nuclei (karyons) that contain a full set of haploid chromosomes        each. The physical separation of haplotypes in dikaryons means that, unlike in        diploids, Hi-C chromatin contacts between haplotypes are false-positive signals.        RESULTS: We generate the first chromosome-scale, fully-phased assembly for the        dikaryotic leaf rust fungus Puccinia triticina and compare Nanopore MinION and        PacBio HiFi sequence-based assemblies. We show that false-positive Hi-C contacts        between haplotypes are predominantly caused by phase switches rather than by        collapsed regions or Hi-C read mis-mappings. We introduce a method for phasing of        dikaryotic genomes into the two haplotypes using Hi-C contact graphs, including a        phase switch correction step. In the HiFi assembly, relatively few phase switches        occur, and these are predominantly located at haplotig boundaries and can be        readily corrected. In contrast, phase switches are widespread throughout the        Nanopore assembly. We show that haploid genome read coverage of 30-40 times using        HiFi sequencing is required for phasing of the leaf rust genome, with 0.7%        heterozygosity, and that HiFi sequencing resolves genomic regions with low        heterozygosity that are otherwise collapsed in the Nanopore assembly.        CONCLUSIONS: This first Hi-C based phasing pipeline for dikaryons and comparison        of long-read sequencing technologies will inform future genome assembly and        haplotype phasing projects in other non-haploid organisms.",PMC8957140,Genome biology,100960660

Major architectural        elements, such as common repeats and segmental duplications (SDs), increase        genome plasticity that stimulates further evolution by changing the genomic        structure and inventing new genes. Optimal computation of SDs within a genome        requires quadratic-time local alignment algorithms that are impractical due to        the size of most genomes. Additionally, to perform evolutionary analysis, one        needs to characterize SDs in multiple genomes and find relations between those        SDs and unique (non-duplicated) segments in other genomes. A naïve approach        consisting of multiple sequence alignment would make the optimal solution to this        problem even more impractical. Thus there is a need for fast and accurate        algorithms to characterize SD structure in multiple genome assemblies to better        understand the evolutionary forces that shaped the genomes of today.

Though gene        marker approaches can now be complemented by genome-resolved studies of        inter-(macrodiversity) and intra-(microdiversity) population variation,        analytical tools to do so remain scattered or under-developed. RESULTS: Here, we        introduce MetaPop, an open-source bioinformatic pipeline that provides a single        interface to analyze and visualize microbial and viral community metagenomes at        both the macro- and microdiversity levels. Macrodiversity estimates include        population abundances and α- and β-diversity. Microdiversity calculations include        identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms, novel codon-constrained        linkage of SNPs, nucleotide diversity (π and θ), and selective pressures (pN/pS        and Tajima's D) within and fixation indices (F(ST)) between populations. MetaPop        will also identify genes with distinct codon usage. Following rigorous        validation, we applied MetaPop to the gut viromes of autistic children that        underwent fecal microbiota transfers and their neurotypical peers. The        macrodiversity results confirmed our prior findings for viral populations        (microbial shotgun metagenomes were not available) that diversity did not        significantly differ between autistic and neurotypical children. However, by also        quantifying microdiversity, MetaPop revealed lower average viral nucleotide        diversity (π) in autistic children. Analysis of the percentage of genomes        detected under positive selection was also lower among autistic children,        suggesting that higher viral π in neurotypical children may be beneficial because        it allows populations to better ""bet hedge"" in changing environments. Further,        comparisons of microdiversity pre- and post-FMT in autistic children revealed        that the delivery FMT method (oral versus rectal) may influence viral activity        and engraftment of microdiverse viral populations, with children who received        their FMT rectally having higher microdiversity post-FMT. Overall, these results        show that analyses at the macro level alone can miss important biological        differences. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that standardized population and        genetic variation analyses will be invaluable for maximizing biological        inference, and MetaPop provides a convenient tool package to explore the dual        impact of macro- and microdiversity across microbial communities.

35269811,Pangenomes as a Resource to Accelerate Breeding of Under-Utilised Crop Species.,10.3390/ijms23052671,"Pangenomes are a rich resource to examine the genomic variation observed within a        species or genera, supporting population genetics studies, with applications for        the improvement of crop traits. Major crop species such as maize (Zea mays), rice        (Oryza sativa), Brassica (Brassica spp.), and soybean (Glycine max) have had        pangenomes constructed and released, and this has led to the discovery of        valuable genes associated with disease resistance and yield components. However,        pangenome data are not available for many less prominent crop species that are        currently under-utilised. Despite many under-utilised species being important        food sources in regional populations, the scarcity of genomic data for these        species hinders their improvement. Here, we assess several under-utilised crops        and review the pangenome approaches that could be used to build resources for        their improvement. Many of these under-utilised crops are cultivated in arid or        semi-arid environments, suggesting that novel genes related to drought tolerance        may be identified and used for introgression into related major crop species. In        addition, we discuss how previously collected data could be used to enrich        pangenome functional analysis in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) based on        studies in major crops. Considering the technological advances in genome        sequencing, pangenome references for under-utilised species are becoming more        obtainable, offering the opportunity to identify novel genes related to        agro-morphological traits in these species.",PMC8910360,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791

Here, we took a        genomic approach together with experimental assays to investigate LTH's universal        susceptibility to rice blast. Using Nanopore long reads, we assembled a        chromosome-level genome. Millions of genomic variants were detected by comparing        LTH with 10 other rice varieties, of which large-effect variants could affect        plant immunity. Gene family analyses show that the number of R genes and        leucine-rich repeat receptor-like protein kinase (LRR-RLK)-encoding genes        decrease significantly in LTH. Rice blast resistance genes called Pi genes are        either absent or disrupted by genomic variations. Additionally, residual R genes        of LTH are likely under weak pathogen selection pressure, and other plant        defense-related genes are weakly induced by rice blast. In contrast, the        pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) of LTH is normal, as demonstrated by        experimental assays. Therefore, we conclude that weak effector-trigger immunity        (ETI)-mediated primarily by Pi genes but not PTI results in the universal        susceptibility of LTH to rice blast. The attenuated ETI of LTH may be also        associated with reduced numbers of R genes and LRR-RLKs, and minimally functional        residual defense-related genes. Finally, we demonstrate the use of the LTH genome        by rapid cloning of the Pi gene Piak from a resistant variety.",PMC8866493,Computational and structural biotechnology journal,101585369

To address this question, we quantified TE Landscapes (TLs) via whole        genome sequencing of young and aged Drosophila strains of wild-type and mutant        backgrounds. We quantified TLs in whole flies and dissected brains and validated        the feasibility of our approach in detecting new TE insertions in aging        Drosophila genomes when small RNA and RNA interference (RNAi) pathways are        compromised. We also describe improved sequencing methods to quantify        extra-chromosomal DNA circles (eccDNAs) in Drosophila as an additional source of        TE copies that accumulate during aging. Lastly, to combat the natural progression        of aging-associated TE expression, we show that knocking down PAF1, a conserved        transcription elongation factor that antagonizes RNAi pathways, may bolster        suppression of TEs during aging and extend lifespan. Our study suggests that in        addition to a possible influence by different genetic backgrounds, small RNA and        RNAi mechanisms may mitigate genomic TL expansion despite the increase in TE        transcripts during aging.",PMC8893327,PLoS genetics,101239074

Recent studies have        uncovered how resident microbial communities play a significant role in        maintaining the normal healthy function of the skin and the immune system. In        turn, numerous host-associated and environmental factors influence these        communities' composition and diversity across the cutaneous surface. In addition,        specific compositional changes in skin microbiota have also been connected to the        development of several chronic diseases. The current era of microbiome research        is characterized by its reliance on large data sets of nucleotide sequences        produced with high-throughput sequencing of sample-extracted DNA.

However, when genomes have low variability in the early stages of a        pandemic, the impact of technical and/or sequencing errors increases. We        quantitatively assessed inter-laboratory differences in consensus genome        assemblies of 72 matched SARS-CoV-2-positive specimens sequenced at different        laboratories in Sydney, Australia. Raw sequence data were assembled using two        different bioinformatics pipelines in parallel, and resulting consensus genomes        were compared to detect laboratory-specific differences. Matched genome sequences        were predominantly concordant, with a median pairwise identity of 99.997%.        Identified differences were predominantly driven by ambiguous site content.        Ignoring these produced differences in only 2.3% (5/216) of pairwise comparisons,        each differing by a single nucleotide. Matched samples were assigned the same        Pango lineage in 98.2% (212/216) of pairwise comparisons, and were mostly        assigned to the same phylogenetic clade. However, epidemiological inference based        only on single nucleotide variant distances may lead to significant differences        in the number of defined clusters if variant allele frequency thresholds for        consensus genome generation differ between laboratories.

This review discusses various methods to        improve the molecular diagnostic rates in these genomic cold cases. We discuss        extended analysis methods to consider, non-Mendelian inheritance models,        mosaicism, dual/multiple diagnoses, periodic re-analysis, artificial intelligence        tools, and deep phenotyping, in addition to integrating various omics methods to        improve variant prioritization. Last, novel genomic technologies, including        long-read sequencing, artificial long-read sequencing, and optical genome mapping        are discussed. In conclusion, a more comprehensive molecular analysis and a        timely re-analysis of unsolved cases are imperative to improve diagnostic rates.        In addition, our current understanding of the human genome is still limited due        to restrictions in technologies. Novel technologies are now available that        improve upon some of these limitations and can capture all human genomic        variation more accurately.

Yet, evolutionary refinement has        produced distinct retroelements across the tree of microbial life that are        perhaps best described in terms of their programmed RNA-a compact sequence that        preserves core information for a sophisticated mechanism. From this perspective,        reverse transcriptase has been selected as the modular tool for carrying out        nature's instructions in various RNA templates. Beneficial retroelements-those        that can provide a fitness advantage to their host-evolved to their extant forms        in a wide array of microorganisms and their viruses, spanning nearly all        habitats. Within each specialized retroelement class, several universal features        seem to be shared across diverse taxa, while specific functional and mechanistic        insights are based on only a few model retroelement systems from clinical        isolates. Currently, little is known about the diversity of cellular functions        and ecological significance of retroelements across different biomes. With        increasing availability of isolate, metagenome-assembled, and single-amplified        genomes, the taxonomic and functional breadth of prokaryotic retroelements is        coming into clearer view. This review explores the recently characterized classes        of beneficial, yet accessory retroelements of bacteria and archaea.

35164688,"Genion, an accurate tool to detect gene fusion from long transcriptomics reads.",10.1186/s12864-022-08339-5,"BACKGROUND: The advent of next-generation sequencing technologies empowered a        wide variety of transcriptomics studies. A widely studied topic is gene fusion        which is observed in many cancer types and suspected of having oncogenic        properties. Gene fusions are the result of structural genomic events that bring        two genes closely located and result in a fused transcript. This is different        from fusion transcripts created during or after the transcription process. These        chimeric transcripts are also known as read-through and trans-splicing        transcripts. Gene fusion discovery with short reads is a well-studied problem,        and many methods have been developed. But the sensitivity of these methods is        limited by the technology, especially the short read length. Advances in        long-read sequencing technologies allow the generation of long transcriptomics        reads at a low cost. Transcriptomic long-read sequencing presents unique        opportunities to overcome the shortcomings of short-read technologies for gene        fusion detection while introducing new challenges. RESULTS: We present Genion, a        sensitive and fast gene fusion detection method that can also detect read-through        events. We compare Genion against a recently introduced long-read gene fusion        discovery method, LongGF, both on simulated and real datasets. On simulated data,        Genion accurately identifies the gene fusions and its clustering accuracy for        detecting fusion reads is better than LongGF. Furthermore, our results on the        breast cancer cell line MCF-7 show that Genion correctly identifies all the        experimentally validated gene fusions.

METHODS: The genetic material of the        three β-thalassemia mutation carrier couples was sequenced using single-molecule        real-time sequencing in the 7.7-kb region of the HBB gene and a 7.4-kb region        that partially overlapped with it to detect the presence of 17 common HBB gene        mutations in the Chinese population and the haplotypes formed by the continuous        array of single-nucleotide polymorphisms linked to these mutations. By using the        same method to analyze multiple displacement amplification products of embryos        from three families and comparing the results with those of the parents, it could        be revealed whether the embryos carry disease-causing mutations without the need        for a proband. RESULTS: The HBB gene mutations of the three couples were        accurately detected, and the haplotype linked to the pathogenic site was        successfully obtained without the need for a proband. A total of 68.75% (22/32)        of embryos from the three families successfully underwent haplotype linkage        analysis, and the results were consistent with the results of NGS-based mutation        site detection.

Disentangling these two        sources of variation will be a key to resolving the debate about the importance        of epigenetic mechanisms, and studies on natural populations that partition the        relative contribution of genetic and epigenetic factors to phenotypic variation        can play an important role in this debate.",PMC8826306,Proceedings.

Most of these tools employ Type II (e.g., Cas9) or Type V (e.g.,        Cas12a) CRISPR enzymes to create RNA-guided precise double-strand breaks in the        genome. However, such technologies are limited in their capacity to make targeted        large deletions. Recently, the Type I CRISPR system, which is prevalent in        microbes and displays unique enzymatic features, has been harnessed to        effectively create large chromosomal deletions in human cells. Type I CRISPR        first uses a multisubunit ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex called Cascade to find        its guide-complementary target site, and then recruits a helicase-nuclease        enzyme, Cas3, to travel along and shred the target DNA over a long distance with        high processivity. When introduced into human cells as purified RNPs, the        CRISPR-Cas3 complex can efficiently induce large genomic deletions of varying        lengths (1-100 kb) from the CRISPR-targeted site. Because of this unique editing        outcome, CRISPR-Cas3 holds great promise for tasks such as the removal of        integrated viral genomes and the interrogation of structural variants affecting        gene function and human disease. Here, we provide detailed protocols for        introducing large deletions using CRISPR-Cas3. We describe step-by-step        procedures for purifying the Type I-E CRISPR proteins Cascade and Cas3 from        Thermobifida fusca, electroporating RNPs into human cells, and characterizing DNA        deletions using PCR and sequencing.

However, the underlying mechanisms of pathogenesis and etiologies        are still largely unknown. Herein, we investigated apparently balanced        interchromosomal structural rearrangements in six cases with azoospermia/severe        oligospermia to comprehensively identify and delineate cryptic structural        rearrangements and the related copy number variants. In addition, high read-depth        genome sequencing (GS) (30-fold) was performed to investigate point mutations        causative of male infertility. Mate-pair GS (4-fold) revealed additional        structural rearrangements and/or copy number changes in 5 of 6 cases and detected        a total of 48 rearrangements. Overall, the breakpoints caused truncations of 30        RefSeq genes, five of which were associated with spermatogenesis. Furthermore,        the breakpoints disrupted 43 topological-associated domains. Direct disruptions        or potential dysregulations of genes, which play potential roles in male germ        cell development, apoptosis, and spermatogenesis, were found in all cases (n =        6).

34991450,"Lerna: transformer architectures for configuring error correction tools for        short- and long-read genome sequencing.",10.1186/s12859-021-04547-0,"BACKGROUND: Sequencing technologies are prone to errors, making error correction        (EC) necessary for downstream applications. EC tools need to be manually        configured for optimal performance. We find that the optimal parameters (e.g.,        k-mer size) are both tool- and dataset-dependent. Moreover, evaluating the        performance (i.e., Alignment-rate or Gain) of a given tool usually relies on a        reference genome, but quality reference genomes are not always available. We        introduce Lerna for the automated configuration of k-mer-based EC tools. Lerna        first creates a language model (LM) of the uncorrected genomic reads, and then,        based on this LM, calculates a metric called the perplexity metric to evaluate        the corrected reads for different parameter choices. Next, it finds the one that        produces the highest alignment rate without using a reference genome. The        fundamental intuition of our approach is that the perplexity metric is inversely        correlated with the quality of the assembly after error correction. Therefore,        Lerna leverages the perplexity metric for automated tuning of k-mer sizes without        needing a reference genome. RESULTS: First, we show that the best k-mer value can        vary for different datasets, even for the same EC tool. This motivates our design        that automates k-mer size selection without using a reference genome. Second, we        show the gains of our LM using its component attention-based transformers. We        show the model's estimation of the perplexity metric before and after error        correction. The lower the perplexity after correction, the better the k-mer size.        We also show that the alignment rate and assembly quality computed for the        corrected reads are strongly negatively correlated with the perplexity, enabling        the automated selection of k-mer values for better error correction, and hence,        improved assembly quality. We validate our approach on both short and long reads.        Additionally, we show that our attention-based models have significant runtime        improvement for the entire pipeline-18[Formula: see text] faster than previous        works, due to parallelizing the attention mechanism and the use of JIT        compilation for GPU inferencing.

The        introduction of long-read sequencing technologies permits those contiguous        sequences to be unambiguously bridged into complete genomes. However, the        elevated costs associated with long-read sequencing frequently limit the number        of bacterial isolates that can be long-read sequenced. Here we evaluated the        recently released 96 barcoding kit from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) to        generate complete genomes on a high-throughput basis. In addition, we propose an        isolate selection strategy that optimizes a representative selection of isolates        for long-read sequencing considering as input large-scale bacterial collections.        RESULTS: Despite an uneven distribution of long reads per barcode, near-complete        chromosomal sequences (assembly contiguity = 0.89) were generated for 96        Escherichia coli isolates with associated short-read sequencing data. The        assembly contiguity of the plasmid replicons was even higher (0.98), which        indicated the suitability of the multiplexing strategy for studies focused on        resolving plasmid sequences.

Progressive telomere shortening at each somatic        cell division eventually leads to critically short and dysfunctional telomeres,        which can contribute to either cellular senescence and aging, or tumorigenesis.        Human reproductive cells, some stem cells, and most cancer cells, express the        enzyme telomerase to restore telomeric DNA. Numerous studies have shown that        oxidative stress caused by excess reactive oxygen species is associated with        accelerated telomere shortening and dysfunction. Telomeric repeat sequences are        remarkably susceptible to oxidative damage and are preferred sites for the        production of the mutagenic base lesion 8-oxoguanine, which can alter telomere        length homeostasis and integrity.

Our results show that both        methodologies deliver similar results in the context of phylogenetic analysis and        popular population genetic analysis methods such as clustering. Furthermore, WGS        and GBS datasets from different experiments can be merged in a single dataset to        perform these analytical methodologies with proper filtering. We also tested the        influence of the different olive reference genomes in this type of analysis,        finding that they have almost no effect when estimating genetic relationships.        This work represents the first comparative study between both sequencing        techniques in olive. Our results demonstrate that the use of GBS is a perfectly        viable option for replacing WGS and reducing research costs when the goal of the        experiment is to characterise the genetic relationship between different        accessions. Besides this, we show that it is possible to combine variants from        GBS and WGS datasets, allowing the reuse of publicly available data.",PMC8622120,"Plants (Basel, Switzerland)",101596181

This trend is of particular interest for precision medicine which aims        at single-patient analysis. Here we evaluated whether gene abundances measured by        MinION direct RNA sequencing are suited to produce robust estimates of pathway        activation for single sample scoring methods. We performed multiple RNA-seq        analyses for a single sample that originated from the HepG2 cell line, namely        five ONT replicates, and three replicates using Illumina NovaSeq. Two pathway        scoring methods were employed-ssGSEA and singscore. We estimated the ONT        performance in terms of detected protein-coding genes and average pairwise        correlation between pathway activation scores using an exhaustive computational        scheme for all combinations of replicates. In brief, we found that at least two        ONT replicates are required to obtain reproducible pathway scores for both        algorithms.

We evaluated the performance        of long-read (LR) and/or short-read (SR) sequencing for anti-TB drug-resistance        prediction using the TBProfiler and Mykrobe tools, the fraction of genome        recovery, assembly accuracies and the robustness of two typing approaches based        on core-genome SNP (cgSNP) typing and core-genome multi-locus sequence typing        (cgMLST). Most of the discrepancies between phenotypic drug-susceptibility        testing (DST) and drug-resistance prediction were observed for the first-line        drugs rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide and ethambutol, mainly with LR sequence        data. Resistance prediction to second-line drugs made by both TBProfiler and        Mykrobe tools with SR- and LR-sequence data were in complete agreement with        phenotypic DST except for one isolate. The SR assemblies were more accurate than        the LR assemblies, having significantly (P<0.05) fewer indels and mismatches per        100 kbp. However, the hybrid and LR assemblies had slightly higher genome        fractions. For LR assemblies, Canu followed by Racon, and Medaka polishing was        the most accurate approach. The cgSNP approach, based on either reads or        assemblies, was more robust than the cgMLST approach, especially for LR sequence        data. In conclusion, anti-TB drug-resistance prediction, particularly with only        LR sequence data, remains challenging, especially for first-line drugs. In        addition, SR assemblies appear more accurate than LR ones, and reproducible        phylogeny can be achieved using cgSNP approaches.",PMC8743536,Microbial genomics,101671820

Each of these technologies comes with its own        limitations and biases, many of which are well-known, but not all of them are        thoroughly quantified. RESULTS: We assembled an ensemble of public datasets of        published CNV calls and raw data for the well-studied Genome in a Bottle        individual NA12878. This assembly represents a variety of methods and pipelines        used for CNV calling from array, short- and long-read technologies.

Reconstructing high-quality genomes is a crucial part of the        metagenomic workflow, as subsequent ecological and metabolic inferences depend on        their accuracy, quality, and completeness. In contrast to microbial communities        in other ecosystems, there has been no systematic assessment of genome-centric        metagenomic workflows for drinking water microbiomes. In this study, we assessed        the performance of a combination of assembly and binning strategies for time        series drinking water metagenomes that were collected over 6 months. The goal of        this study was to identify the combination of assembly and binning approaches        that result in high-quality and -quantity metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs),        representing most of the sequenced metagenome. Our findings suggest that the        metaSPAdes coassembly strategies had the best performance, as they resulted in        larger and less fragmented assemblies, with at least 85% of the sequence data        mapping to contigs greater than 1 kbp. Furthermore, a combination of metaSPAdes        coassembly strategies and MetaBAT2 produced the highest number of medium-quality        MAGs while capturing at least 70% of the metagenomes based on read recruitment.        Utilizing different assembly/binning approaches also assists in the        reconstruction of unique MAGs from closely related species that would have        otherwise collapsed into a single MAG using a single workflow. Overall, our study        suggests that leveraging multiple binning approaches with different metaSPAdes        coassembly strategies may be required to maximize the recovery of good-quality        MAGs.

In recent years, long-read        sequencing has greatly benefited genome assembly and scaffolding, a process by        which assembled sequences are ordered and oriented through the use of long-range        information. Long reads are better able to span repetitive genomic regions        compared to short reads, and thus have tremendous utility for resolving        problematic regions and helping generate more complete draft assemblies. Here, we        present LongStitch, a scalable pipeline that corrects and scaffolds draft genome        assemblies exclusively using long reads. RESULTS: LongStitch incorporates        multiple tools developed by our group and runs in up to three stages, which        includes initial assembly correction (Tigmint-long), followed by two incremental        scaffolding stages (ntLink and ARKS-long). Tigmint-long and ARKS-long are        misassembly correction and scaffolding utilities, respectively, previously        developed for linked reads, that we adapted for long reads. Here, we describe the        LongStitch pipeline and introduce our new long-read scaffolder, ntLink, which        utilizes lightweight minimizer mappings to join contigs. LongStitch was tested on        short and long-read assemblies of Caenorhabditis elegans, Oryza sativa, and three        different human individuals using corresponding nanopore long-read data, and        improves the contiguity of each assembly from 1.2-fold up to 304.6-fold (as        measured by NGA50 length).

In the Netherlands, core-genome MLST        (cgMLST) based on short-read sequencing is often used for molecular typing.        Long-read sequencing is more rapid and provides useful information about the        genome's structural composition but lacks the precision required for SNP-based        typing and cgMLST. Here we compared prophages among 50 complete E. faecium        genomes belonging to different lineages to explore whether a phage signature        would be usable for typing and identifying an outbreak caused by VRE. As a proof        of principle, we investigated if long-read sequencing data would allow for        identifying phage signatures and thereby outbreak-related isolates. RESULTS:        Analysis of complete genome sequences of publicly available isolates showed        variation in phage content among different lineages defined by MLST. We        identified phage present in multiple STs as well as phages uniquely detected        within a single lineage. Next, in silico phage typing was applied to twelve        MinION sequenced isolates belonging to two different genetic backgrounds, namely        ST117/CT24 and ST80/CT16. Genomic comparisons of the long-read-based assemblies        allowed us to correctly identify isolates of the same complex type based on        global genome architecture and specific phage signature similarity. CONCLUSIONS:        For rapid identification of related VRE isolates, phage content analysis in        long-read sequencing data is possible. This allows software development for        real-time typing analysis of long-read sequencing data, which will generate        results within several hours.

Genomic data can provide sufficient        in-depth information to identify the pockets of endemicity responsible for PPRV        persistence and viral evolution, and direct an appropriate vaccination response.        Yet, access to the required sequencing technology is low in resource-limited        settings and is compounded by the difficulty of transporting clinical samples        from wildlife across international borders due to the Convention on International        Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) of Wild Fauna and Flora, and Nagoya Protocol        regulations.

However, the majority of plasmids that carried antibiotic resistance        genes (n = 85, 57.8%) could not be completely recovered as distinct plasmids by        any of the tools. MOB-suite was the only tool that was able to correctly        reconstruct the majority of plasmids (n = 317, 50.23%), and performed best at        reconstructing large plasmids (n = 166, 46.37%) and ARG-plasmids (n = 41, 27.9%),        but predictions frequently contained chromosome contamination (40%). In contrast,        plasmidSPAdes reconstructed the highest fraction of plasmids smaller than 18 kbp        (n = 168, 61.54%). Large ARG-plasmids, however, were frequently merged with        sequences derived from distinct replicons. Available bioinformatic tools can        provide valuable insight into E. coli plasmids, but also have important        limitations. This work will serve as a guideline for selecting the most        appropriate plasmid reconstruction tool for studies focusing on E. coli plasmids        in the absence of long-read sequencing data.",PMC8400445,Microorganisms,101625893

Selecting an appropriate sequencing        platform is undoubtedly crucial for the success of the research outcome, thus        there is a need to compare these long-read sequencing platforms and evaluate them        for specific research questions. This study aims to compare the performance of        PacBio and ONT platforms for transcriptomic analysis by utilizing transcriptome        data from three different tissues (hepatopancreas, intestine, and gonads) of the        juvenile black tiger shrimp, Penaeus monodon. We compared three important        features: (i) main characteristics of the sequencing libraries and their        alignment with the reference genome, (ii) transcript assembly features and        isoform identification, and (iii) correlation of the quantification of gene        expression levels for both platforms. Our analyses suggest that read-length bias        and differences in sequencing throughput are highly influential factors when        using long reads in transcriptome studies.

Among them are        molecular markers, amplification and sequencing of nucleic acids. The latter is        classified into three generations. The first allows to sequence small DNA        fragments. The second one increases throughput, reducing turnaround and pricing,        and is therefore more convenient to sequence full genomes and transcriptomes. The        third generation is currently pushing technology to its limits, being able to        sequence single molecules, without previous amplification, which was previously        impossible. Besides, this represents a new revolution, allowing researchers to        directly sequence RNA without previous retrotranscription. These technologies are        having a significant impact on different areas, such as medicine, agronomy,        ecology and biotechnology. Additionally, the study of biomolecules is revealing        interesting evolutionary information. That includes deciphering what makes us        human, including phenomena like non-coding RNA expansion. All this is redefining        the concept of gene and transcript. Basic analyses and applications are now        facilitated with new genome editing tools, such as CRISPR.

In        this study, we compared these two approaches for bacterial whole-genome        sequencing, with a specific aim of assessing their ability to recover small        plasmid sequences. To do so, we sequenced DNA from seven plasmid-rich bacterial        isolates in three different ways: ONT ligation, ONT rapid and Illumina. Using the        Illumina read depths to approximate true plasmid abundance, we found that small        plasmids (<20 kbp) were underrepresented in ONT ligation read sets (by a mean        factor of ~4) but were not underrepresented in ONT rapid read sets. This effect        correlated with plasmid size, with the smallest plasmids being the most        underrepresented in ONT ligation read sets. We also found lower rates of        chimaeric reads in the rapid read sets relative to ligation read sets. These        results show that when small plasmid recovery is important, ONT rapid library        preparations are preferable to ligation-based protocols.",PMC8549360,Microbial genomics,101671820

A key challenge in democratizing long-read        sequencing technology in the biomedical and clinical community is the lack of        graphical bioinformatics software tools which can efficiently process the raw        nanopore reads, support graphical output and interactive visualizations for        interpretations of results. Another obstacle is that high performance software        tools for long-read sequencing data analyses often leverage graphics processing        units (GPU), which is challenging and time-consuming to configure, especially on        the cloud. RESULTS: We present a graphical cloud-enabled workflow for fast,        interactive analysis of nanopore sequencing data using GPUs. Users customize        parameters, monitor execution and visualize results through an accessible        graphical interface. The workflow and its components are completely containerized        to ensure reproducibility and facilitate installation of the GPU-enabled        software. We also provide an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) with all software and        drivers pre-installed for GPU computing on the cloud. Most importantly, we        demonstrate the potential of applying our software tools to reduce the turnaround        time of cancer diagnostics by generating blood cancer (NB4, K562, ME1, 238        MV4;11) cell line Nanopore data using the Flongle adapter.

Regulation of        AS is critical for the correct functioning of many biological pathways, while        disruption of AS can be directly pathogenic in diseases such as cancer or cause        risk for complex disorders. Current short-read sequencing technologies achieve        high read depth but are limited in their ability to resolve complex isoforms. In        this review we examine how long-read sequencing (LRS) technologies can address        this challenge by covering the entire RNA sequence in a single read and thereby        distinguish isoform changes that could impact RNA regulation or protein function.        Coupling LRS with technologies such as single cell sequencing, targeted        sequencing and spatial transcriptomics is producing a rapidly expanding suite of        technological approaches to profile alternative splicing at the isoform level        with unprecedented detail. In addition, integrating LRS with genotype now allows        the impact of genetic variation on isoform expression to be determined.

Here, we present a complete haplotype-resolved        genome assembly at a chromosome-scale for Pt using the Australian pathotype        64-(6),(7),(10),11 (Pt64; North American race LBBQB) built upon the newly        developed technologies of PacBio and Hi-C sequencing. PacBio reads with ∼200-fold        coverage (29.8 Gb data) were assembled by Falcon and Falcon-unzip and        subsequently scaffolded with Hi-C data using Falcon-phase and Proximo. This        approach allowed us to construct 18 chromosome pseudomolecules ranging from 3.5        to 12.3 Mb in size for each haplotype of the dikaryotic genome of Pt64. Each        haplotype had a total length of ∼147 Mb, scaffold N (50) of ∼9.4 Mb, and was ∼93%        complete for BUSCOs. Each haplotype had ∼29,800 predicted genes, of which ∼2,000        were predicted as secreted proteins (SPs). The investigation of structural        variants (SVs) between haplotypes A and B revealed that 10% of the total genome        was spanned by SVs, highlighting variations previously undetected by short-read        based assemblies. For the first time, the mating type (MAT) genes on each        haplotype of Pt64 were identified, which showed that MAT loci a and b are located        on two chromosomes (chromosomes 7 and 14), representing a tetrapolar type.        Furthermore, the Pt64 assembly enabled haplotype-based evolutionary analyses for        21 Australian Pt isolates, which highlighted the importance of a haplotype        resolved reference when inferring genetic relationships using whole genome SNPs.        This Pt64 assembly at chromosome-scale with full phase information provides an        invaluable resource for genomic and evolutionary research, which will accelerate        the understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying Pt-wheat interactions and        facilitate the development of durable resistance to leaf rust in wheat and        sustainable control of rust disease.",PMC8358450,Frontiers in microbiology,101548977
34389041,Nanopore sequencing reveals endogenous NMD-targeted isoforms in human cells.,10.1186/s13059-021-02439-3,"BACKGROUND: Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) is a eukaryotic,        translation-dependent degradation pathway that targets mRNAs with premature        termination codons and also regulates the expression of some mRNAs that encode        full-length proteins. Although many genes express NMD-sensitive transcripts,        identifying them based on short-read sequencing data remains a challenge.        RESULTS: To identify and analyze endogenous targets of NMD, we apply cDNA        Nanopore sequencing and short-read sequencing to human cells with varying        expression levels of NMD factors. Our approach detects full-length NMD substrates        that are highly unstable and increase in levels or even only appear when NMD is        inhibited. Among the many new NMD-targeted isoforms that our analysis identifies,        most derive from alternative exon usage. The isoform-aware analysis reveals many        genes with significant changes in splicing but no significant changes in overall        expression levels upon NMD knockdown. NMD-sensitive mRNAs have more exons in the        3΄UTR and, for those mRNAs with a termination codon in the last exon, the length        of the 3΄UTR per se does not correlate with NMD sensitivity. Analysis of splicing        signals reveals isoforms where NMD has been co-opted in the regulation of gene        expression, though the main function of NMD seems to be ridding the transcriptome        of isoforms resulting from spurious splicing events. CONCLUSIONS: Long-read        sequencing enables the identification of many novel NMD-sensitive mRNAs and        reveals both known and unexpected features concerning their biogenesis and their        biological role.

Its root is enriched with various bioactive        molecules mainly iridoids, possessing important pharmaceutical properties.        However, the molecular biology and evolution of R. glutinosa have been largely        unexplored. Here, we report a reference genome of R. glutinosa using Nanopore        technology, Illumina and Hi-C sequencing. The assembly genome is 2.49 Gb long        with a scaffold N50 length of 70 Mb and high heterozygosity (2%). Since R.        glutinosa is an autotetraploid (4n = 56), the difference between each set of        chromosomes is very small, and it is difficult to distinguish the two sets of        chromosomes using Hi-C. Hence, only one set of the genome size was mounted to the        chromosome level. Scaffolds covering 52.61% of the assembled genome were anchored        on 14 pseudochromosomes. Over 67% of the genome consists of repetitive sequences        dominated by Copia long terminal repeats and 48,475 protein-coding genes were        predicted. Phylogenetic analysis corroborates the placement of R. glutinosa in        the Orobanchaceae family. Our results indicated an independent and very recent        whole genome duplication event that occurred 3.64 million year ago in the R.        glutinosa lineage.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A systematic review was        performed including studies concerning genotypes of E. granulosus s.l. without        language or genotyped method restriction, published between 1990 and 2020. A        systematic search was carried out in Trip Database, BIREME, SciELO, LILACS,        IBECS, PAHO-WHO, EMBASE, PubMed, Scopus, and WoS. Variables of interest were year        of publication, country, number of samples, and hosts; genotypes, molecular        marker, haplotypes and molecular biology techniques used. Descriptive statistics        were applied. RESULTS: 2411 articles were analyzed, however 135 met the selection        criteria, representing 8643 liver and lung samples. Of the samples selected 24%        were human, the remaining samples pertained to non-human animal hosts; cattle and        sheep prevailed with 28.6% and 26.6% of the studied samples, respectively. The        reported evidence is mainly from Iran, Turkey, Argentina, China and Chile; with        50, 11, 6, 6 and 5 studies, respectively, published between 1992 and 2020 [most        frequently during 2015-2020 (76/135 studies; 56.3%)]. The mitochondrial gene cox1        was generally sequenced and informative (91.8%). Genotypes most frequently        identified were E. granulosus sensu stricto (s.s.) (83.2%). CONCLUSIONS: Based on        this overall evidence, it can be concluded that publications related to genotypes        of E. granulosus s.l. are heterogeneous. E. granulosus ss accounts for the vast        majority of the global burden of E. granulosus s.l. worldwide. Further studies        including larger number of cases and adequate internal validity are required to        specify the distribution of genotypes in various host species.

Existing work indicates that the        current spectra recorded from SMBJ experimentations contain unique signatures to        identify known sequences from a dataset. However, the spectra are typically        extremely noisy due to the stochastic and complex interactions between the        substrate, sample, environment, and the measuring system, necessitating hundreds        or thousands of experimentations to obtain reliable and accurate results.        RESULTS: This article presents a DNA sequence identification system based on the        current spectra of ten short strand sequences, including a pair that differs by a        single mismatch. By employing a gradient boosted tree classifier model trained on        conductance histograms, we demonstrate that extremely high accuracy, ranging from        approximately 96 % for molecules differing by a single mismatch to 99.5 %        otherwise, is possible. Further, such accuracy metrics are achievable in near        real-time with just twenty or thirty SMBJ measurements instead of hundreds or        thousands. We also demonstrate that a tandem classifier architecture, where the        first stage is a multiclass classifier and the second stage is a binary        classifier, can be employed to boost the single mismatched pair's identification        accuracy to 99.5 %. CONCLUSIONS: A monolithic classifier, or more generally, a        multistage classifier with model specific parameters that depend on experimental        current spectra can be used to successfully identify DNA strands.",PMC8268518,BMC genomics,100965258

In infected hepatocytes, HBV DNA        can be integrated into the host genome through an insertional mutagenesis process        inducing tumorigenesis. Dissection of the genomic features surrounding        integration sites will deepen our understanding of mechanisms underlying        integration. Moreover, the quantity and biological activity of integration sites        may reflect the DNA damage within affected cells or the potential survival        benefits they may confer. The well-known human genomic features include repeat        elements, particular regions (such as telomeres), and frequently interrupted        genes (e.g., telomerase reverse transcriptase [i.e. TERT], lysine        methyltransferase 2B [i.e. KMT2B], cyclin E1 [CCNE1], and cyclin A2 [CCNA2]).        Consequently, distinct genomic features within diverse integrations differentiate        their biological functions. Meanwhile, accumulating evidence has shown that viral        proteins produced by integrants may cause cell damage even after the suppression        of HBV replication. The integration-derived gene products can also serve as tumor        markers, promoting the development of novel therapeutic strategies for HCC. Viral        integrants can be single copy or multiple copies of different fragments with        complicated rearrangement, which warrants elucidation of the whole viral        integrant arrangement in future studies.

Toward this end, we compared the results obtained from different        transcriptome analysis platforms (quantitative polymerase chain reaction,        Illumina RNASeq, and Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION) for the transcriptome        encoded by human chromosome 18 (Chr 18) using the same sample types (HepG2 cells        and liver tissue). A total of 275 protein-coding genes encoded by Chr 18 was        taken as the gene set for evaluation. The combination of Illumina RNASeq and        MinION nanopore technologies enabled the detection of at least one transcript for        each protein-coding gene encoded by Chr 18. This combination also reduced the        probability of false-positive detection of low-copy transcripts due to the        simultaneous confirmation of the presence of a transcript by the two        fundamentally different technologies: short reads essential for reliable        detection (Illumina RNASeq) and long-read sequencing data (MinION). The        combination of these technologies achieved complete coverage of all 275        protein-coding genes on Chr 18, identifying transcripts with non-zero expression        levels.

Increasing integration of whole        exome sequencing into routine diagnostics of rare diseases is improving        diagnostic rates. Nevertheless, about half of the patients do not receive a        genetic diagnosis due to the challenges of variant detection and interpretation.        During the last years, RNA sequencing is increasingly used as a complementary        diagnostic tool providing functional data.

With the application of RNA sequencing to search for the molecular        diagnosis, the implementation of robust statistical models on normalized read        counts allowed for the detection of significant outliers corrected for multiple        testing.

34074310,LazyB: fast and cheap genome assembly.,10.1186/s13015-021-00186-5,"BACKGROUND: Advances in genome sequencing over the last years have lead to a        fundamental paradigm shift in the field. With steadily decreasing sequencing        costs, genome projects are no longer limited by the cost of raw sequencing data,        but rather by computational problems associated with genome assembly. There is an        urgent demand for more efficient and and more accurate methods is particular with        regard to the highly complex and often very large genomes of animals and plants.        Most recently, ""hybrid"" methods that integrate short and long read data have been        devised to address this need. RESULTS: LazyB is such a hybrid genome assembler.        It has been designed specificially with an emphasis on utilizing low-coverage        short and long reads. LazyB starts from a bipartite overlap graph between long        reads and restrictively filtered short-read unitigs. This graph is translated        into a long-read overlap graph G. Instead of the more conventional approach of        removing tips, bubbles, and other local features, LazyB stepwisely extracts        subgraphs whose global properties approach a disjoint union of paths. First, a        consistently oriented subgraph is extracted, which in a second step is reduced to        a directed acyclic graph. In the next step, properties of proper interval graphs        are used to extract contigs as maximum weight paths. These path are translated        into genomic sequences only in the final step. A prototype implementation of        LazyB, entirely written in python, not only yields significantly more accurate        assemblies of the yeast and fruit fly genomes compared to state-of-the-art        pipelines but also requires much less computational effort. CONCLUSIONS: LazyB is        new low-cost genome assembler that copes well with large genomes and low        coverage. It is based on a novel approach for reducing the overlap graph to a        collection of paths, thus opening new avenues for future improvements.        AVAILABILITY: The LazyB prototype is available at        https://github.com/TGatter/LazyB .",PMC8168326,Algorithms for molecular biology : AMB,101265088

S. citri is transmitted in a persistent propagative        manner by the beet leafhopper, Neoaliturus tenellus in North America and        Circulifer haematoceps in the Mediterranean region. Leafhopper transmission and        the pathogen's wide host range serve as drivers of genetic diversity. This        diversity was examined in silico by comparing the genome sequences of seven S.        citri strains from the United States (BR12, CC-2, C5, C189, LB 319, BLH-13, and        BLH-MB) collected from different hosts and times with other publicly available        spiroplasmas. RESULTS: Phylogenetic analysis using 16S rRNA sequences from 39        spiroplasmas obtained from NCBI database showed that S. citri strains, along with        S. kunkelii and S. phoeniceum, two other plant pathogenic spiroplasmas, formed a        monophyletic group. To refine genetic relationships among S. citri strains,        phylogenetic analyses with 863 core orthologous sequences were performed. Strains        that clustered together were: CC-2 and C5; C189 and R8-A2; BR12, BLH-MB, BLH-13        and LB 319. Strain GII3-3X remained in a separate branch. Sequence rearrangements        were observed among S. citri strains, predominantly in the center of the        chromosome. One to nine plasmids were identified in the seven S. citri strains        analyzed in this study. Plasmids were most abundant in strains isolated from the        beet leafhopper, followed by strains from carrot, Chinese cabbage, horseradish,        and citrus, respectively. All these S. citri strains contained one plasmid with        high similarity to plasmid pSci6 from S. citri strain GII3-3X which is known to        confer insect transmissibility. Additionally, 17 to 25 prophage-like elements        were identified in these genomes, which may promote rearrangements and contribute        to repetitive regions. CONCLUSIONS: The genome of seven S. citri strains were        found to contain a single circularized chromosome, ranging from 1.58 Mbp to 1.74        Mbp and 1597-2232 protein-coding genes. These strains possessed a plasmid similar        to pSci6 from the GII3-3X strain associated with leafhopper transmission.        Prophage sequences found in the S. citri genomes may contribute to the extension        of its host range.

Though metagenomic short-read sequencing has greatly        improved our virus ecology toolkit-and revealed many critical ecosystem roles for        viruses-microdiverse populations and fine-scale genomic traits are missed. Some        of these microdiverse populations are abundant and the missed regions may be of        interest for identifying selection pressures that underpin evolutionary        constraints associated with hosts and environments. Though long-read sequencing        promises complete virus genomes on single reads, it currently suffers from high        DNA requirements and sequencing errors that limit accurate gene prediction. Here        we introduce VirION2, an integrated short- and long-read metagenomic wet-lab and        informatics pipeline that updates our previous method (VirION) to further enhance        the utility of long-read viral metagenomics.

VirION2        assemblies combined with short-read based data ('enhanced' viromes), provided        significant improvements over VirION libraries in the recovery of longer and more        complete viral genomes, and our optimized error-correction strategy using long-        and short-read data achieved 99.97% accuracy. In the seawater virome, VirION2        assemblies captured 5,161 viral populations (including all of the virus        populations observed in the other assemblies), 30% of which were uniquely        assembled through inclusion of long-reads, and 22% of the top 10% most abundant        virus populations derived from assembly of long-reads.

New computational methods are still needed to improve        the performance of domain prediction in long noisy reads. RESULTS: In this work,        we introduce ProDOMA, a deep learning model that conducts domain classification        for TGS reads. It uses deep neural networks with 3-frame translation encoding to        learn conserved features from partially correct translations. In addition, we        formulate our problem as an open-set problem and thus our model can reject reads        not containing the targeted domains. In the experiments on simulated long reads        of protein coding sequences and real TGS reads from the human genome, our model        outperforms HMMER and DeepFam on protein domain classification. CONCLUSIONS: In        summary, ProDOMA is a useful end-to-end protein domain analysis tool for long        noisy reads without relying on error correction.",PMC8033682,BMC genomics,100965258

Various correlates of variation in genome size, such as        accumulation of transposable elements (TEs) or rate of DNA gain and loss, are        well known, but the underlying molecular mechanisms driving or constraining        genome size are poorly understood. Here, we study one of the smallest genomes        among frogs characterized thus far, that of the ornate burrowing frog        (Platyplectrum ornatum) from Australia, and compare it to other published frog        and vertebrate genomes to examine the forces driving reduction in genome size. At        ∼1.06 gigabases (Gb), the P. ornatum genome is like that of birds, revealing four        major mechanisms underlying TE dynamics: reduced abundance of all major classes        of TEs; increased net deletion bias in TEs; drastic reduction in intron lengths;        and expansion via gene duplication of the repertoire of TE-suppressing Piwi        genes, accompanied by increased expression of Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA)-based        TE-silencing pathway genes in germline cells. Transcriptomes from multiple        tissues in both sexes corroborate these results and provide insight into        sex-differentiation pathways in Platyplectrum Genome skimming of two closely        related frog species (Lechriodus fletcheri and Limnodynastes fletcheri) confirms        a reduction in TEs as a major driver of genome reduction in Platyplectrum and        supports a macroevolutionary scenario of small genome size in frogs driven by        convergence in life history, especially rapid tadpole development and tadpole        diet.

Recovery of DNA and RNA for such studies        is challenged by common biological properties of the highly diverse molluscs.        Molluscan biomineralization, adhesive structures and mucus involve polyphenolic        proteins and mucopolysaccharides that hinder DNA extraction or copurify to        inhibit enzyme-catalysed molecular procedures. DNA extraction methods that employ        the detergent hexadecyltrimethylammoniumbromide (CTAB) to remove these        contaminants importantly facilitate molecular-level study of molluscs. Molluscan        pigments may stain DNA samples and interfere with spectrophotometry,        necessitating gel electrophoresis or fluorometry for accurate quantification. RNA        can reliably be extracted but the 'hidden break' in 28S rRNA of molluscs (like        most protostomes) causes 18S and 28S rRNA fragments to co-migrate        electrophoretically.

As our understanding of the LS        phenotype and diagnostic technologies have advanced, there is a need to review        these guidelines and new screening opportunities. We discuss the barriers to        implementation of current guidelines, as well as guideline limitations, and        highlight new technologies and knowledge that may address these. We also discuss        alternative screening strategies to increase the rate of LS diagnoses. In        particular, the focus of current guidance on CRCs means that approximately half        of Lynch-spectrum tumours occurring in unknown male LS carriers, and only        one-third in female LS carriers, will trigger testing for LS. There is increasing        pressure to expand guidelines to include molecular screening of endometrial        cancers, the most frequent cancer in female LS carriers. Furthermore, we collate        the evidence to support MMR deficiency testing of other Lynch-spectrum tumours to        screen for LS. However, a reliance on tumour tissue limits preoperative testing        and, therefore, diagnosis prior to malignancy.

Recently, RNA        sequencing has proven to be an effective complementary avenue to detect aberrant        splicing. Here, we develop FRASER, an algorithm to detect aberrant splicing from        RNA sequencing data. Unlike existing methods, FRASER captures not only        alternative splicing but also intron retention events. This typically doubles the        number of detected aberrant events and identified a pathogenic intron retention        in MCOLN1 causing mucolipidosis. FRASER automatically controls for latent        confounders, which are widespread and affect sensitivity substantially. Moreover,        FRASER is based on a count distribution and multiple testing correction, thus        reducing the number of calls by two orders of magnitude over commonly applied z        score cutoffs, with a minor loss of sensitivity.

This has a number of limitations, with the most significant being bias        towards the detection of culturable organisms and the inherent delay between        sample collection and ground-based analysis. In recent years, portable and        easy-to-use molecular-based tools, such as Oxford Nanopore Technologies' MinION™        sequencer and miniPCR bio's miniPCR™ thermal cycler, have been validated onboard        the ISS. Here, we report on the development, validation, and implementation of a        swab-to-sequencer method that provides a culture-independent solution to        real-time microbial profiling onboard the ISS. Method development focused on        analysis of swabs collected in a low-biomass environment with limited facility        resources and stringent controls on allowed processes and reagents. ISS-optimized        procedures included enzymatic DNA extraction from a swab tip, bead-based        purifications, altered buffers, and the use of miniPCR and the MinION. Validation        was conducted through extensive ground-based assessments comparing current        standard culture-dependent and newly developed culture-independent methods.        Similar microbial distributions were observed between the two methods; however,        as expected, the culture-independent data revealed microbial profiles with        greater diversity. Protocol optimization and verification was established during        NASA Extreme Environment Mission Operations (NEEMO) analog missions 21 and 22,        respectively. Unique microbial profiles obtained from analog testing validated        the swab-to-sequencer method in an extreme environment.

Genomics-assisted aquaculture can        increase yield while preserving the environment to ensure sufficient and        sustainable production for global food security. However, only few high-quality        genome sequences of marine organisms, especially shellfish, are available to the        public partly because of the difficulty in the sequence assembly due to the        complex nature of their genomes. A key step for a successful genome sequencing is        the preparation of high-quality high molecular weight (HMW) genomic DNA. This        study evaluated the effectiveness of five DNA extraction protocols (CTAB,        Genomic-tip, Mollusc DNA, TIANamp Marine Animals DNA, and Sbeadex livestock kits)        in obtaining shrimp HMW DNA for a long-read sequencing platform. DNA samples were        assessed for quality and quantity using a Qubit fluorometer, NanoDrop        spectrophotometer and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Among the five extraction        methods examined without further optimization, the Genomic-tip kit yielded        genomic DNA with the highest quality. However, further modifications of these        established protocols might yield even better DNA quality and quantity. To        further investigate whether the obtained genomic DNA could be used in a long-read        sequencing application, DNA samples from the top three extraction methods (CTAB        method, Genomic-tip and Mollusc DNA kits) were used for Pacific Biosciences        (PacBio) library construction and sequencing. Genomic DNA obtained from        Genomic-tip and Mollusc DNA kits allowed successful library construction, while        the DNA obtained from the CTAB method did not. Genomic DNA isolated using the        Genomic-tip kit yielded a higher number of long reads (N50 of 14.57 Kb) than        those obtained from Mollusc DNA kits (N50 of 9.74 Kb). Thus, this study        identified an effective extraction method for high-quality HMW genomic DNA of        shrimp that can be applied to other marine organisms for a long-read sequencing        platform.",PMC7668203,PeerJ,101603425

We        recently introduced a novel DNA labeling strategy based on a CRISPR-Cas9 genome        editing system, which can target any 20bp sequences. The labeling strategy is        specifically useful in targeting repetitive sequences, and sequences not        accessible to other labeling methods. In this report, we present customized        mapping strategies that extend the applications of CRISPR-Cas9 DNA labeling. We        first design a CRISPR-Cas9 labeling strategy to interrogate and differentiate the        single allele differences in NGG protospacer adjacent motifs (PAM sequence).        Combined with sequence motif labeling, we can pinpoint the single-base        differences in highly conserved sequences. In the second strategy, we design        mapping patterns across a genome by selecting sets of specific single-guide RNAs        (sgRNAs) for labeling multiple loci of a genomic region or a whole genome. By        developing and optimizing a single tube synthesis of multiple sgRNAs, we        demonstrate the utility of CRISPR-Cas9 mapping with 162 sgRNAs targeting the 2Mb        Haemophilus influenzae chromosome. These CRISPR-Cas9 mapping approaches could be        particularly useful for applications in defining long-distance haplotypes and        pinpointing the breakpoints in large structural variants in complex genomes and        microbial mixtures.",PMC7826249,Nucleic acids research,0411011

To achieve a high-quality genome assembly, we        used the combination of two sequencing platforms - Oxford Nanopore Technologies        (MinION system) with long noisy reads and Illumina (HiSeq 2500 instrument) with        short accurate reads. Given the quality of DNA is crucial for Nanopore        sequencing, we developed the protocol for extraction of pure        high-molecular-weight DNA from fungi. Sequencing of DNA extracted using this        protocol allowed us to obtain about 85x genome coverage with long (N50 = 29 kb)        MinION reads and 30x coverage with 2 × 250 bp HiSeq reads. Several tools were        developed for genome assembly; however, they provide different results depending        on genome complexity, sequencing data volume, read length and quality. We        benchmarked the most requested assemblers (Canu, Flye, Shasta, wtdbg2, and        MaSuRCA), Nanopore polishers (Medaka and Racon), and Illumina polishers (Pilon        and POLCA) on our sequencing data. The assembly performed with Canu and polished        with Medaka and POLCA was considered the most full and accurate.

A        human-specific SVA in the promoter region of the gene leucine-rich repeats and        immunoglobulin-like domains 2 (LRIG2), which we termed SVA_LRIG2, is a common        retrotransposon insertion polymorphism (RIP), defined as an element which is        polymorphic for its presence or absence in the genome. We hypothesised that this        RIP might be associated with differential levels of expression of LRIG2. The RIP        genotype of SVA_LRIG2 was determined in a subset of frontal cortex DNA samples        from the North American Brain Expression Consortium (NABEC) cohort and was        imputed for a larger set of that cohort. Utilising available frontal cortex total        RNA-seq and CpG methylation data for this cohort, we observed that increased        allele dosage of SVA_LRIG2 was non-significantly associated with a decrease in        transcription from the region and significantly associated with increased        methylation of the CpG probe nearest to SVA_LRIG2, i.e., SVA_LRIG2 is a        significant methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTL) at the LRIG2 locus.

The most predominant yeasts species        are Debaryomyces hansenii, Geotrichum candidum, Kluyveromyces marxianus,        Kluyveromyces lactis, Rhodotorula mucilaginosa, and Trichosporon spp. Although        their spoilage potential varies at both species and strain levels, yeasts will,        in case of excessive growth, present a microbiological hazard, effecting cheese        quality. To evaluate the hazard and trace routes of contamination, the exact        taxonomic classification of yeasts is required. Today, identification of dairy        yeasts is mainly based on DNA sequencing, various genotyping techniques, and, to        some extent, advanced phenotypic identification technologies. Even though these        technologies are state of the art at the scientific level, they are only hardly        implemented at the industrial level. Quality defects, caused by yeasts in        white-brined cheese, are mainly linked to enzymatic activities and metabolism of        fermentable carbohydrates, leading to production of metabolites (CO(2), fatty        acids, volatile compounds, amino acids, sulfur compounds, etc.) and resulting in        off-flavors, texture softening, discoloration, and swelling of cheese packages.        The proliferation of spoilage yeast depends on maturation and storage conditions        at each specific dairy, product characteristics, nutrients availability, and        interactions with the co-existing microorganisms. To prevent and control yeast        contamination, different strategies based on the principles of HACCP and Good        Manufacturing Practice (GMP) have been introduced in white-brined cheese        production. These strategies include milk pasteurization, refrigeration, hygienic        sanitation, air filtration, as well as aseptic and modified atmosphere packaging.        Though a lot of research has been dedicated to yeasts in dairy products, the role        of yeast contaminants, specifically in white-brined cheeses, is still        insufficiently understood.

However, limitations in sequencing        technologies have biased the annotation toward multi-exonic protein coding genes.        Accurate high-throughput long read transcript sequencing can now provide        additional evidence for rare transcripts and genes such as mono-exonic and        non-coding genes that were previously either undetectable or impossible to        differentiate from sequencing noise. RESULTS: We developed the Transcriptome        Annotation by Modular Algorithms (TAMA) software to leverage the power of long        read transcript sequencing and address the issues with current data processing        pipelines. TAMA achieved high sensitivity and precision for gene and transcript        model predictions in both reference guided and unguided approaches in our        benchmark tests using simulated Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and Nanopore        sequencing data and real PacBio datasets. By analyzing PacBio Sequel II Iso-Seq        sequencing data of the Universal Human Reference RNA (UHRR) using TAMA and other        commonly used tools, we found that the convention of using alignment identity to        measure error correction performance does not reflect actual gain in accuracy of        predicted transcript models. In addition, inter-read error correction can cause        major changes to read mapping, resulting in potentially over 6 K erroneous gene        model predictions in the Iso-Seq based human genome annotation. Using TAMA's        genome assembly based error correction and gene feature evidence, we predicted        2566 putative novel non-coding genes and 1557 putative novel protein coding gene        models. CONCLUSIONS: Long read transcript sequencing data has the power to        identify novel genes within the highly annotated human genome. The use of        parameter tuning and extensive output information of the TAMA software package        allows for in depth exploration of eukaryotic transcriptomes. We have found long        read data based evidence for thousands of unannotated genes within the human        genome.

In        recent decades, many new organic compounds have ended up in surface waters in        concentrations that, while very low, cause (chronic) toxicity to countless        organisms. These organic micropollutants (OMPs) are usually quite recalcitrant        and not sufficiently removed during wastewater treatment. Microbial degradation        plays a pivotal role in OMP conversion. Microorganisms can adapt their metabolism        to the use of novel molecules via mutations and rearrangements of existing genes        in new clusters. Many catabolic genes have been found adjacent to mobile genetic        elements (MGEs), which provide a stable scaffold to host new catabolic pathways        and spread these genes in the microbial community. These mobile systems could be        engineered to enhance OMP degradation in WWTPs, and this review aims to summarize        and better understand the role that MGEs might play in the degradation and        wastewater treatment process. Available data about the presence of catabolic MGEs        in WWTPs are reviewed, and current methods used to identify and measure MGEs in        environmental samples are critically evaluated. Finally, examples of how these        MGEs could be used to improve micropollutant degradation in WWTPs are outlined.        In the near future, advances in the use of MGEs will hopefully enable us to apply        selective augmentation strategies to improve OMP conversion in WWTPs.",PMC7494797,Water research X,101742109
