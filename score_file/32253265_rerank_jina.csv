Unravelling glioblastoma heterogeneity by means of single-cell RNA sequencing,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most invasive and deadliest brain cancer in adults. Its inherent heterogeneity has been designated as the main cause of treatment failure. Thus, a deeper understanding of the diversity that shapes GBM pathobiology is of utmost importance. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies have begun to uncover the hidden composition of complex tumor ecosystems. Herein, a semi-systematic search of reference literature databases provided all existing publications using scRNA-seq for the investigation of human GBM. We compared and discussed findings from these works to build a more robust and unified knowledge base. All aspects ranging from inter-patient heterogeneity to intra-tumoral organization, cancer stem cell diversity, clonal mosaicism, and the tumor microenvironment (TME) are comprehensively covered in this report. Tumor composition not only differs across patients but also involves a great extent of heterogeneity within itself. Spatial and cellular heterogeneity can reveal tumor evolution dynamics. In addition, the discovery of distinct cell phenotypes might lead to the development of targeted treatment approaches. In conclusion, scRNA-seq expands our knowledge of GBM heterogeneity and helps to unravel putative therapeutic targets.",34902524,,10.1016/j.canlet.2021.12.008,20,Cancer letters,7600053,9.756,0.9801293015480042,0.7892976588628763,0.7759197324414716,0.901121059189672
Unveiling the Dynamics behind Glioblastoma Multiforme Single-Cell Data Heterogeneity,"Glioblastoma Multiforme is a brain tumor distinguished by its aggressiveness. We suggested that this aggressiveness leads single-cell RNA-sequence data (scRNA-seq) to span a representative portion of the cancer attractors domain. This conjecture allowed us to interpret the scRNA-seq heterogeneity as reflecting a representative trajectory within the attractor's domain. We considered factors such as genomic instability to characterize the cancer dynamics through stochastic fixed points. The fixed points were derived from centroids obtained through various clustering methods to verify our method sensitivity. This methodological foundation is based upon sample and time average equivalence, assigning an interpretative value to the data cluster centroids and supporting parameters estimation. We used stochastic simulations to reproduce the dynamics, and our results showed an alignment between experimental and simulated dataset centroids. We also computed the Waddington landscape, which provided a visual framework for validating the centroids and standard deviations as characterizations of cancer attractors. Additionally, we examined the stability and transitions between attractors and revealed a potential interplay between subtypes. These transitions might be related to cancer recurrence and progression, connecting the molecular mechanisms of cancer heterogeneity with statistical properties of gene expression dynamics. Our work advances the modeling of gene expression dynamics and paves the way for personalized therapeutic interventions.",38732140,PMC11084314,10.3390/ijms25094894,0,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,6.208,0.9764904975891113,0.0,0.41471571906354515,0.6688374423661758
Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals intra-tumoral heterogeneity of glioblastoma and a pro-tumor subset of tumor-associated macrophages characterized by EZH2 overexpression,"Background:Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly heterogeneous disease with poor clinical outcome.Aim:To comprehensively dissect molecular landscape of GBM and heterogeneous distribution and potential role of Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) in tumor microenvironment (TME).Methods:Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis was performed in GBM samples from 8 patients. Deconvolution analysis, immunofluorescence (IF) microscopy, reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), colony formation experiments, and Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assays were performed to confirmed the potential role of EZH2 in TME cells.Results:Malignant cells exhibited remarkable heterogeneity in abnormal metabolic patterns. A mesenchymal-2-like (MES2-like) GBM subcluster with glial-immune dual feature was firstly discovered, which were associated with highly activated hallmark pathways, immune evasion associated transcription factor (IRF8), and poor survival. The oncogene, EZH2, was heterogeneously expressed in malignant cells and immune cells consistent with proliferative genes, cell-cycle transcription factors, and similar activated hallmark pathways. In a tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) subset (macrophage.3), EZH2 was highly expressed with similar changes of transcriptomic dynamics with cell-cycle genes and macrophages M2-phetotype genes. In addition, the subset tightly interacted with malignant cells. Deconvolution analysis showed increased abundance of the subset in GBM compared to low-grade glioma (LGG) and significant association with worse prognosis. Functional verification experiments confirmed the pro-tumor role of TAMs with EZH2 overexpression in GBM.Conclusions:Our study illustrated a MES2-like GBM subcluster characterized by glial-immune dual feature and highlighted the pro-tumor role of a TAMs subset characterized by EZH2 overexpression.",36057370,,10.1016/j.bbadis.2022.166534,4,Biochimica et biophysica acta.

"Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals tumor heterogeneity, microenvironment, and drug-resistance mechanisms of recurrent glioblastoma","Glioblastomas are highly heterogeneous brain tumors. Despite the availability of standard treatment for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), i.e., Stupp protocol, which involves surgical resection followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy, glioblastoma remains refractory to treatment and recurrence is inevitable. Moreover, the biology of recurrent glioblastoma remains unclear. Increasing evidence has shown that intratumoral heterogeneity and the tumor microenvironment contribute to therapeutic resistance. However, the interaction between intracellular heterogeneity and drug resistance in recurrent GBMs remains controversial. The aim of this study was to map the transcriptome landscape of cancer cells and the tumor heterogeneity and tumor microenvironment in recurrent and drug-resistant GBMs at a single-cell resolution and further explore the mechanism of drug resistance of GBMs. We analyzed six tumor tissue samples from three patients with primary GBM and three patients with recurrent GBM in which recurrence and drug resistance developed after treatment with the standard Stupp protocol using single-cell RNA sequencing. Using unbiased clustering, nine major cell clusters were identified. Upregulation of the expression of stemness-related and cell-cycle-related genes was observed in recurrent GBM cells. Compared with the initial GBM tissues, recurrent GBM tissues showed a decreased proportion of microglia, consistent with previous reports. Finally, vascular endothelial growth factor A expression and the blood-brain barrier permeability were high, and the O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase-related signaling pathway was activated in recurrent GBM. Our results delineate the single-cell map of recurrent glioblastoma, tumor heterogeneity, tumor microenvironment, and drug-resistance mechanisms, providing new insights into treatment strategies for recurrent glioblastomas.",36853018,PMC10236634,10.1111/cas.15773,5,Cancer science,101168776,6.518,0.934634268283844,0.5183946488294314,0.47491638795986624,0.7594427683281659
Characterization of tumor microenvironment in glioblastoma multiforme identifies ITGB2 as a key immune and stromal related regulator in glial cell types,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive form of brain tumor characterized by inter and intra-tumor heterogeneity and complex tumor microenvironment. To uncover the molecular targets in this milieu, we systematically identified immune and stromal interactions at the glial cell type level that leverages on RNA-sequencing data of GBM patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas. The perturbed genes between the high vs low immune and stromal scored patients were subjected to weighted gene co-expression network analysis to identify the glial cell type specific networks in immune and stromal infiltrated patients. The intramodular connectivity analysis identified the highly connected genes in each module. Combining it with univariable and multivariable prognostic analysis revealed common vital gene ITGB2, between the immune and stromal infiltrated patients enriched in microglia and newly formed oligodendrocytes. We found following unique hub genes in immune infiltrated patients; COL6A3 (microglia), ITGAM (oligodendrocyte precursor cells), TNFSF9 (microglia), and in stromal infiltrated patients, SERPINE1 (microglia) and THBS1 (newly formed oligodendrocytes, oligodendrocyte precursor cells). To validate these hub genes, we used external GBM patient single cell RNA-sequencing dataset and this identified ITGB2 to be significantly enriched in microglia, newly formed oligodendrocytes, T-cells, macrophages and adipocyte cell types in both immune and stromal datasets. The tumor infiltration analysis of ITGB2 showed that it is correlated with myeloid dendritic cells, macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils, B-cells, fibroblasts and adipocytes. Overall, the systematic screening of tumor microenvironment components at glial cell types uncovered ITGB2 as a potential target in primary GBM.",37660569,,10.1016/j.compbiomed.2023.107433,3,Computers in biology and medicine,1250250,6.698,0.9304582476615906,0.4280936454849498,0.4983277591973244,0.7435592295334092
"""Zooming in"" on Glioblastoma: Understanding Tumor Heterogeneity and its Clinical Implications in the Era of Single-Cell Ribonucleic Acid Sequencing","Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary brain malignancy in adults and one of the most aggressive of all human cancers. It is highly recurrent and treatment-resistant, in large part due to its infiltrative nature and inter- and intratumoral heterogeneity. This heterogeneity entails varying genomic landscapes and cell types within and between tumors and the tumor microenvironment (TME). In GBM, heterogeneity is a driver of treatment resistance, recurrence, and poor prognosis, representing a substantial impediment to personalized medicine. Over the last decade, sequencing technologies have facilitated deeper understanding of GBM heterogeneity by ""zooming in"" progressively further on tumor genomics and transcriptomics. Initial efforts employed bulk ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing, which examines composite gene expression of whole tumor specimens. While groundbreaking at the time, this bulk RNAseq masks the crucial contributions of distinct tumor subpopulations to overall gene expression. This work progressed to the use of bulk RNA sequencing in anatomically and spatially distinct tumor subsections, which demonstrated previously underappreciated genomic complexity of GBM. A revolutionary next step forward has been the advent of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq), which examines gene expression at the single-cell level. scRNAseq has enabled us to understand GBM heterogeneity in unprecedented detail. We review seminal studies in our progression of understanding GBM heterogeneity, with a focus on scRNAseq and the insights that it has provided into understanding the GBM tumor mass, peritumoral space, and TME. We highlight preclinical and clinical implications of this work and consider its potential to impact neuro-oncology and to improve patient outcomes via personalized medicine.",32674143,,10.1093/neuros/nyaa305,9,Neurosurgery,7802914,5.315,0.8987665772438049,0.6555183946488294,0.3712374581939799,0.7446111169148448
Tumor Microenvironment Is Critical for the Maintenance of Cellular States Found in Primary Glioblastomas,"Glioblastoma (GBM), an incurable tumor, remains difficult to model and more importantly to treat due to its genetic/epigenetic heterogeneity and plasticity across cellular states. The ability of current tumor models to recapitulate the cellular states found in primary tumors remains unexplored. To address this issue, we compared single-cell RNA sequencing of tumor cells from 5 patients across four patient-specific glioblastoma stem cell (GSC)-derived model types, including glioma spheres, tumor organoids, glioblastoma cerebral organoids (GLICO), and patient-derived xenografts. We find that GSCs within the GLICO model are enriched for a neural progenitor-like cell subpopulation and recapitulate the cellular states and their plasticity found in the corresponding primary parental tumors. These data demonstrate how the contribution of a neuroanatomically accurate human microenvironment is critical and sufficient for recapitulating the cellular states found in human primary GBMs, a principle that may likely apply to other tumor models. SIGNIFICANCE: It has been unclear how well different patient-derived GBM models are able to recreate the full heterogeneity of primary tumors. Here, we provide a complete transcriptomic characterization of the major model types. We show that the microenvironment is crucial for recapitulating GSC cellular states, highlighting the importance of tumor-host cell interactions.See related commentary by Luo and Weiss, p. 907.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 890.",32253265,PMC10256258,10.1158/2159-8290.CD-20-0057,64,Cancer discovery,101561693,38.272,0.8879840970039368,0.9331103678929766,0.9765886287625418,0.9147302575334658
Cancer biology deciphered by single-cell transcriptomic sequencing,"Tumors are complex ecosystems in which heterogeneous cancer cells interact with their microenvironment composed of diverse immune, endothelial, and stromal cells. Cancer biology had been studied using bulk genomic and gene expression profiling, which however mask the cellular diversity and average the variability among individual molecular programs. Recent advances in single-cell transcriptomic sequencing have enabled a detailed dissection of tumor ecosystems and promoted our understanding of tumorigenesis at single-cell resolution. In the present review, we discuss the main topics of recent cancer studies that have implemented single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). To study cancer cells, scRNA-seq has provided novel insights into the cancer stem-cell model, treatment resistance, and cancer metastasis. To study the tumor microenvironment, scRNA-seq has portrayed the diverse cell types and complex cellular states of both immune and non-immune cells interacting with cancer cells, with the promise to discover novel targets for future immunotherapy.",34405376,PMC8901819,10.1007/s13238-021-00868-1,15,Protein & cell,101532368,15.328,0.8873999118804932,0.7525083612040134,0.8996655518394648,0.8628747297369916
Transcriptome analysis reveals tumor microenvironment changes in glioblastoma,"A better understanding of transcriptional evolution of IDH-wild-type glioblastoma may be crucial for treatment optimization. Here, we perform RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) (n = 322 test, n = 245 validation) on paired primary-recurrent glioblastoma resections of patients treated with the current standard of care. Transcriptional subtypes form an interconnected continuum in a two-dimensional space. Recurrent tumors show preferential mesenchymal progression. Over time, hallmark glioblastoma genes are not significantly altered. Instead, tumor purity decreases over time and is accompanied by co-increases in neuron and oligodendrocyte marker genes and, independently, tumor-associated macrophages. A decrease is observed in endothelial marker genes. These composition changes are confirmed by single-cell RNA-seq and immunohistochemistry. An extracellular matrix-associated gene set increases at recurrence and bulk, single-cell RNA, and immunohistochemistry indicate it is expressed mainly by pericytes. This signature is associated with significantly worse survival at recurrence. Our data demonstrate that glioblastomas evolve mainly by microenvironment (re-)organization rather than molecular evolution of tumor cells.",36898379,,10.1016/j.ccell.2023.02.019,32,Cancer cell,101130617,38.585,0.8828325867652893,0.8595317725752508,0.9899665551839465,0.899599217611013
Highly Multiplexed Spatially Resolved Proteomic and Transcriptional Profiling of the Glioblastoma Microenvironment Using Archived Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded Specimens,"Glioblastoma is a heterogeneous tumor for which effective treatment options are limited and often insufficient. Few studies have examined the intratumoral transcriptional and proteomic heterogeneity of the glioblastoma microenvironment to characterize the spatial distribution of potential molecular and cellular therapeutic immunooncology targets. We applied an integrated multimodal approach comprised of NanoString GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling, single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq), and expert neuropathologic assessment to characterize archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded glioblastoma specimens. Clustering analysis and spatial cluster maps highlighted the intratumoral heterogeneity of each specimen. Mixed cell deconvolution analysis revealed that neoplastic and vascular cells were the prominent cell types throughout each specimen, with macrophages, oligodendrocyte precursors, neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes present in lower abundance and illustrated the regional distribution of the respective cellular enrichment scores. The spatial resolution of the actionable immunotherapeutic landscape showed that robust B7H3 gene and protein expression was broadly distributed throughout each specimen and identified STING and VISTA as potential targets. Lastly, we uncovered remarkable variability in VEGFA expression and discovered unanticipated associations between VEGFA, endothelial cell markers, hypoxia, and the expression of immunoregulatory genes, indicative of regionally distinct immunosuppressive microdomains. This work provides an early demonstration of the ability of an integrated panel-based spatial biology approach to characterize and quantify the intrinsic molecular heterogeneity of the glioblastoma microenvironment.",36788070,PMC9937641,10.1016/j.modpat.2022.100034,5,Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy,8806605,8.209,0.8675976395606995,0.5217391304347826,0.6086956521739131,0.7466455402581589
Heterogeneity and individualized treatment of microenvironment in glioblastoma (Review),"The heterogeneity of glioblastoma can suppress immune cell function and lead to immune evasion, which presents a challenge in developing effective molecular therapies for tumor cells. However, the study of tumor immune heterogeneity holds great potential for clinical immunotherapy. Liquid biopsy is a useful tool for accurately monitoring dynamic changes in tumor immune heterogeneity and the tumor microenvironment. This paper explores the heterogeneity of glioblastoma and the immune microenvironment, providing a therapeutic basis for individualized treatment. Using liquid biopsy technology as a new diagnostic method, innovative treatment strategies may be implemented for patients with glioblastoma to improve their outcomes.",37888767,PMC10636722,10.3892/or.2023.8654,0,Oncology reports,9422756,4.136,0.8635067343711853,0.0033444816053511705,0.24749163879598662,0.5682712647029787
Single-Cell Transcriptome Profiling Signatures and Alterations of Microglia Associated With Glioblastoma Associate Microglia Contribution to Tumor Formation,"Glioblastoma (GBM), which occasionally occurs in pediatric patients, is the most common tumor of the central nervous system in adults. Clinically, GBM is classified as low-grade to high-grade (from 1 to 4) and is characterized by late discovery, limited effective treatment methods, and poor efficacy. With the development of immunotherapy technology, effective GBM treatment strategies are of great significance. The main immune cells found in the GBM tumor microenvironment are macrophages and microglia (MG). Both these monocytes play important roles in the occurrence and development of GBM. Macrophages are recruited during tumorigenesis, whereas MG is present in the brain during embryonic development. Interestingly, the accumulation of these monocytes is inversely proportional to the survival of adult GBM patients but not the pediatric GBM patients. This study used single-cell RNA-seq data to reveal the heterogeneity of MG in tumor lesions and to explore the role of different MG subtypes in the occurrence and development of GBM. The results may help find new targets for immunotherapy of GBM.",35693633,PMC9176381,10.3389/pore.2022.1610067,3,Pathology oncology research : POR,9706087,2.874,0.8578872084617615,0.431438127090301,0.1505016722408027,0.6311202849432777
"Glioblastoma scRNA-seq shows treatment-induced, immune-dependent increase in mesenchymal cancer cells and structural variants in distal neural stem cells","Background:Glioblastoma is a treatment-resistant brain cancer. Its hierarchical cellular nature and its tumor microenvironment (TME) before, during, and after treatments remain unresolved.Methods:Here, we used single-cell RNA sequencing to analyze new and recurrent glioblastoma and the nearby subventricular zone (SVZ).Results:We found 4 glioblastoma neural lineages are present in new and recurrent glioblastoma with an enrichment of the cancer mesenchymal lineage, immune cells, and reactive astrocytes in early recurrences. Cancer lineages were hierarchically organized around cycling oligodendrocytic and astrocytic progenitors that are transcriptomically similar but distinct to SVZ neural stem cells (NSCs). Furthermore, NSCs from the SVZ of patients with glioblastoma harbored glioblastoma chromosomal anomalies. Lastly, mesenchymal cancer cells and TME reactive astrocytes shared similar gene signatures which were induced by radiotherapy in a myeloid-dependent fashion in vivo.Conclusion:These data reveal the dynamic, immune-dependent nature of glioblastoma's response to treatments and identify distant NSCs as likely cells of origin.",35416251,PMC9435507,10.1093/neuonc/noac085,7,Neuro-oncology,100887420,13.029,0.8474634885787964,0.5919732441471572,0.8361204013377926,0.7940968222442677
The diversity and dynamics of tumor-associated macrophages in recurrent glioblastoma,"Despite tremendous efforts to exploit effective therapeutic strategies, most glioblastoma (GBM) inevitably relapse and become resistant to therapies, including radiotherapy and immunotherapy. The tumor microenvironment (TME) of recurrent GBM (rGBM) is highly immunosuppressive, dominated by tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). TAMs consist of tissue-resident microglia and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs), which are essential for favoring tumor growth, invasion, angiogenesis, immune suppression, and therapeutic resistance; however, restricted by the absence of potent methods, the heterogeneity and plasticity of TAMs in rGBM remain incompletely investigated. Recent application of single-cell technologies, such as single-cell RNA-sequencing has enabled us to decipher the unforeseen diversity and dynamics of TAMs and to identify new subsets of TAMs which regulate anti-tumor immunity. Here, we first review hallmarks of the TME, progress and challenges of immunotherapy, and the biology of TAMs in the context of rGBM, including their origins, categories, and functions. Next, from a single-cell perspective, we highlight recent findings regarding the distinctions between tissue-resident microglia and MDMs, the identification and characterization of specific TAM subsets, and the dynamic alterations of TAMs during tumor progression and treatment. Last, we briefly discuss the potential of TAM-targeted strategies for combination immunotherapy in rGBM. We anticipate the comprehensive understanding of the diversity and dynamics of TAMs in rGBM will shed light on further improvement of immunotherapeutic efficacy in rGBM.",37731483,PMC10507272,10.3389/fimmu.2023.1238233,4,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,8.786,0.837619960308075,0.4882943143812709,0.6454849498327759,0.7293278290276544
Single-cell sequencing reveals the landscape of the human brain metastatic microenvironment,"Brain metastases is the most common intracranial tumor and account for approximately 20% of all systematic cancer cases. It is a leading cause of death in advanced-stage cancer, resulting in a five-year overall survival rate below 10%. Therefore, there is a critical need to identify effective biomarkers that can support frequent surveillance and promote efficient drug guidance in brain metastasis. Recently, the remarkable breakthroughs in single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology have advanced our insights into the tumor microenvironment (TME) at single-cell resolution, which offers the potential to unravel the metastasis-related cellular crosstalk and provides the potential for improving therapeutic effects mediated by multifaceted cellular interactions within TME. In this study, we have applied scRNA-seq and profiled 10,896 cells collected from five brain tumor tissue samples originating from breast and lung cancers. Our analysis reveals the presence of various intratumoral components, including tumor cells, fibroblasts, myeloid cells, stromal cells expressing neural stem cell markers, as well as minor populations of oligodendrocytes and T cells. Interestingly, distinct cellular compositions are observed across different samples, indicating the influence of diverse cellular interactions on the infiltration patterns within the TME. Importantly, we identify tumor-associated fibroblasts in both our in-house dataset and external scRNA-seq datasets. These fibroblasts exhibit high expression of type I collagen genes, dominate cell-cell interactions within the TME via the type I collagen signaling axis, and facilitate the remodeling of the TME to a collagen-I-rich extracellular matrix similar to the original TME at primary sites. Additionally, we observe M1 activation in native microglial cells and infiltrated macrophages, which may contribute to a proinflammatory TME and the upregulation of collagen type I expression in fibroblasts. Furthermore, tumor cell-specific receptors exhibit a significant association with patient survival in both brain metastasis and native glioblastoma cases. Taken together, our comprehensive analyses identify type I collagen-secreting tumor-associated fibroblasts as key mediators in metastatic brain tumors and uncover tumor receptors that are potentially associated with patient survival. These discoveries provide potential biomarkers for effective therapeutic targets and intervention strategies.",37479733,PMC10362065,10.1038/s42003-023-05124-2,2,Communications biology,101719179,6.548,0.8283842206001282,0.3411371237458194,0.4816053511705686,0.6615790273433546
Combining single-cell sequencing and spatial transcriptome sequencing to identify exosome-related features of glioblastoma and constructing a prognostic model to identify BARD1 as a potential therapeutic target for GBM patients,"Background:Glioblastoma (GBM) is a malignant primary brain tumor. This study focused on exploring the exosome-related features of glioblastoma to better understand its cellular composition and molecular characteristics.Methods:Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptome RNA sequencing (stRNA-seq) were used to analyze the heterogeneity of glioblastomas. After data integration, cell clustering, and annotation, five algorithms were used to calculate scores for exosome-related genes(ERGs). Cell trajectory analysis and intercellular communication analysis were performed to explore exosome-related communication patterns. Spatial transcriptome sequencing data were analyzed to validate the findings. To further utilize exosome-related features to aid in clinical decision-making, a prognostic model was constructed using GBM's bulk RNA-seq.Results:Different cell subpopulations were observed in GBM, with Monocytes/macrophages and malignant cells in tumor samples showing higher exosome-related scores. After identifying differentially expressed ERGs in malignant cells, pseudotime analysis revealed the cellular status of malignant cells during development. Intercellular communication analysis highlighted signaling pathways and ligand-receptor interactions. Spatial transcriptome sequencing confirmed the high expression of exosome-related gene features in the tumor core region. A prognostic model based on six ERGs was shown to be predictive of overall survival and immunotherapy outcome in GBM patients. Finally, based on the results of scRNA-seq and prognostic modeling as well as a series of cell function experiments, BARD1 was identified as a novel target for the treatment of GBM.Conclusion:This study provides a comprehensive understanding of the exosome-related features of GBM in both scRNA-seq and stRNA-seq, with malignant cells with higher exosome-related scores exhibiting stronger communication with Monocytes/macrophages. In terms of spatial data, highly scored malignant cells were also concentrated in the tumor core region. In bulk RNA-seq, patients with a high exosome-related index exhibited an immunosuppressive microenvironment, which was accompanied by a worse prognosis as well as immunotherapy outcomes. Prognostic models constructed using ERGs are expected to be independent prognostic indicators for GBM patients, with potential implications for personalized treatment strategies for GBM. Knockdown of BARD1 in GBM cell lines reduces the invasive and value-added capacity of tumor cells, and thus BARD1-positively expressing malignant cells are a risk factor for GBM patients.",37727789,PMC10505933,10.3389/fimmu.2023.1263329,9,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,8.786,0.8247444033622742,0.6588628762541806,0.6488294314381271,0.756385103555826
Roles of the m6A Modification of RNA in the Glioblastoma Microenvironment as Revealed by Single-Cell Analyses,"Purpose:Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a common and aggressive form of brain tumor. The N6-methyladenosine (m6A) mRNA modification plays multiple roles in many biological processes and disease states. However, the relationship between m6A modifications and the tumor microenvironment in GBM remains unclear, especially at the single-cell level.Experimental design:Single-cell and bulk RNA-sequencing data were acquired from the GEO and TCGA databases, respectively. We used bioinformatics and statistical tools to analyze associations between m6A regulators and multiple factors.Results:HNRNPA2B1andHNRNPCwere extensively expressed in the GBM microenvironment. m6A regulators promoted the stemness state in GBM cancer cells. Immune-related BP terms were enriched in modules of m6A-related genes. Cell communication analysis identified genes in the GALECTIN signaling network in GBM samples, and expression of these genes (LGALS9,CD44,CD45, andHAVCR2) correlated with that of m6A regulators. Validation experiments revealed thatMDKin MK signaling network promoted migration and immunosuppressive polarization of macrophage. Expression of m6A regulators correlated with ICPs in GBM cancer cells, M2 macrophages and T/NK cells. Bulk RNA-seq analysis identified two expression patterns (low m6A/high ICP and high m6A/low ICP) with different predicted immune infiltration and responses to ICP inhibitors. A predictive nomogram model to distinguish these 2 clusters was constructed and validated with excellent performance.Conclusion:At the single-cell level, m6A modification facilitates the stemness state in GBM cancer cells and promotes an immunosuppressive microenvironment through ICPs and the GALECTIN signaling pathway network. And we also identified two m6A-ICP expression patterns. These findings could lead to novel treatment strategies for GBM patients.",35558067,PMC9086907,10.3389/fimmu.2022.798583,10,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,8.786,0.8223318457603455,0.6822742474916388,0.6521739130434783,0.7602887395632306
Dissecting human gliomas by single-cell RNA sequencing,"Diffuse gliomas are the most common human primary brain tumors and remain incurable. They are complex entities in which diverse genetic and nongenetic effects determine tumor biology and clinical course. Our current understanding of gliomas in patients is primarily based on genomic and transcriptomic methods that have profiled them as bulk, providing critical information yet masking the diversity of cells within each tumor. Recent advances in single-cell DNA and RNA profiling have paved the way to studying tumors at cellular resolution. Here, we review initial studies deploying single-cell analysis in clinical glioma samples, with a focus on RNA expression profiling. We highlight how these studies provide new insights into glioma biology, tumor heterogeneity, cancer cell lineages, cancer stem cell programs, the tumor microenvironment, and glioma classification.",29016805,PMC5761500,10.1093/neuonc/nox126,36,Neuro-oncology,100887420,13.029,0.820900559425354,0.882943143812709,0.8394648829431438,0.8370219410063828
Microenvironment-Derived Regulation of HIF Signaling Drives Transcriptional Heterogeneity in Glioblastoma Multiforme,"The evolving and highly heterogeneous nature of malignant brain tumors underlies their limited response to therapy and poor prognosis. In addition to genetic alterations, highly dynamic processes, such as transcriptional and metabolic reprogramming, play an important role in the development of tumor heterogeneity. The current study reports an adaptive mechanism in which the metabolic environment of malignant glioma drives transcriptional reprogramming. Multiregional analysis of a glioblastoma patient biopsy revealed a metabolic landscape marked by varying stages of hypoxia and creatine enrichment. Creatine treatment and metabolism was further shown to promote a synergistic effect through upregulation of the glycine cleavage system and chemical regulation of prolyl-hydroxylase domain. Consequently, creatine maintained a reduction of reactive oxygen species and change of the Î±-ketoglutarate/succinate ratio, leading to an inhibition of HIF signaling in primary tumor cell lines. These effects shifted the transcriptional pattern toward a proneural subtype and reduced the rate of cell migration and invasionin vitroImplications:Transcriptional subclasses of glioblastoma multiforme are heterogeneously distributed within the same tumor.

The Heterogeneity of Tumour-Associated Macrophages Contributes to the Recurrence and Outcomes of Glioblastoma Patients,"Cellular heterogeneity and immune cell molecular phenotypes may be involved in the malignant progression of glioblastoma (GBM). In this study, we aimed to know whether the heterogeneity of tumour-associated macrophages contributes to the recurrence and outcomes of glioblastoma patients. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) data were used to assess the heterogeneity of CD45 + immune cells in recurrent GBM and analyse differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in master cells. Then, a prognostic signature based on the identified DEGs was established and validated, the correlation between risk score and tumour microenvironment (TME) was explored. The correlation between immune infiltration and LGMN, an important DEG in GBM tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs) was illuminated, using integrated bioinformatics analyses. Finally, immunohistochemistry and multiplex immunohistochemistry (mIHC) were used to analyse the expression of LGMN in GBM tissues from our hospital. scRNA-Seq analysis showed that the heterogeneity of recurrent GBM mainly comes from TAMs, which can be divided into 8 cell subclusters. Among these subclusters, TAM1 (markers: CXCL10, ADORA3), TAM3 (markers: MRC1, CFP), TAM4 (markers: GPNMB, PLTP), and TAM5 (markers: CCL4, IRAK2) were specifically present in recurrent GBM. After 342 DEGs in TAMs were identified, a prognostic signature was established based on 13 TAM-associated DEGs, and this signature could serve as an excellent prognostic predictor for patients with GBM. LGMN, one of 13 TAM-associated DEGs, was an important gene in lysosome pathway, we found that macrophage infiltration levels were higher after LGMN upregulation. GBM tissues from our hospital were collected for histopathologic validation, then LGMN was co-expressed with CD68, which is associated with the immune regulation of GBM. In conclusion, cell heterogeneity of TAMs is important for recurrent GBM, a prognostic signature based on 13 TAM-related DEGs can predict the survival outcome of GBM patients. An important DEG, LGMN may regulate the immune cell infiltration of GBM.",36542317,,10.1007/s12031-022-02081-z,0,Journal of molecular neuroscience : MN,9002991,2.866,0.8180109858512878,0.006688963210702341,0.14046822742474915,0.520238029637863
Histologically defined intratumoral sequencing uncovers evolutionary cues into conserved molecular events driving gliomagenesis,"Background:Glioblastoma represents an archetypal example of a heterogeneous malignancy. To understand the diverse molecular consequences of this complex tumor ecology, we analyzed RNA-seq data generated from commonly identified intratumoral structures in glioblastoma enriched using laser capture microdissection.Methods:Raw gene-level values of fragments per kilobase of transcript per million reads mapped and the associated clinical data were acquired from the publicly available Ivy Glioblastoma Atlas Project database and analyzed using MetaboAnalyst (v3.0). The database includes gene expression data generated from multiple structural features commonly identified in glioblastoma enriched by laser capture microdissection.Results:We uncovered a relationship between subtype heterogeneity in glioblastoma and its unique tumor microenvironment, with infiltrating cells harboring a proneural signature while the mesenchymal subtype was enriched in perinecrotic regions. When evaluating the tumors' transcriptional profiles in the context of their derived structural regions, there was a relatively small amount of intertumoral heterogeneity in glioblastoma, with individual regions from different tumors clustering tightly together. Analyzing the transcriptional profiles in the context of evolutionary progression identified unique cellular programs associated with specific phases of gliomagenesis. Mediators of cell signaling and cell cycle progression appear to be critical events driving proliferation in the tumor core, while in addition to a multiplex strategy for promoting angiogenesis and/or an immune-tolerant environment, transformation to perinecrotic zones involved global metabolic alterations.Conclusion:These findings suggest that intratumoral heterogeneity in glioblastoma is a conserved, predictable consequence to its complex microenvironment, and combinatorial approaches designed to target these unequivocally present tumor biomes may lead to therapeutic gains.",28541485,PMC5716184,10.1093/neuonc/nox100,18,Neuro-oncology,100887420,13.029,0.8177200555801392,0.7759197324414716,0.842809364548495,0.8143778527460768
Dissecting Intra-tumor Heterogeneity in the Glioblastoma Microenvironment Using Fluorescence-Guided Multiple Sampling,"The treatment of the most aggressive primary brain tumor in adults, glioblastoma (GBM), is challenging due to its heterogeneous nature, invasive potential, and poor response to chemo- and radiotherapy. As a result, GBM inevitably recurs and only a few patients survive 5 years post-diagnosis. GBM is characterized by extensive phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity, creating a diversified genetic landscape and a network of biological interactions between subclones, ultimately promoting tumor growth and therapeutic resistance. This includes spatial and temporal changes in the tumor microenvironment, which influence cellular and molecular programs in GBM and therapeutic responses. However, dissecting phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity at spatial and temporal levels is extremely challenging, and the dynamics of the GBM microenvironment cannot be captured by analysis of a single tumor sample. In this review, we discuss the current research on GBM heterogeneity, in particular, the utility and potential applications of fluorescence-guided multiple sampling to dissect phenotypic and genetic intra-tumor heterogeneity in the GBM microenvironment, identify tumor and non-tumor cell interactions and novel therapeutic targets in areas that are key for tumor growth and recurrence, and improve the molecular classification of GBM.",37255362,PMC10390891,10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-23-0048,1,Molecular cancer research : MCR,101150042,6.333,0.8171371221542358,0.25752508361204013,0.47157190635451507,0.6361016712858525
Glioblastoma heterogeneity and the tumour microenvironment: implications for preclinical research and development of new treatments,"Glioblastoma is the deadliest form of brain cancer. Aside from inadequate treatment options, one of the main reasons glioblastoma is so lethal is the rapid growth of tumour cells coupled with continuous cell invasion into surrounding healthy brain tissue. Significant intra- and inter-tumour heterogeneity associated with differences in the corresponding tumour microenvironments contributes greatly to glioblastoma progression. Within this tumour microenvironment, the extracellular matrix profoundly influences the way cancer cells become invasive, and changes to extracellular (pH and oxygen levels) and metabolic (glucose and lactate) components support glioblastoma growth. Furthermore, studies on clinical samples have revealed that the tumour microenvironment is highly immunosuppressive which contributes to failure in immunotherapy treatments. Although technically possible, many components of the tumour microenvironment have not yet been the focus of glioblastoma therapies, despite growing evidence of its importance to glioblastoma malignancy. Here, we review recent progress in the characterisation of the glioblastoma tumour microenvironment and the sources of tumour heterogeneity in human clinical material. We also discuss the latest advances in technologies for personalised andin vitropreclinical studies using brain organoid models to better model glioblastoma and its interactions with the surrounding healthy brain tissue, which may play an essential role in developing new and more personalised treatments for this aggressive type of cancer.",30902924,,10.1042/BST20180444,69,Biochemical Society transactions,7506897,4.919,0.8161134123802185,0.9431438127090301,0.3411371237458194,0.746524234719101
Single-cell analysis reveals diversity of tumor-associated macrophages and their interactions with T lymphocytes in glioblastoma,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive primary CNS malignancy and clinical outcomes have remained stagnant despite introduction of new treatments. Understanding the tumor microenvironment (TME) in which tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) interact with T cells has been of great interest. Although previous studies examining TAMs in GBM have shown that certain TAMs are associated with specific clinical and/or pathologic features, these studies used an outdated M1/M2 paradigm of macrophage polarization and failed to include the continuum of TAM states in GBM. Perhaps most significantly, the interactions of TAMs with T cells have yet to be fully explored. Our study uses single-cell RNA sequencing data from adult IDH-wildtype GBM, with the primary aim of deciphering the cellular interactions of the 7 TAM subtypes with T cells in the GBM TME. Furthermore, the interactions discovered herein are compared to IDH-mutant astrocytoma, allowing for focus on the cellular ecosystem unique to GBM. The resulting ligand-receptor interactions, signaling sources, and global communication patterns discovered provide a framework for future studies to explore methods of leveraging the immune system for treating GBM.",38012322,PMC10682178,10.1038/s41598-023-48116-2,1,Scientific reports,101563288,4.996,0.8156734108924866,0.2608695652173913,0.34782608695652173,0.6111431769702745
Glioblastoma-instructed microglia transition to heterogeneous phenotypic states with phagocytic and dendritic cell-like features in patient tumors and patient-derived orthotopic xenografts,"Background:A major contributing factor to glioblastoma (GBM) development and progression is its ability to evade the immune system by creating an immune-suppressive environment, where GBM-associated myeloid cells, including resident microglia and peripheral monocyte-derived macrophages, play critical pro-tumoral roles. However, it is unclear whether recruited myeloid cells are phenotypically and functionally identical in GBM patients and whether this heterogeneity is recapitulated in patient-derived orthotopic xenografts (PDOXs). A thorough understanding of the GBM ecosystem and its recapitulation in preclinical models is currently missing, leading to inaccurate results and failures of clinical trials.Methods:Here, we report systematic characterization of the tumor microenvironment (TME) in GBM PDOXs and patient tumors at the single-cell and spatial levels. We applied single-cell RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, multicolor flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, and functional studies to examine the heterogeneous TME instructed by GBM cells. GBM PDOXs representing different tumor phenotypes were compared to glioma mouse GL261 syngeneic model and patient tumors.Results:We show that GBM tumor cells reciprocally interact with host cells to create a GBM patient-specific TME in PDOXs. We detected the most prominent transcriptomic adaptations in myeloid cells, with brain-resident microglia representing the main population in the cellular tumor, while peripheral-derived myeloid cells infiltrated the brain at sites of blood-brain barrier disruption. More specifically, we show that GBM-educated microglia undergo transition to diverse phenotypic states across distinct GBM landscapes and tumor niches. GBM-educated microglia subsets display phagocytic and dendritic cell-like gene expression programs. Additionally, we found novel microglial states expressing cell cycle programs, astrocytic or endothelial markers. Lastly, we show that temozolomide treatment leads to transcriptomic plasticity and altered crosstalk between GBM tumor cells and adjacent TME components.Conclusions:Our data provide novel insights into the phenotypic adaptation of the heterogeneous TME instructed by GBM tumors. We show the key role of microglial phenotypic states in supporting GBM tumor growth and response to treatment. Our data place PDOXs as relevant models to assess the functionality of the TME and changes in the GBM ecosystem upon treatment.",38566128,PMC10988817,10.1186/s13073-024-01321-8,0,Genome medicine,101475844,15.266,0.8155264854431152,0.010033444816053512,0.882943143812709,0.6679112089916217
Tumor Microenvironment and Immune Escape in the Time Course of Glioblastoma,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive primary brain tumor with a malignant prognosis. GBM is characterized by high cellular heterogeneity and its progression relies on the interaction with the central nervous system, which ensures the immune-escape and tumor promotion. This interplay induces metabolic, (epi)-genetic and molecular rewiring in both domains. In the present study, we aim to characterize the time-related changes in the GBM landscape, using a syngeneic mouse model of primary GBM. GL261 glioma cells were injected in the right striatum of immuno-competent C57Bl/6 mice and animals were sacrificed after 7, 14, and 21 days (7D, 14D, 21D). The tumor development was assessed through 3D tomographic imaging and brains were processed for immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and western blotting. A human transcriptomic database was inquired to support the translational value of the experimental data. Our results showed the dynamic of the tumor progression, being established as a bulk at 14D and surrounded by a dense scar of reactive astrocytes. The GBM growth was paralleled by the impairment in the microglial/macrophagic recruitment and antigen-presenting functions, while the invasive phase was characterized by changes in the extracellular matrix, as shown by the analysis of tenascin C and metalloproteinase-9. The present study emphasizes the role of the molecular changes in the microenvironment during the GBM progression, fostering the development of novel multi-targeted, time-dependent therapies in an experimental model similar to the human disease.",36048342,PMC9525332,10.1007/s12035-022-02996-z,4,Molecular neurobiology,8900963,5.682,0.8119744062423706,0.4916387959866221,0.38127090301003347,0.6617665835447535
Deciphering the Immune Microenvironment at the Forefront of Tumor Aggressiveness by Constructing a Regulatory Network with Single-Cell and Spatial Transcriptomic Data,"The heterogeneity and intricate cellular architecture of complex cellular ecosystems play a crucial role in the progression and therapeutic response of cancer. Understanding the regulatory relationships of malignant cells at the invasive front of the tumor microenvironment (TME) is important to explore the heterogeneity of the TME and its role in disease progression. In this study, we inferred malignant cells at the invasion front by analyzing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics (ST) data of ER-positive (ER+) breast cancer patients. In addition, we developed a software pipeline for constructing intercellular gene regulatory networks (IGRNs), which help to reduce errors generated by single-cell communication analysis and increase the confidence of selected cell communication signals. Based on the constructed IGRN between malignant cells at the invasive front of the TME and the immune cells of ER+ breast cancer patients, we found that a high expression of the transcription factors FOXA1 and EZH2 played a key role in driving tumor progression. Meanwhile, elevated levels of their downstream target genes (ESR1 and CDKN1A) were associated with poor prognosis of breast cancer patients. This study demonstrates a bioinformatics workflow of combining scRNA-seq and ST data; in addition, the study provides the software pipelines for constructing IGRNs automatically (cIGRN). This strategy will help decipher cancer progression by revealing bidirectional signaling between invasive frontline malignant tumor cells and immune cells, and the selected signaling molecules in the regulatory network may serve as biomarkers for mechanism studies or therapeutic targets.",38254989,PMC10815467,10.3390/genes15010100,0,Genes,101551097,4.141,0.8074606657028198,0.013377926421404682,0.25418060200668896,0.5379881051073105
Single-cell characterization of human GBM reveals regional differences in tumor-infiltrating leukocyte activation,"Glioblastoma (GBM) harbors a highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) which influences glioma growth. Major efforts have been undertaken to describe the TME on a single-cell level. However, human data on regional differences within the TME remain scarce. Here, we performed high-depth single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) on paired biopsies from the tumor center, peripheral infiltration zone and blood of five primary GBM patients. Through analysis of >45,000 cells, we revealed a regionally distinct transcription profile of microglia (MG) and monocyte-derived macrophages (MdMs) and an impaired activation signature in the tumor-peripheral cytotoxic-cell compartment. Comparing tumor-infiltrating CD8+T cells with circulating cells identified CX3CR1highand CX3CR1intCD8+T cells with effector and memory phenotype, respectively, enriched in blood but absent in the TME. Tumor CD8+T cells displayed a tissue-resident memory phenotype with dysfunctional features. Our analysis provides a regionally resolved mapping of transcriptional states in GBM-associated leukocytes, serving as an additional asset in the effort towards novel therapeutic strategies to combat this fatal disease.",38127790,PMC10735226,10.7554/eLife.92678,0,eLife,101579614,8.713,0.8060905337333679,0.016722408026755852,0.6321070234113713,0.6134202065276462
Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals changes in glioma-associated macrophage polarization and cellular states of malignant gliomas with high AQP4 expression,"Glioma is the most common primary central nervous system tumor in adults. Aquaporin-4, as a water channel protein encoded by AQP4 in the brain, is reported to alter its aggregation status to affect plasma membrane dynamics and provide the potential for metastasis of tumor cells and components of the tumor microenvironment. We performed single-cell RNA transcriptome sequencing of 53059 cells from 13 malignant glioma samples and spotted that the expression of AQP4 differed between samples. The same result was observed in the TCGA glioma database, showing poor overall survival and poor response to chemotherapy in AQP4 overexpressed populations. Concomitant with the overexpression of AQP4, genes related to the immune system were also over-expressed, such as CD74, HES1, CALD1, and HEBP2, indicating AQP4 may relate to immune factors of tumor progression. We also found that tumor-associated macrophages tended to polarize toward M2 macrophages in the high AQP4 group. In glioblastoma samples, we examined cell status differences and identified that cell status differs according to AQP4 expression levels. Briefly, our study revealed substantial heterogeneity within malignant gliomas with different AQP4 expression levels, indicating the intricate connection between tumor cells and the tumor immune environment.",36599974,PMC10191842,10.1038/s41417-022-00582-y,3,Cancer gene therapy,9432230,5.854,0.804405927658081,0.43478260869565216,0.4013377926421405,0.6498676368624072
Identification of a unique tumor cell subset employing myeloid transcriptional circuits to create an immunomodulatory microenvironment in glioblastoma,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive primary brain tumor with unique immunity predominated by myeloid cells. GBM cells have been implicated to evade immune attack through hijacking myeloid-affiliated transcriptional programs to establish an immunosuppressive microenvironment. However, molecular features of immune-evading GBM cells in heterogeneous GBMs and their interactions with immune cells remain unclear. Herein, we employed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and bulk RNA-seq data to develop an in silico method for delineating GBM immune signature and identifying new molecular subsets for immunotherapy. We identified a new GBM cell subset, termed TC-6, that harbored immune-invading signature and actively interacted with tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) to orchestrate an immune-suppressive niche. Proinflammatory transcriptional factors STAT1, STAT2, IRF1, IRF2, IRF3, and IRF7 were identified as the core regulons defining TC-6 subsets. Further immune transcriptome analyses revealed three immune subtypes (C1, C2, and C3). C3 subtype GBMs were enriched with TC-6 cells and immunosuppressive TAMs, and exhibited an immunomodulatory signature that associated with reduced efficacy of anti-PD-1 treatment. Interferon-related DNA damage resistance signaling was upregulated in C3 GBMs, predicting shortened survival of GBM patients who received chemo-radiation treatment. Treatment of OSI-930 as a molecular agent targeting c-kit and VEGFR2 tyrosine kinases may compromise the immunomodulatory signature of C3 GBMs and synergize with chemo-radiation therapy. We further developed a simplified 11-gene set for defining C3 GBMs. Our work identified TC-6 subset as an immune-evading hub that creates an immunomodulatory signature of C3 GBMs, gaining insights into the heterogeneity of GBM immune microenvironment and holding promise for optimized anti-GBM immunotherapy.",35096487,PMC8797738,10.1080/2162402X.2022.2030020,3,Oncoimmunology,101570526,7.723,0.8033281564712524,0.43812709030100333,0.6053511705685619,0.6906925460566645
Single-Cell Molecular Characterization to Partition the Human Glioblastoma Tumor Microenvironment Genetic Background,"Background:Glioblastoma (GB) is a devastating primary brain malignancy. The recurrence of GB is inevitable despite the standard treatment of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation, and the median survival is limited to around 15 months. The barriers to treatment include the complex interactions among the different cellular components inhabiting the tumor microenvironment. The complex heterogeneous nature of GB cells is helped by the local inflammatory tumor microenvironment, which mostly induces tumor aggressiveness and drug resistance.Methods:By using fluorescent multiple labeling and a DEPArray cell separator, we recovered several single cells or groups of single cells from populations of different origins from IDH-WT GB samples. From each GB sample, we collected astrocytes-like (GFAP+), microglia-like (IBA1+), stem-like cells (CD133+), and endothelial-like cells (CD105+) and performed Copy Number Aberration (CNA) analysis with a low sequencing depth. The same tumors were subjected to a bulk CNA analysis.Results:The tumor partition in its single components allowed single-cell molecular subtyping which revealed new aspects of the GB altered genetic background.Conclusions:Nowadays, single-cell approaches are leading to a new understanding of GB physiology and disease.

Single-Cell Transcriptomics Revealed Subtype-Specific Tumor Immune Microenvironments in Human Glioblastomas,"Human glioblastoma (GBM), the most aggressive brain tumor, comprises six major subtypes of malignant cells, giving rise to both inter-patient and intra-tumor heterogeneity. The interaction between different tumor subtypes and non-malignant cells to collectively shape a tumor microenvironment has not been systematically characterized. Herein, we sampled the cellular milieu of surgically resected primary tumors from 7 GBM patients using single-cell transcriptome sequencing. A lineage relationship analysis revealed that a neural-progenitor-2-like (NPC2-like) state with high metabolic activity was associated with the tumor cells of origin. Mesenchymal-1-like (MES1-like) and mesenchymal-2-like (MES2-like) tumor cells correlated strongly with immune infiltration and chronic hypoxia niche responses. We identified four subsets of tumor-associated macrophages/microglia (TAMs), among which TAM-1 co-opted both acute and chronic hypoxia-response signatures, implicated in tumor angiogenesis, invasion, and poor prognosis. MES-like GBM cells expressed the highest number of M2-promoting ligands compared to other cellular states while all six states were associated with TAM M2-type polarization and immunosuppressionviaa set of 10 ligand-receptor signaling pathways. Our results provide new insights into the differential roles of GBM cell subtypes in the tumor immune microenvironment that may be deployed for patient stratification and personalized treatment.",35669791,PMC9163377,10.3389/fimmu.2022.914236,17,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,8.786,0.8016254305839539,0.7658862876254181,0.6555183946488294,0.7652561948052219
Deconvolution of cell type-specific drug responses in human tumor tissue with single-cell RNA-seq,"Background:Preclinical studies require models that recapitulate the cellular diversity of human tumors and provide insight into the drug sensitivities of specific cellular populations. The ideal platform would enable rapid screening of cell type-specific drug sensitivities directly in patient tumor tissue and reveal strategies to overcome intratumoral heterogeneity.Methods:We combine multiplexed drug perturbation in acute slice culture from freshly resected tumors with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to profile transcriptome-wide drug responses in individual patients. We applied this approach to drug perturbations on slices derived from six glioblastoma (GBM) resections to identify conserved drug responses and to one additional GBM resection to identify patient-specific responses.Results:We used scRNA-seq to demonstrate that acute slice cultures recapitulate the cellular and molecular features of the originating tumor tissue and the feasibility of drug screening from an individual tumor. Detailed investigation of etoposide, a topoisomerase poison, and the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor panobinostat in acute slice cultures revealed cell type-specific responses across multiple patients. Etoposide has a conserved impact on proliferating tumor cells, while panobinostat treatment affects both tumor and non-tumor populations, including unexpected effects on the immune microenvironment.Conclusions:Acute slice cultures recapitulate the major cellular and molecular features of GBM at the single-cell level. In combination with scRNA-seq, this approach enables cell type-specific analysis of sensitivity to multiple drugs in individual tumors. We anticipate that this approach will facilitate pre-clinical studies that identify effective therapies for solid tumors.",33975634,PMC8114529,10.1186/s13073-021-00894-y,33,Genome medicine,101475844,15.266,0.8006919622421265,0.862876254180602,0.8862876254180602,0.8302479532650082
Characterization of the m6A/m1A/m5C/m7G-related regulators on the prognosis and immune microenvironment of glioma by integrated analysis of scRNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq data,"Background:Proliferation, metabolism, tumor occurrence and development in gliomas are greatly influenced by RNA modifications. However, no research has integrated the four RNA methylation regulators of m6A, m1A, m5C and m7G in gliomas to analyze their relationship with glioma prognosis and intratumoral heterogeneity.Methods:Based on three in-house single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, the glioma heterogeneity and characteristics of m6A/m1A/m5C/m7G-related regulators were elucidated. Based on publicly available bulk RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data, a risk-score system for predicting the overall survival (OS) for gliomas was established by three machine learning methods and multivariate Cox regression analysis, and validated in an independent cohort.Results:Seven cell types were identified in gliomas by three scRNA-seq data, and 22 m6A/m1A/m5C/m7G-related regulators among the marker genes of different cell subtypes were discovered. Three m6A/m1A/m5C/m7G-related regulators were selected to construct prognostic risk-score model, including EIFA, NSUN6 and TET1. The high-risk patients showed higher immune checkpoint expression, higher tumor microenvironment scores, as well as higher tumor mutation burden and poorer prognosis compared with low-risk patients. Additionally, the area under the curve values of the risk score and nomogram were 0.833 and 0.922 for 3 year survival and 0.759 and 0.885 for 5 year survival for gliomas. EIF3A was significantly highly expressed in glioma tissues in our in-house RNA-sequencing data (p < 0.05).Conclusion:These findings may contribute to further understanding of the role of m6A/m1A/m5C/m7G-related regulators in gliomas, and provide novel and reliable biomarkers for gliomas prognosis and treatment.",38391150,,10.1002/jgm.3666,0,The journal of gene medicine,9815764,4.152,0.79739910364151,0.020066889632107024,0.2608695652173913,0.5346267531548057
A variational algorithm to detect the clonal copy number substructure of tumors from scRNA-seq data,"Single-cell RNA sequencing is the reference technology to characterize the composition of the tumor microenvironment and to study tumor heterogeneity at high resolution. Here we report Single CEll Variational ANeuploidy analysis (SCEVAN), a fast variational algorithm for the deconvolution of the clonal substructure of tumors from single-cell RNA-seq data. It uses a multichannel segmentation algorithm exploiting the assumption that all the cells in a given copy number clone share the same breakpoints. Thus, the smoothed expression profile of every individual cell constitutes part of the evidence of the copy number profile in each subclone. SCEVAN can automatically and accurately discriminate between malignant and non-malignant cells, resulting in a practical framework to analyze tumors and their microenvironment. We apply SCEVAN to datasets encompassing 106 samples and 93,322 cells from different tumor types and technologies. We demonstrate its application to characterize the intratumor heterogeneity and geographic evolution of malignant brain tumors.",36841879,PMC9968345,10.1038/s41467-023-36790-9,16,Nature communications,101528555,17.694,0.7923036217689514,0.7625418060200669,0.9230769230769231,0.8125059188807688
Decipher the Glioblastoma Microenvironment: The First Milestone for New Groundbreaking Therapeutic Strategies,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary malignant brain tumour in adults. Despite the combination of novel therapeutical approaches, it remains a deadly malignancy with an abysmal prognosis. GBM is a polymorphic tumour from both molecular and histological points of view. It consists of different malignant cells and various stromal cells, contributing to tumour initiation, progression, and treatment response. GBM's microenvironment is multifaceted and is made up of soluble factors, extracellular matrix components, tissue-resident cell types (e.g., neurons, astrocytes, endothelial cells, pericytes, and fibroblasts) together with resident (e.g., microglia) or recruited (e.g., bone marrow-derived macrophages) immune cells. These latter constitute the so-called immune microenvironment, accounting for a substantial GBM's tumour volume. Despite the abundance of immune cells, an intense state of tumour immunosuppression is promoted and developed; this represents the significant challenge for cancer cells' immune-mediated destruction. Though literature data suggest that distinct GBM's subtypes harbour differences in their microenvironment, its role in treatment response remains obscure. However, an in-depth investigation of GBM's microenvironment may lead to novel therapeutic opportunities to improve patients' outcomes. This review will elucidate the GBM's microenvironment composition, highlighting the current state of the art in immunotherapy approaches. We will focus on novel strategies of active and passive immunotherapies, including vaccination, gene therapy, checkpoint blockade, and adoptive T-cell therapies.",33804731,PMC8003887,10.3390/genes12030445,39,Genes,101551097,4.141,0.7902066707611084,0.8963210702341137,0.25752508361204013,0.7048932332258958
Glioblastoma multiforme: novel therapeutic targets,"Introduction:The increasingly detailed genetic characterization of glioblastoma (GBM) has failed to translate into meaningful breakthroughs in treatment. This is likely to be attributed to molecular heterogeneity of GBM. However, the understanding of the tumor microenvironment in GBM has become more refined and has revealed a wealth of therapeutic targets that may enable the disruption of angiogenesis or immunosuppression.Areas covered:This review discusses the selective targeting of tumor-intrinsic pathways, therapies that target the GBM tumor microenvironment and relevant preclinical studies and their limitations. Relevant literature was derived from a PubMed search encompassing studies from 1989 to 2020.Expert opinion:Despite appropriate target engagement, attempts to directly inhibit oncogenic pathways in GBM have yielded little success. This is likely attributed to the molecular heterogeneity of GBM and the presence of redundant signaling that allow for accumulation of adaptive mutations and development of drug resistance. Subsequently, there has been a shift toward therapies modulating the pro-angiogenic, immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment in GBM. The non-transformed cells in the microenvironment which includes endothelial cells, myeloid cells, and T cells, are presumably genetically stable, less susceptible to heterogeneity, and easier to target. This approach offers the highest potential for a therapeutic breakthrough in GBM.",32394767,,10.1080/14728222.2020.1762568,28,Expert opinion on therapeutic targets,101127833,6.797,0.7892336845397949,0.8294314381270903,0.5083612040133779,0.7410987391519706
Integrative analysis of single-cell transcriptomics reveals age-associated immune landscape of glioblastoma,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most malignant tumor in center nervous system. Clinical statistics revealed that senior GBM patients had a worse overall survival (OS) comparing with that of patients in other ages, which is mainly related with tumor microenvironment including tumor-associated immune cells in particular. However, the immune heterogeneity and age-related prognosis in GBM are under studied. Here we developed a machine learning-based method to integrate public large-scale single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets to establish a comprehensive atlas of immune cells infiltrating in cross-age GBM. We found that the compositions of the immune cells are remarkably different across ages. Brain-resident microglia constitute the majority of glioblastoma-associated macrophages (GAMs) in patients, whereas dramatic elevation of extracranial monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) is observed in GAMs of senior patients, which contributes to the worse prognosis of aged patients. Further analysis suggests that the increased MDMs arisen from excessive recruitment and proliferation of peripheral monocytes not only lead to the T cell function inhibition in GBM, but also stimulate tumor cells proliferationviaVEGFA secretion. In summary, our work provides new cues for the correlational relationship between the immune microenvironment of GBM and aging, which might be insightful for precise and effective therapeutic interventions for senior GBM patients.",36761752,PMC9903136,10.3389/fimmu.2023.1028775,1,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,8.786,0.7884203195571899,0.26755852842809363,0.6588628762541806,0.6583364726707688
Molecular Heterogeneity and Immunosuppressive Microenvironment in Glioblastoma,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive primary brain tumor in adults, with a poor prognosis, despite surgical resection combined with radio- and chemotherapy. The major clinical obstacles contributing to poor GBM prognosis are late diagnosis, diffuse infiltration, pseudo-palisading necrosis, microvascular proliferation, and resistance to conventional therapy. These challenges are further compounded by extensive inter- and intra-tumor heterogeneity and the dynamic plasticity of GBM cells. The complex heterogeneous nature of GBM cells is facilitated by the local inflammatory tumor microenvironment, which mostly induces tumor aggressiveness and drug resistance. An immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment of GBM provides multiple pathways for tumor immune evasion. Infiltrating immune cells, mostly tumor-associated macrophages, comprise much of the non-neoplastic population in GBM. Further understanding of the immune microenvironment of GBM is essential to make advances in the development of immunotherapeutics. Recently, whole-genome sequencing, epigenomics and transcriptional profiling have significantly helped improve the prognostic and therapeutic outcomes of GBM patients. Here, we discuss recent genomic advances, the role of innate and adaptive immune mechanisms, and the presence of an established immunosuppressive GBM microenvironment that suppresses and/or prevents the anti-tumor host response.",32765498,PMC7379131,10.3389/fimmu.2020.01402,130,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,8.786,0.7841538190841675,0.9765886287625418,0.6622073578595318,0.7982514887749153
"A single cell RNAseq benchmark experiment embedding ""controlled"" cancer heterogeneity","Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has emerged as a vital tool in tumour research, enabling the exploration of molecular complexities at the individual cell level. It offers new technical possibilities for advancing tumour research with the potential to yield significant breakthroughs. However, deciphering meaningful insights from scRNA-seq data poses challenges, particularly in cell annotation and tumour subpopulation identification. Efficient algorithms are therefore needed to unravel the intricate biological processes of cancer. To address these challenges, benchmarking datasets are essential to validate bioinformatics methodologies for analysing single-cell omics in oncology. Here, we present a 10XGenomics scRNA-seq experiment, providing a controlled heterogeneous environment using lung cancer cell lines characterised by the expression of seven different driver genes (EGFR, ALK, MET, ERBB2, KRAS, BRAF, ROS1), leading to partially overlapping functional pathways. Our dataset provides a comprehensive framework for the development and validation of methodologies for analysing cancer heterogeneity by means of scRNA-seq.",38307867,PMC10837414,10.1038/s41597-024-03002-y,0,Scientific data,101640192,8.501,0.7828285694122314,0.023411371237458192,0.6287625418060201,0.6001319242560346
Time-resolved single-cell transcriptomics defines immune trajectories in glioblastoma,"Deciphering the cell-state transitions underlying immune adaptation across time is fundamental for advancing biology. Empirical in vivo genomic technologies that capture cellular dynamics are currently lacking. We present Zman-seq, a single-cell technology recording transcriptomic dynamics across time by introducing time stamps into circulating immune cells, tracking them in tissues for days. Applying Zman-seq resolved cell-state and molecular trajectories of the dysfunctional immune microenvironment in glioblastoma. Within 24 hours of tumor infiltration, cytotoxic natural killer cells transitioned to a dysfunctional program regulated by TGFB1 signaling. Infiltrating monocytes differentiated into immunosuppressive macrophages, characterized by the upregulation of suppressive myeloid checkpoints Trem2, Il18bp, and Arg1, over 36 to 48 hours. Treatment with an antagonistic anti-TREM2 antibody reshaped the tumor microenvironment by redirecting the monocyte trajectory toward pro-inflammatory macrophages. Zman-seq is a broadly applicable technology, enabling empirical measurements of differentiation trajectories, which can enhance the development of more efficacious immunotherapies.",38134933,,10.1016/j.cell.2023.11.032,3,Cell,0413066,0.0,0.7796576023101807,0.4414715719063545,0.0,0.5560888757673793
Drivers of heterogeneity in the glioblastoma immune microenvironment,"Glioblastoma is the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor, characterized by a highly complex and heterogeneous tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). In this review, we discuss the impact of tumor-intrinsic and tumor-extrinsic drivers that contribute to heterogeneity in the adult glioblastoma TIME, focusing on four main factors: genetic drivers, sex, age, and standard of care therapy. We describe recent insights into how each of these factors affects key aspects ranging from TIME composition to therapy response, with an emphasis on the cross-talk between tumor and immune cells. Deciphering these local interactions is fundamental to understanding therapy resistance and identifying novel immunomodulatory strategies.",37984008,,10.1016/j.ceb.2023.102279,1,Current opinion in cell biology,8913428,8.386,0.7779753804206848,0.2709030100334448,0.6120401337792643,0.6433738570149528
Meta-Analysis of Human Cancer Single-Cell RNA-Seq Datasets Using the IMMUcan Database,"The development of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies has greatly contributed to deciphering the tumor microenvironment (TME). An enormous amount of independent scRNA-seq studies have been published representing a valuable resource that provides opportunities for meta-analysis studies. However, the massive amount of biological information, the marked heterogeneity and variability between studies, and the technical challenges in processing heterogeneous datasets create major bottlenecks for the full exploitation of scRNA-seq data. We have developed IMMUcan scDB (https://immucanscdb.vital-it.ch), a fully integrated scRNA-seq database exclusively dedicated to human cancer and accessible to nonspecialists. IMMUcan scDB encompasses 144 datasets on 56 different cancer types, annotated in 50 fields containing precise clinical, technological, and biological information. A data processing pipeline was developed and organized in four steps: (i) data collection; (ii) data processing (quality control and sample integration); (iii) supervised cell annotation with a cell ontology classifier of the TME; and (iv) interface to analyze TME in a cancer type-specific or global manner. This framework was used to explore datasets across tumor locations in a gene-centric (CXCL13) and cell-centric (B cells) manner as well as to conduct meta-analysis studies such as ranking immune cell types and genes correlated to malignant transformation. This integrated, freely accessible, and user-friendly resource represents an unprecedented level of detailed annotation, offering vast possibilities for downstream exploitation of human cancer scRNA-seq data for discovery and validation studies.Significance:The IMMUcan scDB database is an accessible supportive tool to analyze and decipher tumor-associated single-cell RNA sequencing data, allowing researchers to maximally use this data to provide new insights into cancer biology.",36459564,PMC9896021,10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-22-0074,7,Cancer research,2984705R,0.0,0.7723590135574341,0.5953177257525084,0.0033444816053511705,0.5831478496060324
Multiple Faces of the Glioblastoma Microenvironment,"The tumor microenvironment is a highly dynamic accumulation of resident and infiltrating tumor cells, responsible for growth and invasion. The authors focused on the leading-edge concepts regarding the glioblastoma microenvironment.

The Interplay between Glioblastoma and Its Microenvironment,"GBM is the most common primary brain tumor in adults, and the aggressive nature of this tumor contributes to its extremely poor prognosis. Over the years, the heterogeneous and adaptive nature of GBM has been highlighted as a major contributor to the poor efficacy of many treatments including various immunotherapies. The major challenge lies in understanding and manipulating the complex interplay among the different components within the tumor microenvironment (TME). This interplay varies not only by the type of cells interacting but also by their spatial distribution with the TME. This review highlights the various immune and non-immune components of the tumor microenvironment and their consequences f the efficacy of immunotherapies. Understanding the independent and interdependent aspects of the various sub-populations encapsulated by the immune and non-immune components will allow for more targeted therapies. Meanwhile, understanding how the TME creates and responds to different environmental pressures such as hypoxia may allow for other multimodal approaches in the treatment of GBM. Ultimately, a better understanding of the GBM TME will aid in the development and advancement of more effective treatments and in improving patient outcomes.",34571905,PMC8469987,10.3390/cells10092257,45,Cells,101600052,7.666,0.7661187648773193,0.9063545150501672,0.5785953177257525,0.7566612254815756
Contribution of the Microenvironmental Niche to Glioblastoma Heterogeneity,"Glioblastoma is the most aggressive cancer of the brain. The dismal prognosis is largely attributed to the heterogeneous nature of the tumor, which in addition to intrinsic molecular and genetic changes is also influenced by the microenvironmental niche in which the glioma cells reside. The cancer stem cells (CSCs) hypothesis suggests that all cancers arise from CSCs that possess the ability to self-renew and initiate tumor formation. CSCs reside in specialized niches where interaction with the microenvironment regulates their stem cell behavior. The reciprocal interaction between glioma stem cells (GSCs) and cells from the microenvironment, such as endothelial cells, immune cells, and other parenchymal cells, may also promote angiogenesis, invasion, proliferation, and stemness of the GSCs and be likely to have an underappreciated role in their responsiveness to therapy. This crosstalk may also promote molecular transition of GSCs. Hence the inherent plasticity of GSCs can be seen as an adaptive response, changing according to the signaling cue from the niche. Given the association of GSCs with tumor recurrence and treatment sensitivity, understanding this bidirectional crosstalk between GSCs and its niche may provide a framework to identify more effective therapeutic targets and improve treatment outcome.",28630875,PMC5467280,10.1155/2017/9634172,33,BioMed research international,101600173,3.246,0.7638362646102905,0.8662207357859532,0.16722408026755853,0.6649907219768767
Comprehensive Analysis of the Tumor Immune Microenvironment Landscape in Glioblastoma Reveals Tumor Heterogeneity and Implications for Prognosis and Immunotherapy,"Background:Glioblastoma (GBM) is a fatal brain tumor with no effective treatment. The specific GBM tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) may contribute to resistance to immunotherapy, a tumor therapy with great potential. Thus, an in-depth understanding of the characteristics of tumor-infiltrating immune cells is essential for exploring biomarkers in GBM pathogenesis and immunotherapy.Methods:We estimated the relative abundances of 25 immune cell types in 796 GBM samples using single sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA). Unsupervised clustering was used to identify different GBM-associated TIME immune cell infiltration (GTMEI) patterns. The GTMEIscore system was constructed with principal component analysis (PCA) to determine the immune infiltration pattern of individual tumors.Results:We revealed three distinct GTMEI patterns with different clinical outcomes and modulated biological pathways. We developed a scoring system (GTMEIscore) to determine the immune infiltration pattern of individual tumors. We comprehensively analyzed the genomic characteristics, molecular subtypes and clinicopathological features as well as proteomic, phosphoproteomic, acetylomic, lipidomic and metabolomic properties associated with the GTMEIscore and revealed many novel dysregulated pathways and precise targets in GBM. Moreover, the GTMEIscore accurately quantified the immune status of many other cancer types. Clinically, the GTMEIscore was found to have significant potential therapeutic value for chemotherapy/radiotherapy, immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy and targeted therapy.Conclusions:For the first time, we employed a multilevel and multiplatform strategy to construct a multidimensional molecular map of tumors with different immune infiltration patterns. These results may provide theoretical basises for identifying more effective predictive biomarkers and developing more effective drug combination strategies or novel immunotherapeutic agents for GBM.",35309323,PMC8924366,10.3389/fimmu.2022.820673,8,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,8.786,0.7606506943702698,0.6120401337792643,0.6655518394648829,0.7119088112709914
[Single-cell transcriptome analysis of multigrade glioma heterogeneity and immune microenvironment revealed potential prognostic biomarkers],"Glioma, the most common intrinsic tumor of the central nervous system, is characterized by its high incidence and poor prognosis. The aim of this study was to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and low-grade glioma (LGG) to explore prognostic factors of different grades of gliomas. Single-cell transcriptome sequencing data of gliomas were collected from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), which included a total of 29 097 cell samples from three datasets. For the analysis of human gliomas of different grades, 21 071 cells were obtained by filtering, and 70 genes were screened from differentially expressed genes by gene ontology (GO) analysis, Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis, from which the geneDLL3was focused by reviewing the literature. The TCGA-based gene expression profiling interactive analysis (GEPIA) database was used to explore the survival curves of genes in LGG and GBM, and the gene expression profiling interactive analysis and tumor immune estimation resource (TIMER) database was used to study the expression of key genes in gliomas of different grades, predicting biomarkers that were closely related to immunotherapy. The cBioPortal database was used to explore the relationship betweenDLL3expression and 25 immune checkpoints. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) further identified pathways associated with central genes. Finally, the efficacy of biomarkers in prognosis and prediction was validated in the Chinese glioma genome atlas (CGGA). These results demonstrated that prognostic genes are associated with tumor proliferation and progression. Analysis of biological information and survival suggested that these genes might serve as a promising prognostic biomarker and as new targets for selecting therapeutic strategies.",36305410,,10.13345/j.cjb.220481,0,Sheng wu gong cheng xue bao = Chinese journal of biotechnology,9426463,0.0,0.7585106492042542,0.026755852842809364,0.006688963210702341,0.46179535273325484
Integrated single-cell transcriptomic analyses reveal that GPNMB-high macrophages promote PN-MES transition and impede T cell activation in GBM,"Background:Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive type of primary brain tumor and is often resistant to current therapies. Tumor microenvironment-centered therapies may unleash new hope for GBM treatment. Therefore, an in-depth understanding of tumor-stroma communication is urgently needed to identify promising therapeutic targets.Methods:We systematically analyzed GBM single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), bulk RNA-seq and spatial scRNA-seq data from various human and mice studies to characterize the network within the microenvironment. Moreover, we applied ex vivo co-culture system, flow cytometry analysis and immunofluorescent staining to validate our findings.Findings:Our integrative analyses revealed that highly heterogeneous GBM tumor cells can be classified into MES-like, AC-like, OPC-like and NPC-like subtypes based on molecular studying. Additionally, trajectory and regulatory network inference implied a PN to MES cell state transition regulated by specific transcriptional factor (TF) regulons. Importantly, we discovered that glycoprotein nonmetastatic B (GPNMB) derived from macrophages played a crucial role in this transition through immune cell-tumor interplay. Besides, through deep signal transduction analyses and cell co-culture studies, we further disclosed that these GPNMB-high macrophage subpopulations, originating from monocytes, could also ineffectively retain T cells from activating by dendritic cells (DCs).Interpretation:Our study suggests that targeting this particular GPNMB-high macrophage subset may provide a new strategy to control GBM plasticity and facilitate T cell-based immunotherapy.Funding:A full list of funding bodies that contributed to this study can be found in the Acknowledgements section.",36054938,PMC9437813,10.1016/j.ebiom.2022.104239,8,EBioMedicine,101647039,11.205,0.755636990070343,0.6153846153846154,0.8060200668896321,0.7376631304970553
Single-Cell RNA Sequencing with Spatial Transcriptomics of Cancer Tissues,"Single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) techniques can perform analysis of transcriptome at the single-cell level and possess an unprecedented potential for exploring signatures involved in tumor development and progression. These techniques can perform sequence analysis of transcripts with a better resolution that could increase understanding of the cellular diversity found in the tumor microenvironment and how the cells interact with each other in complex heterogeneous cancerous tissues. Identifying the changes occurring in the genome and transcriptome in the spatial context is considered to increase knowledge of molecular factors fueling cancers. It may help develop better monitoring strategies and innovative approaches for cancer treatment. Recently, there has been a growing trend in the integration of RNA-seq techniques with contemporary omics technologies to study the tumor microenvironment.

Single-cell RNA sequencing identifies critical transcription factors of tumor cell invasion induced by hypoxia microenvironment in glioblastoma,"Rationale:Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive malignant primary brain cancer with poor survival. Hypoxia is a hallmark of GBM, which promotes tumor cells spreading (invasion) into the healthy brain tissue.Methods:To better elucidate the influence of hypoxia on GBM invasion, we proposed a data-driven modeling framework for predicting cellular hypoxia (CHPF) by integrating single cell transcriptome profiling and hypoxia gene signatures.Results:We characterized the hypoxia status landscape of GBM cells and observed that hypoxic cells were only present in the tumor core. Then, by investigating the cell-cell communication between immune cells and tumor cells, we discovered significant interaction between macrophages and tumor cells in hypoxic microenvironment. Notably, we dissected the functional heterogeneity of tumor cells and identified a hypoxic subpopulation that had highly invasive potential. By constructing cell status specific gene regulatory networks, we further identified 14 critical regulators of tumor invasion induced by hypoxic microenvironment. Finally, we confirmed that knocking down two critical regulatorsCEBPDandFOSL1could reduce the invasive ability of GBM under hypoxic conditions. Additionally, we revealed the therapeutic effect of Axitinib and Entinostat through the mice model.Conclusion:Our work revealed the critical regulators in hypoxic subpopulation with high invasive potential in GBM, which may have practical implications for clinical targeted-hypoxia cancer drug therapy.",37441593,PMC10334835,10.7150/thno.81407,3,Theranostics,101552395,11.6,0.7523766160011292,0.44481605351170567,0.8160535117056856,0.7035998826441557
Single-cell RNA sequencing unveils tumor heterogeneity and immune microenvironment between subungual and plantar melanoma,"Acral melanoma (AM) is a subtype of melanoma with high prevalence in East Asians. AM is characterized by greater aggressiveness and lower survival rates. However, there are still fewer studies on immune mechanisms of AM especially subungual melanoma (SM) versus non-subungual melanoma (NSM). In order to explore tumor heterogeneity and immune microenvironment in different subtypes of AM, we applied single-cell RNA sequencing to 24,789 single cells isolated from the SM and plantar melanoma (PM) patients. Aspects of tumor heterogeneity, melanocytes from PM and SM had significant differences in gene expression, CNV and pathways in which tumor-associated such as NF-kb and Wnt were involved. Regarding the immune microenvironment, PM contained more fibroblasts and T/NK cells. The EPHA3-EFNA1 axis was expressed only in cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) and melanocytes of PM, and the TIGIT-NECTIN2 axis was expressed in both AM subtypes of T/NK cells and melanocytes. Altogether, our study helps to elucidate the tumor heterogeneity in AM subpopulations and provides potential therapeutic targets for clinical research.",38528036,PMC10963724,10.1038/s41598-024-57640-8,0,Scientific reports,101563288,4.996,0.7487199306488037,0.030100334448160536,0.3511705685618729,0.5254861389912889
Focusing on scRNA-seq-Derived T Cell-Associated Genes to Identify Prognostic Signature and Immune Microenvironment Status in Low-Grade Glioma,"Background:The clinical outcomes of low-grade glioma (LGG) are associated with T cell infiltration, but the specific contribution of heterogeneous T cell types remains unclear.Method:To study the different functions of T cells in LGG, we mapped the single-cell RNA sequencing results of 10 LGG samples to obtain T cell marker genes. In addition, bulk RNA data of 975 LGG samples were collected for model construction. Algorithms such as TIMER, CIBERSORT, QUANTISEQ, MCPCOUTER, XCELL, and EPIC were used to depict the tumor microenvironment landscape. Subsequently, three immunotherapy cohorts, PRJEB23709, GSE78820, and IMvigor210, were used to explore the efficacy of immunotherapy.Results:The Human Primary Cell Atlas was used as a reference dataset to identify each cell cluster; a total of 15 cell clusters were defined and cells in cluster 12 were defined as T cells. According to the distribution of T cell subsets (CD4+ T cell, CD8+ T cell, NaÃ¯ve T cell, and Treg cell), we selected the differentially expressed genes. Among the CD4+ T cell subsets, we screened 3 T cell-related genes, and the rest were 28, 4, and 13, respectively. Subsequently, according to the T cell marker genes, we screened six genes for constructing the model, namely, RTN1, HERPUD1, MX1, SEC61G, HOPX, and CHI3L1. The ROC curve showed that the predictive ability of the prognostic model for 1, 3, and 5 years was 0.881, 0.817, and 0.749 in the TCGA cohort, respectively. In addition, we found that risk scores were positively correlated with immune infiltration and immune checkpoints. To this end, we obtained three immunotherapy cohorts to verify their predictive ability of immunotherapy effects and found that high-risk patients had better clinical effects of immunotherapy.Conclusion:This single-cell RNA sequencing combined with bulk RNA sequencing may elucidate the composition of the tumor microenvironment and pave the way for the treatment of low-grade gliomas.",37292257,PMC10247320,10.1155/2023/3648946,0,Mediators of inflammation,9209001,4.529,0.7481683492660522,0.033444816053511704,0.2976588628762542,0.5151217453455845
Single-cell atlas reveals the immunosuppressive microenvironment and Treg cells landscapes in recurrent Glioblastoma,"Patients diagnosed with glioblastoma (GBM) have the most aggressive tumor progression and lethal recurrence. Research on the immune microenvironment landscape of tumor and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is limited. At the single-cell level, we aim to reveal the recurrent immune microenvironment of GBM and the potential CSF biomarkers and compare tumor locations. We collected four clinical samples from two patients: malignant samples from one recurrent GBM patient and non-malignant samples from a patient with brain tumor. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to reveal the immune landscape of recurrent GBM and CSF. T cells were enriched in the malignant tumors, while Treg cells were predominately found in malignant CSF, which indicated an inhibitory microenvironment in recurrent GBM. Moreover, macrophages and neutrophils were significantly enriched in malignant CSF. This indicates that they an important role in GBM progression. S100A9, extensively expressed in malignant CSF, is a promising biomarker for GBM diagnosis and recurrence. Our study reveals GBM's recurrent immune microenvironment after chemoradiotherapy and compares malignant and non-malignant CSF samples. We provide novel targets and confirm the promise of liquid CSF biopsy for patients with GBM.",38429367,,10.1038/s41417-024-00740-4,0,Cancer gene therapy,9432230,5.854,0.7478001117706299,0.03678929765886288,0.40468227424749165,0.5369743814436488
The use of single-cell RNA-seq to study heterogeneity at varying levels of virus-host interactions,"The outcome of viral infection depends on the diversity of the infecting viral population and the heterogeneity of the cell population that is infected. Until almost a decade ago, the study of these dynamic processes during viral infection was challenging and limited to certain targeted measurements. Presently, with the use of single-cell sequencing technology, the complex interface defined by the interactions of cells with infecting virus can now be studied across the breadth of the transcriptome in thousands of individual cells simultaneously. In this review, we will describe the use of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to study the heterogeneity of viral infections, ranging from individual virions to the immune response between infected individuals. In addition, we highlight certain key experimental limitations and methodological decisions that are critical to analyzing scRNA-seq data at each scale.",38236826,PMC10796064,10.1371/journal.ppat.1011898,1,PLoS pathogens,101238921,7.464,0.739234209060669,0.27424749163879597,0.5484949832775919,0.6080890204196789
Myeloid Cell Classification and Therapeutic Opportunities Within the Glioblastoma Tumor Microenvironment in the Single Cell-Omics Era,"The glioma tumor microenvironment (TME) is complex and heterogeneous, and multiple emerging and current technologies are being utilized for an improved comprehension and understanding of these tumors. Single cell analysis techniques such as single cell genomic and transcriptomic sequencing analysis are on the rise and play an important role in elucidating the glioma TME. These large datasets will prove useful for patient tumor characterization, including immune configuration that will ultimately influence therapeutic choices and especially immune therapies. In this review we discuss the advantages and drawbacks of these techniques while debating their role in the domain of glioma-infiltrating myeloid cells characterization and function.",35784281,PMC9244707,10.3389/fimmu.2022.907605,4,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,8.786,0.7375364303588867,0.4983277591973244,0.6688963210702341,0.6759666742688437
Mapping and Validation of scRNA-Seq-Derived Cell-Cell Communication Networks in the Tumor Microenvironment,"Recent advances in single-cell technologies, particularly single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), have permitted high throughput transcriptional profiling of a wide variety of biological systems. As scRNA-seq supports inference of cell-cell communication, this technology has and continues to anchor groundbreaking studies into the efficacy and mechanism of novel immunotherapies for cancer treatment. In this review, we will highlight methods developed to infer inter- and intracellular signaling from scRNA-seq and discuss how they have contributed to studies of immunotherapeutic intervention in the tumor microenvironment (TME). However, a central challenge remains in validating the hypothesized cell-cell interactions. Therefore, this review will also cover strategies for integration of these scRNA-seq-derived interaction networks with existing experimental and computational approaches. Integration of these networks with imaging, protein secretion measurements, and network analysis and mathematical modeling tools addresses challenges that remain with scRNA-seq to enhance studies of immunosuppressive and immunotherapy-altered signaling in the TME.",35572582,PMC9096838,10.3389/fimmu.2022.885267,15,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,8.786,0.7331653237342834,0.7558528428093646,0.6722408026755853,0.7255179233375599
"The Glioblastoma Microenvironment: Morphology, Metabolism, and Molecular Signature of Glial Dynamics to Discover Metabolic Rewiring Sequence","Different functional states determine glioblastoma (GBM) heterogeneity. Brain cancer cells coexist with the glial cells in a functional syncytium based on a continuous metabolic rewiring. However, standard glioma therapies do not account for the effects of the glial cells within the tumor microenvironment. This may be a possible reason for the lack of improvements in patients with high-grade gliomas therapies. Cell metabolism and bioenergetic fitness depend on the availability of nutrients and interactions in the microenvironment. It is strictly related to the cell location in the tumor mass, proximity to blood vessels, biochemical gradients, and tumor evolution, underlying the influence of the context and the timeline in anti-tumor therapeutic approaches. Besides the cancer metabolic strategies, here we review the modifications found in the GBM-associated glia, focusing on morphological, molecular, and metabolic features. We propose to analyze the GBM metabolic rewiring processes from a systems biology perspective. We aim at defining the crosstalk between GBM and the glial cells as modules. The complex networking may be expressed by metabolic modules corresponding to the GBM growth and spreading phases. Variation in the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) rate and regulation appears to be the most important part of the metabolic and functional heterogeneity, correlating with glycolysis and response to hypoxia. Integrated metabolic modules along with molecular and morphological features could allow the identification of key factors for controlling the GBM-stroma metabolism in multi-targeted, time-dependent therapies.",33804873,PMC8036663,10.3390/ijms22073301,29,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,6.208,0.7266196608543396,0.8361204013377926,0.42474916387959866,0.688145709556082
Transcriptional Heterogeneity of Cellular Senescence in Cancer,"Cellular senescence plays a paradoxical role in tumorigenesis through the expression of diverse senescence-associated (SA) secretory phenotypes (SASPs). The heterogeneity of SA gene expression in cancer cells not only promotes cancer stemness but also protects these cells from chemotherapy. Despite the potential correlation between cancer and SA biomarkers, many transcriptional changes across distinct cell populations remain largely unknown. During the past decade, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies have emerged as powerful experimental and analytical tools to dissect such diverse senescence-derived transcriptional changes. Here, we review the recent sequencing efforts that successfully characterized scRNA-seq data obtained from diverse cancer cells and elucidated the role of senescent cells in tumor malignancy. We further highlight the functional implications of SA genes expressed specifically in cancer and stromal cell populations in the tumor microenvironment. Translational research leveraging scRNA-seq profiling of SA genes will facilitate the identification of novel expression patterns underlying cancer susceptibility, providing new therapeutic opportunities in the era of precision medicine.",35983702,PMC9448649,10.14348/molcells.2022.0036,5,Molecules and cells,9610936,4.25,0.7265226244926453,0.5250836120401338,0.2809364548494983,0.5971175880735136

The Heterogeneous Cellular States of Glioblastoma Stem Cells Revealed by Single Cell Analysis,"Glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) contributed to the progression, treatment resistance, and relapse of glioblastoma (GBM). However, current researches on GSCs were performed usually outside the human tumor microenvironment, ignoring the importance of the cellular states of primary GSCs. In this study, we leveraged single-cell transcriptome sequencing data of 6 independent GBM cohorts from public databases, and combined lineage and stemness features to identify primary GSCs. We dissected the cell states of GSCs and correlated them with the clinical outcomes of patients. As a result, we constructed a cellular hierarchy where GSCs resided at the center. In addition, we identified and characterized 2 different and recurrent GSCs subpopulations: proliferative GSCs (pGSCs) and quiescent GSCs (qGSCs). The pGSCs showed high cell cycle activity, indicating rapid cell division, while qGSCs showed a quiescent state. Then we traced the processes of tumor development by pseudo-time analysis and tumor phylogeny, and found that GSCs accumulated throughout the whole tumor development period. During the process, pGSCs mainly contributed to the early stage and qGSCs were enriched in the later stage. Finally, we constructed an 8-gene prognostic signature reflecting pGSCs activity and found that patients whose tumors were enriched for the pGSC signature had poor clinical outcomes. Our study highlights the primary GSCs heterogeneity and its correlation to tumor development and clinical outcomes, providing the potential targets for GBM treatment.",36583266,,10.1093/stmcls/sxac088,2,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,5.845,0.7229183912277222,0.34448160535117056,0.3979933110367893,0.5822460180142253
Single-Cell RNA Sequencing for Studying Human Cancers,"Since the first publication a decade ago describing the use of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) in the context of cancer, over 200 datasets and thousands of scRNA-seq studies have been published in cancer biology. scRNA-seq technologies have been applied across dozens of cancer types and a diverse array of study designs to improve our understanding of tumor biology, the tumor microenvironment, and therapeutic responses, and scRNA-seq is on the verge of being used to improve decision-making in the clinic. Computational methodologies and analytical pipelines are key in facilitating scRNA-seq research.

"Comprehensive genomic profiling of glioblastoma tumors, BTICs, and xenografts reveals stability and adaptation to growth environments","Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most deadly brain tumor, and currently lacks effective treatment options. Brain tumor-initiating cells (BTICs) and orthotopic xenografts are widely used in investigating GBM biology and new therapies for this aggressive disease. However, the genomic characteristics and molecular resemblance of these models to GBM tumors remain undetermined. We used massively parallel sequencing technology to decode the genomes and transcriptomes of BTICs and xenografts and their matched tumors in order to delineate the potential impacts of the distinct growth environments. Using data generated from whole-genome sequencing of 201 samples and RNA sequencing of 118 samples, we show that BTICs and xenografts resemble their parental tumor at the genomic level but differ at the mRNA expression and epigenomic levels, likely due to the different growth environment for each sample type. These findings suggest that a comprehensive genomic understanding of in vitro and in vivo GBM model systems is crucial for interpreting data from drug screens, and can help control for biases introduced by cell-culture conditions and the microenvironment in mouse models. We also found that lack ofMGMTexpression in pretreated GBM is linked to hypermutation, which in turn contributes to increased genomic heterogeneity and requires new strategies for GBM treatment.",31471491,PMC6754609,10.1073/pnas.1813495116,24,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,12.779,0.7167145609855652,0.822742474916388,0.8294314381270903,0.7604635192000347
Identification of glioblastoma stem cell-associated lncRNAs using single-cell RNA sequencing datasets,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is an aggressive, heterogeneous brain tumor in which glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) are known culprits of therapy resistance. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to play a critical role in both cancer and normal biology. A few studies have suggested that aberrant expression of lncRNAs is associated with GSCs. However, a comprehensive single-cell analysis of the GSC-associated lncRNA transcriptome has not been carried out. Here, we analyzed recently published single-cell RNA sequencing datasets of adult GBM tumors, GBM organoids, GSC-enriched GBM tumors, and developing human brain samples to identify lncRNAs highly expressed in GSCs. We further revealed that the GSC-specific lncRNAs GIHCG and LINC01563 promote proliferation, migration, and stemness in the GSC population. Together, this study identified a panel of uncharacterized GSC-enriched lncRNAs and set the stage for future in-depth studies to examine their role in GBM pathology and their potential as biomarkers and/or therapeutic targets in GBM.",37922916,PMC10679778,10.1016/j.stemcr.2023.10.004,0,Stem cell reports,101611300,7.294,0.7144288420677185,0.04013377926421405,0.5317725752508361,0.5430385761436411
Targeting Glioblastoma Tumor Microenvironment,"Glioblastoma, also referred to as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), is an aggressive type of brain cancer. The prognosis for GBM is poor with an average medium survival rate of 12-15 months. GBM is highly challenging to treat due to neural stem cells phenotypic variations. These variations are determined by the tumor microenvironment (TME), which refers to all the molecules, cells, and structures that encompass and support other cells and tissues. Along with these, other vital components of the TME are fibroblasts, immune and inflammatory cells, blood and lymphatic vascular networks, extracellular matrix, and signaling molecules. This chapter provides an in-depth review of the vital components that form the TME and methods currently under development attempting to target each key area.",34185283,,10.1007/978-3-030-59038-3_1,6,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,0.0,0.7140302062034607,0.5618729096989966,0.013377926421404682,0.5434682909461567
MetaTiME integrates single-cell gene expression to characterize the meta-components of the tumor immune microenvironment,"Recent advances in single-cell RNA sequencing have shown heterogeneous cell types and gene expression states in the non-cancerous cells in tumors. The integration of multiple scRNA-seq datasets across tumors can indicate common cell types and states in the tumor microenvironment (TME). We develop a data driven framework, MetaTiME, to overcome the limitations in resolution and consistency that result from manual labelling using known gene markers. Using millions of TME single cells, MetaTiME learns meta-components that encode independent components of gene expression observed across cancer types. The meta-components are biologically interpretable as cell types, cell states, and signaling activities. By projecting onto the MetaTiME space, we provide a tool to annotate cell states and signature continuums for TME scRNA-seq data. Leveraging epigenetics data, MetaTiME reveals critical transcriptional regulators for the cell states. Overall, MetaTiME learns data-driven meta-components that depict cellular states and gene regulators for tumor immunity and cancer immunotherapy.",37149682,PMC10164163,10.1038/s41467-023-38333-8,2,Nature communications,101528555,17.694,0.7130321860313416,0.34782608695652173,0.9264214046822743,0.6826688099465641
Glioma: molecular signature and crossroads with tumor microenvironment,"In patients with glioblastoma, the average survival time with current treatments is short, mainly due to recurrences and resistance to therapy. This insufficient treatment success is, in large parts, due to the tremendous molecular heterogeneity of gliomas, which affects the overall prognosis and response to therapies and plays a vital role in gliomas' grading. In addition, the tumor microenvironment is a major player for glioma development and resistance to therapy. Active communication between glioma cells and local or neighboring healthy cells and the immune environment promotes the cancerogenic processes and contributes to establishing glioma stem cells, which drives therapy resistance. Besides genetic alterations in the primary tumor, tumor-released factors, cytokines, proteins, extracellular vesicles, and environmental influences like hypoxia provide tumor cells the ability to evade host tumor surveillance machinery and promote disease progression. Moreover, there is increasing evidence that these players affect the molecular biological properties of gliomas and enable inter-cell communication that supports pro-cancerogenic cell properties. Identifying and characterizing these complex mechanisms are inevitably necessary to adapt therapeutic strategies and to develop novel measures. Here we provide an update about these junctions where constant traffic of biomolecules adds complexity in the management of glioblastoma.",34687436,PMC8924130,10.1007/s10555-021-09997-9,50,Cancer metastasis reviews,8605731,9.237,0.7116313576698303,0.9130434782608695,0.7625418060200669,0.7620958714580854
Single-cell profiling and zebrafish avatars reveal LGALS1 as immunomodulating target in glioblastoma,"Glioblastoma (GBM) remains the most malignant primary brain tumor, with a median survival rarely exceeding 2 years. Tumor heterogeneity and an immunosuppressive microenvironment are key factors contributing to the poor response rates of current therapeutic approaches. GBM-associated macrophages (GAMs) often exhibit immunosuppressive features that promote tumor progression. However, their dynamic interactions with GBM tumor cells remain poorly understood. Here, we used patient-derived GBM stem cell cultures and combined single-cell RNA sequencing of GAM-GBM co-cultures and real-time in vivo monitoring of GAM-GBM interactions in orthotopic zebrafish xenograft models to provide insight into the cellular, molecular, and spatial heterogeneity. Our analyses revealed substantial heterogeneity across GBM patients in GBM-induced GAM polarization and the ability to attract and activate GAMs-features that correlated with patient survival. Differential gene expression analysis, immunohistochemistry on original tumor samples, and knock-out experiments in zebrafish subsequently identified LGALS1 as a primary regulator of immunosuppression. Overall, our work highlights that GAM-GBM interactions can be studied in a clinically relevant way using co-cultures and avatar models, while offering new opportunities to identify promising immune-modulating targets.",37791581,PMC10630887,10.15252/emmm.202318144,1,EMBO molecular medicine,101487380,14.26,0.7106282711029053,0.27759197324414714,0.8729096989966555,0.6564772971099038
"An Integrative Model of Cellular States, Plasticity, and Genetics for Glioblastoma","Diverse genetic, epigenetic, and developmental programs drive glioblastoma, an incurable and poorly understood tumor, but their precise characterization remains challenging. Here, we use an integrative approach spanning single-cell RNA-sequencing of 28 tumors, bulk genetic and expression analysis of 401 specimens from the The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), functional approaches, and single-cell lineage tracing to derive a unified model of cellular states and genetic diversity in glioblastoma. We find that malignant cells in glioblastoma exist in four main cellular states that recapitulate distinct neural cell types, are influenced by the tumor microenvironment, and exhibit plasticity. The relative frequency of cells in each state varies between glioblastoma samples and is influenced by copy number amplifications of the CDK4, EGFR, and PDGFRA loci and by mutations in the NF1 locus, which each favor a defined state. Our work provides a blueprint for glioblastoma, integrating the malignant cell programs, their plasticity, and their modulation by genetic drivers.",31327527,PMC6703186,10.1016/j.cell.2019.06.024,940,Cell,0413066,0.0,0.7101260423660278,1.0,0.016722408026755852,0.6294201070249679
Single-cell transcriptome analysis reveals heterogeneity and convergence of the tumor microenvironment in colorectal cancer,"Introduction:Colorectal cancer (CRC) ranks second for mortality and third for morbidity among the most commonly diagnosed cancers worldwide. We aimed to investigate the heterogeneity and convergence of tumor microenvironment (TME) in CRC.Methods:We analyzed the single-cell RNA sequencing data obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and identified 8 major cell types and 25 subgroups derived from tumor, para-tumor and peripheral blood.Results:In this study, we found that there were significant differences in metabolic patterns, immunophenotypes and transcription factor (TF) regulatory patterns among different subgroups of each major cell type. However, subgroups manifested similar lipid metabolic patterns, immunosuppressive functions and TFs module at the end of the differentiation trajectory in CD8+ T cells, myeloid cells and Fibroblasts. Meanwhile, TFs regulated lipid metabolism and immunosuppressive ligand-receptor pairs were detected by tracing the differentiation trajectory. Based on the cell subgroup fractions calculated by CIBERSORTx and bulk RNA-sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we constructed an immune risk model and clinical risk model of CRC which presented excellent prognostic value.Conclusion:This study identified that the differentiation was accompanied by remodeling of lipid metabolism and suppression of immune function, which suggest that lipid remodeling may be an important trigger of immunosuppression. More importantly, our work provides a new perspective for understanding the heterogeneity and convergence of the TME and will aid the development of prognosis and immunotherapies of CRC patients.",36685571,PMC9845924,10.3389/fimmu.2022.1003419,7,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,8.786,0.7100254893302917,0.6020066889632107,0.6755852842809364,0.6815336882470044
The strange Microenvironment of Glioblastoma,"Glioblastoma (GB) is the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor, with poor patient survival and lack of effective therapies. Late advances trying to decipher the composition of the GB tumor microenvironment (TME) emphasized its role in tumor progression and potentialized it as a therapeutic target. Many components participate critically to tumor development and expansion such as blood vessels, immune cells or components of the nervous system. Dysmorphic tumor vasculature brings challenges to optimal delivery of cytotoxic agents currently used in clinics. Also, massive infiltration of immunosuppressive myeloid cells and limited recruitment of T cells limits the success of conventional immunotherapies. Neuronal input seems also be required for tumor expansion.

The Role of the Tumor Microenvironment in Glioblastoma: A Mathematical Model,"Glioblastoma multiforme is one of the deadliest human cancers and is characterized by tumor cells that hijack immune system cells in a deadly symbiotic relationship. Microglia and glioma infiltrating macrophages, which in principle should mount an immune response to the tumor, are subverted by tumor cells to facilitate growth in several ways. In this study, we seek to understand the interactions between the tumor cells and the microglia that enhance tumor growth, and for this purpose, we develop a mathematical and computational model that involves reaction-diffusion equations for the important components in the interaction. These include the densities of tumor and microglial cells, and the concentrations of growth factors and other signaling molecules. We apply this model to a transwell assay used in the laboratory to demonstrate that microglia can stimulate tumor cell invasion by secreting the growth factor TGF- Î². We show that the model can both replicate the major components of the experimental findings and make new predictions to guide future experiments aimed at the development of new therapeutic approaches. Sensitivity analysis is used to identify the most important parameters as an aid to future experimental work. This study is the first step in a program that involves development of detailed 3-D models of the mechanical and biochemical interactions between a glioblastoma and the tumor microenvironment.",27959794,PMC5384419,10.1109/TBME.2016.2637828,31,IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering,0012737,0.0,0.7022238373756409,0.8561872909698997,0.023411371237458192,0.5972540348668561
Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals the MIF-ACKR3 receptor-ligand interaction between iCAFs and tumor cells in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma,"Background:Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is a malignant tumor of the gastrointestinal tract with a high morbidity and mortality rate. The heterogeneity of ESCC poses challenges in treatment and contributes to the poor prognosis of patients. Therefore, it is crucial to gain a better understanding of the tumor microenvironment (TME) heterogeneity and identify novel therapeutic targets.Methods:To solve this problem, we performed a single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis of ESCC samples obtained from the GEO database.Results:A total of 31,283 single cells were categorized into nine cell types, which included four non-immune cells (epithelial cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, schwann cells) and five immune cells (T cells, macrophages, mast cells, neutrophils, B cells). Our study revealed the presence of immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments in ESCC. We have also identified not only inflammatory cancer-associated fibroblast (iCAFs) and myofibroblastic cancer-associated fibroblasts (myCAFs) but also a subset of antigen presenting cancer-associated fibroblasts (apCAFs) which express high levels of HLA class II molecules in ESCC. Furthermore, our analysis of cell communication showed up-regulation of MIF-ACKR3 interaction between iCAFs and tumor cells in tumors compared to normal tissues. Finally, it was demonstrated that macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) facilitates tumor cell migration and invasion through interacting with ACKR3 in vitro.Conclusions:This study exposes the features of the tumor microenvironment of ESCC via scRNA-seq and examines the dynamics of various cellular subpopulations, thus facilitating the identification of future therapeutic targets for ESCC.",38336189,,10.1016/j.cellsig.2024.111093,0,Cellular signalling,8904683,4.85,0.700177788734436,0.046822742474916385,0.3311036789297659,0.49569195752159806
Exploiting Microglial Functions for the Treatment of Glioblastoma,"Background:Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common brain tumor in adults and is associated with a very low survival rate. The heterogeneity of the tumor microenvironment, its resistance to drug and radiation therapy, and its robust invasiveness all contribute to the poor outcome. Large numbers of glioma associated microglia and macrophages (GAMs) can accumulate within the tumor where they appear to have an important role in prognosis.Methods:An extensive revision of current available literature on this topic has been carried out, using the PubMed database. Articles exploring the contribution of GAMs to GBM biology as well as evidence that GAMs can be pharmacologically modulated to inhibit tumor growth are critically discussed in this review article.Results:GAMs constitute the largest portion of tumor infiltrating cells contributing up to 30% of the entire glioma mass. Upon interaction with neoplastic cells, GAMs acquire a unique phenotype of activation including both M1 and M2 specific markers. Different profiles of activation usually co-exist in the same tumor that is dependent upon GAM location or stage of disease. In addition to regulating immune responses which may control or favor astrocyte malignant transformation, GAMs are directly involved in the degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM), a crucial mechanism that allows the expansion of tumors and parenchyma invasion. Several pharmacological strategies have been developed which interfere with GAM recruitment at the tumor site, cell polarization and immune function, and ECM remodeling by GAM-secreted factors. The most promising therapeutic approaches appear to target both GBM cells and GAM biological properties.Conclusion:GAMs significantly contribute to GBM biology (favoring tumor growth and invasiveness). Data reviewed in the present article suggest that these cells represent a valuable alternative/ additional target for the development of more effective treatments for GBM.",27528361,,10.2174/1568009616666160813191240,28,Current cancer drug targets,101094211,2.907,0.6995623707771301,0.8327759197324415,0.15719063545150502,0.6177307335030674
"An update on the molecular biology of glioblastoma, with clinical implications and progress in its treatment","Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive and common malignant primary brain tumor. Patients with GBM often have poor prognoses, with a median survival of â¼15 months. Enhanced understanding of the molecular biology of central nervous system tumors has led to modifications in their classifications, the most recent of which classified these tumors into new categories and made some changes in their nomenclature and grading system. This review aims to give a panoramic view of the last 3 years' findings in glioblastoma characterization, its heterogeneity, and current advances in its treatment. Several molecular parameters have been used to achieve an accurate and personalized characterization of glioblastoma in patients, including epigenetic, genetic, transcriptomic and metabolic features, as well as age- and sex-related patterns and the involvement of several noncoding RNAs in glioblastoma progression. Astrocyte-like neural stem cells and outer radial glial-like cells from the subventricular zone have been proposed as agents involved in GBM of IDH-wildtype origin, but this remains controversial. Glioblastoma metabolism is characterized by upregulation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, promotion of the glycolytic flux, maintenance of lipid storage, and other features. This metabolism also contributes to glioblastoma's resistance to conventional therapies. Tumor heterogeneity, a hallmark of GBM, has been shown to affect the genetic expression, modulation of metabolic pathways, and immune system evasion. GBM's aggressive invasion potential is modulated by cell-to-cell crosstalk within the tumor microenvironment and altered expressions of specific genes, such as ANXA2, GBP2, FN1, PHIP, and GLUT3. Nevertheless, the rising number of active clinical trials illustrates the efforts to identify new targets and drugs to treat this malignancy. Immunotherapy is still relevant for research purposes, given the amount of ongoing clinical trials based on this strategy to treat GBM, and neoantigen and nucleic acid-based vaccines are gaining importance due to their antitumoral activity by inducing the immune response. Furthermore, there are clinical trials focused on the PI3K/Akt/mTOR axis, angiogenesis, and tumor heterogeneity for developing molecular-targeted therapies against GBM. Other strategies, such as nanodelivery and computational models, may improve the drug pharmacokinetics and the prognosis of patients with GBM.",36129048,PMC9648390,10.1002/cac2.12361,29,"Cancer communications (London, England)",101723675,15.283,0.6983294486999512,0.8394648829431438,0.8963210702341137,0.7661548598554222
Multidimensional communication in the microenvirons of glioblastoma,"Glioblastomas are heterogeneous and invariably lethal tumours. They are characterized by genetic and epigenetic variations among tumour cells, which makes the development of therapies that eradicate all tumour cells challenging and currently impossible. An important component of glioblastoma growth is communication with and manipulation of other cells in the brain environs, which supports tumour progression and resistance to therapy. Glioblastoma cells recruit innate immune cells and change their phenotype to support tumour growth. Tumour cells also suppress adaptive immune responses, and our increasing understanding of how T cells access the brain and how the tumour thwarts the immune response offers new strategies for mobilizing an antitumour response. Tumours also subvert normal brain cells - including endothelial cells, neurons and astrocytes - to create a microenviron that favours tumour success. Overall, after glioblastoma-induced phenotypic modifications, normal cells cooperate with tumour cells to promote tumour proliferation, invasion of the brain, immune suppression and angiogenesis. This glioblastoma takeover of the brain involves multiple modes of communication, including soluble factors such as chemokines and cytokines, direct cell-cell contact, extracellular vesicles (including exosomes and microvesicles) and connecting nanotubes and microtubes. Understanding these multidimensional communications between the tumour and the cells in its environs could open new avenues for therapy.",29985475,PMC6425928,10.1038/s41582-018-0025-8,265,Nature reviews.

Single-Cell Spatial Analysis Identifies Regulators of Brain Tumor-Initiating Cells,"Glioblastomas (GBM) are aggressive brain tumors with extensive intratumoral heterogeneity that contributes to treatment resistance. Spatial characterization of GBMs could provide insights into the role of the brain tumor microenvironment in regulating intratumoral heterogeneity. Here, we performed spatial transcriptomic and single-cell analyses of the mouse and human GBM microenvironment to dissect the impact of distinct anatomical regions of brains on GBM. In a syngeneic GBM mouse model, spatial transcriptomics revealed that numerous extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules, including biglycan, were elevated in areas infiltrated with brain tumor-initiating cells (BTIC). Single-cell RNA sequencing and single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing showed that ECM molecules were differentially expressed by GBM cells based on their differentiation and cellular programming phenotypes. Exogeneous biglycan or overexpression of biglycan resulted in a higher proliferation rate of BTICs, which was associated mechanistically with low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6) binding and activation of the Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway. Biglycan-overexpressing BTICs developed into larger tumors and displayed mesenchymal phenotypes when implanted intracranially in mice. This study points to the spatial heterogeneity of ECM molecules in GBM and suggests that the biglycan-LRP6 axis could be a therapeutic target to curb tumor growth.Significance:Characterization of the spatial heterogeneity of glioblastoma identifies regulators of brain tumor-initiating cells and tumor growth that could serve as candidates for therapeutic interventions to improve the prognosis of patients.",37067922,,10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-22-3004,2,Cancer research,2984705R,0.0,0.6952345967292786,0.3511705685618729,0.026755852842809364,0.4927260423185036
Transcriptome and single-cell analysis reveal the contribution of immunosuppressive microenvironment for promoting glioblastoma progression,"Background and objectives:GBM patients frequently exhibit severe local and systemic immunosuppression, limiting the possible efficacy of immunotherapy strategies. The mechanism through which immunosuppression is established in GBM tumors is the key to successful personalized immunotherapies.Methods:We divided GBM patients into subtypes according to the expression characteristics of the TME typing-related signature matrix. WGCNA analysis was used to get co-expressed gene modules. The expression activity of hub genes retrieved from co-expressed modules was validated in two single-cell datasets. Then, cell-cell interaction was calculated.Results:Four subtypes were identified in the TCGA and CGGA RNA-seq datasets simultaneously, one of which was an immunosuppressive subtype rich in immunosuppressive factors with low lymphocyte infiltration and an IDH1 mutation. Three co-expressed gene modules related to the immunosuppressive subtype were identified. These three modules are associated with the inflammatory response, angiogenesis, hypoxia, and carbon metabolism, respectively. The genes of the inflammatory response were mainly related to myeloid cells, especially TAM, angiogenesis was related to blood vessels; hypoxia and glucose metabolism were related to tumors, TAM, and blood vessels. Moreover, there was enhanced interaction between tumor cells and TAM.Discussion:This research successfully found the immunosuppressive subtype and the major cell types, signal pathways, and molecules involved in the formation of the immunosuppressive subtype and will provide new clues for the improvement of GBM personalized immunotherapy in the future.",36685556,PMC9851159,10.3389/fimmu.2022.1051701,2,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,8.786,0.6952345967292786,0.35451505016722407,0.6789297658862876,0.6238297212482695
Improved prognostication of glioblastoma beyond molecular subtyping by transcriptional profiling of the tumor microenvironment,"Glioblastoma (GBM), the most aggressive form of brain cancer, is characterized by a high level of molecular heterogeneity, and infiltration by various immune and stromal cell populations. Important advances have been made in deciphering the microenvironment of GBMs, but its association with existing molecular subtypes and its potential prognostic role remain elusive. We have investigated the abundance of infiltrating immune and stromal cells in silico, from gene expression profiles. Two cohorts, including in-house normal brain and glioma samples (n = 70) and a large sample set from TCGA (n = 393), were combined into a single exploratory dataset. A third independent cohort (n = 124) was used for validation. Tumors were clustered based on their microenvironment infiltration profiles, and associations with known GBM molecular subtypes and patient outcome were tested a posteriori in a multivariable setting. We identified a subset of GBM samples with significantly higher abundances of most immune and stromal cell populations. This subset showed increased expression of both immune suppressor and immune effector genes compared to other GBMs and was enriched for the mesenchymal molecular subtype. Survival analyses suggested that tumor microenvironment infiltration pattern was an independent prognostic factor for GBM patients. Among all, patients with the mesenchymal subtype with low immune and stromal infiltration had the poorest survival. By combining molecular subtyping with gene expression measures of tumor infiltration, the present work contributes with improving prognostic models in GBM.",32171051,PMC7191188,10.1002/1878-0261.12668,13,Molecular oncology,101308230,7.449,0.6945099234580994,0.7224080267558528,0.5384615384615384,0.6688798671183378
Immune microenvironments differ in immune characteristics and outcome of glioblastoma multiforme,"Understanding the interactions between tumors and the host immune system holds great promise to uncover biomarkers for targeted therapies, predict the prognosis of patients and guide clinical treatment. However, the immune signatures of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) remain largely unstudied in terms of systematic analyses. We aimed to classify GBM samples according to immune-related genes and complement the existing immunotherapy system knowledge. In this study, we designed a strategy to identify 3 immune subtypes representing 3 different immune microenvironments (M1-M3) and associated with prognosis. The 3 subtypes were significantly different in terms of specific immune characteristics (immune cell subpopulations, immune responses, immune cells, and checkpoint gene interactions). In additional, copy number variations and methylation changes were identified that correlated with genes related to a worse prognosis subtype in the microenvironment. More importantly, in M3 (worst prognosis subtype) and M2 (best prognosis subtype), the interaction between immune cells and checkpoint genes was different, which had an important effect on the prognosis. Finally, we used risk scores of immune cells and checkpoint genes to evaluate the prognosis of GBM patients and validated the results with 3 independent datasets. Disordered interactions between immune cells and checkpoint genes result in a change in the immune microenvironment and affects the prognosis of patients. We propose that a better understanding of the immune microenvironment of advanced cancers may provide new insights into immunotherapy.",31038851,PMC6558448,10.1002/cam4.2192,20,Cancer medicine,101595310,4.711,0.6908720135688782,0.7926421404682275,0.32441471571906355,0.6379345793787852
Single-cell transcriptome analysis reveals tumoral microenvironment heterogenicity and hypervascularization in human carotid body tumor,"Carotid body tumor (CBT) is a rare neck tumor located at the adventitia of the common carotid artery bifurcation. The prominent pathological features of CBT are high vascularization and abnormal proliferation. However, single-cell transcriptome analysis of the microenvironment composition and molecular complexity in CBT has yet to be performed. In this study, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis on human CBT to define the cells that contribute to hypervascularization and chronic hyperplasia. Unbiased clustering analysis of transcriptional profiles identified 16 distinct cell populations including endothelial cells (ECs), smooth muscle cells (SMCs), neuron cells, macrophage cells, neutrophil cells, and T cells. Within the ECs population, we defined subsets with angiogenic capacity plus clear signs of later endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) to normal ECs. Two populations of macrophages were detectable in CBT, macrophage1 showed enrichment in hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) and as well as an early EPCs cell-like population expressing CD14 and vascular endothelial growth factor. In addition to HIF-1-related transcriptional protein expression, macrophages1 also display a neovasculogenesis-promoting phenotype. SMCs included three populations showing platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta and vimentin expression, indicative of a cancer-associated fibroblast phenotype. Finally, we identified three types of neuronal cells, including chief cells and sustentacular cells, and elucidated their distinct roles in the pathogenesis of CBT and abnormal proliferation of tumors. Overall, our study provided the first comprehensive characterization of the transcriptional landscape of CBT at scRNA-seq profiles, providing novel insights into the mechanisms underlying its formation.",38214142,,10.1002/jcp.31175,0,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,0.0,0.6908720135688782,0.05016722408026756,0.030100334448160536,0.4305767198470126
Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals evolution of immune landscape during glioblastoma progression,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is an incurable primary malignant brain cancer hallmarked with a substantial protumorigenic immune component. Knowledge of the GBM immune microenvironment during tumor evolution and standard of care treatments is limited. Using single-cell transcriptomics and flow cytometry, we unveiled large-scale comprehensive longitudinal changes in immune cell composition throughout tumor progression in an epidermal growth factor receptor-driven genetic mouse GBM model. We identified subsets of proinflammatory microglia in developing GBMs and anti-inflammatory macrophages and protumorigenic myeloid-derived suppressors cells in end-stage tumors, an evolution that parallels breakdown of the blood-brain barrier and extensive growth of epidermal growth factor receptor+GBM cells. A similar relationship was found between microglia and macrophages in patient biopsies of low-grade glioma and GBM. Temozolomide decreased the accumulation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells, whereas concomitant temozolomide irradiation increased intratumoral GranzymeB+CD8+T cells but also increased CD4+regulatory T cells. These results provide a comprehensive and unbiased immune cellular landscape and its evolutionary changes during GBM progression.",35624211,PMC9174057,10.1038/s41590-022-01215-0,57,Nature immunology,100941354,31.25,0.687839686870575,0.9297658862876255,0.9665551839464883,0.7919680261691677
The mode and dynamics of glioblastoma cell invasion into a decellularized tissue-derived extracellular matrix-based three-dimensional tumor model,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common brain tumor with very aggressive and infiltrative. Extracellular matrix (ECM) plays pivotal roles in the infiltrative characteristics of GBM. To understand the invasive characteristic of GBM, it is necessary to study cell-ECM interaction in the physiologically relevant biomimetic model that recapitulates the GBM-specific ECM microenvironment. Here, we propose biomimetic GBM-specific ECM microenvironment for studying mode and dynamics of glioblastoma cell invasion. Using tissue decellularization process, we constructed a patient tissue-derived ECM (pdECM)-based three-dimensional in vitro model. In our model, GBM cells exhibited heterogeneous morphology and altered the invasion routes in a microenvironment-adaptive manner. We further elucidate the effects of inhibition of ECM remodeling-related enzymatic activity (Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 2/9, hyaluronan synthase (HAS)) on GBM cell invasion. Interestingly, after blocking both enzyme activity, GBM cells underwent morphological transition and switch the invasion mode. Such adaptability could render cell invasion resistant to anti-cancer target therapy. There results provide insight of how organ-specific matrix differentially regulates cancer cell phenotype, and have significant implications for the design of matrix with appropriate physiologically relevant properties for in vitro tumor model.",29545552,PMC5854588,10.1038/s41598-018-22681-3,72,Scientific reports,101563288,4.996,0.6862649321556091,0.9498327759197325,0.35451505016722407,0.6726285245107568
Immune and non-immune cell subtypes identify novel targets for prognostic and therapeutic strategy: A study based on intratumoral heterogenicity analysis of multicenter scRNA-seq datasets in lung adenocarcinoma,"Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most common type of lung cancer and the leading cause of cancer incidence and mortality worldwide. Despite the improvement of traditional and immunological therapies, the clinical outcome of LUAD is still far from satisfactory. Patients given the same treatment regimen had different responses and clinical outcomes due to the heterogeneity of LUAD. How to identify the targets based on heterogeneity analysis is crucial for treatment strategies. Recently, the single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology has been used to investigate the tumor microenvironment (TME) based on cell-specific changes and shows prominently valuable for biomarker prediction. In this study, we systematically analyzed a meta-dataset from the multiple LUAD scRNA-seq datasets in LUAD, identified 15 main types of cells and 57 cell subgroups, and revealed a series of potential biomarkers in M2b, exhausted CD8+T, endothelial cells, fibroblast, and metabolic patterns in TME, which further validated with immunofluorescence in clinical cohorts of LUAD. In the prognosis analysis, M0 macrophage and T cell activation were shown correlated to a better prognosis (p<0.05). Briefly, our study provided insights into the heterogeneity of LUAD and assisted in novel therapeutic strategies for clinical outcome improvement.",36483553,PMC9723329,10.3389/fimmu.2022.1046121,2,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,8.786,0.6860546469688416,0.35785953177257523,0.6822742474916388,0.6196595440341477
Single-cell transcriptomic analysis reveals tumor cell heterogeneity and immune microenvironment features of pituitary neuroendocrine tumors,"Background:Pituitary neuroendocrine tumors (PitNETs) are one of the most common types of intracranial tumors. Currently, the cellular characteristics of normal pituitary and various other types of PitNETs are still not completely understood.Methods:We performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on 4 normal samples and 24 PitNET samples for comprehensive bioinformatics analysis. Findings regarding the function of PBK in the aggressive tumor cells were validated by siRNA knockdown, overexpression, and transwell experiments.Results:We first constructed a reference cell atlas of the human pituitary. Subsequent scRNA-seq analysis of PitNET samples, representing major tumor subtypes, shed light on the intrinsic cellular heterogeneities of the tumor cells and tumor microenvironment (TME). We found that the expression of hormone-encoding genes defined the major variations of the PIT1-lineage tumor cell transcriptomic heterogeneities. A sub-population of TPIT-lineage tumor cells highly expressing GZMK suggested a novel subtype of corticotroph tumors. In immune cells, we found two clusters of tumor-associated macrophages, which were both highly enriched in PitNETs but with distinct functional characteristics. In PitNETs, the stress response pathway was significantly activated in T cells. While a majority of these tumors are benign, our study unveils a common existence of aggressive tumor cells in the studied samples, which highly express a set of malignant signature genes. The following functional experiments confirmed the oncogenic role of selected up-regulated genes. The over-expression of PBK could promote both tumor cell proliferation and migration, and it was also significantly associated with poor prognosis in PitNET patients.Conclusions:Our data and analysis manifested the basic cell types in the normal pituitary and inherent heterogeneity of PitNETs, identified several features of the tumor immune microenvironments, and found a novel epithelial cell sub-population with aggressive signatures across all the studied cases.",38167466,PMC10759356,10.1186/s13073-023-01267-3,0,Genome medicine,101475844,15.266,0.6819385886192322,0.05351170568561873,0.8896321070234113,0.5977919157133453
Microenvironment-Driven Dynamic Chromatin Changes in Glioblastoma Recapitulate Early Neural Development at Single-Cell Resolution,"The tumor microenvironment is necessary for recapitulating the intratumoral heterogeneity and cell state plasticity found in human primary glioblastoma (GBM). Conventional models do not accurately recapitulate the spectrum of GBM cellular states, hindering elucidation of the underlying transcriptional regulation of these states. Using our glioblastoma cerebral organoid model, we profiled the chromatin accessibility of 28,040 single cells in five patient-derived glioma stem cell lines. Integration of paired epigenomes and transcriptomes within the context of tumor-normal host cell interactions was used to probe the gene-regulatory networks underlying individual GBM cellular states in a way not readily possible in other in vitro models. These analyses identified the epigenetic underpinnings of GBM cellular states and characterized dynamic chromatin changes reminiscent of early neural development that underlie GBM cell state transitions. Despite large differences between tumors, a shared cellular compartment made up of neural progenitor-like cells and outer radial glia-like cells was observed. Together, these results shed light on the transcriptional regulation program in GBM and offer novel therapeutic targets across a broad range of genetically heterogenous GBMs.Significance:Single-cell analyses elucidate the chromatin landscape and transcriptional regulation of glioblastoma cellular states and identify a radial glia-like population, providing potential targets to disrupt cell states and improve therapeutic efficacy.",36877162,PMC11022245,10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-22-2872,3,Cancer research,2984705R,0.0,0.6750152111053467,0.451505016722408,0.033444816053511704,0.501999093218392
The landscape of the mesenchymal signature in brain tumours,"The complexity of glioblastoma multiforme, the most common and lethal variant of gliomas, is reflected by cellular and molecular heterogeneity at both the inter- and intra-tumoural levels. Molecular subtyping has arisen in the past two decades as a promising strategy to give better predictions of glioblastoma multiforme evolution, common disease pathways, and rational treatment options. The Cancer Genome Atlas network initially identified four molecular subtypes of glioblastoma multiforme: proneural, neural, mesenchymal and classical. However, further studies, also investigated glioma stem cells, have only identified two to three subtypes: proneural, mesenchymal and classical. The proneural-mesenchymal transition upon tumour recurrence has been suggested as a mechanism of tumour resistance to radiation and chemotherapy treatment. Glioblastoma multiforme patients with the mesenchymal subtype tend to survive shorter than other subtypes when analysis is restricted to samples with low transcriptional heterogeneity. Although the mesenchymal signature in malignant glioma may seem at odds with the common idea of the ectodermal origin of neural-glial lineages, the presence of the mesenchymal signature in glioma is supported by several studies suggesting that it can result from: (i) intrinsic expression of tumour cells affected with accumulated genetic mutations and cell of origin; (ii) tumour micro-environments with recruited macrophages or microglia, mesenchymal stem cells or pericytes, and other progenitors; (iii) resistance to tumour treatment, including radiotherapy, antiangiogenic therapy and possibly chemotherapy. Genetic abnormalities, mainly NF1 mutations, together with NF-ÎºB transcriptional programs, are the main driver of acquiring mesenchymal-signature. This signature is far from being simply tissue artefacts, as it has been identified in single cell glioma, circulating tumour cells, and glioma stem cells that are released from the tumour micro-environment. All these together suggest that the mesenchymal signature in glioblastoma multiforme is induced and sustained via cell intrinsic mechanisms and tumour micro-environment factors. Although patients with the mesenchymal subtype tend to have poorer prognosis, they may have favourable response to immunotherapy and intensive radio- and chemotherapy.",30946477,PMC6485274,10.1093/brain/awz044,167,Brain : a journal of neurology,0372537,0.0,0.6724392771720886,0.979933110367893,0.03678929765886288,0.6068080479086044
Spatial transcriptomics reveals segregation of tumor cell states in glioblastoma and marked immunosuppression within the perinecrotic niche,"Glioblastoma (GBM) remains an untreatable malignant tumor with poor patient outcomes, characterized by palisading necrosis and microvascular proliferation. While single-cell technology made it possible to characterize different lineage of glioma cells into neural progenitor-like (NPC-like), oligodendrocyte-progenitor-like (OPC-like), astrocyte-like (AC-like) and mesenchymal like (MES-like) states, it does not capture the spatial localization of these tumor cell states. Spatial transcriptomics empowers the study of the spatial organization of different cell types and tumor cell states and allows for the selection of regions of interest to investigate region-specific and cell-type-specific pathways. Here, we obtained paired 10x Chromium single-nuclei RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) and 10x Visium spatial transcriptomics data from three GBM patients to interrogate the GBM microenvironment. Integration of the snRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics data reveals patterns of segregation of tumor cell states. For instance, OPC-like tumor and NPC-like tumor significantly segregate in two of the three samples. Our differentially expressed gene and pathway analyses uncovered significant pathways in functionally relevant niches. Specifically, perinecrotic regions were more immunosuppressive than the endogenous GBM microenvironment, and perivascular regions were more pro-inflammatory. Our gradient analysis suggests that OPC-like tumor cells tend to reside in areas closer to the tumor vasculature compared to tumor necrosis, which may reflect increased oxygen requirements for OPC-like cells. In summary, we characterized the localization of cell types and tumor cell states, the gene expression patterns, and pathways in different niches within the GBM microenvironment. Our results provide further evidence of the segregation of tumor cell states and highlight the immunosuppressive nature of the necrotic and perinecrotic niches in GBM.",38650010,PMC11036705,10.1186/s40478-024-01769-0,0,Acta neuropathologica communications,101610673,7.578,0.6657366156578064,0.056856187290969896,0.5551839464882943,0.5218499961505367
uPAR (PLAUR) Marks Two Intra-Tumoral Subtypes of Glioblastoma: Insights from Single-Cell RNA Sequencing,"Urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) encoded by thePLAURgene is known as a clinical marker for cell invasiveness in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). It is additionally implicated in various processes, including angiogenesis and inflammation within the tumor microenvironment. However, there has not been a comprehensive study that depicts the overall functions and molecular cooperators ofPLAURwith respect to intra-tumoral subtypes of GBM. Using single-cell RNA sequencing data from 37 GBM patients, we identifiedPLAURas a marker gene for two distinct subtypes in GBM. One subtype is featured by inflammatory activities and the other subtype is marked by ECM remodeling processes. Using the whole-transcriptome data from single cells, we are able to uncover the molecular cooperators ofPLAURfor both subtypes without presuming biological pathways.

We concluded that targetingPLAURdirectly influences the mechanisms represented by these two protein networks, regardless of the subtype of the targeted cell.",38396677,PMC10889167,10.3390/ijms25041998,0,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,6.208,0.6651931405067444,0.06020066889632107,0.4280936454849498,0.49677474718030085
Preferential Infiltration of Unique VÎ³9JÎ³2-VÎ´2 T Cells Into Glioblastoma Multiforme,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is clinically highly aggressive as a result of evolutionary dynamics induced by cross-talk between cancer cells and a heterogeneous group of immune cells in tumor microenvironment. The brain harbors limited numbers of immune cells with few lymphocytes and macrophages; thus, innate-like lymphocytes, such as Î³Î´ T cells, have important roles in antitumor immunity. Here, we characterized GBM-infiltrating Î³Î´ T cells, which may have roles in regulating the GBM tumor microenvironment and cancer cell gene expression. V(D)J repertoires of tumor-infiltrating and blood-circulating Î³Î´ T cells from four patients were analyzed by next-generation sequencing-based T-cell receptor (TCR) sequencing in addition to mutation and immune profiles in four GBM cases. In all tumor tissues, abundant innate and effector/memory lymphocytes were detected, accompanied by large numbers of tumor-associated macrophages and closely located tumor-infiltrating Î³Î´ T cells, which appear to have anti-tumor activity. The immune-related gene expression analysis using the TCGA database showed that the signature gene expression extent of Î³Î´ T cells were more associated with those of cytotoxic T and Th1 cells and M1 macrophages than those of Th2 cells and M2 macrophages. Although the most abundant Î³Î´ T cells were VÎ³9VÎ´2 T cells in both tumor tissues and blood, the repertoire of intratumoral VÎ³9VÎ´2 T cells was distinct from that of peripheral blood VÎ³9VÎ´2 T cells and was dominated by VÎ³9JÎ³2 sequences, not by canonical VÎ³9JÎ³P sequences that are mostly commonly found in blood Î³Î´ T cells. Collectively, unique GBM-specific TCR clonotypes were identified by comparing TCR repertoires of peripheral blood and intra-tumoral Î³Î´ T cells. These findings will be helpful for the elucidation of tumor-specific antigens and development of anticancer immunotherapies using tumor-infiltrating Î³Î´ T cells.",30967876,PMC6440384,10.3389/fimmu.2019.00555,21,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,8.786,0.6638869047164917,0.802675585284281,0.68561872909699,0.6959910057061492
Cellular and molecular features related to exceptional therapy response and extreme long-term survival in glioblastoma,"Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) remains the most common malignant primary brain tumor with a dismal prognosis that rarely exceeds beyond 2 years despite extensive therapy, which consists of maximal safe surgical resection, radiotherapy, and/or chemotherapy. Recently, it has become clear that GBM is not one homogeneous entity and that both intra-and intertumoral heterogeneity contributes significantly to differences in tumoral behavior which may consequently be responsible for differences in survival. Strikingly and in spite of its dismal prognosis, small fractions of GBM patients seem to display extremely long survival, defined as surviving over 10 years after diagnosis, compared to the large majority of patients. Although the underlying mechanisms for this peculiarity remain largely unknown, emerging data suggest that still poorly characterized both cellular and molecular factors of the tumor microenvironment and their interplay probably play an important role. We hereby give an extensive overview of what is yet known about these cellular and molecular features shaping extreme long survival in GBM.",36776000,PMC10242322,10.1002/cam4.5681,3,Cancer medicine,101595310,4.711,0.6622506380081177,0.45484949832775917,0.3277591973244147,0.5538721219353053
Tumor Evolution of Glioma-Intrinsic Gene Expression Subtypes Associates with Immunological Changes in the Microenvironment,"We leveraged IDH wild-type glioblastomas, derivative neurospheres, and single-cell gene expression profiles to define three tumor-intrinsic transcriptional subtypes designated as proneural, mesenchymal, and classical. Transcriptomic subtype multiplicity correlated with increased intratumoral heterogeneity and presence of tumor microenvironment. In silico cell sorting identified macrophages/microglia, CD4+T lymphocytes, and neutrophils in the glioma microenvironment. NF1 deficiency resulted in increased tumor-associated macrophages/microglia infiltration. Longitudinal transcriptome analysis showed that expression subtype is retained in 55% of cases. Gene signature-based tumor microenvironment inference revealed a decrease in invading monocytes and a subtype-dependent increase in macrophages/microglia cells upon disease recurrence.

Novel insights from spatial transcriptome analysis in solid tumors,"Since its first application in 2016, spatial transcriptomics has become a rapidly evolving technology in recent years. Spatial transcriptomics enables transcriptomic data to be acquired from intact tissue sections and provides spatial distribution information and remedies the disadvantage of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), whose data lack spatially resolved information. Presently, spatial transcriptomics has been widely applied to various tissue types, especially for the study of tumor heterogeneity. In this review, we provide a summary of the research progress in utilizing spatial transcriptomics to investigate tumor heterogeneity and the microenvironment with a focus on solid tumors. We summarize the research breakthroughs in various fields and perspectives due to the application of spatial transcriptomics, including cell clustering and interaction, cellular metabolism, gene expression, immune cell programs and combination with other techniques. As a combination of multiple transcriptomics, single-cell multiomics shows its superiority and validity in single-cell analysis. We also discuss the application prospect of single-cell multiomics, and we believe that with the progress of data integration from various transcriptomics, a multilayered subcellular landscape will be revealed.",37781515,PMC10539699,10.7150/ijbs.83098,0,International journal of biological sciences,101235568,10.75,0.6611575484275818,0.06354515050167224,0.802675585284281,0.5699386762137397
Single-Cell RNA-Sequencing Shift in the Interaction Pattern Between Glioma Stem Cells and Immune Cells During Tumorigenesis,"Glioblastoma is one of the most common neoplasms in the central nervous system characterized by limited immune response and unlimited expansion capability. Cancer stem cells (GSCs), a small fraction of the tumor cells, possess a pivotal regulation capability in the tumor microenvironment with a superior proliferation ability. We aimed to reveal the interaction between glioma stem cells (GSCs) and immune cells during tumorigenesis. Single-cell sequencing data from seven surgical specimens of glioblastoma patients and patient-derived GSCs cocultured with peripheral leukocytes were used for the analysis. Cell grouping and trajectory analysis were performed using Seurat and Monocle 3 packages in R software. The gene set of Cancer Genome Anatomy Project was used to define different cell types. Cells with the ability of proliferation and differentiation in glioblastoma tissue were defined as GSCs, which had a similar expression pattern to that in the GSCsin vitro. Astrocytes in glioblastoma were mainly derived from differentiated GSCs, while oligodendrocytes were most likely to be derived from different precursor cells. No remarkable evolutionary trajectory was observed among the subgroups of T cells in glioblastoma. The immune checkpoint interaction between GSCs and immune cells was changed from stimulatory to inhibitory during tumorigenesis. The patient-derived GSCs system is an ideal model for GSC research. The above research revealed that the interaction pattern between GSC glioma stem cells and immune cells during tumorigenesis provides a theoretical basis for GSC glioma stem cell-targeted immunotherapy.",33133100,PMC7580180,10.3389/fimmu.2020.581209,22,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,8.786,0.6602818965911865,0.8127090301003345,0.6889632107023411,0.6965035861152471
Expression of hub genes of endothelial cells in glioblastoma-A prognostic model for GBM patients integrating single-cell RNA sequencing and bulk RNA sequencing,"Background:This study aimed to use single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) to discover marker genes in endothelial cells (ECs) and construct a prognostic model for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients in combination with traditional high-throughput RNA sequencing (bulk RNA-seq).Methods:Bulk RNA-seq data was downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and The China Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) databases. 10x scRNA-seq data for GBM were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) were used for downscaling and cluster identification. Key modules and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified by weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA). A non-negative matrix decomposition (NMF) algorithm was used to identify the different subtypes based on DEGs, and multivariate cox regression analysis to model the prognosis. Finally, differences in mutational landscape, immune cell abundance, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs)-associated genes, immunotherapy effects, and enriched pathways were investigated between different risk groups.Results:The analysis of scRNA-seq data from eight samples revealed 13 clusters and four cell types. After applying Fisher's exact test, ECs were identified as the most important cell type. The NMF algorithm identified two clusters with different prognostic and immunological features based on DEGs. We finally built a prognostic model based on the expression levels of four key genes. Higher risk scores were significantly associated with poorer survival outcomes, low mutation rates in IDH genes, and upregulation of immune checkpoints such as PD-L1 and CD276.Conclusion:We built and validated a 4-gene signature for GBM using 10 scRNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq data in this work.",36474171,PMC9724299,10.1186/s12885-022-10305-z,19,BMC cancer,100967800,4.638,0.6535692811012268,0.7792642140468228,0.3076923076923077,0.6095328730085623
Tumor Microenvironment and Microvascular Density in Human Glioblastoma,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is a very aggressive form of cancer affecting the central nervous system. Although it occurs almost exclusively in the brain, glioblastoma can also appear in the brainstem, cerebellum, and spinal cord. It is characterized by high rates of proliferation, invasion, and necrosis. Moreover, GBM is a highly vascularized tumor and presents resistance to therapy. Recent data indicate that GBM cells are surrounded by a microenvironment (TME) which includes a complex network constituted of cellular/extracellular components and vessels able to influence both tumor growth and angiogenesis. In this retrospective study, we evaluated 30 bioptic specimens of adult patients diagnosed with IDH1 wild type GBM taken at the time of the first diagnosis. Each section has been divided into two experimental zones: the tumor side and the healthy surrounding tissue. We performed a series of immunohistochemical stainings with the purpose of evaluating the presence of total and M2 macrophages, CD4+-, CD8+-lymphocytes, and CD34+microvessels. In addition, we have also evaluated the percentage of cells expressing bcl6 and p53 to determine any possible correlations with TME. Our data showed a significant increase in the total and M2 type macrophages, of CD4+and CD8+lymphocytes, and of CD34+microvessels in the tumoral area respective to the healthy zone. We also confirmed our previous data showing the higher number of p53 and BCL6+cells in the tumor area with a positive correlation between BCL6 and CD34+microvessels. In conclusion, the data that came from this work support the important role played by microenvironment components in GBM progression. These results could contribute to the generation of new specific therapies useful in preventing GBM progression.",36611806,PMC9818990,10.3390/cells12010011,9,Cells,101600052,7.666,0.6534587144851685,0.6622073578595318,0.5819397993311036,0.6409046601292282
Tumor immune microenvironment lncRNAs,"Long non-coding ribonucleic acids (RNAs) (lncRNAs) are key players in tumorigenesis and immune responses. The nature of their cell type-specific gene expression and other functional evidence support the idea that lncRNAs have distinct cellular functions in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). To date, the majority of lncRNA studies have heavily relied on bulk RNA-sequencing data in which various cell types contribute to an averaged signal, limiting the discovery of cell type-specific lncRNA functions. Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a potential solution for tackling this limitation despite the lack of annotations for low abundance yet cell type-specific lncRNAs. Hence, updated annotations and further understanding of the cellular expression of lncRNAs will be necessary for characterizing cell type-specific functions of lncRNA genes in the TIME. In this review, we discuss lncRNAs that are specifically expressed in tumor and immune cells, summarize the regulatory functions of the lncRNAs at the cell type level and highlight how a scRNA-seq approach can help to study the cell type-specific functions of TIME lncRNAs.",34891154,PMC8769899,10.1093/bib/bbab504,68,Briefings in bioinformatics,100912837,13.994,0.6520198583602905,0.939799331103679,0.8561872909698997,0.75040923943089
Decoding the tumor microenvironment and molecular mechanism: unraveling cervical cancer subpopulations and prognostic signatures through scRNA-Seq and bulk RNA-seq analyses,"Background:Cervical carcinoma (CC) represents a prevalent gynecological neoplasm, with a discernible rise in prevalence among younger cohorts observed in recent years. Nonetheless, the intrinsic cellular heterogeneity of CC remains inadequately investigated.Methods:We utilized single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) transcriptomic analysis to scrutinize the tumor epithelial cells derived from four specimens of cervical carcinoma (CC) patients. This method enabled the identification of pivotal subpopulations of tumor epithelial cells and elucidation of their contributions to CC progression. Subsequently, we assessed the influence of associated molecules in bulk RNA sequencing (Bulk RNA-seq) cohorts and performed cellular experiments for validation purposes.Results:Through our analysis, we have discerned C3 PLP2+ Tumor Epithelial Progenitor Cells as a noteworthy subpopulation in cervical carcinoma (CC), exerting a pivotal influence on the differentiation and progression of CC. We have established an independent prognostic indicator-the PLP2+ Tumor EPCs score. By stratifying patients into high and low score groups based on the median score, we have observed that the high-score group exhibits diminished survival rates compared to the low-score group. The correlations observed between these groups and immune infiltration, enriched pathways, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), drug sensitivity, among other factors, further underscore their impact on CC prognosis. Cellular experiments have validated the significant impact of ATF6 on the proliferation and migration of CC cell lines.Conclusion:This study enriches our comprehension of the determinants shaping the progression of CC, elevates cognizance of the tumor microenvironment in CC, and offers valuable insights for prospective CC therapies. These discoveries contribute to the refinement of CC diagnostics and the formulation of optimal therapeutic approaches.",38482016,PMC10933018,10.3389/fimmu.2024.1351287,1,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,8.786,0.651576578617096,0.2809364548494983,0.6923076923076923,0.5855947766016957
Involvement of microglia-expressed MS4A6A in the onset of glioblastoma,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) represents the deadliest form of brain tumour, characterized by its low survival rate and grim prognosis. Cytokines released from glioma-associated microglia/macrophages are involved in establishing the tumour microenvironment, thereby crucially promoting GBM progression. MS4A6A polymorphism was confirmed to be associated with neurodegenerative and polymorphism disease pathobiology, but whether it participates in the regulation of GBM and the underlying mechanisms is still not elucidated. Here, we found that MS4A6A was significantly upregulated in GBM patient samples. The results from the single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) database and immunostaining demonstrated the specific expression of MS4A6A in microglial cells. In vitro, microglial overexpression of MS4A6A stimulated the proliferation and migration of glioblastoma cells. Moreover, high MS4A6A mRNA expression was related to poor prognosis in GBM patients. Our study highlights the potential of MS4A6A as a promising biomarker for GBM, which may provide novel strategies for its prevention, diagnosis and treatment.",38488530,,10.1111/ejn.16309,0,The European journal of neuroscience,8918110,3.698,0.6514657735824585,0.06688963210702341,0.2140468227424749,0.4470667551193747
Decoding key cell sub-populations and molecular alterations in glioblastoma at recurrence by single-cell analysis,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most frequent malignant brain tumor, the relapse of which is unavoidable following standard treatment. However, the effective treatment for recurrent GBM is lacking, necessitating the understanding of key mechanisms driving tumor recurrence and the identification of new targets for intervention. Here, we integrated single-cell RNA-sequencing data spanning 36 patient-matched primary and recurrent GBM (pGBM and rGBM) specimens, with 6 longitudinal GBM spatial transcriptomics to explore molecular alterations at recurrence, with each cell type characterized in parallel. Genes involved in extracellular matrix (ECM) organization are preferentially enriched in rGBM cells, and MAFK is highlighted as a potential regulator. Notably, we uncover a unique subpopulation of GBM cells that is much less detected in pGBM and highly expresses ECM and mesenchyme related genes, suggesting it may contribute to the molecular transition of rGBM. Further regulatory network analysis reveals that transcription factors, such as NFATC4 and activator protein 1 members, may function as hub regulators. All non-tumor cells alter their specific sets of genes as well and certain subgroups of myeloid cells appear to be physically associated with the mesenchyme-like GBM subpopulation. Altogether, our study provides new insights into the molecular understanding of GBM relapse and candidate targets for rGBM treatment.",37525259,PMC10391841,10.1186/s40478-023-01613-x,0,Acta neuropathologica communications,101610673,7.578,0.6491339206695557,0.07023411371237458,0.5585284280936454,0.5152328607629374
Challenges in glioblastoma research: focus on the tumor microenvironment,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most deadly type of malignant brain tumor, despite extensive molecular analyses of GBM cells. In recent years, the tumor microenvironment (TME) has been recognized as an important player and therapeutic target in GBM. However, there is a need for a full and integrated understanding of the different cellular and molecular components involved in the GBM TME and their interactions for the development of more efficient therapies. In this review, we provide a comprehensive report of the GBM TME, which assembles the contributions of physicians and translational researchers working on brain tumor pathology and therapy in France. We propose a holistic view of the subject by delineating the specific features of the GBM TME at the cellular, molecular, and therapeutic levels.",36400694,,10.1016/j.trecan.2022.09.005,55,Trends in cancer,101665956,19.161,0.6447844505310059,0.9230769230769231,0.9565217391304348,0.7627904027600751
Testing for Phylogenetic Signal in Single-Cell RNA-Seq Data,"Phylogenetic methods are emerging as a useful tool to understand cancer evolutionary dynamics, including tumor structure, heterogeneity, and progression. Most currently used approaches utilize either bulk whole genome sequencing or single-cell DNA sequencing and are based on calling copy number alterations and single nucleotide variants (SNVs). Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is commonly applied to explore differential gene expression of cancer cells throughout tumor progression. The method exacerbates the single-cell sequencing problem of low yield per cell with uneven expression levels. This accounts for low and uneven sequencing coverage and makes SNV detection and phylogenetic analysis challenging. In this article, we demonstrate for the first time that scRNA-seq data contain sufficient evolutionary signal and can also be utilized in phylogenetic analyses. We explore and compare results of such analyses based on both expression levels and SNVs called from scRNA-seq data. Both techniques are shown to be useful for reconstructing phylogenetic relationships between cells, reflecting the clonal composition of a tumor. Both standardized expression values and SNVs appear to be equally capable of reconstructing a similar pattern of phylogenetic relationship. This pattern is stable even when phylogenetic uncertainty is taken in account. Our results open up a new direction of somatic phylogenetics based on scRNA-seq data. Further research is required to refine and improve these approaches to capture the full picture of somatic evolutionary dynamics in cancer.",36475926,PMC10125402,10.1089/cmb.2022.0357,5,Journal of computational biology : a journal of computational molecular cell,9433358,1.549,0.6440012454986572,0.5284280936454849,0.12374581939799331,0.5168355299078901
Development and validation a prognostic model based on natural killer T cells marker genes for predicting prognosis and characterizing immune status in glioblastoma through integrated analysis of single-cell and bulk RNA sequencing,"Background:Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive and unstoppable malignancy. Natural killer T (NKT) cells, characterized by specific markers, play pivotal roles in many tumor-associated pathophysiological processes. Therefore, investigating the functions and complex interactions of NKT cells is great interest for exploring GBM.Methods:We acquired a single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) dataset of GBM from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) was employed to further screen genes subpopulations. Subsequently, we integrated the GBM cohorts from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) databases to describe different subtypes by consensus clustering and developed a prognostic model by least absolute selection and shrinkage operator (LASSO) and multivariate Cox regression analysis. We further investigated differences in survival rates and clinical characteristics among different risk groups. Furthermore, a nomogram was developed by combining riskscore with the clinical characteristics. We investigated the abundance of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) by CIBERSORT and single sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) algorithms. Immunotherapy efficacy assessment was done with the assistance of Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE) and The Cancer Immunome Atlas (TCIA) databases. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) experiments and immunohistochemical profiles of tissues were utilized to validate model genes.Results:We identified 945 NKT cells marker genes from scRNA-seq data. Through further screening, 107 genes were accurately identified, of which 15 were significantly correlated with prognosis. We distinguished GBM samples into two distinct subtypes and successfully developed a robust prognostic prediction model. Survival analysis indicated that high expression of NKT cell marker genes was significantly associated with poor prognosis in GBM patients. Riskscore can be used as an independent prognostic factor. The nomogram was demonstrated remarkable utility in aiding clinical decision making. Tumor immune microenvironment analysis revealed significant differences of immune infiltration characteristics between different risk groups. In addition, the expression levels of immune checkpoint-associated genes were consistently elevated in the high-risk group, suggesting more prominent immune escape but also a stronger response to immune checkpoint inhibitors.Conclusions:By integrating scRNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq data analysis, we successfully developed a prognostic prediction model that incorporates two pivotal NKT cells marker genes, namely, CD44 and TNFSF14. This model has exhibited outstanding performance in assessing the prognosis of GBM patients. Furthermore, we conducted a preliminary investigation into the immune microenvironment across various risk groups that contributes to uncover promising immunotherapeutic targets specific to GBM.",37650991,,10.1007/s10142-023-01217-7,0,Functional & integrative genomics,100939343,3.674,0.6417592167854309,0.07357859531772576,0.2040133779264214,0.440573924720088
Spatiotemporal analysis of glioma heterogeneity reveals COL1A1 as an actionable target to disrupt tumor progression,"Intra-tumoral heterogeneity is a hallmark of glioblastoma that challenges treatment efficacy. However, the mechanisms that set up tumor heterogeneity and tumor cell migration remain poorly understood. Herein, we present a comprehensive spatiotemporal study that aligns distinctive intra-tumoral histopathological structures, oncostreams, with dynamic properties and a specific, actionable, spatial transcriptomic signature. Oncostreams are dynamic multicellular fascicles of spindle-like and aligned cells with mesenchymal properties, detected using ex vivo explants and in vivo intravital imaging. Their density correlates with tumor aggressiveness in genetically engineered mouse glioma models, and high grade human gliomas. Oncostreams facilitate the intra-tumoral distribution of tumoral and non-tumoral cells, and potentially the collective invasion of the normal brain. These fascicles are defined by a specific molecular signature that regulates their organization and function. Oncostreams structure and function depend on overexpression of COL1A1. Col1a1 is a central gene in the dynamic organization of glioma mesenchymal transformation, and a powerful regulator of glioma malignant behavior. Inhibition of Col1a1 eliminates oncostreams, reprograms the malignant histopathological phenotype, reduces expression of the mesenchymal associated genes, induces changes in the tumor microenvironment and prolongs animal survival. Oncostreams represent a pathological marker of potential value for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment.",35750880,PMC9232499,10.1038/s41467-022-31340-1,21,Nature communications,101528555,17.694,0.6414223909378052,0.8060200668896321,0.9297658862876255,0.7320106251981346
Single-Cell Atlas Reveals Complexity of the Immunosuppressive Microenvironment of Initial and Recurrent Glioblastoma,"The Glioblastoma (GBM) immune microenvironment plays a critical role in tumor development, progression, and prognosis. A comprehensive understanding of the intricate milieu and its interactions remains unclear, and single-cell analysis is crucially needed. Leveraging mass cytometry (CyTOF), we analyzed immunocytes from 13 initial and three recurrent GBM samples and their matched peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pPBMCs). Using a panel of 30 markers, we provide a high-dimensional view of the complex GBM immune microenvironment. Hematoxylin and eosin staining and polychromatic immunofluorescence were used for verification of the key findings. In the initial and recurrent GBMs, glioma-associated microglia/macrophages (GAMs) constituted 59.05 and 27.87% of the immunocytes, respectively; programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), T cell immunoglobulin domain and mucin domain-3 (TIM-3), lymphocyte activation gene-3 (LAG-3), interleukin-10 (IL-10) and transforming growth factor-Î² (TGFÎ²) demonstrated different expression levels in the GAMs among the patients. GAMs could be subdivided into different subgroups with different phenotypes. Both the exhausted T cell and regulatory T (Treg) cell percentages were significantly higher in tumors than in pPBMCs. The natural killer (NK) cells that infiltrated into the tumor lesions expressed higher levels of CXC chemokine receptor 3 (CXCR3), as these cells expressed lower levels of interferon-Î³ (IFNÎ³). The immune microenvironment in the initial and recurrent GBMs displayed similar suppressive changes. Our study confirmed that GAMs, as the dominant infiltrating immunocytes, present great inter- and intra-tumoral heterogeneity and that GAMs, increased exhausted T cells, infiltrating Tregs, and nonfunctional NK cells contribute to local immune suppressive characteristics. Recurrent GBMs share similar immune signatures with the initial GBMs except the proportion of GAMs decreases.",32457755,PMC7221162,10.3389/fimmu.2020.00835,85,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,8.786,0.6375951170921326,0.9632107023411371,0.6956521739130435,0.7143296455061157
RNA modification patterns based on major RNA modifications define tumor microenvironment characteristics in glioblastoma,"RNA modifications play a major role in tumorigenicity and progression, but the expression and function in glioblastoma (GBM) have not been well described. In this study, we developed a GBM score based on the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between groups showing RNA modification patterns. We assessed the association between the GBM score and tumor microenvironment (TME) characteristics. Based on the gene expression of these regulators, we identified two clusters with distinct RNA modification patterns. Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that patients in cluster 1 had worse survival than those in cluster 2. Kaplan-Meier and multivariate Cox regression analyses showed that GBM scores (based on DEGs between RNA modification patterns) are an independent predictive biomarker for patient prognosis. Besides, we found that samples with high scores were significantly associated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and immune checkpoints, while samples with low scores were associated with cell cycle regulation. Importantly, GBM-score markedly positively correlated drug resistance, while negatively correlated with drug sensitive. The responders of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy tend to have a lower GBM score than non-responders.

scRNA-seq and proteomics reveal the distinction of M2-like macrophages between primary and recurrent malignant glioma and its critical role in the recurrence,"Aims:Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in the immune microenvironment play an important role in the increased drug resistance and recurrence of malignant glioma, but the mechanism remains incompletely inventoried. The focus of this study was to investigate the distinctions of M2-like TAMs in the immune microenvironment between primary and recurrent malignant glioma and its influence in the recurrence.Methods:We employed single-cell RNA sequencing to construct a single-cell atlas for a total of 23,010 individual cells from 6 patients with primary or recurrent malignant glioma and identified 5 cell types, including TAMs and malignant cells. Immunohistochemical techniques and proteomics analysis were performed to investigate the role of intercellular interaction between malignant cells and TAMs in the recurrence of malignant glioma.Results:Six subgroups of TAMs were annotated and M2-like TAMs were found to increase in recurrent malignant glioma significantly. A pseudotime trajectory and a dynamic gene expression profiling during the recurrence of malignant glioma were reconstructed. Up-regulation of several cancer pathways and intercellular interaction-related genes are associated with the recurrence of malignant glioma. Moreover, the M2-like TAMs can activate the PI3K/Akt/HIF-1Î±/CA9 pathway in the malignant glioma cells via SPP1-CD44-mediated intercellular interaction. Interestingly, high expression of CA9 can trigger the immunosuppressive response in the malignant glioma, thus promoting the degree of malignancy and drug resistance.Conclusion:Our study uncovers the distinction of M2-like TAMs between primary and recurrent glioma, which offers unparalleled insights into the immune microenvironment of primary and recurrent malignant glioma.",37194413,PMC10580349,10.1111/cns.14269,1,CNS neuroscience & therapeutics,101473265,7.035,0.6274948120117188,0.2842809364548495,0.5217391304347826,0.5377009005849577
"Interaction, immune infiltration characteristics and prognostic modeling of efferocytosis-related subtypes in glioblastoma","Background:Efferocytosis is a biological process in which phagocytes remove apoptotic cells and vesicles from tissues. This process is initiated by the release of inflammatory mediators from apoptotic cells and plays a crucial role in resolving inflammation. The signals associated with efferocytosis have been found to regulate the inflammatory response and the tumor microenvironment (TME), which promotes the immune escape of tumor cells. However, the role of efferocytosis in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is not well understood and requires further investigation.Methods:In this study, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of 22 efferocytosis-related genes (ERGs) by searching for studies related to efferocytosis. Using bulk RNA-Seq and single-cell sequencing data, we analyzed the expression and mutational characteristics of these ERGs. By using an unsupervised clustering algorithm, we obtained ERG clusters from 549 GBM patients and evaluated the immune infiltration characteristics of each cluster. We then identified differential genes (DEGs) in the two ERG clusters and classified GBM patients into different gene clusters using univariate cox analysis and unsupervised clustering algorithms. Finally, we utilized the Boruta algorithm to screen for prognostic genes and reduce dimensionality, and the PCA algorithm was applied to create a novel efferocytosis-related scoring system.Results:Differential expression of ERGs in glioma cell lines and normal cells was analyzed by rt-PCR. Cell function experiments, on the other hand, validated TIMD4 as a tumor risk factor in GBM. We found that different ERG clusters and gene clusters have distinct prognostic and immune infiltration profiles. The ERG signature we developed provides insight into the tumor microenvironment of GBM. Patients with lower ERG scores have a better survival rate and a higher likelihood of benefiting from immunotherapy.Conclusions:Our novel efferocytosis-related signature has the potential to be used in clinical practice for risk stratification of GBM patients and for selecting individuals who are likely to respond to immunotherapy. This can help clinicians design appropriate targeted therapies before initiating clinical treatment.",37853449,PMC10583324,10.1186/s12920-023-01688-4,2,BMC medical genomics,101319628,3.622,0.6268097162246704,0.36454849498327757,0.20066889632107024,0.4891293079956718
Glioblastoma preclinical models: Strengths and weaknesses,"Glioblastoma multiforme is a highly malignant brain tumor with significant intra- and intertumoral heterogeneity known for its aggressive nature and poor prognosis. The complex signaling cascade that regulates this heterogeneity makes targeted drug therapy ineffective. The development of an optimal preclinical model is crucial for the comprehension of molecular heterogeneity and enhancing therapeutic efficacy. The ideal model should establish a relationship between various oncogenes and their corresponding responses. This review presents an analysis of preclinical in vivo and in vitro models that have contributed to the advancement of knowledge in model development. The experimental designs utilized in vivo models consisting of both immunodeficient and immunocompetent mice induced with intracranial glioma. The transgenic model was generated using various techniques, like the viral vector delivery system, transposon system, Cre-LoxP model, and CRISPR-Cas9 approaches. The utilization of the patient-derived xenograft model in glioma research is valuable because it closely replicates the human glioma microenvironment, providing evidence of tumor heterogeneity. The utilization of in vitro techniques in the initial stages of research facilitated the comprehension of molecular interactions. However, these techniques are inadequate in reproducing the interactions between cells and extracellular matrix (ECM). As a result, bioengineered 3D-in vitro models, including spheroids, scaffolds, and brain organoids, were developed to cultivate glioma cells in a three-dimensional environment. These models have enabled researchers to understand the influence of ECM on the invasive nature of tumors. Collectively, these preclinical models effectively depict the molecular pathways and facilitate the evaluation of multiple molecules while tailoring drug therapy.",38109948,,10.1016/j.bbcan.2023.189059,0,Biochimica et biophysica acta.

Examining the function of macrophage oxidative stress response and immune system in glioblastoma multiforme through analysis of single-cell transcriptomics,"Background:Glioblastoma (GBM), a prevalent malignant neoplasm within the neuro-oncological domain, has been a subject of considerable scrutiny. Macrophages, serving as the principal immunological constituents, profoundly infiltrate the microenvironment of GBM. However, investigations elucidating the intricate immunological mechanisms governing macrophage involvement in GBM at the single-cell level remain notably limited.Methods:We conducted a comprehensive investigation employing single-cell analysis, aiming to redefine the intricate cellular landscape within both the core and peripheral regions of GBM tumors. Our analytical focus extended to the profound study of macrophages, elucidating their roles within the context of oxidative stress, intercellular information exchange, and cellular trajectories concerning GBM and its assorted subpopulations. We pursued the identification of GBM prognostic genes intricately associated with macrophages. Utilizing experimental research to investigate the relevance of MANBA in the context of GBM.Results:Our investigations have illuminated the central role of macrophages in the intricate interplay among various subpopulations within the GBM microenvironment. Notably, we observed a pronounced intensity of oxidative stress responses within macrophages when compared to their GBM counterparts in other subpopulations. Moreover, macrophages orchestrated intricate cellular communication networks, facilitated by the SPP1-CD44 axis, both internally and with neighboring subpopulations. These findings collectively suggest the potential for macrophage polarization from an M1 to an M2 phenotype, contributing to immune suppression within the tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, our exploration unearthed GBM prognostic genes closely associated with macrophages, most notably MANBA and TCF12. Remarkably, MANBA appears to participate in the modulation of neuroimmune functionality by exerting inhibitory effects on M1-polarized macrophages, thereby fostering tumor progression. To bolster these assertions, experimental validations unequivocally affirmed the promotional impact of MANBA on GBM, elucidated through its capacity to curb cell proliferation, invasiveness, and metastatic potential.Conclusion:These revelations represent a pivotal step towards unraveling the intricate immunological mechanisms governing the interactions between macrophages and diverse subpopulations within the GBM milieu. Furthermore, they lay the foundation for the development of an innovative GBM prognostic model, with MANBA at its epicenter, and underscore the potential for novel immunotherapeutic targets in the ongoing pursuit of enhanced treatment modalities for this formidable malignancy.",38274828,PMC10808540,10.3389/fimmu.2023.1288137,8,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,8.786,0.6257811784744263,0.6187290969899666,0.6989966555183946,0.6390138575863279
Distinct immune escape and microenvironment between RG-like and pri-OPC-like glioma revealed by single-cell RNA-seq analysis,"The association of neurogenesis and gliogenesis with glioma remains unclear. By conducting single-cell RNA-seq analyses on 26 gliomas, we reported their classification into primitive oligodendrocyte precursor cell (pri-OPC)-like and radial glia (RG)-like tumors and validated it in a public cohort and TCGA glioma. The RG-like tumors exhibited wild-type isocitrate dehydrogenase and tended to carry EGFR mutations, and the pri-OPC-like ones were prone to carrying TP53 mutations. Tumor subclones only in pri-OPC-like tumors showed substantially down-regulated MHC-I genes, suggesting their distinct immune evasion programs. Furthermore, the two subgroups appeared to extensively modulate glioma-infiltrating lymphocytes in distinct manners. Some specific genes not expressed in normal immune cells were found in glioma-infiltrating lymphocytes. For example, glial/glioma stem cell markers OLIG1/PTPRZ1 and B cell-specific receptors IGLC2/IGKC were expressed in pri-OPC-like and RG-like glioma-infiltrating lymphocytes, respectively. Their expression was positively correlated with those of immune checkpoint genes (e.g., LGALS33) and poor survivals as validated by the increased expression of LGALS3 upon IGKC overexpression in Jurkat cells. This finding indicated a potential inhibitory role in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and could provide a new way of cancer immune evasion.",37955814,,10.1007/s11684-023-1017-7,0,Frontiers of medicine,101549428,9.927,0.6234915256500244,0.0802675585284281,0.7892976588628763,0.5480079588682755
Exploring the current landscape of single-cell RNA sequencing applications in gastric cancer research,"Gastric cancer (GC) represents a major global health burden and is responsible for a significant number of cancer-related fatalities. Its complex nature, characterized by heterogeneity and aggressive behaviour, poses considerable challenges for effective diagnosis and treatment. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has emerged as an important technique, offering unprecedented precision and depth in gene expression profiling at the cellular level. By facilitating the identification of distinct cell populations, rare cells and dynamic transcriptional changes within GC, scRNA-seq has yielded valuable insights into tumour progression and potential therapeutic targets. Moreover, this technology has significantly improved our comprehension of the tumour microenvironment (TME) and its intricate interplay with immune cells, thereby opening avenues for targeted therapeutic strategies. Nonetheless, certain obstacles, including tumour heterogeneity and technical limitations, persist in the field. Current endeavours are dedicated to refining protocols and computational tools to surmount these challenges. In this narrative review, we explore the significance of scRNA-seq in GC, emphasizing its advantages, challenges and potential applications in unravelling tumour heterogeneity and identifying promising therapeutic targets. Additionally, we discuss recent developments, ongoing efforts to overcome these challenges, and future prospects. Although further enhancements are required, scRNA-seq has already provided valuable insights into GC and holds promise for advancing biomedical research and clinical practice.",38494861,PMC10945075,10.1111/jcmm.18159,1,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,101083777,5.295,0.621828019618988,0.28762541806020064,0.36789297658862874,0.5042004907011586
Consequences and opportunities arising due to sparser single-cell RNA-seq datasets,"With the number of cells measured in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets increasing exponentially and concurrent increased sparsity due to more zero counts being measured for many genes, we demonstrate here that downstream analyses on binary-based gene expression give similar results as count-based analyses. Moreover, a binary representation scales up to ~ 50-fold more cells that can be analyzed using the same computational resources. We also highlight the possibilities provided by binarized scRNA-seq data.

New Approaches to Glioblastoma,"Faced with unique immunobiology and marked heterogeneity, treatment strategies for glioblastoma require therapeutic approaches that diverge from conventional oncological strategies. The selection and prioritization of targeted and immunotherapeutic strategies will need to carefully consider these features and companion biomarkers developed alongside treatment strategies to identify the appropriate patient populations.

"Glioblastoma-initiating cell heterogeneity generated by the cell-of-origin, genetic/epigenetic mutation and microenvironment","Glioblastoma (GBM) and other malignant tumours consist of heterogeneous cancer cells, including GBM-initiating cells (GICs). This heterogeneity is likely to arise from the following: different sets of genetic mutations and epigenetic modifications, which GICs gain in the transformation process; differences in cells of origin, such as stem cells, precursor cells or differentiated cells; and the cancer microenvironment, in which GICs communicate with neural cells, endothelial cells and immune cells. Furthermore, considering that various types of GICs can be generated at different time points of the transformation process, GBM very likely consists of heterogeneous GICs and their progeny. Because cancer cell heterogeneity is responsible for therapy resistance, it is crucial to develop methods of reducing such heterogeneity. Here, I summarize how GIC heterogeneity is generated in the transformation process and present how cell heterogeneity in cancer can be addressed based on recent findings.",33453403,,10.1016/j.semcancer.2020.12.003,8,Seminars in cancer biology,9010218,17.012,0.6193561553955078,0.6220735785953178,0.9130434782608695,0.6786371046085422
Insights in the immunobiology of glioblastoma,"Glioblastoma, a grade IV astrocytoma, is considered as the most malignant intracranial tumor, characterized by poor prognosis and therapy resistance. Tumor heterogeneity that often leads to distinct functional phenotypes contributes to glioblastoma (GB) indispensable growth and aggressiveness. The complex interaction of neoplastic cells with tumor microenvironment (TME) along with the presence of cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) largely confers to extrinsic and intrinsic GB heterogeneity. Recent data indicate that glioma cells secrete a variety of soluble immunoregulatory factors to attract different cell types to TME including astrocytes, endothelial cells, circulating stem cells, and a range of immune cells. These further induce a local production of cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors which upon crosstalk with extracellular matrix (ECM) components reprogram immune cells to inflammatory or anti-inflammatory phenotypes and manipulate host's immune response in favor of cancer growth and metastasis. Herein, we provide an overview of the immunobiologic factors that orchestrate the complex network of glioma cells and TME interactions in an effort to identify potential therapeutic targets for GB malignancy. Current therapeutic schemes and advances in targeting GB-TME crosstalk are further discussed. KEY MESSAGES: â¢ Intrinsic and extrinsic tumor heterogeneity affects GB growth and aggressiveness. â¢ GB cells secrete growth factors and chemoattractants to recruit immune cells to TME. â¢ GAMs are a critical cell type in promoting GB growth. â¢ GAMs change from pro-inflammatory, anti-tumor M1 phenotype to pro-tumorigenic M2. â¢ Novel therapeutic agents target the crosstalk of neoplastic cells with TME.",31650201,,10.1007/s00109-019-01835-4,30,"Journal of molecular medicine (Berlin, Germany)",9504370,5.606,0.6172819137573242,0.842809364548495,0.3779264214046823,0.61451630544503
"A Review of Single-Cell RNA-Seq Annotation, Integration, and Cell-Cell Communication","Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has emerged as a powerful tool for investigating cellular biology at an unprecedented resolution, enabling the characterization of cellular heterogeneity, identification of rare but significant cell types, and exploration of cell-cell communications and interactions. Its broad applications span both basic and clinical research domains. In this comprehensive review, we survey the current landscape of scRNA-seq analysis methods and tools, focusing on count modeling, cell-type annotation, data integration, including spatial transcriptomics, and the inference of cell-cell communication. We review the challenges encountered in scRNA-seq analysis, including issues of sparsity or low expression, reliability of cell annotation, and assumptions in data integration, and discuss the potential impact of suboptimal clustering and differential expression analysis tools on downstream analyses, particularly in identifying cell subpopulations. Finally, we discuss recent advancements and future directions for enhancing scRNA-seq analysis. Specifically, we highlight the development of novel tools for annotating single-cell data, integrating and interpreting multimodal datasets covering transcriptomics, epigenomics, and proteomics, and inferring cellular communication networks.

Combined bulk RNA-seq and single-cell RNA-seq identifies a necroptosis-related prognostic signature associated with inhibitory immune microenvironment in glioma,"Necroptosis is a programmed cell death playing a significant role in cancer. Although necroptosis has been related to tumor immune environment (TIME) remodeling and cancer prognosis, however, the role of necroptosis-related genes (NRGs) in glioma is still elusive. In this study, a total of 159 NRGs were obtained, and parameters such as mutation rate, copy number variation (CNV), and relative expression level were assessed. Then, we constructed an 18-NRGs-based necroptosis-related signature (NRS) in the TCGA dataset, which could predict the patient's prognosis and was validated in two external CGGA datasets. We also explored the correlation between NRS and glioma TIME, chemotherapy sensitivity, and certain immunotherapy-related factors. The two necroptosis-related subtypes were discovered and could also distinguish the patients' prognosis. Through the glioblastoma (GBM) scRNA-seq data analysis, NRGs' expression levels in different GBM patient tissue cell subsets were investigated and the relative necroptosis status of different cell subsets was assessed, with the microglia score culminating among all. Moreover, we found a high infiltration level of immunosuppressive cells in glioma TIME, which was associated with poor prognosis in the high-NRS glioma patient group. Finally, the necroptosis suppressor CASP8 exhibited a high expression in glioma and was associated with poor prognosis. Subsequent experiments were performed in human glioma cell lines and patients' tissue specimens to verify the bioinformatic analytic findings about CASP8. Altogether, this study provides comprehensive evidence revealing a prognostic value of NRGs in glioma, which is associated with TIME regulation.",36466844,PMC9713702,10.3389/fimmu.2022.1013094,5,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,8.786,0.6150878667831421,0.5317725752508361,0.7023411371237458,0.6158754625448016
Stem cell-associated heterogeneity in Glioblastoma results from intrinsic tumor plasticity shaped by the microenvironment,"The identity and unique capacity of cancer stem cells (CSC) to drive tumor growth and resistance have been challenged in brain tumors. Here we report that cells expressing CSC-associated cell membrane markers in Glioblastoma (GBM) do not represent a clonal entity defined by distinct functional properties and transcriptomic profiles, but rather a plastic state that most cancer cells can adopt. We show that phenotypic heterogeneity arises from non-hierarchical, reversible state transitions, instructed by the microenvironment and is predictable by mathematical modeling. Although functional stem cell properties were similar in vitro, accelerated reconstitution of heterogeneity provides a growth advantage in vivo, suggesting that tumorigenic potential is linked to intrinsic plasticity rather than CSC multipotency. The capacity of any given cancer cell to reconstitute tumor heterogeneity cautions against therapies targeting CSC-associated membrane epitopes. Instead inherent cancer cell plasticity emerges as a novel relevant target for treatment.",30992437,PMC6467886,10.1038/s41467-019-09853-z,246,Nature communications,101528555,17.694,0.6140469312667847,0.9866220735785953,0.9331103678929766,0.7523746470543852
Tumor microenvironment targeting for glioblastoma multiforme treatment via hybrid cell membrane coating supramolecular micelles,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is one of the most common primary intracranial tumors in the central nervous system with poor prognosis, high invasiveness, risk of recurrence and low survival rate. Thus, it is urgent and vital to develop drug effective delivery systems that efficiently to traverse the blood-brain barrier and targeted transport therapeutic agents into the GBM tumor site for the treatment of brain tumors. Recently, amphiphilic cucurbit[7]uril-polyethylene glycol-hydrophobic Chlorin e6 (CB[7]-PEG-Ce6) polymer was designed, prepared, and self-assembled into micells (CPC) in an aqueous solution, and chemo drug methyl-triazeno-imidazole-carboxamide (MTIC), loaded into the cavity of CB[7] was subsequently coated with hybrid membrane mUMH (HMC3 membrane: macrophage membrane: U87MG membrane = 1:1:2) to afford mUMH@CPC@MTIC. The surface hybrid membrane mUMH potentially enhance the targeted delivery of CPC@MTIC to GBM tissue. Bioactive MTIC was released from the cavity of CB[7] in response to the high spermine level in GBM tumor microenvironments for effective tumor chemotherapy. The biomimetic mUMH@CPC@MTIC exhibited superior antitumor efficacy against GBM in mice.

Integration of scATAC-Seq with scRNA-Seq Data,"Single-cell studies are enabling our understanding of the molecular processes of normal cell development and the onset of several pathologies. For instance, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) measures the transcriptome-wide gene expression at a single-cell resolution, allowing for studying the heterogeneity among the cells of the same population and revealing complex and rare cell populations. On the other hand, single-cell Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (scATAC-Seq) can be used to define transcriptional and epigenetic changes by analyzing the chromatin accessibility at the single-cell level.

Crosstalk between microglia and neural stem cells influences the relapse of glioblastoma in GBM immunological microenvironment,"Interactions between immunocytes and Neural Stem Cells (NSCs) in glioblastoma multiforme still remains unclear. Here, microglial cells and NSCs in peri-tumoral tissue were analyzed via single-cell whole-transcriptome sequencing. Results showed that two clusters of putative NSCs (the EGFR+BCAN+cell cluster, and the FABPT+H19+cell cluster) exhibited immune-related functions. Two clusters of putative microglia (the XIST+PDK4+and APOC1+CCL3+cell clusters) exhibited the function of glial cell activation. The results of ligand receptor network analysis disclosed significant interactions between the APOC1+CCL3+microglia and the NSCs. Correlation analysis on the overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) with 102 potential molecular targets in the TCGA database showed that a much larger number of molecules were correlated with RFS than with OS (34.31% vs. 8.82%), nine of them were validated in clinical specimens.

However, the precise characterization of diverse cell populations and their crosstalk associated with PDAC progression and metastasis is still challenging.Methods:We performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of treatment-naÃ¯ve primary PDAC samples with and without paired liver metastasis samples to understand the interplay between ITH and TME in the PDAC evolution and its clinical associations.Results:scRNA-seq analysis revealed that even a small proportion (22%) of basal-like malignant ductal cells could lead to poor chemotherapy response and patient survival and that epithelial-mesenchymal transition programs were largely subtype-specific. The clonal homogeneity significantly increased with more prevalent and pronounced copy number gains of oncogenes, such as KRAS and ETV1, and losses of tumor suppressor genes, such as SMAD2 and MAP2K4, along PDAC progression and metastasis. Moreover, diverse immune cell populations, including naÃ¯ï»¿ve SELLhiregulatory T cells (Tregs) and activated TIGIThiTregs, contributed to shaping immunosuppressive TMEs of PDAC through cellular interactions with malignant ductal cells in PDAC evolution. Importantly, the proportion of basal-like ductal cells negatively correlated with that of immunoreactive cell populations, such as cytotoxic T cells, but positively correlated with that of immunosuppressive cell populations, such as Tregs.Conclusion:We uncover that the proportion of basal-like subtype is a key determinant for chemotherapy response and patient outcome, and that PDAC clonally evolves with subtype-specific dosage changes of cancer-associated genes by forming immunosuppressive microenvironments in its progression and metastasis.",38702773,PMC11067162,10.1186/s12943-024-02003-0,0,Molecular cancer,101147698,41.444,0.6106275916099548,0.08361204013377926,0.9966555183946488,0.5824300666716585
EREG is the core onco-immunological biomarker of cuproptosis and mediates the cross-talk between VEGF and CD99 signaling in glioblastoma,"Background:Glioma is the most prevalent primary tumor of the central nervous system. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most malignant form of glioma with an extremely poor prognosis. A novel, regulated cell death form of copper-induced cell death called ""cuproptosis"" provides a new prospect for cancer treatment by regulating cuproptosis.Methods:Data from bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis (The Cancer Genome Atlas cohort and Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas cohort) and single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) analysis were integrated to reveal their relationships. A scoring system was constructed according to the cuproptosis-related gene expression, and core genes were experimentally verified using real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), Western blot (WB), immunohistochemistry (IHC), and immunofluorescence (IF). Moreover, cell counting kit-8 (CCK8), colony formation, 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation, transwell, and flow cytometry cell cycle were performed to evaluate cell proliferation, invasion, and migration.Results:The Cuproptosis Activation Scoring (CuAS) Model has stable and independent prognostic efficacy, as verified by two CGGA datasets. Epiregulin (EREG), the gene of the model has the most contributions in the principal component analysis (PCA), is an onco-immunological gene that can affect immunity by influencing the expression of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and mediate the process of cuproptosis by influencing the expression of ferredoxin 1 (FDX1). Single cell transcriptome analysis revealed that high CuAS GBM cells are found in vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) + malignant cells. Oligodendrocyte transcription factor 1 (OLIG1) + malignant is the original clone, and VEGF and CD99 are the differential pathways of specific cell communication between the high and low CuAS groups. This was also demonstrated by immunofluorescence in the tissue sections. Furthermore, CuAS has therapeutic potential for immunotherapy, and we predict that many drugs (methotrexate, NU7441, KU -0063794, GDC-0941, cabozantinib, and NVP-BEZ235) may be used in patients with high CuAS.Conclusion:EREG is the core onco-immunological biomarker of CuAS and modulates the cross-talk between VEGF and CD99 signaling in glioblastoma, and CuAS may provide support for immunotherapy and chemotherapy.",36647156,PMC9843967,10.1186/s12967-023-03883-4,10,Journal of translational medicine,101190741,8.44,0.6095241904258728,0.6889632107023411,0.6153846153846154,0.626584079472915
TMExplorer: A tumour microenvironment single-cell RNAseq database and search tool,"Motivation:The tumour microenvironment (TME) contains various cells including stromal fibroblasts, immune and malignant cells, and its composition can be elucidated using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). scRNA-seq datasets from several cancer types are available, yet we lack a comprehensive database to collect and present related TME data in an easily accessible format.Results:We therefore built a TME scRNA-seq database, and created the R package TMExplorer to facilitate investigation of the TME. TMExplorer provides an interface to easily access all available datasets and their metadata. The users can search for datasets using a thorough range of characteristics. The TMExplorer allows for examination of the TME using scRNA-seq in a way that is streamlined and allows for easy integration into already existing scRNA-seq analysis pipelines.",36084081,PMC9462821,10.1371/journal.pone.0272302,5,PloS one,101285081,3.752,0.609175443649292,0.5351170568561873,0.22408026755852842,0.5173447310725183
"Comprehensive Characterization of the Multiple Myeloma Immune Microenvironment Using Integrated scRNA-seq, CyTOF, and CITE-seq Analysis","As part of the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation (MMRF) immune atlas pilot project, we compared immune cells of multiple myeloma bone marrow samples from 18 patients assessed by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), mass cytometry (CyTOF), and cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing (CITE-seq) to understand the concordance of measurements among single-cell techniques. Cell type abundances are relatively consistent across the three approaches, while variations are observed in T cells, macrophages, and monocytes. Concordance and correlation analysis of cell type marker gene expression across different modalities highlighted the importance of choosing cell type marker genes best suited to particular modalities. By integrating data from these three assays, we found International Staging System stage 3 patients exhibited decreased CD4+T/CD8+T cells ratio. Moreover, we observed upregulation ofRAC2andPSMB9, in natural killer cells of fast progressors compared with those of nonprogressors, as revealed by both scRNA-seq and CITE-seq RNA measurement. This detailed examination of the immune microenvironment in multiple myeloma using multiple single-cell technologies revealed markers associated with multiple myeloma rapid progression which will be further characterized by the full-scale immune atlas project.Significance:scRNA-seq, CyTOF, and CITE-seq are increasingly used for evaluating cellular heterogeneity. Understanding their concordances is of great interest. To date, this study is the most comprehensive examination of the measurement of the immune microenvironment in multiple myeloma using the three techniques. Moreover, we identified markers predicted to be significantly associated with multiple myeloma rapid progression.",36969740,PMC10035369,10.1158/2767-9764.CRC-22-0022,8,Cancer research communications,9918281580506676,0.0,0.6077213883399963,0.6287625418060201,0.05016722408026756,0.5004187861812553
"Profiling transcriptional heterogeneity of epithelium, fibroblasts, and immune cells in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma by single-cell RNA sequencing","Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is one of the most aggressive malignancies with complex tumor microenvironment (TME) which has been proven to be associated with therapeutic failure or resistance. A deeper understanding of the complex TME and cellular heterogeneity is urgently needed in ESCC. Here, we generated single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of 25 796 immune and 8197 non-immune cells from three primary tumor and paired normal samples in ESCC patients. The results revealed intratumoral and intertumoral epithelium heterogeneity and tremendously differences in tumor and normal epithelium. The infiltration of myofibroblasts, one subtype of fibroblasts, might play important roles in the progression of ESCC. We also found that some differentially expressed genes and markers in epithelium and fibroblast subtypes showed prognostic values for ESCC. Diverse cell subtypes of T cells and myeloid cells were identified, including tumor-enriched HAVCR2+CD4+T cells with significantly exhausted signature. The epithelium and myeloid cells had more frequent cell-cell communication compared with epithelium and T cells. Taken together, this study provided in-depth insights into the cellular heterogeneity of TME in ESCC and highlighted potential therapeutic targets including for immunotherapy.",36260317,,10.1096/fj.202200898R,6,FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for,8804484,5.834,0.6066732406616211,0.5719063545150501,0.391304347826087,0.5566460848652001
Resolving the lineage relationship between malignant cells and vascular cells in glioblastomas,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), a highly malignant and heterogeneous brain tumor, contains various types of tumor and non-tumor cells. Whether GBM cells can trans-differentiate into non-neural cell types, including mural cells or endothelial cells (ECs), to support tumor growth and invasion remains controversial. Here we generated two genetic GBM models de novo in immunocompetent mouse brains, mimicking essential pathological and molecular features of human GBMs. Lineage-tracing and transplantation studies demonstrated that, although blood vessels in GBM brains underwent drastic remodeling, evidence of trans-differentiation of GBM cells into vascular cells was barely detected. Intriguingly, GBM cells could promiscuously express markers for mural cells during gliomagenesis. Furthermore, single-cell RNA sequencing showed that patterns of copy number variations (CNVs) of mural cells and ECs were distinct from those of GBM cells, indicating discrete origins of GBM cells and vascular components. Importantly, single-cell CNV analysis of human GBM specimens also suggested that GBM cells and vascular cells are likely separate lineages. Rather than expansion owing to trans-differentiation, vascular cell expanded by proliferation during tumorigenesis. Therefore, cross-lineage trans-differentiation of GBM cells is very unlikely to occur during gliomagenesis. Our findings advance understanding of cell lineage dynamics during gliomagenesis, and have implications for targeted treatment of GBMs.",36929001,PMC10019576,10.1093/procel/pwac006,2,Protein & cell,101532368,15.328,0.6047491431236267,0.3712374581939799,0.903010033444816,0.6176989842019351
GBMdeconvoluteR accurately infers proportions of neoplastic and immune cell populations from bulk glioblastoma transcriptomics data,"Background:Characterizing and quantifying cell types within glioblastoma (GBM) tumors at scale will facilitate a better understanding of the association between the cellular landscape and tumor phenotypes or clinical correlates. We aimed to develop a tool that deconvolutes immune and neoplastic cells within the GBM tumor microenvironment from bulk RNA sequencing data.Methods:We developed an IDH wild-type (IDHwt) GBM-specific single immune cell reference consisting of B cells, T-cells, NK-cells, microglia, tumor associated macrophages, monocytes, mast and DC cells. We used this alongside an existing neoplastic single cell-type reference for astrocyte-like, oligodendrocyte- and neuronal progenitor-like and mesenchymal GBM cancer cells to create both marker and gene signature matrix-based deconvolution tools. We applied single-cell resolution imaging mass cytometry (IMC) to ten IDHwt GBM samples, five paired primary and recurrent tumors, to determine which deconvolution approach performed best.Results:Marker-based deconvolution using GBM-tissue specific markers was most accurate for both immune cells and cancer cells, so we packaged this approach as GBMdeconvoluteR. We applied GBMdeconvoluteR to bulk GBM RNAseq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and recapitulated recent findings from multi-omics single cell studies with regards associations between mesenchymal GBM cancer cells and both lymphoid and myeloid cells. Furthermore, we expanded upon this to show that these associations are stronger in patients with worse prognosis.Conclusions:GBMdeconvoluteR accurately quantifies immune and neoplastic cell proportions in IDHwt GBM bulk RNA sequencing data and is accessible here: https://gbmdeconvoluter.leeds.ac.uk.",36689332,PMC10326489,10.1093/neuonc/noad021,2,Neuro-oncology,100887420,13.029,0.6042237877845764,0.3745819397993311,0.8461538461538461,0.6066814298613813
Characterizing cancer metabolism from bulk and single-cell RNA-seq data using METAFlux,"Cells often alter metabolic strategies under nutrient-deprived conditions to support their survival and growth. Characterizing metabolic reprogramming in the tumor microenvironment (TME) is of emerging importance in cancer research and patient care. However, recent technologies only measure a subset of metabolites and cannot provide in situ measurements. Computational methods such as flux balance analysis (FBA) have been developed to estimate metabolic flux from bulk RNA-seq data and can potentially be extended to single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data. However, it is unclear how reliable current methods are, particularly in TME characterization. Here, we present a computational framework METAFlux (METAbolic Flux balance analysis) to infer metabolic fluxes from bulk or single-cell transcriptomic data. Large-scale experiments using cell-lines, the cancer genome atlas (TCGA), and scRNA-seq data obtained from diverse cancer and immunotherapeutic contexts, including CAR-NK cell therapy, have validated METAFlux's capability to characterize metabolic heterogeneity and metabolic interaction amongst cell types.",37573313,PMC10423258,10.1038/s41467-023-40457-w,5,Nature communications,101528555,17.694,0.602587878704071,0.5384615384615384,0.9364548494983278,0.6565360048144159
Re-convolving the compositional landscape of primary and recurrent glioblastoma reveals prognostic and targetable tissue states,"Glioblastoma (GBM) diffusely infiltrates the brain and intermingles with non-neoplastic brain cells, including astrocytes, neurons and microglia/myeloid cells. This complex mixture of cell types forms the biological context for therapeutic response and tumor recurrence. We used single-nucleus RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics to determine the cellular composition and transcriptional states in primary and recurrent glioma and identified three compositional 'tissue-states' defined by cohabitation patterns between specific subpopulations of neoplastic and non-neoplastic brain cells. These tissue-states correlated with radiographic, histopathologic, and prognostic features and were enriched in distinct metabolic pathways. Fatty acid biosynthesis was enriched in the tissue-state defined by the cohabitation of astrocyte-like/mesenchymal glioma cells, reactive astrocytes, and macrophages, and was associated with recurrent GBM and shorter survival. Treating acute slices of GBM with a fatty acid synthesis inhibitor depleted the transcriptional signature of this pernicious tissue-state. These findings point to therapies that target interdependencies in the GBM microenvironment.",37142563,PMC10160047,10.1038/s41467-023-38186-1,7,Nature communications,101528555,17.694,0.6010668277740479,0.6053511705685619,0.939799331103679,0.6696701969988769
"Belonging to a network--microRNAs, extracellular vesicles, and the glioblastoma microenvironment","The complexity of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and its distinct pathophysiology belong to a unique brain microenvironment and its cellular interactions. Despite extensive evidence of a role for microRNAs in GBM cells, little is known about microRNA-dependent communication between different cellular compartments of the microenvironment that may contribute to the tumor phenotype. While the majority of microRNAs are found intracellularly, a significant number of microRNAs have been observed outside of cells, often encapsulated in secreted extracellular vesicles (EVs). The function of these circulating/secreted microRNAs has not been explored in the context of the brain tumor microenvironment. Establishing how microRNAs are involved in the regulation of oncogenic signaling networks between tumor cells and stroma is likely to add a needed additional layer of complexity to the tumor network, consisting of intercellular communication. More importantly, microRNA/EV signaling may provide an additional therapeutic target for this deadly disease.",25301812,PMC4482852,10.1093/neuonc/nou292,56,Neuro-oncology,100887420,13.029,0.6000711917877197,0.9264214046822743,0.8494983277591973,0.7152266615609262
Single-cell RNA-seq methods to interrogate virus-host interactions,"The twenty-first century has seen the emergence of many epidemic and pandemic viruses, with the most recent being the SARS-CoV-2-driven COVID-19 pandemic. As obligate intracellular parasites, viruses rely on host cells to replicate and produce progeny, resulting in complex virus and host dynamics during an infection. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), by enabling broad and simultaneous profiling of both host and virus transcripts, represents a powerful technology to unravel the delicate balance between host and virus. In this review, we summarize technological and methodological advances in scRNA-seq and their applications to antiviral immunity. We highlight key scRNA-seq applications that have enabled the understanding of viral genomic and host response heterogeneity, differential responses of infected versus bystander cells, and intercellular communication networks. We expect further development of scRNA-seq technologies and analytical methods, combined with measurements of additional multi-omic modalities and increased availability of publicly accessible scRNA-seq datasets, to enable a better understanding of viral pathogenesis and enhance the development of antiviral therapeutics strategies.",36414692,PMC9684776,10.1007/s00281-022-00972-2,14,Seminars in immunopathology,101308769,11.759,0.5976078510284424,0.7324414715719063,0.8193979933110368,0.6689326035936541
"Non-Tumor Cells within the Tumor Microenvironment-The ""Eminence Grise"" of the Glioblastoma Pathogenesis and Potential Targets for Therapy","Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common malignancy of the central nervous system in adults. GBM has high levels of therapy failure and its prognosis is usually dismal. The phenotypic heterogeneity of the tumor cells, dynamic complexity of non-tumor cell populations within the GBM tumor microenvironment (TME), and their bi-directional cross-talk contribute to the challenges of current therapeutic approaches. Herein, we discuss the etiology of GBM, and describe several major types of non-tumor cells within its TME, their impact on GBM pathogenesis, and molecular mechanisms of such an impact. We also discuss their value as potential therapeutic targets or prognostic biomarkers, with reference to the most recent works on this subject. We conclude that unless all ""key player"" populations of non-tumor cells within the TME are considered, no breakthrough in developing treatment for GBM can be achieved.",38786032,PMC11119139,10.3390/cells13100808,0,Cells,101600052,7.666,0.5972555875778198,0.08695652173913043,0.5886287625418061,0.4934704094028792
Innovative prognostic modeling in ESCC: leveraging scRNA-seq and bulk-RNA for dendritic cell heterogeneity analysis,"Background:Globally, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) stands out as a common cancer type, characterized by its notably high rates of occurrence and mortality. Recent advancements in treatment methods, including immunotherapy, have shown promise, yet the prognosis remains poor. In the context of tumor development and treatment outcomes, the tumor microenvironment (TME), especially the function of dendritic cells (DCs), is significantly influential. Our study aims to delve deeper into the heterogeneity of DCs in ESCC using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and bulk RNA analysis.Methods:In the scRNA-seq analysis, we utilized the SCP package for result visualization and functional enrichment analysis of cell subpopulations. CellChat was employed to identify potential oncogenic mechanisms in DCs, while Monocle 2 traced the evolutionary trajectory of the three DC subtypes. CopyKAT assessed the benign or malignant nature of cells, and SCENIC conducted transcription factor regulatory network analysis, offering a preliminary exploration of DC heterogeneity. In Bulk-RNA analysis, we constructed a prognostic model for ESCC prognosis and immunotherapy response, based on DC marker genes. This model was validated through quantitative PCR (qPCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC), confirming the gene expression levels.Results:In this study, through intercellular communication analysis, we identified GALECTIN and MHC-I signaling pathways as potential oncogenic mechanisms within dendritic cells. We categorized DCs into three subtypes: plasmacytoid (pDC), conventional (cDC), and tolerogenic (tDC). Our findings revealed that pDCs exhibited an increased proportion of cells in the G2/M and S phases, indicating enhanced cellular activity. Pseudotime trajectory analysis demonstrated that cDCs were in early stages of differentiation, whereas tDCs were in more advanced stages, with pDCs distributed across both early and late differentiation phases. Prognostic analysis highlighted a significant correlation between pDCs and tDCs with the prognosis of ESCC (P< 0.05), while no significant correlation was observed between cDCs and ESCC prognosis (P = 0.31). The analysis of cell malignancy showed the lowest proportion of malignant cells in cDCs (17%), followed by pDCs (29%), and the highest in tDCs (48%), with these results being statistically significant (P< 0.05). We developed a robust ESCC prognostic model based on marker genes of pDCs and tDCs in the GSE53624 cohort (n = 119), which was validated in the TCGA-ESCC cohort (n = 139) and the IMvigor210 immunotherapy cohort (n = 298) (P< 0.05). Additionally, we supplemented the study with a novel nomogram that integrates clinical features and risk assessments. Finally, the expression levels of genes involved in the model were validated using qPCR (n = 8) and IHC (n = 16), thereby confirming the accuracy of our analysis.Conclusion:This study enhances the understanding of dendritic cell heterogeneity in ESCC and its impact on patient prognosis. The insights gained from scRNA-seq and Bulk-RNA analysis contribute to the development of novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Our prognostic models based on DC-related gene signatures hold promise for improving ESCC patient stratification and guiding treatment decisions.",38515748,PMC10956130,10.3389/fimmu.2024.1352454,0,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,8.786,0.5959041118621826,0.0903010033444816,0.705685618729097,0.5167397915320253
Histone acetylation gene-based biomarkers as novel markers of the immune microenvironment in glioblastoma,"Background:Glioblastoma (GBM) is a primary malignant tumour with high intracranial morbidity, high malignancy and poor prognosis. Abnormal changes in histone acetylation are closely related to the occurrence and development of cancer. However, there is still a lack of systematic research on histone acetylation in GBM.Methods:Whole-transcriptome sequencing data and clinical data of GBM patients were obtained through the TCGA database. Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from GBM patients were obtained from GSE146711 in the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Cell descending fractionation was first performed for scRNA-seq on GBM. The CellChat and PROGENy scores explore the impact of the histone acetylation pathway in GBM on intercellular chat and tumour pathways. The AddModuleScore function evaluates the enrichment score of histone acetylation in cells and divides them into high-histone acetylation and low-histone acetylation groups. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses were performed on the differential genes between different histone acetylation states, and the biological processes and pathways that may be affected by histone acetylation were evaluated. Based on this, a prognostic model was constructed using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) analysis, and survival analysis was performed to evaluate its prognostic performance. Finally, we also analysed the main effects of the constructed histone acetylation-related model on GBM immune infiltration by multiple methods, and analysed the main mutation data of its different subgroups.Results:GBM samples mainly include seven large cell populations: oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), myeloid, neoplastic, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, vascular and neurons. Cellchat and ProgenY scores revealed that in GBM tumours, histone acetylation interacts closely with multiple immune cells and tumour pathways. GO and KEGG analyses revealed the main impact proteins and pathway correlates of histone acetylation. Five histone acetylation genes were screened using LASSO analysis and a prognostic model was constructed. The results revealed that prognostic models were significant in the prognostic stratification of patients in both the training and validation groups of GBM patients. Immune infiltration analysis revealed that the mechanism of histone acetylation in GBM may be related to the immune infiltration of multiple effector immune cells.Conclusions:Our histone acetylation-based biomarkers are closely associated with immune microenvironmental infiltration and functional mutations in multiple tumour pathways in GBM. This suggests that histone acetylation may reveal microscopic alterations in the tumour microenvironment, and may provide potential evidence and a research basis for the development of novel therapeutic targets for GBM. On this basis, a novel perspective on the spatial biology and immunological understanding of GBM is provided.",37097165,,10.1002/jgm.3511,1,The journal of gene medicine,9815764,4.152,0.594904363155365,0.2909698996655518,0.26421404682274247,0.4679794071908779
Targeted inducible delivery of immunoactivating cytokines reprograms glioblastoma microenvironment and inhibits growth in mouse models,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and lethal brain tumor characterized by a strongly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) that represents a barrier also for the development of effective immunotherapies. The possibility to revert this hostile TME by immunoactivating cytokines is hampered by the severe toxicity associated with their systemic administration. Here, we exploited a lentiviral vector-based platform to engineer hematopoietic stem cells ex vivo with the aim of releasing, via their tumor-infiltrating monocyte/macrophage progeny, interferon-Î± (IFN-Î±) or interleukin-12 (IL-12) at the tumor site with spatial and temporal selectivity. Taking advantage of a syngeneic GBM mouse model, we showed that inducible release of IFN-Î± within the TME achieved robust tumor inhibition up to eradication and outperformed systemic treatment with the recombinant protein in terms of efficacy, tolerability, and specificity. Single-cell RNA sequencing of the tumor immune infiltrate revealed reprogramming of the immune microenvironment toward a proinflammatory and antitumoral state associated with loss of a macrophage subpopulation shown to be associated with poor prognosis in human GBM. The spatial and temporal control of IL-12 release was critical to overcome an otherwise lethal hematopoietic toxicity while allowing to fully exploit its antitumor activity. Overall, our findings demonstrate a potential therapeutic approach for GBM and set the bases for a recently launched first-in-human clinical trial in patients with GBM.",35857642,,10.1126/scitranslmed.abl4106,19,Science translational medicine,101505086,19.319,0.5946100950241089,0.782608695652174,0.959866220735786,0.7052610402920573
Integrating single-cell RNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics reveals MDK-NCL dependent immunosuppressive environment in endometrial carcinoma,"Objectives:The tumor microenvironment (TME) play important roles in progression of endometrial carcinoma (EC). We aimed to assess the cell populations in TME of EC.Methods:We downloaded datasets of single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptome (ST) for EC from GEO, and downloaded RNA-Seq (FPKM) and clinical data of TCGA-UCEC project from TCGA. The datasets were analyzed using R software.Results:We obtained 5 datasets of scRNA-seq, 1 of ST and 569 samples of RNA-seq. Totally, 0.2 billion transcripts and 33,408 genes were detected in 33,162 cells from scRNA-seq. The cells were classified into 9 clusters, and EC cells were originated from epithelial cells and ciliated cells. Gene set variation analysis (GSVA) indicated that the pathways enriched in the subclusters of epithelial cells and endothelial cells were significantly different, indicating great heterogeneity in EC. Cell-cell communication analyses showed that EC cells emitted the strongest signals, and endothelial cells received more signals than other cells. Further analysis found that subclusters of 1 and 2 of epithelial cells were showed a more malignant phenotype, which may confer malignant phenotype to subcluster of 0 of endothelial cells through MK pathway by MDL-NCL signal. We also analyzed communications between spatial neighbors with ST data and confirmed the findings on MDL-NCL in cell-cell communication. TCGA and GEO analyses indicated that the expression levels of NCL was inversely correlated with ImmuneScore.Conclusion:Our study revealed EC cells can confer malignant phenotype to endothelial cells by MDK-NCL signal, and NCL is associated with suppressed immune activity. EC cells may shape TME by inhibiting immune cells and ""educating"" stromal cellsviaMDK-NCL signal.",37081869,PMC10110842,10.3389/fimmu.2023.1145300,8,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,8.786,0.5940214991569519,0.6321070234113713,0.7090301003344481,0.6246403242433349
Glioblastoma microenvironment: The stromal interactions,"Glioblastomas (GBMs) are the most common primary brain tumors with poor prognosis due to their aggressive growth accompanied by invasive behavior and therapy-resistance. These features promote a high rate of recurrence; therefore, they are largely incurable. One major cause of the incurability is brought about by the intimate relationship of GBM cells with the microenvironment, which supports the tumor growth in various ways by providing a permissive neighborhood. In the tumor microenvironment are glioma stem cells (GSC); endothelial cells (EC) and hypoxic regions; immune cells and immune modulatory cues; astrocytes; neural stem/precursor cells (NPC) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). Each cell type contributes to GBM pathology in unique ways; therefore, it is necessary to understand such interactions between GBM cells and the stromal cells in order to establish a through understanding of the GBM pathology. By explaining the contribution of each stromal entity to GBM pathology we aim to draw an interaction map for GBMs and promote awareness of the complexity of the GBM microenvironment.",35228161,,10.1016/j.prp.2022.153813,5,"Pathology, research and practice",7806109,3.309,0.5926666259765625,0.5418060200668896,0.17725752508361203,0.4994126846160379
ScRNA-seq reveals novel immune-suppressive T cells and investigates CMV-TCR-T cells cytotoxicity against GBM,"Background:Glioblastoma (GBM) is a fatal primary brain malignancy in adults. Previous studies have shown that cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a risk factor for tumorigenesis and aggressiveness for glioblastoma. However, little is known about how CMV infection affects immune cells in the tumor microenvironment of GBM. Furthermore, there has been almost no engineered T-cell receptor (TCR)-T targeting CMV for GBM research to date.Methods:We evaluated the CMV infection status of patients with GBM's tumor tissue by immune electron microscopy, immunofluorescence, and droplet digital PCR. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing for CMV-infected GBM to investigate the effects of CMV on the GBM immune microenvironment. CellChat was applied to analyze the interaction between cells in the GBM tumor microenvironment. Additionally, we conducted single-cell TCR/B cell receptor (BCR) sequencing and Grouping of Lymphocyte Interactions with Paratope Hotspots 2 algorithms to acquire specific CMV-TCR sequences. Genetic engineering was used to introduce CMV-TCR into primary T cells derived from patients with CMV-infected GBM. Flow cytometry was used to measure the proportion and cytotoxicity status of T cells in vitro.Results:We identified two novel immune cell subpopulations in CMV-infected GBM, which were bipositive CD68+SOX2+tumor-associated macrophages and FXYD6+T cells. We highlighted that the interaction between bipositive TAMs or cancer cells and T cells was predominantly focused on FXYD6+T cells rather than regulatory T cells (Tregs), whereas, FXYD6+T cells were further identified as a group of novel immunosuppressive T cells. CMV-TCR-T cells showed significant therapeutic effects on the human-derived orthotopic GBM mice model.Conclusions:These findings provided an insight into the underlying mechanism of CMV infection promoting the GBM immunosuppression, and provided a novel potential immunotherapy strategy for patients with GBM.",38688579,PMC11086384,10.1136/jitc-2024-008967,0,Journal for immunotherapy of cancer,101620585,12.469,0.5916053056716919,0.09364548494983277,0.8260869565217391,0.5389096716973295
Immune micro-environment analysis and establishment of response prediction model for PD-1 blockade immunotherapy in glioblastoma based on transcriptome deconvolution,"Purpose:Only a small proportion of patients obtain survival benefit from PD-1 blockade immunotherapy due to the highly heterogeneous and suppressed immune micro-environment of GBM. We aimed at revealing the characteristics of tumor micro-environment (TME) of GBM related to response to PD-1 inhibitors and constructing a response prediction model for screening patients possibly benefit from PD-1 inhibitors.Methods:Based on the composition and expression profiles of cell subpopulations calculated by deconvoluting the GBM bulk RNA-seq, differentially expressed gene analysis and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) were performed to explore genes and pathways related to response to PD-1 inhibitors. Further by combining least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression and expression correlation with PD-L1, the response prediction genes of PD-1 inhibitors were identified and the response prediction model was constructed through binary logistic regression.Results:The comparison of abundances of tumor infiltrating immune cells showed that the abundance of M0 macrophages of responders was lower, while the abundance of activated dendritic cells (DCs) was higher before PD-1 inhibitors treatment; the abundances of plasma cells and M0 macrophages of responders were lower after PD-1 inhibitors treatment. In addition, GSEA showed that the main up-regulation pathways in the tumor micro-environment of responders before PD-1 inhibitors treatment included the regulation of T-helper 1 type immune response, the positive regulation of natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity, p53 signaling pathway, homotypic cell-cell adhesion, etc., the main down-regulation pathways included the activation of microglia and myeloid leukocytes, Ras signaling pathway, etc. Afterward, ITGAX, LRRFIP1 and FMN1 were identified as the key response prediction genes of PD-1 inhibitors and the response prediction model based on them showed good predictive performance with potential value of clinical application in its validation and verification.Conclusions:ITGAX, LRRFIP1 and FMN1 were identified as the response prediction genes of PD-1 inhibitors and the response prediction model based on them was proved to have potential clinical value.",37407848,,10.1007/s00432-023-05026-0,1,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,4.322,0.5907201766967773,0.29431438127090304,0.28762541806020064,0.47082006588428704
Single cell spatial analysis reveals the topology of immunomodulatory purinergic signaling in glioblastoma,"How the glioma immune microenvironment fosters tumorigenesis remains incompletely defined. Here, we use single-cell RNA-sequencing and multiplexed tissue-imaging to characterize the composition, spatial organization, and clinical significance of extracellular purinergic signaling in glioma. We show that microglia are the predominant source of CD39, while tumor cells principally express CD73. In glioblastoma, CD73 is associated with EGFR amplification, astrocyte-like differentiation, and increased adenosine, and is linked to hypoxia. Glioblastomas enriched for CD73 exhibit inflammatory microenvironments, suggesting that purinergic signaling regulates immune adaptation. Spatially-resolved single-cell analyses demonstrate a strong spatial correlation between tumor-CD73 and microglial-CD39, with proximity associated with poor outcomes. Similar spatial organization is present in pediatric high-grade gliomas including H3K27M-mutant diffuse midline glioma. These data reveal that purinergic signaling in gliomas is shaped by genotype, lineage, and functional state, and that core enzymes expressed by tumor and myeloid cells are organized to promote adenosine-rich microenvironments potentially amenable to therapeutic targeting.",35973991,PMC9381513,10.1038/s41467-022-32430-w,19,Nature communications,101528555,17.694,0.5906611680984497,0.7859531772575251,0.9431438127090301,0.7002160988523809
Biomimetic models to examine microenvironmental regulation of glioblastoma stem cells,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), a malignant brain tumor, is the deadliest form of human cancer with low survival rates because of its highly invasive nature. In recent years, there has been a growing appreciation for the role that glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) play during tumorigenesis and tumor recurrence of GBM. GSCs are a specialized subset of GBM cells with stem cell-like features that contribute to tumor initiation and therapeutic resistance. Thus, to enhance therapeutic efficiency and improve survival, targeting GSCs and their microenvironmental niche appears to be a promising approach. To develop this approach, understanding GSC-microenvironment interactions is crucial. This review discusses various biomimetic model systems to understand the impact of biophysical, biochemical, and cellular microenvironmental cues on GSC behaviors. These models include two-dimensional or matrix-free environment models, engineered biomaterial-based three-dimensional models, co-culture models, and mouse and rat in vivo models. These systems have been used to study the effects of biophysical factors, modulation of signaling pathways, extracellular matrix components, and culture conditions on the GSC phenotype. The advantages and disadvantages of these model systems and their impact in the field of GSC research are discussed.",29746930,,10.1016/j.canlet.2018.05.007,11,Cancer letters,7600053,9.756,0.5906611680984497,0.7090301003344481,0.7792642140468228,0.652055563735324
Single-cell transcriptome profiling reveals intra-tumoral heterogeneity in human chordomas,"Chordoma is a rare and aggressive bone tumor. An accurate investigation of tumor heterogeneity is necessary for the development of effective therapeutic strategies. This study aims to assess the poorly understood tumor heterogeneity of chordomas and identify potential therapeutic targets. Single-cell RNA sequencing was performed to delineate the transcriptomic landscape of chordomas. Six tumor samples of chordomas were obtained, and 33,737 cells passed the quality control test and were analyzed. The main cellular populations identified with specific markers were as follows: chordoma cells (16,052 [47.6%]), fibroblasts (6945 [20.6%]), mononuclear phagocytes (4734 [14.0%]), and T/natural killer (NK) cells (3944 [11.7%]). Downstream analysis of each cell type was performed. Six subclusters of chordomas exhibited properties of an epithelial-like extracellular matrix, stem cells, and immunosuppressive activity. Although few immune checkpoints were detected on cytotoxic immune cells such as T and NK cells, a strong immunosuppressive effect was exerted on the Tregs and M2 macrophages. In addition, the cellular interactions were indicative of enhancement of the TGF-Î² signaling pathway being the main mechanism for tumor progression, invasion, and immunosuppression. These findings, especially from the analysis of molecular targeted therapy and tumor immune microenvironment, may help in the identification of therapeutic targets in chordomas.",35084549,PMC10992276,10.1007/s00262-022-03152-1,14,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,6.63,0.5903069972991943,0.7357859531772575,0.4882943143812709,0.5990002518912223
scRNA-seq data analysis method to improve analysis performance,"With the development of single-cell RNA sequencing technology (scRNA-seq), we have the ability to study biological questions at the level of the individual cell transcriptome. Nowadays, many analysis tools, specifically suitable for single-cell RNA sequencing data, have been developed. In this review, the currently commonly used scRNA-seq protocols are discussed. The upstream processing flow pipeline of scRNA-seq data, including goals and popular tools for reads mapping and expression quantification, quality control, normalization, imputation, and batch effect removal is also introduced. Finally, methods to evaluate these tools in both cellular and genetic dimensions, clustering and differential expression analysis are presented.",36727937,PMC10190501,10.1049/nbt2.12115,4,IET nanobiotechnology,101303205,2.05,0.5899525880813599,0.5016722408026756,0.13043478260869565,0.48039295753109024
Data mining of bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing introduces OBI1-AS1 as an astrocyte marker with possible role in glioma recurrence and progression,"Long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs) are widely known for their various functions in cancer from tumor initiation to tumor progression and metastasis. Gliomas are the most prevalent primary forms of brain tumor, classified into grades I to IV according to their malignant histological features with grade IV, also known as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), displaying the highest level of malignancy. Thus, the search for differentially expressed LncRNAs in GBM versus low-grade glioma to uncover new insights into the molecular mechanisms of glioma progression have intensified. Bulk RNA sequencing pinpointed decreased expression of OBI1-AS1 in GBM compared to low-grade glioma samples. Subsequent single nuclei RNA sequencing revealed OBI1-AS1 to be a super-exclusive astrocyte marker with AUC = 0.99 and the potential to fully differentiate astrocytes from other brain cell types. Additional supplementary bioinformatics analysis exhibited OBI1-AS1 role in synaptic signal transduction and glutamatergic signaling. In addition, ChIP-Seq data were analyzed to explore transcription factors that can regulate OBI1-AS1 expression in neural cells. Results of Hi-C, methylation and ChIP-Seq analysis strongly suggest methylation of the CTCF binding site serving a central role in regulation of OBI1-AS1 expression via managing chromatin interactions. Our study indicated that lncRNAs, like OBI1-AS1, could be extremely precise in identifying the astrocyte cluster in the single-cell transcriptome and demonstrating superiority to well-established astrocyte markers such as GFAP, S100B, ALDH1L1, and AQP4.",35260196,PMC8905821,10.1186/s13148-022-01260-4,2,Clinical epigenetics,101516977,7.259,0.5888300538063049,0.3779264214046823,0.5284280936454849,0.5345689352938164
Immune landscapes associated with different glioblastoma molecular subtypes,"Recent work has highlighted the tumor microenvironment as a central player in cancer. In particular, interactions between tumor and immune cells may help drive the development of brain tumors such as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Despite significant research into the molecular classification of glioblastoma, few studies have characterized in a comprehensive manner the immune infiltrate in situ and within different GBM subtypes.In this study, we use an unbiased, automated immunohistochemistry-based approach to determine the immune phenotype of the four GBM subtypes (classical, mesenchymal, neural and proneural) in a cohort of 98 patients. Tissue Micro Arrays (TMA) were stained for CD20 (B lymphocytes), CD5, CD3, CD4, CD8 (T lymphocytes), CD68 (microglia), and CD163 (bone marrow derived macrophages) antibodies. Using automated image analysis, the percentage of each immune population was calculated with respect to the total tumor cells. Mesenchymal GBMs displayed the highest percentage of microglia, macrophage, and lymphocyte infiltration. CD68+and CD163+cells were the most abundant cell populations in all four GBM subtypes, and a higher percentage of CD163+cells was associated with a worse prognosis. We also compared our results to the relative composition of immune cell type infiltration (using RNA-seq data) across TCGA GBM tumors and validated our results obtained with immunohistochemistry with an external cohort and a different method. The results of this study offer a comprehensive analysis of the distribution and the infiltration of the immune components across the four commonly described GBM subgroups, setting the basis for a more detailed patient classification and new insights that may be used to better apply or design immunotherapies for GBM.",31815646,PMC6902522,10.1186/s40478-019-0803-6,91,Acta neuropathologica communications,101610673,7.578,0.5884753465652466,0.9665551839464883,0.5618729096989966,0.6587708266682449
Three-dimensional vascular microenvironment landscape in human glioblastoma,"The cellular complexity of glioblastoma microenvironments is still poorly understood. In-depth, cell-resolution tissue analyses of human material are rare but highly necessary to understand the biology of this deadly tumor. Here we present a unique 3D visualization revealing the cellular composition of human GBM in detail and considering its critical association with the neo-vascular niche. Our images show a complex vascular map of human 3D biopsies with increased vascular heterogeneity and altered spatial relationship with astrocytes or glioma-cell counterparts. High-resolution analysis of the structural layers of the blood brain barrier showed a multilayered fenestration of endothelium and basement membrane. Careful examination of T cell position and migration relative to vascular walls revealed increased infiltration corresponding with tumor proliferation. In addition, the analysis of the myeloid landscape not only showed a volumetric increase in glioma-associated microglia and macrophages relative to GBM proliferation but also revealed distinct phenotypes in tumor nest and stroma. Images and data sets are available on demand as a resource for public access.",33579378,PMC7879533,10.1186/s40478-020-01115-0,9,Acta neuropathologica communications,101610673,7.578,0.5877065062522888,0.6655518394648829,0.5652173913043478,0.5987777499052195
Inflammatory Mediators and GBM Malignancy: Current Scenario and Future Prospective,"Glioblastoma multiforme is one of the most widespread and dangerous forms of brain tumor with high inflammation. The tumor microenvironment comprises diverse tumor cells, different types of immune cells, and the extracellular matrix. Inflammatory mediators like chemokines, cytokines, and growth factors possibly serve as a capable therapeutic target to quash their tumor-promoting properties in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Cytokines are a heterogeneous group of soluble functional proteins which are also associated with the induction and progression of tumors. These are supposed to have both pro-inflammatory (such as tumor necrosis factor-Î± (TNF-Î±), interleukin-17A (IL-17A), interferon-Î³ (IFN-Î³), IL-4, IL-2, IL-6, IL-12, IL-13) and anti-inflammatory (such as transforming growth factor-Î² (TGF-Î²), IL-10, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)) actions and are the crucial communications channels in the tumor microenvironment. In the present minireview we discuss the tumor microenvironment and inflammatory mediators and focus on the involvement of cytokines in establishing communication with the tumor microenvironment. The presented data highlight the possible roles of cytokines in communication between glioblastoma cells and tumor microenvironment. Cytokines formed by immune cells protect the host organs while cytokines secreted by tumor cells are used for their advantage. Though the clinical trials with a number of immunotherapeutic agents are going on around the globe, there is still a requirement for thorough investigation of the regulatory mechanism managing GBM growth, recurrence, and tumor response to the therapy.",37553300,,10.24976/Discov.Med.202335177.47,0,Discovery medicine,101250006,3.222,0.586167573928833,0.09698996655518395,0.16387959866220736,0.40387445740077804
Tumor Cell Invasion in Glioblastoma,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is a particularly devastating tumor with a median survival of about 16 months. Recent research has revealed novel insights into the outstanding heterogeneity of this type of brain cancer. However, all GBM subtypes share the hallmark feature of aggressive invasion into the surrounding tissue. Invasive glioblastoma cells escape surgery and focal therapies and thus represent a major obstacle for curative therapy. This review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of glioma invasion mechanisms with respect to tumor-cell-intrinsic properties as well as cues provided by the microenvironment. We discuss genetic programs that may influence the dissemination and plasticity of GBM cells as well as their different invasion patterns. We also review how tumor cells shape their microenvironment and how, vice versa, components of the extracellular matrix and factors from non-neoplastic cells influence tumor cell motility. We further discuss different research platforms for modeling invasion. Finally, we highlight the importance of accounting for the complex interplay between tumor cell invasion and treatment resistance in glioblastoma when considering new therapeutic approaches.",32178267,PMC7139341,10.3390/ijms21061932,106,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,6.208,0.58486407995224,0.9732441471571907,0.431438127090301,0.6318549028208423
Identification of Immune Cell Infiltration and Immune-Related Genes in the Tumor Microenvironment of Glioblastomas,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is one of the most prevalent malignant brain tumors with poor prognosis. Increasing evidence has revealed that infiltrating immune cells and other stromal components in the tumor microenvironment (TME) are associated with prognosis of GBM. The aim of the present study was to identify immune cells and immune-related genes extracted from TME in GBM. RNA-sequencing and clinical data of GBM were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Four survival-related immune cells were identifiedviaKaplan-Meier survival analysis and immune-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs) screened. Functional enrichment and protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks for the genes were constructed. In addition, we identified 24 hub genes and the expressions of 6 of the genes were significantly associated with prognosis of GBM. Finally, the genes were validated in single-cell sequencing studies of GBM, and the immune cells validated in an independent GBM cohort from the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA). Overall, 24 immune-related genes infiltrating the tumor microenvironment were identified in the present study, which could serve as novel biomarkers and immune therapeutic targets.",33193404,PMC7606992,10.3389/fimmu.2020.585034,35,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,8.786,0.5808276534080505,0.8795986622073578,0.7123745819397993,0.6668912408742618
Phagocytosis of Glioma Cells Enhances the Immunosuppressive Phenotype of Bone Marrow-Derived Macrophages,"Tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) play a crucial role in immunosuppression. However, how TAMs are transformed into immunosuppressive phenotypes and influence the tumor microenvironment (TME) is not fully understood. Here, we utilized single-cell RNA sequencing and whole-exome sequencing data of glioblastoma (GBM) tissues and identified a subset of TAMs dually expressing macrophage and tumor signatures, which were termed double-positive TAMs. Double-positive TAMs tended to be bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) and were characterized by immunosuppressive phenotypes. Phagocytosis of glioma cells by BMDMs in vitro generated double-positive TAMs with similar immunosuppressive phenotypes to double-positive TAMs in the GBM TME of patients. The double-positive TAMs were transformed into M2-like macrophages and drove immunosuppression by expressing immune-checkpoint proteins CD276, PD-L1, and PD-L2 and suppressing the proliferation of activated T cells. Together, glioma cell phagocytosis by BMDMs in the TME leads to the formation of double-positive TAMs with enhanced immunosuppressive phenotypes, shedding light on the processes driving TAM-mediated immunosuppression in GBM.Significance:Bone marrow-derived macrophages phagocytose glioblastoma cells to form double-positive cells, dually expressing macrophage and tumor signatures that are transformed into M2-like macrophages and drive immunosuppression.",36622331,PMC9978884,10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-22-1570,6,Cancer research,2984705R,0.0,0.5797573328018188,0.5752508361204013,0.05351170568561873,0.4736069080422953
ALKBH5 Facilitates Hypoxia-Induced Paraspeckle Assembly and IL8 Secretion to Generate an Immunosuppressive Tumor Microenvironment,"The dynamic changes of RNA N6-methyl-adenosine (m6A) during cancer progression contribute to quick adaption to microenvironmental changes. Here, we profiled the cancer cell m6A dynamics in the hypoxic tumor niche and its pathological consequences in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). The m6A demethylase ALKBH5 was induced in GBM models under hypoxic conditions and was associated with a hypoxic gene signature in GBM patient samples. Depletion or inactivation of ALKBH5 in GBM cells significantly suppressed hypoxia-induced tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) recruitment and immunosuppression in allograft tumors. Expression and secretion of CXCL8/IL8 were significantly suppressed in ALKBH5-deficient tumors. However, ALKBH5 did not regulate CXCL8 m6A directly. Instead, hypoxia-induced ALKBH5 erased m6A deposition from the lncRNA NEAT1, stabilizing the transcript and facilitating NEAT1-mediated paraspeckle assembly, which led to relocation of the transcriptional repressor SFPQ from the CXCL8 promoter to paraspeckles and, ultimately, upregulation of CXCL8/IL8 expression. Accordingly, ectopic expression of CXCL8 in ALKBH5-deficient GBM cells partially restored TAM recruitment and tumor progression. Together, this study links hypoxia-induced epitranscriptomic changes to the emergence of an immunosuppressive microenvironment facilitating tumor evasion. SIGNIFICANCE: Hypoxia induces tumor immune microenvironment remodeling through an ALKBH5-mediated epigenetic and epitranscriptomic mechanism, providing potential immunotherapeutic strategies for treating glioblastoma.",34670781,,10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-21-1456,82,Cancer research,2984705R,0.0,0.5786862969398499,0.9565217391304348,0.056856187290969896,0.5498873634481909

Functional Contribution and Clinical Implication of Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts in Glioblastoma,"Purpose:The abundance and biological contribution of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) in glioblastoma (GBM) are poorly understood. Here, we aim to uncover its molecular signature, cellular roles, and potential tumorigenesis implications.Experimental design:We first applied single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and bioinformatics analysis to identify and characterize stromal cells with CAF transcriptomic features in human GBM tumors. Then, we performed functional enrichment analysis and in vitro assays to investigate their interactions with malignant GBM cells.Results:We found that CAF abundance was low but significantly correlated with tumor grade, poor clinical outcome, and activation of extracellular matrix remodeling using three large cohorts containing bulk RNA-seq data and clinical information. Proteomic analysis of a GBM-derived CAF line and its secretome revealed fibronectin (FN1) as a critical candidate factor mediating CAF functions. This was validated using in vitro cellular models, which demonstrated that CAF-conditioned media and recombinant FN1 could facilitate the migration and invasion of GBM cells. In addition, we showed that CAFs were more abundant in the mesenchymal-like state (or subtype) than in other states of GBMs. Interestingly, cell lines resembling the proneural state responded to the CAF signaling better for the migratory and invasive phenotypes.Conclusions:Overall, this study characterized the molecular features and functional impacts of CAFs in GBM, alluding to novel cell interactions mediated by CAFs in the GBM microenvironment.",38060213,,10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-23-0493,5,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for,9502500,13.801,0.5751108527183533,0.5451505016722408,0.8528428093645485,0.6246651738383698
Single cell sequencing revealed the mechanism of CRYAB in glioma and its diagnostic and prognostic value,"Background:We explored the characteristics of single-cell differentiation data in glioblastoma and established prognostic markers based on CRYAB to predict the prognosis of glioblastoma patients. Aberrant expression of CRYAB is associated with invasive behavior in various tumors, including glioblastoma. However, the specific role and mechanisms of CRYAB in glioblastoma are still unclear.Methods:We assessed RNA-seq and microarray data from TCGA and GEO databases, combined with scRNA-seq data on glioma patients from GEO. Utilizing the Seurat R package, we identified distinct survival-related gene clusters in the scRNA-seq data. Prognostic pivotal genes were discovered through single-factor Cox analysis, and a prognostic model was established using LASSO and stepwise regression algorithms. Moreover, we investigated the predictive potential of these genes in the immune microenvironment and their applicability in immunotherapy. Finally,in vitroexperiments confirmed the functional significance of the high-risk gene CRYAB.Results:By analyzing the ScRNA-seq data, we identified 28 cell clusters representing seven cell types. After dimensionality reduction and clustering analysis, we obtained four subpopulations within the oligodendrocyte lineage based on their differentiation trajectory. Using CRYAB as a marker gene for the terminal-stage subpopulation, we found that its expression was associated with poor prognosis.In vitroexperiments demonstrated that knocking out CRYAB in U87 and LN229 cells reduced cell viability, proliferation, and invasiveness.Conclusion:The risk model based on CRYAB holds promise in accurately predicting glioblastoma. A comprehensive study of the specific mechanisms of CRYAB in glioblastoma would contribute to understanding its response to immunotherapy.

Systematic review on the current knowledge and use of single-cell RNA sequencing in head and neck cancer,"Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a novel method enabling genetic characterization of tumor tissue at a single-cell level. This study systematically reviewed the literature on studies using scRNA-seq to characterize head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs). Seven studies were included, of which two studies performed scRNA-seq on 20 patients in total, and five studies used scRNA-seq data in a subsequent clinical study. The former mentioned two studies found intra-tumoral genetic heterogeneity among malignant cells but genetic uniformity among non-malignant cells. The five latter studies used scRNA-seq data in various ways. Three studies identified biomarkers related to predicting whether a patient would benefit from immunotherapeutic treatment. One study characterized genes related to the perineural invasion. One study identified genes to be used in diagnostics. Further studies performing scRNA-seq on HNSCC are required to continue the ongoing development and use of scRNA-seq.",34561896,,10.1111/apm.13173,2,"APMIS : acta pathologica, microbiologica, et immunologica Scandinavica",8803400,3.428,0.5730214715003967,0.38127090301003347,0.18729096989966554,0.45752525748217787
Pan-cancer analysis of ASB3 and the potential clinical implications for immune microenvironment of glioblastoma multiforme,"Background:Ankyrin repeat and SOCS Box containing 3 (ASB3) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase. It has been reported to regulate the progression of some cancers, but no systematic pan-cancer analysis has been conducted to explore its function in prognosis and immune microenvironment.Method:In this study, mRNA expression data were downloaded from TCGA and GTEx database. Next generation sequencing data from 14 glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) samples by neurosurgical resection were used as validation dataset. Multiple bioinformatics methods (ssGSEA, Kaplan-Meier, Cox regression analysis, GSEA and online tools) were applied to explore ASB3 expression, gene activity, prognosis of patients in various cancers, and its correlation with clinical information, immune microenvironment and pertinent signal pathways in GBM. The biological function of ASB3 in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) was verified using an animal model.Results:We found that ASB3 was aberrant expressed in a variety of tumors, especially in GBM, and significantly correlated with the prognosis of cancer patients. The level of ASB3 was related to the TMB, MSI and immune cell infiltration in some cancer types. ASB3 had a negative association with immune infiltration and TME, including regulatory T cells (Tregs), cancer-associated fibroblasts, immunosuppressors and related signaling pathways in GBM. ASB3 overexpression reduced the proportion of Tregs in TILs. GSEA and PPI analysis also showed negative correlation between ASB3 expression and oncogenetic signaling pathways in GBM.Conclusion:A comprehensive pan-cancer analysis of ASB3 showed its potential function as a biomarker of cancer prognosis and effective prediction of immunotherapy response. This study not only enriches the understanding of the biological function of ASB3 in pan-cancer, especially in GBM immunity, but also provides a new reference for the personalized immunotherapy of GBM.",36618381,PMC9812557,10.3389/fimmu.2022.842524,2,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,8.786,0.5686553716659546,0.38461538461538464,0.7190635451505016,0.56192900895275
Understanding the glioblastoma tumor microenvironment: leveraging the extracellular matrix to increase immunotherapy efficacy,"Glioblastoma (GBM) accounts for approximately half of all malignant brain tumors, and it remains lethal with a five-year survival of less than 10%. Despite the immense advancements in the field, it has managed to evade even the most promising therapeutics: immunotherapies. The main reason is the highly spatiotemporally heterogeneous and immunosuppressive GBM tumor microenvironment (TME). Accounting for this complex interplay of TME-driven immunosuppression is key to developing effective therapeutics. This review will explore the immunomodulatory role of the extracellular matrix (ECM) by establishing its contribution to the TME as a key mediator of immune responses in GBM. This relationship will help us elucidate therapeutic targets that can be leveraged to develop and deliver more effective immunotherapies.",38380331,PMC10876826,10.3389/fimmu.2024.1336476,0,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,8.786,0.568355917930603,0.10702341137123746,0.7224080267558528,0.5068998383837798
Elucidating tumour-associated microglia/macrophage diversity along glioblastoma progression and under ACOD1 deficiency,"In glioblastoma (GBM), tumour-associated microglia/macrophages (TAMs) represent the major cell type of the stromal compartment and contribute to tumour immune escape mechanisms. Thus, targeting TAMs is emerging as a promising strategy for immunotherapy. However, TAM heterogeneity and metabolic adaptation along GBM progression represent critical features for the design of effective TAM-targeted therapies. Here, we comprehensively study the cellular and molecular changes of TAMs in the GL261 GBM mouse model, combining single-cell RNA-sequencing with flow cytometry and immunohistological analyses along GBM progression and in the absence of Acod1 (also known as Irg1), a key gene involved in the metabolic reprogramming of macrophages towards an anti-inflammatory phenotype. Similarly to patients, we identify distinct TAM profiles, mainly based on their ontogeny, that reiterate the idea that microglia- and macrophage-like cells show key transcriptional differences and dynamically adapt along GBM stages. Notably, we uncover decreased antigen-presenting cell features and immune reactivity in TAMs along tumour progression that are instead enhanced in Acod1-deficient mice. Overall, our results provide insight into TAM heterogeneity and highlight a novel role for Acod1 in TAM adaptation during GBM progression.",35838338,PMC9441003,10.1002/1878-0261.13287,8,Molecular oncology,101308230,7.449,0.5679365992546082,0.6354515050167224,0.5418060200668896,0.5762134645694873
Profiling and Bioinformatics Analyses of Differential Circular RNA Expression in Glioblastoma Multiforme Cells Under Hypoxia,"The hypoxia microenvironment is highly associated with GBM's malignant phenotypes. CircRNAs were reported involved in GBM's biological characteristics and regulated by HIF-1Î±. However, the differential expression profile and role of circRNAs in GBM cells under hypoxia are still unclear. The expression profiles of circRNAs in LN229 and T98G under hypoxia were explored via circRNA sequencing analysis. Those circRNAs significantly dysregulated both in LN229 and T98G and could be found in circBase were selected and validated by qRT-PCR, RNase R digestion reaction, and Sanger sequencing. Normal cell line and fresh GBM tissues were also used for qRT-PCR validation. The roles of differentially expressed circRNAs were evaluated by bioinformatics analyses. There were 672 dysregulated circRNAs in LN229 and 698 dysregulated circRNAs in T98G. GO analysis indicated that the alteration of circRNA expression related to GBM cell's biogenesis and metabolism. KEGG analysis demonstrated that TGF-Î² signaling pathway, HIF-1 signaling pathway, and metabolism-related signaling pathway were closely associated with differentially expressed circRNAs under hypoxia. These results were confirmed by GSEA analysis. The 6 selected and dysregulated circRNAs both in LN229 and T98G including hsa_circ_0000745, hsa_circ_0020093, hsa_circ_0020094, hsa_circ_0000943, hsa_circ_0004874, and hsa_circ_0002359 were validated by qRT-PCR. Inhibition of hsa_circ_0000745 inhibited GBM cell's proliferation, migration, and invasion. HIF-1Î± centered circRNA-miRNA-mRNA networks analysis showed that the 6 validated circRNAs could cross-talk with 11 related miRNAs. The circRNA expressions are dysregulated in GBM cell under hypoxia. The 6 validated circRNAs could participate in GBM's development and progression when hypoxia occurs. They might be the candidates for prognostic markers and adjuvant therapeutics of GBM in the future.",36484975,,10.1007/s12031-022-02090-y,2,Journal of molecular neuroscience : MN,9002991,2.866,0.5667380690574646,0.3879598662207358,0.14381270903010032,0.44639735648464607
Macrophages and microglia: the cerberus of glioblastoma,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive and deadliest of the primary brain tumors, characterized by malignant growth, invasion into the brain parenchyma, and resistance to therapy. GBM is a heterogeneous disease characterized by high degrees of both inter- and intra-tumor heterogeneity. Another layer of complexity arises from the unique brain microenvironment in which GBM develops and grows. The GBM microenvironment consists of neoplastic and non-neoplastic cells. The most abundant non-neoplastic cells are those of the innate immune system, called tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). TAMs constitute up to 40% of the tumor mass and consist of both brain-resident microglia and bone marrow-derived myeloid cells from the periphery. Although genetically stable, TAMs can change their expression profiles based upon the signals that they receive from tumor cells; therefore, heterogeneity in GBM creates heterogeneity in TAMs. By interacting with tumor cells and with the other non-neoplastic cells in the tumor microenvironment, TAMs promote tumor progression. Here, we review the origin, heterogeneity, and functional roles of TAMs. In addition, we discuss the prospects of therapeutically targeting TAMs alone or in combination with standard or newly-emerging GBM targeting therapies.",33766119,PMC7992800,10.1186/s40478-021-01156-z,73,Acta neuropathologica communications,101610673,7.578,0.5635581612586975,0.9531772575250836,0.568561872909699,0.642482722842175
Single-cell transcriptome analysis identifies novel biomarkers involved in major liver cancer subtypes,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) are the two aggressive subtypes of liver cancer (LC). Immense cellular heterogeneity and cross-talk between cancer and healthy cells make it challenging to treat these cancer subtypes. To address these challenges, the study aims to systematically characterize the tumor heterogeneity of LC subtypes using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets. The study combined 51,927 single cells from HCC, ICC, and healthy scRNA-seq datasets. After integrating the datasets, cell groups with similar gene expression patterns are clustered and cluster annotation has been performed based on gene markers. Cell-cell communication analysis (CCA) was implemented to understand the cross-talk between various cell types. Further, differential gene expression analysis and enrichment analysis were carried out to identify unique molecular drivers associated with HCC and ICC. Our analysis identified T cells, hepatocytes, epithelial cells, and monocyte as the major cell types present in the tumor microenvironment. Among them, abundance of natural killer (NK) cells in HCC, epithelial cells, and hepatocytes in ICC was detected. CCA revealed key interaction between T cells to NK cells in HCC and smooth muscle cells to epithelial cells in the ICC. Additionally, SOX4 and DTHD1 are the top differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in HCC, while keratin and CCL4 are in ICC. Enrichment analysis of DEGs reveals major upregulated genes in HCC affect protein folding mechanism and in ICC alter pathways involved in cell adhesion. The findings suggest potential targets for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of these two aggressive subtypes of LC.",37438675,,10.1007/s10142-023-01156-3,1,Functional & integrative genomics,100939343,3.674,0.5625370144844055,0.2976588628762542,0.20735785953177258,0.4385255531722486
Integrated analysis of single-cell RNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq unveils heterogeneity and establishes a novel signature for prognosis and tumor immune microenvironment in ovarian cancer,"Ovarian cancer is a highly heterogeneous gynecological malignancy that seriously affects the survival and prognosis of female patients. Single-cell sequencing and transcriptome analysis can effectively characterize tumor heterogeneity to better study the mechanism of occurrence and development. In this study, we identified differentially expressed genes with different differentiation outcomes of tumor cells by analyzing a single-cell dataset. Based on the differentially expressed genes, we explored the differences in function and tumor microenvironment among clusters via consensus clustering. Meanwhile, WGCNA was employed to obtain key genes related to ovarian cancer. On the basis of the TCGA and GEO datasets, we constructed a risk model consisting of 7 genes using the LASSO regression model, and successfully verified that the model was characterized as an independent prognostic factor, efficiently predicting the survival prognosis of patients. In addition, immune signature analysis showed that patients in the high-risk group exhibited lower anti-tumor immune cell infiltration and immunosuppressive status, and had poorer responsiveness to chemotherapeutic drugs and immunotherapy. In conclusion, our study provided a 7-gene prognostic model based on the heterogeneity of OC cells for ovarian cancer patients, which could effectively predict the prognosis of patients and identify the immune microenvironment status of patients.",36642706,PMC9841625,10.1186/s13048-022-01074-1,1,Journal of ovarian research,101474849,5.506,0.5605233311653137,0.3010033444816054,0.3745819397993311,0.4714310555553755
Therapy-induced shaping of the glioblastoma microenvironment: Macrophages at play,"The intricate cross-talks between tumor cells and their microenvironment play a key role in cancer progression and resistance to treatment. In recent years, targeting pro-tumorigenic components of the tumor microenvironment (TME) has emerged as a tantalizing strategy to improve the efficacy of standard-of-care (SOC) treatments, particularly for hard-to-treat cancers such as glioblastoma. In this review, we explore how the distinct microenvironmental niches characteristic of the glioblastoma TME shape response to therapy. In particular, we delve into the interplay between tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) and glioblastoma cells within angiogenic and hypoxic niches, and interrogate their dynamic co-evolution upon SOC therapies that fuels malignancy. Resolving the complexity of therapy-induced alterations in the glioblastoma TME and their impact on disease relapse is a stepping stone to identify targetable pro-tumorigenic pathways and TAM subsets, and may open the way to efficient combination therapies that will improve clinical outcomes.",35569742,,10.1016/j.semcancer.2022.05.003,5,Seminars in cancer biology,9010218,17.012,0.5604330897331238,0.5484949832775919,0.9163879598662207,0.6292364424686367
Multi-omics profiling of chemotactic characteristics of brain microglia and astrocytoma,"Brain cancer is a deadly disease with low survival rates for over 70 % of patients. Therefore, there is a critical need to develop better treatment methods and strategies to improve patient outcomes. In this study, we explored the tumor microenvironment and discovered unique characteristics of microglia to interact with astrocytoma cells and promote proliferation and migration of collisions. The conditioned medium from the collisions expressed cell chemoattraction and anti-inflammatory responses. To further understand the interactions between microglia and astrocytoma cells, we used flow sorting and protein analysis found that the protein alterations were related to biogenesis in the astrocytoma cells and metabolic processes in the microglia. Both types of cells were involved in binding and activity in cell-cell interactions. Using STRING to demonstrate the protein cross-interaction between the cells. Furthermore, PHB and RDX interact with oncogenic proteins, which were significantly expressed in patients with Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) and low-grade glioma (LGG) according to GEPIA. To study the role of RDX in chemoattraction, the inhibitor-NSC668394 suppressed collision formation and migration in BV2 cells in vitro by down-regulating F-actin. Additionally, it suppressed macrophage infiltration in infiltrating islands in vivo of intracranial tumor-bearing mice. These findings provide evidence for the role of resident cells in mediating tumor development and invasiveness and suggest that potential interacting molecules may be a strategy for controlling tumor growth by regulating the infiltration of tumor-associated microglia in the brain tumor microenvironment.",37419413,,10.1016/j.lfs.2023.121855,1,Life sciences,0375521,0.0,0.5599819421768188,0.30434782608695654,0.06354515050167224,0.4095677606238171
Adaptive Changes of Glioblastoma Cells Following Exposure to Hypoxic (1% Oxygen) Tumour Microenvironment,"Glioblastoma multiforme is the most aggressive and malignant primary brain tumour, with a median survival rate of between 15 to 17 months. Heterogeneous regions occur in glioblastoma as a result of oxygen gradients which ranges from 0.1% to 10% in vivo. Emerging evidence suggests that tumour hypoxia leads to increased aggressiveness and chemo/radio resistance. Yet, few in vitro studies have been performed in hypoxia. Using three glioblastoma cell-lines (U87, U251, and SNB19), the adaptation of glioblastoma cells in a 1% (hypoxia) and 20% (normoxia) oxygen microenvironment on proliferation, metabolism, migration, neurosphere formation, CD133 and VEGF expression was investigated. Compared to cells maintained in normoxia (20% oxygen), glioblastoma cells adapted to 1% oxygen tension by reducing proliferation and enhancing metabolism. Both migratory tendency and neurosphere formation ability were greatly limited. In addition, hypoxic-mediated gene upregulation (CD133 and VEGF) was reversed when cells were removed from the hypoxic environment. Collectively, our results reveal that hypoxia plays a pivotal role in changing the behaviour of glioblastoma cells. We have also shown that genetic modulation can be reversed, supporting the concept of reversibility. Thus, understanding the degree of oxygen gradient in glioblastoma will be crucial in personalising treatment for glioblastoma patients.",31035344,PMC6539006,10.3390/ijms20092091,13,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,6.208,0.5598616600036621,0.725752508361204,0.43478260869565216,0.5680240194135685
"New perspectives on biology, disease progression, and therapy response of head and neck cancer gained from single cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics","Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is one of the most frequent cancers worldwide. The main risk factors are consumption of tobacco products and alcohol, as well as infection with human papilloma virus. Approved therapeutic options comprise surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, targeted therapy through epidermal growth factor receptor inhibition, and immunotherapy, but outcome has remained unsatisfactory due to recurrence rates of ~50% and the frequent occurrence of second primaries. The availability of the human genome sequence at the beginning of the millennium heralded the omics era, in which rapid technological progress has advanced our knowledge of the molecular biology of malignant diseases, including HNSCC, at an unprecedented pace. Initially, microarray-based methods, followed by approaches based on next-generation sequencing, were applied to study the genetics, epigenetics, and gene expression patterns of bulk tumors. More recently, the advent of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) and spatial transcriptomics methods has facilitated the investigation of the heterogeneity between and within different cell populations in the tumor microenvironment (e.g., cancer cells, fibroblasts, immune cells, endothelial cells), led to the discovery of novel cell types, and advanced the discovery of cell-cell communication within tumors. This review provides an overview of scRNAseq, spatial transcriptomics, and the associated bioinformatics methods, and summarizes how their application has promoted our understanding of the emergence, composition, progression, and therapy responsiveness of, and intercellular signaling within, HNSCC.",38188682,PMC10767240,10.32604/or.2023.044774,0,Oncology research,9208097,4.938,0.5595307350158691,0.11036789297658862,0.34448160535117056,0.4266883406750733
Improving the performance of single-cell RNA-seq data mining based on relative expression orderings,"The advent of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides an unprecedented opportunity to explore gene expression profiles at the single-cell level. However, gene expression values vary over time and under different conditions even within the same cell. There is an urgent need for more stable and reliable feature variables at the single-cell level to depict cell heterogeneity. Thus, we construct a new feature matrix called the delta rank matrix (DRM) from scRNA-seq data by integrating an a priori gene interaction network, which transforms the unreliable gene expression value into a stable gene interaction/edge value on a single-cell basis. This is the first time that a gene-level feature has been transformed into an interaction/edge-level for scRNA-seq data analysis based on relative expression orderings. Experiments on various scRNA-seq datasets have demonstrated that DRM performs better than the original gene expression matrix in cell clustering, cell identification and pseudo-trajectory reconstruction. More importantly, the DRM really achieves the fusion of gene expressions and gene interactions and provides a method of measuring gene interactions at the single-cell level. Thus, the DRM can be used to find changes in gene interactions among different cell types, which may open up a new way to analyze scRNA-seq data from an interaction perspective. In addition, DRM provides a new method to construct a cell-specific network for each single cell instead of a group of cells as in traditional network construction methods. DRM's exceptional performance is due to its extraction of rich gene-association information on biological systems and stable characterization of cells.",36528803,PMC9851298,10.1093/bib/bbac556,0,Briefings in bioinformatics,100912837,13.994,0.5587182641029358,0.11371237458193979,0.8595317725752508,0.5298797878931996
CancerSCEM: a database of single-cell expression map across various human cancers,"With the proliferating studies of human cancers by single-cell RNA sequencing technique (scRNA-seq), cellular heterogeneity, immune landscape and pathogenesis within diverse cancers have been uncovered successively. The exponential explosion of massive cancer scRNA-seq datasets in the past decade are calling for a burning demand to be integrated and processed for essential investigations in tumor microenvironment of various cancer types. To fill this gap, we developed a database of Cancer Single-cell Expression Map (CancerSCEM, https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/cancerscem), particularly focusing on a variety of human cancers. To date, CancerSCE version 1.0 consists of 208 cancer samples across 28 studies and 20 human cancer types.

Detecting hidden batch factors through data-adaptive adjustment for biological effects,"Motivation:Batch effects are one of the major source of technical variations that affect the measurements in high-throughput studies such as RNA sequencing. It has been well established that batch effects can be caused by different experimental platforms, laboratory conditions, different sources of samples and personnel differences. These differences can confound the outcomes of interest and lead to spurious results. A critical input for batch correction algorithms is the knowledge of batch factors, which in many cases are unknown or inaccurate. Hence, the primary motivation of our paper is to detect hidden batch factors that can be used in standard techniques to accurately capture the relationship between gene expression and other modeled variables of interest.Results:We introduce a new algorithm based on data-adaptive shrinkage and semi-Non-negative Matrix Factorization for the detection of unknown batch effects. We test our algorithm on three different datasets: (i) Sequencing Quality Control, (ii) Topotecan RNA-Seq and (iii) Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) on Glioblastoma Multiforme. We have demonstrated a superior performance in identifying hidden batch effects as compared to existing algorithms for batch detection in all three datasets. In the Topotecan study, we were able to identify a new batch factor that has been missed by the original study, leading to under-representation of differentially expressed genes. For scRNA-Seq, we demonstrated the power of our method in detecting subtle batch effects.Availability and implementation:DASC R package is available via Bioconductor or at https://github.com/zhanglabNKU/DASC.Contact:zhanghan@nankai.edu.cn or zhandonl@bcm.edu.Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",29617963,PMC6454417,10.1093/bioinformatics/btx635,8,"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",9808944,6.931,0.5577850937843323,0.6387959866220736,0.5117056856187291,0.5647713907187599
Single-cell characterization of macrophages in glioblastoma reveals MARCO as a mesenchymal pro-tumor marker,"Background:Macrophages are the most common infiltrating immune cells in gliomas and play a wide variety of pro-tumor and anti-tumor roles. However, the different subpopulations of macrophages and their effects on the tumor microenvironment remain poorly understood.Methods:We combined new and previously published single-cell RNA-seq data from 98,015 single cells from a total of 66 gliomas to profile 19,331 individual macrophages.Results:Unsupervised clustering revealed a pro-tumor subpopulation of bone marrow-derived macrophages characterized by the scavenger receptor MARCO, which is almost exclusively found in IDH1-wild-type glioblastomas. Previous studies have implicated MARCO as an unfavorable marker in melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer; here, we find that bulk MARCO expression is associated with worse prognosis and mesenchymal subtype. Furthermore, MARCO expression is significantly altered over the course of treatment with anti-PD1 checkpoint inhibitors in a response-dependent manner, which we validate with immunofluorescence imaging.Conclusions:These findings illustrate a novel macrophage subpopulation that drives tumor progression in glioblastomas and suggest potential therapeutic targets to prevent their recruitment.",34011400,PMC8136167,10.1186/s13073-021-00906-x,38,Genome medicine,101475844,15.266,0.5571526885032654,0.8929765886287625,0.8929765886287625,0.6914822485534643
Single-Cell RNA-Seq Reveals Changes in Cell Subsets in the Cortical Microenvironment during Acute Phase of Ischemic Stroke Rats,"Background:Ischemic stroke, the most common stroke type, has threatened human life and health. Currently, intravenous thrombolysis and endovascular thrombectomy are the mainstream treatment methods, but they may cause cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury (CIRI), which aggravates brain injury. Consequently, it is worthwhile to start with a study of CIRI mechanism to identify better prevention and treatment methods. Applying single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology to further understand the biological functions of various cell types in CIRI will facilitate the intervention of CIRI.Methods:This study aimed to establish a rat middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model to simulate cerebral ischemia-reperfusion, perform enzymatic hydrolysis, and suspend cerebral cortex tissue edema. Single-cell transcriptome sequencing was used, combined with cluster analysis, t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) visualization, and other bioinformatics methods to distinguish cell subgroups while using gene ontology (GO) function enrichment and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment to reveal the biological function of each cell subgroup.Results:We identified 21 brain clusters with cell type-specific gene expression patterns and cell subpopulations, as well as 42 marker genes representing different cell subpopulations. The number of cells in clusters 0-3 increased significantly in MCAO group compared to that in the sham group, and nine-cell subpopulations exhibited remarkable differences in the number of genes. Subsequently, GO and KEGG analyses were performed on the top 40 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the six cell subpopulations with significant differences. These results indicate that biological processes and signaling pathways are involved in different cell subpopulations.Conclusions:ScRNA-seq revealed the diversity of cell differentiation and the unique information of cell subpopulations in the cortex of rats with acute ischemic stroke, providing novel insight into the pathological process and drug discovery in stroke.",37735120,,10.31083/j.jin2205128,0,Journal of integrative neuroscience,101156357,1.664,0.556821346282959,0.11705685618729098,0.12709030100334448,0.38292223920790247
Evaluation of single-cell RNAseq labelling algorithms using cancer datasets,"Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) clustering and labelling methods are used to determine precise cellular composition of tissue samples. Automated labelling methods rely on either unsupervised, cluster-based approaches or supervised, cell-based approaches to identify cell types. The high complexity of cancer poses a unique challenge, as tumor microenvironments are often composed of diverse cell subpopulations with unique functional effects that may lead to disease progression, metastasis and treatment resistance. Here, we assess 17 cell-based and 9 cluster-based scRNA-seq labelling algorithms using 8 cancer datasets, providing a comprehensive large-scale assessment of such methods in a cancer-specific context. Using several performance metrics, we show that cell-based methods generally achieved higher performance and were faster compared to cluster-based methods. Cluster-based methods more successfully labelled non-malignant cell types, likely because of a lack of gene signatures for relevant malignant cell subpopulations. Larger cell numbers present in some cell types in training data positively impacted prediction scores for cell-based methods. Finally, we examined which methods performed favorably when trained and tested on separate patient cohorts in scenarios similar to clinical applications, and which were able to accurately label particularly small or under-represented cell populations in the given datasets. We conclude that scPred and SVM show the best overall performances with cancer-specific data and provide further suggestions for algorithm selection.

Tunneling nanotubes: A bridge for heterogeneity in glioblastoma and a new therapeutic target?,"Background:The concept of tumour heterogeneity is not novel but is fast becoming a paradigm by which to explain part of the highly recalcitrant nature of aggressive malignant tumours. Glioblastoma is a prime example of such difficult-to-treat, invasive, and incurable malignancies. With the advent of the post-genomic age and increased access to next-generation sequencing technologies, numerous publications have described the presence and extent of intratumoural and intertumoural heterogeneity present in glioblastoma. Moreover, there have been numerous reports more directly correlating the heterogeneity of glioblastoma to its refractory, reoccurring, and inevitably terminal nature. It is therefore prudent to consider the different forms of heterogeneity seen in glioblastoma and how to harness this understanding to better strategize novel therapeutic approaches. One of the most central questions of tumour heterogeneity is how these numerous different cell types (both tumour and non-tumour) in the tumour mass communicate.Recent findings:This chapter provides a brief review on the variable heterogeneity of glioblastoma, with a focus on cellular heterogeneity and on modalities of communication that can induce further molecular diversity within the complex and ever-evolving tumour microenvironment. We provide particular emphasis on the emerging role of actin-based cellular conduits called tunnelling nanotubes (TNTs) and tumour microtubes (TMs) and outline the perceived current problems in the field that need to be resolved before pharmacological targeting of TNTs can become a reality.Conclusions:We conclude that TNTs and TMs provide a new and exciting avenue for the therapeutic targeting of glioblastoma and that numerous inroads have already made into TNT and TM biology. However, to target TMs and TNTs, several advances must be made before this aim can become a reality.",32729189,PMC7941610,10.1002/cnr2.1185,20,"Cancer reports (Hoboken, N.J.)",101747728,0.0,0.5554050803184509,0.7959866220735786,0.07023411371237458,0.5064871953482613
The N6-Methyladenosine-Modified Pseudogene HSPA7 Correlates With the Tumor Microenvironment and Predicts the Response to Immune Checkpoint Therapy in Glioblastoma,"Background:Glioblastoma (GBM), one of the most aggressive tumors of the brain, has no effective or sufficient therapies. Identifying robust biomarkers for the response to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy, a promising treatment option for GBM patients, is urgently needed.Methods:We comprehensively evaluated lncRNA m6A modification patterns in m6A-sequencing (m6A-seq) data for GBM tissues and systematically investigated the immune and stromal regulators of these m6A-regulated lncRNAs. We used the single-sample gene-set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) algorithm to investigate the difference in enriched tumor microenvironment (TME) infiltrating cells and the functional annotation of HSPA7 in individual GBM samples. Further, we validated that HSPA7 promoted the recruitment of macrophages into GBM TMEin vitro, as well as in our GBM tissue section. We also explored its impact on the efficacy of ICB therapy using the patient-derived glioblastoma organoid (GBO) model.Results:Here, we depicted the first transcriptome-wide m6A methylation profile of lncRNAs in GBM, revealing highly distinct lncRNA m6A modification patterns compared to those in normal brain tissues. We identified the m6A-modified pseudogene HSPA7 as a novel prognostic risk factor in GBM patients, with crucial roles in immunophenotype determination, stromal activation, and carcinogenic pathway activation. We confirmed that HSPA7 promoted macrophage infiltration and SPP1 expressionviaupregulating the YAP1 and LOX expression of glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs)in vitroand in our clinical GBM tumor samples. We also confirmed that knockdown of HSPA7 might increase the efficiency of anti-PD1 therapy utilizing the GBO model, highlighting its potential as a novel target for immunotherapy.Conclusions:Our results indicated that HSPA7 could be a novel immunotherapy target for GBM patients.",34354698,PMC8329659,10.3389/fimmu.2021.653711,23,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,8.786,0.5550131797790527,0.8193979933110368,0.725752508361204,0.6420380082018798
Injury programs shape glioblastoma,"Glioblastoma is the most common and aggressive primary brain cancer in adults and is almost universally fatal due to its stark therapeutic resistance. During the past decade, although survival has not substantially improved, major advances have been made in our understanding of the underlying biology. It has become clear that these devastating tumors recapitulate features of neurodevelopmental hierarchies which are influenced by the microenvironment. Emerging evidence also highlights a prominent role for injury responses in steering cellular phenotypes and contributing to tumor heterogeneity. This review highlights how the interplay between injury and neurodevelopmental programs impacts on tumor growth, invasion, and treatment resistance, and discusses potential therapeutic considerations in view of these findings.",36089406,,10.1016/j.tins.2022.08.006,3,Trends in neurosciences,7808616,16.978,0.5539577603340149,0.46488294314381273,0.9096989966555183,0.6072910441602751
In Vitro/In SilicoStudy on the Role of Doubling Time Heterogeneity among Primary Glioblastoma Cell Lines,"The application of accurate cancer predictive algorithms validated with experimental data is a field concerning both basic researchers and clinicians, especially regarding a highly aggressive form of cancer, such as Glioblastoma. In an aim to enhance prediction accuracy in realistic patient-specific environments, accounting for both inter- and intratumoral heterogeneity, we use patient-derived Glioblastoma cells from different patients. We focus on cell proliferation usingin vitroexperiments to estimate cell doubling times and sizes for established primary Glioblastoma cell lines. A preclinically driven mathematical model parametrization is accomplished by taking into account the experimental measurements. As a control cell line we use the well-studied U87MG cells. Bothin vitroandin silicoresults presented support that the variance between tumor staging can be attributed to the differential proliferative capacity of the different Glioblastoma cells. More specifically, theintratumoral heterogeneitytogether with the overall proliferation reflected in both theproliferation rateand themechanical cell contact inhibitioncan predict thein vitroevolution of different Glioblastoma cell lines growing under the same conditions. Undoubtedly, additional imaging techniques capable of providing spatial information of tumor cell physiology and microenvironment will enhance our understanding regarding Glioblastoma nature and verify and further improve our predictability.",29226151,PMC5684616,10.1155/2017/8569328,21,BioMed research international,101600173,3.246,0.5529924035072327,0.8093645484949833,0.1705685618729097,0.5277820641779182

Emerging Concepts on the Role of Extracellular Vesicles and Its Cargo Contents in Glioblastoma-Microglial Crosstalk,"Glioblastoma multiforme is the most common, highly aggressive malignant brain tumor which is marked by highest inter- and intra-tumoral heterogeneity. Despite, immunotherapy, and combination therapies developed; the clinical trials often result into large number of failures. Often cancer cells are known to communicate with surrounding cells in tumor microenvironment (TME). Extracellular vesicles (EVs) consisting of diverse cargo mediates this intercellular communication and is believed to modulate the immune function against GBM. Tumor-associated microglia (TAM), though being the resident innate immune cell of CNS, is known to attain pro-tumorigenic M2phenotype, and this immunomodulation is aided by extracellular vesicle-mediated transfer of oncogenic, immunomodulatory molecules. Besides, oncogenic proteins, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), are believed to carry oncogenic potential, and therefore, understanding the mechanism leading to microglial dysregulation mediated by GBM-derived extracellular vesicle (GDEV) lncRNAs becomes crucial. This review focuses on current understanding of role of GDEV and lncRNA in microglial dysfunction and its potential as a therapeutic target.",35212938,PMC10058057,10.1007/s12035-022-02752-3,7,Molecular neurobiology,8900963,5.682,0.5522077083587646,0.6086956521739131,0.38461538461538464,0.5299868323731183
The immune landscape of high-grade brain tumor after treatment with immune checkpoint blockade,"Despite the therapeutic success of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy against multiple tumors, many patients still do not benefit from ICB. In particular, high-grade brain tumors, such as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), have a very low response rate to ICB, resulting in several failed clinical trials. This low response rate might be caused by a lack of understanding of the unique characteristics of brain immunity. To overcome this knowledge gap, macroscopic studies of brain immunity are needed. We use single cell RNA sequencing to analyze the immune landscape of the tumor microenvironment (TME) under anti-PD-1 antibody treatment in a murine GBM model. We observe that CD8 T cells show a mixed phenotype overall that includes reinvigoration and re-exhaustion states. Furthermore, we find that CCL5 induced by anti-PD-1 treatment might be related to an increase in the number of anti-inflammatory macrophages in the TME. Therefore, we hypothesize that CCL5-mediated recruitment of anti-inflammatory macrophages may be associated with re-exhaustion of CD8 T cells in the TME. We compare our observations in the murine GBM models with publicly available data from human patients with recurrent GBM. Our study provides critical information for the development of novel immunotherapies to overcome the limitations of anti-PD-1 therapy.",36591276,PMC9794569,10.3389/fimmu.2022.1044544,2,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,8.786,0.550758421421051,0.39464882943143814,0.7290969899665551,0.5552042167322293
Rapid 3D Bioprinting of Glioblastoma Model Mimicking Native Biophysical Heterogeneity,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most lethal primary brain tumor characterized by high cellular and molecular heterogeneity, hypervascularization, and innate drug resistance. Cellular components and extracellular matrix (ECM) are the two primary sources of heterogeneity in GBM. Here, biomimetic tri-regional GBM models with tumor regions, acellular ECM regions, and an endothelial region with regional stiffnesses patterned corresponding to the GBM stroma, pathological or normal brain parenchyma, and brain capillaries, are developed. Patient-derived GBM cells, human endothelial cells, and hyaluronic acid derivatives are used to generate a species-matched and biochemically relevant microenvironment. This in vitro study demonstrates that biophysical cues are involved in various tumor cell behaviors and angiogenic potentials and promote different molecular subtypes of GBM. The stiff models are enriched in the mesenchymal subtype, exhibit diffuse invasion of tumor cells, and induce protruding angiogenesis and higher drug resistance to temozolomide. Meanwhile, the soft models demonstrate enrichment in the classical subtype and support expansive cell growth. The three-dimensional bioprinting technology utilized in this study enables rapid, flexible, and reproducible patient-specific GBM modeling with biophysical heterogeneity that can be employed by future studies as a tunable system to interrogate GBM disease mechanisms and screen drug compounds.",33502104,PMC8049977,10.1002/smll.202006050,30,"Small (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",101235338,15.153,0.5506677627563477,0.8461538461538461,0.8795986622073578,0.6755511593260495
TISCH: a comprehensive web resource enabling interactive single-cell transcriptome visualization of tumor microenvironment,"Cancer immunotherapy targeting co-inhibitory pathways by checkpoint blockade shows remarkable efficacy in a variety of cancer types. However, only a minority of patients respond to treatment due to the stochastic heterogeneity of tumor microenvironment (TME). Recent advances in single-cell RNA-seq technologies enabled comprehensive characterization of the immune system heterogeneity in tumors but posed computational challenges on integrating and utilizing the massive published datasets to inform immunotherapy. Here, we present Tumor Immune Single Cell Hub (TISCH, http://tisch.comp-genomics.org), a large-scale curated database that integrates single-cell transcriptomic profiles of nearly 2 million cells from 76 high-quality tumor datasets across 27 cancer types. All the data were uniformly processed with a standardized workflow, including quality control, batch effect removal, clustering, cell-type annotation, malignant cell classification, differential expression analysis and functional enrichment analysis. TISCH provides interactive gene expression visualization across multiple datasets at the single-cell level or cluster level, allowing systematic comparison between different cell-types, patients, tissue origins, treatment and response groups, and even different cancer-types.

Prescreening of tumor samples for tumor-centric transcriptome analyses of lung adenocarcinoma,"Background:Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables the systemic assessment of intratumoral heterogeneity within tumor cell populations and in diverse stromal cells of the tumor microenvironment. Gain of treatment resistance during tumor progression or drug treatment are important subjects of tumor-centric scRNA-seq analyses, which are hampered by scarce tumor cell portions. To guarantee the inclusion of tumor cells in the data analysis, we developed a prescreening strategy for lung adenocarcinoma.Methods:We obtained candidate genes that were differentially expressed between normal and tumor cells, excluding stromal cells, from the scRNA-seq data. Tumor cell-specific expression of the candidate genes was assessed via real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using lung cancer cell lines, normal vs. lung cancer tissues, and lymph node biopsy samples with or without metastasis.Results:We found that CEA cell adhesion molecule 5 (CEACAM5) and high mobility group box 3 (HMGB3) were reliable markers for RT-PCR-based prescreening of tumor cells in lung adenocarcinoma.Conclusions:The prescreening strategy using CEACAM5 and HMGB3 expression facilitates tumor-centric scRNA-seq analyses of lung adenocarcinoma.",36397035,PMC9673386,10.1186/s12885-022-10317-9,1,BMC cancer,100967800,4.638,0.545285701751709,0.3076923076923077,0.3110367892976589,0.45091724044901865
Macrophages/Microglia in the Glioblastoma Tumor Microenvironment,"The complex interaction between glioblastoma and its microenvironment has been recognized for decades. Among various immune profiles, the major population is tumor-associated macrophage, with microglia as its localized homolog. The present definition of such myeloid cells is based on a series of cell markers. These good sentinel cells experience significant changes, facilitating glioblastoma development and protecting it from therapeutic treatments. Huge, complicated mechanisms are involved during the overall processes. A lot of effort has been dedicated to crack the mysterious codes in macrophage/microglia recruiting, activating, reprogramming, and functioning. We have made our path. With more and more key factors identified, a lot of new therapeutic methods could be explored to break the ominous loop, to enhance tumor sensitivity to treatments, and to improve the prognosis of glioblastoma patients. However, it might be a synergistic system rather than a series of clear, stepwise events. There are still significant challenges before the light of truth can shine onto the field. Here, we summarize recent advances in this field, reviewing the path we have been on and where we are now.",34071306,PMC8198046,10.3390/ijms22115775,22,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,6.208,0.5451949238777161,0.8160535117056856,0.43812709030100333,0.5779530747279674
Chemoradiotherapy Increases Intratumor Heterogeneity of HPSE Expression in the Relapsed Glioblastoma Tumors,"Adjuvant chemoradiotherapy is a standard treatment option for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Despite intensive care, recurrent tumors developed during the first year are fatal for the patients. Possibly contributing to this effect, among other causes, is that therapy induces changes of polysaccharide heparan sulfate (HS) chains in the cancer cells and/or tumor microenvironment. The aim of this study was to perform a comparative analysis of heparanase (HPSE) expression and HS content in different normal and GBM brain tissues. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed a significant decrease of HPSE protein content in the tumor (12-15-fold) and paratumorous (2.5-3-fold) GBM tissues compared with normal brain tissue, both in cellular and extracellular compartments. The relapsed GBM tumors demonstrated significantly higher intertumor and/or intratumor heterogeneity of HPSE and HS content and distribution compared with the matched primary ones (from the same patient) (n= 8), although overall expression levels did not show significant differences, suggesting local deterioration of HPSE expression with reference to the control system or by the treatment. Double immunofluorescence staining of various glioblastoma cell lines (U87, U343, LN18, LN71, T406) demonstrated a complex pattern of HPSE expression and HS content with a tendency towards a negative association of these parameters. Taken together, the results demonstrate the increase of intratumor heterogeneity of HPSE protein in relapsed GBM tumors and suggest misbalance of HPSE expression regulation by the adjuvant anti-GBM chemoradiotherapy.",32075104,PMC7073003,10.3390/ijms21041301,4,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,6.208,0.5431662201881409,0.5050167224080268,0.4414715719063545,0.5151973909757608
Single-cell RNA-seq integrated with multi-omics reveals SERPINE2 as a target for metastasis in advanced renal cell carcinoma,"Tumor growth, metastasis and therapeutic response are believed to be regulated by the tumor and its microenvironment (TME) in advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). However, the mechanisms underlying genomic, transcriptomic and epigenetic alternations in RCC progression have not been completely defined. In this study, single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data were obtained from eight tissue samples of RCC patients, including two matched pairs of primary and metastatic sites (lymph nodes), along with Hi-C, transposable accessible chromatin by high-throughput (ATAC-seq) and RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) between RCC (Caki-1) and human renal tubular epithelial cell line (HK-2). The identified target was verified in clinical tissue samples (microarray of 407 RCC patients, TMA-30 and TMA-2020), whose function was further validated by in vitro and in vivo experiments through knockdown or overexpression. We profiled transcriptomes of 30514 malignant cells, and 14762 non-malignant cells. Comprehensive multi-omics analysis revealed that malignant cells and TME played a key role in RCC. The expression programs of stromal cells and immune cells were consistent among the samples, whereas malignant cells expressed distinct programs associated with hypoxia, cell cycle, epithelial differentiation, and two different metastasis patterns. Comparison of the hierarchical structure showed that SERPINE2 was related to these NNMF expression programs, and at the same time targeted the switched compartment. SERPINE2 was highly expressed in RCC tissues and lowly expressed in para-tumor tissues or HK-2 cell line. SERPINE2 knockdown markedly suppressed RCC cell growth and invasion, while SERPINE2 overexpression dramatically promoted RCC cell metastasis both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, SERPINE2 could activate the epithelial-mesenchymal transition pathway. The above findings demonstrated that the role of distinct expression patterns of malignant cells and TME played a distinct role in RCC progression. SERPINE2 was identified as a potential therapeutic target for inhibiting metastasis in advanced RCC.",36646679,PMC9842647,10.1038/s41419-023-05566-w,10,Cell death & disease,101524092,9.685,0.5415604114532471,0.6923076923076923,0.7725752508361204,0.6179128355007109
Hypoxia coordinates the spatial landscape of myeloid cells within glioblastoma to affect survival,"Myeloid cells are highly prevalent in glioblastoma (GBM), existing in a spectrum of phenotypic and activation states. We now have limited knowledge of the tumor microenvironment (TME) determinants that influence the localization and the functions of the diverse myeloid cell populations in GBM. Here, we have utilized orthogonal imaging mass cytometry with single-cell and spatial transcriptomic approaches to identify and map the various myeloid populations in the human GBM tumor microenvironment (TME). Our results show that different myeloid populations have distinct and reproducible compartmentalization patterns in the GBM TME that is driven by tissue hypoxia, regional chemokine signaling, and varied homotypic and heterotypic cellular interactions. We subsequently identified specific tumor subregions in GBM, based on composition of identified myeloid cell populations, that were linked to patient survival. Our results provide insight into the spatial organization of myeloid cell subpopulations in GBM, and how this is predictive of clinical outcome.",38758780,PMC11100569,10.1126/sciadv.adj3301,0,Science advances,101653440,14.957,0.5404388308525085,0.12709030100334448,0.8762541806020067,0.5249321948325754
The immunosuppressive microenvironment and immunotherapy in human glioblastoma,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most malignant intracranial tumor in adults, characterized by extensive infiltrative growth, high vascularization, and resistance to multiple therapeutic approaches. Among the many factors affecting the therapeutic effect, the immunosuppressive GBM microenvironment that is created by cells and associated moleculesviacomplex mechanisms plays a particularly important role in facilitating evasion of the tumor from the immune response. Accumulating evidence is also revealing a close association of the gut microbiota with the challenges in the treatment of GBM. The gut microbiota establishes a connection with the central nervous system through bidirectional signals of the gut-brain axis, thus affecting the occurrence and development of GBM. In this review, we discuss the key immunosuppressive components in the tumor microenvironment, along with the regulatory mechanism of the gut microbiota involved in immunity and metabolism in the GBM microenvironment. Lastly, we concentrate on the immunotherapeutic strategies currently under investigation, which hold promise to overcome the hurdles of the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and improve the therapeutic outcome for patients with GBM.",36466873,PMC9712217,10.3389/fimmu.2022.1003651,10,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,8.786,0.5396807789802551,0.6956521739130435,0.7324414715719063,0.609427196485143
Pericytes in Glioblastomas: Multifaceted Role Within Tumor Microenvironments and Potential for Therapeutic Interventions,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive and lethal disease that often results in a poor prognosis. Unlike most solid tumors, GBM is characterized by diffuse infiltrating margins, extensive angiogenesis, hypoxia, necrosis, and clonal heterogeneity. Recurrent disease is an unavoidable consequence for many patients as standard treatment options such as surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy have proven to be insufficient in causing long-term survival benefits. Systemic delivery of promising drugs is hindered due to the blood-brain barrier and non-uniform perfusion within GBM tissue. In recent years, many investigations have highlighted the role of GBM stem cells (GSCs) and their microenvironment in the initiation and maintenance of tumor tissue. Preclinical and early clinical studies to target GSCs and microenvironmental components are currently underway. Of these strategies, immunotherapy using checkpoint inhibitors and redirected cytotoxic T cells have shown promising results in early investigations. But, GBM microenvironment is heterogenous and recent investigations have shown cell populations within this microenvironment to be plastic. These studies underline the importance of identifying the role of and targeting multiple cell populations within the GBM microenvironment which could have a synergistic effect when combined with novel therapies. Pericytes are multipotent perivascular cells that play a vital role within the GBM microenvironment by assisting in tumor initiation, survival, and progression. Due to their role in regulating the blood-brain barrier permeability, promoting angiogenesis, tumor growth, clearing extracellular matrix for infiltrating GBM cells and in helping GBM cells evade immune surveillance, pericytes could be ideal therapeutic targets for stymieing or exploiting their role within the GBM microenvironment. This chapter will introduce hallmarks of GBM and elaborate on the contributions of pericytes to these hallmarks by examining recent findings.

"The implications of single-cell RNA-seq analysis in prostate cancer: unraveling tumor heterogeneity, therapeutic implications and pathways towards personalized therapy","In recent years, advancements in single-cell and spatial transcriptomics, which are highly regarded developments in the current era, particularly the emerging integration of single-cell and spatiotemporal transcriptomics, have enabled a detailed molecular comprehension of the complex regulation of cell fate. The insights obtained from these methodologies are anticipated to significantly contribute to the development of personalized medicine. Currently, single-cell technology is less frequently utilized for prostate cancer compared with other types of tumors. Starting from the perspective of RNA sequencing technology, this review outlined the significance of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) in prostate cancer research, encompassing preclinical medicine and clinical applications. We summarize the differences between mouse and human prostate cancer as revealed by scRNA-seq studies, as well as a combination of multi-omics methods involving scRNA-seq to highlight the key molecular targets for the diagnosis, treatment, and drug resistance characteristics of prostate cancer. These studies are expected to provide novel insights for the development of immunotherapy and other innovative treatment strategies for castration-resistant prostate cancer. Furthermore, we explore the potential clinical applications stemming from other single-cell technologies in this review, paving the way for future research in precision medicine.",38605399,PMC11007901,10.1186/s40779-024-00526-7,1,Military Medical Research,101643181,34.915,0.535736083984375,0.3110367892976589,0.9732441471571907,0.5782978376815949
Resolution of tissue signatures of therapy response in patients with recurrent GBM treated with neoadjuvant anti-PD1,"The response of patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme to neoadjuvant immune checkpoint blockade has been challenging to interpret due to the inter-patient and intra-tumor heterogeneity. We report on a comparative analysis of tumor tissues collected from patients with recurrent glioblastoma and high-risk melanoma, both treated with neoadjuvant checkpoint blockade. We develop a framework that uses multiplex spatial protein profiling, machine learning-based image analysis, and data-driven computational models to investigate the pathophysiological and molecular factors within the tumor microenvironment that influence treatment response. Using melanoma to guide the interpretation of glioblastoma analyses, we interrogate the protein expression in microscopic compartments of tumors, and determine the correlates of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, tumor growth, treatment response, and immune cell-cell interaction. This work reveals similarities shared between glioblastoma and melanoma, immunosuppressive factors that are unique to the glioblastoma microenvironment, and potential co-targets for enhancing the efficacy of neoadjuvant immune checkpoint blockade.",34188042,PMC8241935,10.1038/s41467-021-24293-4,13,Nature communications,101528555,17.694,0.5354020595550537,0.7290969899665551,0.9464882943143813,0.6563582925892195
Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals the cellular and molecular heterogeneity of treatment-naÃ¯ve primary osteosarcoma in dogs,"Osteosarcoma (OS) is a heterogeneous, aggressive malignancy of the bone that disproportionally affects children and adolescents. Therapeutic interventions for OS are limited, which is in part due to the complex tumor microenvironment (TME). As such, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to describe the cellular and molecular composition of the TME in 6 treatment-naÃ¯ve dogs with spontaneously occurring primary OS. Through analysis of 35,310 cells, we identified 41 transcriptomically distinct cell types including the characterization of follicular helper T cells, mature regulatory dendritic cells (mregDCs), and 8 tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) populations. Cell-cell interaction analysis predicted that mregDCs and TAMs play key roles in modulating T cell mediated immunity. Furthermore, we completed cross-species cell type gene signature homology analysis and found a high degree of similarity between human and canine OS. The data presented here act as a roadmap of canine OS which can be applied to advance translational immuno-oncology research.",38658617,PMC11043452,10.1038/s42003-024-06182-w,0,Communications biology,101719179,6.548,0.5345517992973328,0.13043478260869565,0.48494983277591974,0.4438080026553227
Immune Microenvironment in Glioblastoma Subtypes,"Glioblastomas (GBMs) are the most common and aggressive primary brain tumors. Due to their malignant growth and invasion into the brain parenchyma coupled with resistance to therapy, GBMs are among the deadliest of all cancers. GBMs are highly heterogeneous at both the molecular and histological levels. Hallmark histological structures include pseudopalisading necrosis and microvascular proliferation. In addition to high levels of intratumoral heterogeneity, GBMs also exhibit high levels of inter-tumoral heterogeneity. The major non-neoplastic cell population in the GBM microenvironment includes cells of the innate immune system called tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Correlative data from the literature suggest that molecularly distinct GBM subtypes exhibit differences in their microenvironment. Data from mouse models of GBM suggest that genetic driver mutations can create unique microenvironments. Here, we review the origin, features, and functions of TAMs in distinct GBM subtypes. We also discuss their interactions with other immune cell constituents and discuss prospects of therapeutically targeting TAMs to increase the efficacy of T-cell functions.",29867979,PMC5951930,10.3389/fimmu.2018.01004,212,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,8.786,0.5337012410163879,0.9832775919732442,0.7357859531772575,0.664033453639933
Characterization of Different Subtypes of Immune Cell Infiltration in Glioblastoma to Aid Immunotherapy,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) has been identified as a frequently occurring adult primary brain cancer that is highly aggressive. Currently, the prognostic outcome for GBM patients is dismal, even with intensive treatment, and the median overall survival (OS) is 14.6 months. Immunotherapy, which is specific at the cellular level and can generate persistent immunosurveillance, is now becoming a promising tool to treat diverse cancers. However, the complicated nature of the tumor microenvironment (TME) makes it challenging to develop anti-GBM immunotherapy because several cell types, cytokines, and signaling pathways are involved in generating the immunosuppressive environment. Novel immunotherapies can illustrate novel tumor-induced immunosuppressive mechanisms. Here, we used unsupervised clustering analysis to identify different subtypes of immune cell infiltration that actuated different prognoses, biological actions, and immunotherapy responses. Gene cluster A, with a hot immune cell infiltration phenotype, had high levels of immune-related genes (IRGs), which were associated with immune pathways including the interferon-gamma response and interferon-alpha response, and had lowIDH1andATRXmutation frequencies. Gene cluster B, a cold immune cell infiltration subtype, exhibited a high expression of theKCNIP2,SCRT1,CPLX2,JPH3,UNC13A,GABRB3,ARPP21,DLGAP1,NRXN1,DLL3,CA10,MAP2,SEZ6L,GRIA2, andGRIA4genes and a low expression of immune-related genes, i.e., low levels of immune reactivity. Our study highlighted the complex interplay between immune cell infiltration and genetic mutation in the establishment of the tumor immune phenotype. Gene cluster A was identified as an important subtype with a better prognosis and improved immunotherapy response.",35799789,PMC9254719,10.3389/fimmu.2022.799509,8,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,8.786,0.5334278345108032,0.6421404682274248,0.7391304347826086,0.5963108813084886
Cancer Stem Cell-Associated Immune Microenvironment in Recurrent Glioblastomas,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most incurable tumor (due to the difficulty in complete surgical resection and the resistance to conventional chemo/radiotherapies) that displays a high relapse frequency. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) have been considered as a promising target responsible for therapy resistance and cancer recurrence. CSCs are known to organize a self-advantageous microenvironment (niche) for their maintenance and expansion. Therefore, understanding how the microenvironment is reconstructed by the remaining CSCs after conventional treatments and how it eventually causes recurrence should be essential to inhibit cancer recurrence. However, the number of studies focusing on recurrence is limited, particularly those related to tumor immune microenvironment, while numerous data have been obtained from primary resected samples. Here, we summarize recent investigations on the immune microenvironment from the viewpoint of recurrent GBM (rGBM). Based on the recurrence-associated immune cell composition reported so far, we will discuss how CSCs manipulate host immunity and create the special microenvironment for themselves to regrow. An integrated understanding of the interactions between CSCs and host immune cells at the recurrent phase will lead us to develop innovative therapies and diagnoses to achieve GBM eradication.",35805138,PMC9265559,10.3390/cells11132054,6,Cells,101600052,7.666,0.532759428024292,0.5785953177257525,0.5919732441471572,0.5537693691891571
The Non-N6-Methyladenosine Epitranscriptome Patterns and Characteristics of Tumor Microenvironment Infiltration and Mesenchymal Transition in Glioblastoma,"Background:An increasing number of RNA modification types other than N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification have been detected. Nonetheless, the probable functions of RNA modifications beyond m6A in the tumor microenvironment (TME), mesenchymal (MES) transition, immunotherapy, and drug sensitivity remain unclear.Methods:We analyzed the characteristics of 32 non-m6A RNA modification regulators in 539 glioblastoma (GBM) patients and the TME cell infiltration and MES transition patterns. Using principal component analysis, a non-m6A epitranscriptome regulator score (RM score) model was established. We estimated the association between RM score and clinical characteristics, TME status, GBM subtypes, and drug and immunotherapy response.Results:Three definite non-m6A RNA modification patterns associated with diverse biological pathways and clinical characteristics were identified. The high RM score group was characterized by a poor prognosis, enhanced immune infiltration, and MES subtype. Further analysis indicated that the high RM score group had a lower tumor mutation burden as well as a weaker response to immunotherapy. The higher RM score group may benefit more from drugs targeting the EGFR and WNT signaling pathways.Conclusion:Our study exposed the potential relationship of non-m6A RNA modification regulators with clinical features, TME status, and GBM subtype and clarified its therapeutic value.",35154083,PMC8825368,10.3389/fimmu.2021.809808,9,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,8.786,0.5320908427238464,0.6688963210702341,0.7424749163879598,0.6015287531259467
Biomanufacturing of glioblastoma organoids exhibiting hierarchical and spatially organized tumor microenvironment via transdifferentiation,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive type of brain tumor that originates from glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs). In the brain, GSCs are supported by a tumor microenvironment (TME) residing in the perivascular niche and the hypoxic niche. The GBM TME is highly heterogenous and exhibits complex cell-to-cell interactions. Three-dimensional tumorspheres cultured in stem cell-enriching media is often used as an in vitro model. The GBM tumorspheres retain some of the transcriptional and translational GSC features but often fails to recapitulate intertumor heterogeneity. Here, we developed a simple, matrix-free, and in vivo-like GBM organoids (GBOs) using patient-derived xenograft GBM lines in small-scale bioreactors. Shear stress was optimized to produce highly reproducible GBOs over 1 mm diameter within 4-5 weeks. GBOs exhibited high stemness and strong cell-to-cell interactions compared to conventional tumorsphere cultures. They displayed spatial gradients of hypoxia-inducible factor 1Î± positive hypoxic cores where CD133-positive cells resided and spatially heterogeneous expression of NOTCH and its ligands. We also observed a self-established, hierarchically organized, and heterogeneous TME by GBM transdifferentiation into endothelial cells, pericytes, and astrocytes. Collectively, we demonstrate the ability to biomanufacture uniformly sized GBOs that recapitulate in vivo GBM TME features that can serve as an improved GBM in vitro model.",35869574,,10.1002/bit.28191,5,Biotechnology and bioengineering,7502021,4.395,0.5311181545257568,0.5518394648829431,0.2909698996655518,0.48723276562515305
Comprehensive analysis of single-cell RNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq revealed the heterogeneity and convergence of the immune microenvironment in renal cell carcinoma,"Substantial progress has been made in cancer biology and treatment in recent years, but the clinical outcome of patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) remains unsatisfactory. The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a potential target. By analyzing single-cell RNA sequencing (sc-RNAseq) data from six RCC tumor samples, this study identified 11 different cell types in the RCC cellular microenvironment, indicating a high degree of intratumoral heterogeneity. Through re-dimensionality reduction clustering of epithelial cells, neutrophils, macrophages, and T cells, we deeply reveal differences in the RCC tumor microenvironment. By analyzing differentially expressed genes in normal epithelial cells and malignant epithelial cells, we identify RNASET2 and GATM as potential prognostic biomarkers in RCC. In addition, by transcriptional factor analysis, we found significant differences in the expression of GZMK-CD8 T cell and B cell transcription factors between cancer tissues and normal tissues. By cell correlation analysis, we found significant correlations between neutrophils and macrophages and between IL7R-CD4 T cells and T regulatory (Treg) cells in RCC, which may be involved in the formation of immune TMEs. By cell developmental trajectory analysis, we showed that macrophages may be derived from neutrophils, whereas Treg cells may be derived from IL7R-CD4 T cells. By cell communication analysis, we found a clear interaction between macrophages and endothelial cells, neutrophils, and GZMK-CD8 T cells. In addition, we found that ADGRE5 signaling was mainly derived from mast cells and GZMK-CD8 T cells, and had a significant communication effect with neutrophils. The COLLAGEN signaling pathway is mainly derived from fibroblasts and has a significant communication effect with mast cells. Finally, we verified that RNASET2, which is highly expressed in epithelial cells, promotes proliferation and migration of RCC in vitro. RNASET2 is likely to be a potential target for renal cell carcinoma therapy. The results based on sc-RNAseq data analysis help to further elucidate the cellular microenvironment of RCC and provide help for cancer heterogeneity studies. This will help to provide more accurate personalized treatment for patients in clinical diagnosis.",37264263,,10.1007/s10142-023-01113-0,2,Functional & integrative genomics,100939343,3.674,0.5288832187652588,0.3979933110367893,0.21070234113712374,0.4390690616939379
Deciphering the tumor-suppressive role of PSMB9 in melanoma through multi-omics and single-cell transcriptome analyses,"Skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) poses a significant challenge in skin cancers. Recent immunotherapy breakthroughs have revolutionized melanoma treamtment, yet tumor heterogeneity persists as an obstacle. Epigenetic modifications orchestrated by DNA methylation contributed to tumorigenesis, thus potentially unveiling melanoma prognosis. Here, we identified an interferon-gamma (IFN-g) sensitive subtype, which possesses favorable outcomes, robust infiltration CD8+T cells, and IFN-g score in bulk RNA-seq profile. Subsequently, we established an IFN-g sensitivity signature based on machine learning. We validated that PSMB9 is strongly correlated with immunotherapy response in both methylation and expression cohorts in this 10-probe signature. We assumed that PSMB9 acts as a putative melanoma suppressor, for its activation of CD8+T cell; capacity to modulate IFN-Î³ secretion; and dynamics altering IFN-g receptors in bulk tissue. We performed single-cell RNA-seq on immunotherapy patients' tissue to uncover the nuanced role of PSMB9 in activating CD8T + cells, enhancing IFN-g, and influencing malignant cells receptors and transcriptional factors. Overexpress PSMB9 in two SKCM cell lines to mimic the hypomethylated state to approve our conjecture. Strong cell proliferation and migration inhibition were detected on both cells, indicating that PSMB9 is present in tumor cells and that high expression is detrimental to tumor growth and migration. Overall, comprehensive integrated analysis shows that PSMB9 emerges as a vital prognostic marker, acting predictive potential regarding immunotherapy in melanoma. This evidence not only reveals the multifaceted impact of PSMB9 on both malignant and immune cells but also serves as a prospective target for undergoing immunotherapeutic strategies in the future.",37944578,,10.1016/j.canlet.2023.216466,0,Cancer letters,7600053,9.756,0.5275599360466003,0.13377926421404682,0.782608695652174,0.49981355360120433
Altered lipid metabolism marks glioblastoma stem and non-stem cells in separate tumor niches,"Glioblastoma (GBM) displays marked cellular and metabolic heterogeneity that varies among cellular microenvironments within a tumor. Metabolic targeting has long been advocated as a therapy against many tumors including GBM, but how lipid metabolism is altered to suit different microenvironmental conditions and whether cancer stem cells (CSCs) have altered lipid metabolism are outstanding questions in the field. We interrogated gene expression in separate microenvironments of GBM organoid models that mimic the transition between nutrient-rich and nutrient-poor pseudopalisading/perinecrotic tumor zones using spatial-capture RNA-sequencing. We revealed a striking difference in lipid processing gene expression and total lipid content between diverse cell populations from the same patient, with lipid enrichment in hypoxic organoid cores and also in perinecrotic and pseudopalisading regions of primary patient tumors. This was accompanied by regionally restricted upregulation of hypoxia-inducible lipid droplet-associated (HILPDA) gene expression in organoid cores and pseudopalisading regions of clinical GBM specimens, but not lower-grade brain tumors. CSCs have low lipid droplet accumulation compared to non-CSCs in organoid models and xenograft tumors, and prospectively sorted lipid-low GBM cells are functionally enriched for stem cell activity. Targeted lipidomic analysis of multiple patient-derived models revealed a significant shift in lipid metabolism between GBM CSCs and non-CSCs, suggesting that lipid levels may not be simply a product of the microenvironment but also may be a reflection of cellular state. CSCs had decreased levels of major classes of neutral lipids compared to non-CSCs, but had significantly increased polyunsaturated fatty acid production due to high fatty acid desaturase (FADS1/2) expression which was essential to maintain CSC viability and self-renewal. Our data demonstrate spatially and hierarchically distinct lipid metabolism phenotypes occur clinically in the majority of patients, can be recapitulated in laboratory models, and may represent therapeutic targets for GBM.",34059134,PMC8166002,10.1186/s40478-021-01205-7,43,Acta neuropathologica communications,101610673,7.578,0.527438223361969,0.903010033444816,0.5719063545150501,0.6114462116091546
Phenotypic Mapping of Pathologic Cross-Talk between Glioblastoma and Innate Immune Cells by Synthetic Genetic Tracing,"Glioblastoma is a lethal brain tumor that exhibits heterogeneity and resistance to therapy. Our understanding of tumor homeostasis is limited by a lack of genetic tools to selectively identify tumor states and fate transitions. Here, we use glioblastoma subtype signatures to construct synthetic genetic tracing cassettes and investigate tumor heterogeneity at cellular and molecular levels,in vitroandin vivo. Through synthetic locus control regions, we demonstrate that proneural glioblastoma is a hardwired identity, whereas mesenchymal glioblastoma is an adaptive and metastable cell state driven by proinflammatory and differentiation cues and DNA damage, but not hypoxia. Importantly, we discovered that innate immune cells divert glioblastoma cells to a proneural-to-mesenchymal transition that confers therapeutic resistance. Our synthetic genetic tracing methodology is simple, scalable, and widely applicable to study homeostasis in development and diseases. In glioblastoma, the method causally links distinct (micro)environmental, genetic, and pharmacologic perturbations and mesenchymal commitment. SIGNIFICANCE: Glioblastoma is heterogeneous and incurable. Here, we designed synthetic reporters to reflect the transcriptional output of tumor cell states and signaling pathways' activity. This method is generally applicable to study homeostasis in normal tissues and diseases. In glioblastoma, synthetic genetic tracing causally connects cellular and molecular heterogeneity to therapeutic responses.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 521.",33361384,PMC7611210,10.1158/2159-8290.CD-20-0219,30,Cancer discovery,101561693,38.272,0.5261145234107971,0.8494983277591973,0.9832775919732442,0.6822238979929665
Intra-tumor heterogeneity and prognostic risk signature for hepatocellular carcinoma based on single-cell analysis,"Intra-tumor heterogeneity poses a serious challenge in the treatment of cancer, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Recent developments in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) make it possible to examine the heterogeneity of tumor cells. The Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database was retrieved to obtain scRNA-seq data of 13 HCC and 8 para cancer samples, and the cells were clustered using FindNeighbors and FindClusters functions. Cell subsets were defined using the ""Enricher"" function of the clusterProfiler package. Monocle was used to predict cell developmental trajectory. The LIMMA package included in the R program was utilized to detect differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between HCC and paracancerous tissues. Univariate Cox analysis and Least Absolute and Selection Operator (Lasso) Cox regression analysis were conducted to establish a risk assessment model. Thirteen cell subpopulations were identified from the sequencing data of 64,634 single cells. Four cell subgroups (dendritic cells, hepatocytes, liver bud hepatic cells, and liver progenitor cells) in tumor tissues were highly enriched. Between HCC and para cancer tissues, 3024 DEGs were identified, and 641 were specific markers of four cell subgroups. To develop a prognostic risk model, 9 genes among the 641 genes were selected. In the training and validation sets, the model demonstrated a higher 5-year AUC and independently served as a prognostic marker as confirmed by multivariate and univariate Cox analyses. This study revealed the characteristics of different cell subpopulations of immune cells and tumor cells from the HCC microenvironment. We established a novel nine-gene prognostic model to determine the death risk of HCC patients.

Integrated analysis of single-cell RNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq unravels the heterogeneity of cancer-associated fibroblasts in TNBC,"Background:The treatment of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is one of the main focuses and key difficulties because of its heterogeneity, and the source of this heterogeneity is unclear.Methods:Single-cell RNA (scRNA) and transcriptomics data of TNBC and normal breast samples were retrieved from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and TCGA-BRCA database. These cells were clustered using the t-SNE and UMAP method, and the marker genes for each cluster were found. We annotated the clusters using the published literature, CellMarker database and ""SingleR"" R package.Results:A total of 1535 cells and 21785 genes from 6 TNBC patients and 2068 cells and 15868 genes from 3 normal breast tissues were used for downstream analyses. The scRNA data were divided into 14 clusters labeled into 8 cell types, including epithelial cells, immunocytes, CAFs/fibroblasts and etc. In the TNBC samples, CAFs were divided into three clusters and labelled as prCAFs, myCAFs and emCAFs, and the marker genes were DCN, FAP and RGS5, respectively. The prCAF subgroup is functionally characterized by promoting proliferation and multi drug resistance; myCAF subgroup is involved in constituting the extracellular matrix and collagen production, matrix composition and collagen production, and the emCAF functionally characterized by energy metabolism.Conclusions:TNBC has inter- and intra-tumor heterogeneity, and CAF is one of the sources of this heterogeneity.

Epigenetic Underpinnings of Inflammation: A Key to Unlock the Tumor Microenvironment in Glioblastoma,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common malignant brain tumor in adults, and immunotherapies and genetic therapies for GBM have evolved dramatically over the past decade, but GBM therapy is still facing a dilemma due to the high recurrence rate. The inflammatory microenvironment is a general signature of tumors that accelerates epigenetic changes in GBM and helps tumors avoid immunological surveillance. GBM tumor cells and glioma-associated microglia/macrophages are the primary contributors to the inflammatory condition, meanwhile the modification of epigenetic events including DNA methylation, non-coding RNAs, and histone methylation and deacetylases involved in this pathological process of GBM, finally result in exacerbating the proliferation, invasion, and migration of GBM. On the other hand, histone deacetylase inhibitors, DNA methyltransferases inhibitors, and RNA interference could reverse the inflammatory landscapes and inhibit GBM growth and invasion. Here, we systematically review the inflammatory-associated epigenetic changes and regulations in the microenvironment of GBM, aiming to provide a comprehensive epigenetic profile underlying the recognition of inflammation in GBM.",35572545,PMC9100418,10.3389/fimmu.2022.869307,12,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,8.786,0.5192470550537109,0.7190635451505016,0.745819397993311,0.6045248216609892
Identification of INSRR as an immune-related gene in the tumor microenvironment of glioblastoma by integrated bioinformatics analysis,"Gliomas are the most common malignant tumors in the central nervous system. The tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a crucial role in tumor proliferation, invasion, angiogenesis, and immune escape. However, little is known about TME in gliomas. The purpose of this study was to explore the biomarkers associated with TME in glioblastoma (GBM) to predict immunotherapy effectiveness and prognosis in patients. Based on RNA-seq transcriptome data and clinical features of 1222 samples (113 normal samples and 1109 tumor samples) in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, the ImmuneScore, StromalScore, and ESTIMATEScore were calculated by ESTIMATE algorithm. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially mutated genes (DMGs) were determined in the TCGA GBM cohort. Furthermore, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used to investigate the enrichment pathways of INSRR genes with abnormal expression. The proportion of tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TIICs) was evaluated by CIBERSORT. Frequent mutations of TP53, EGFR, and PTEN occurred in high and low immune scores. The cross-analysis of DEGs and DMGs revealed that INSRR was an immune-related biomarker in the TCGA GBM cohort. According to GSEA, the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway with INSRR abnormal expression were IgA-produced intestinal immune network and Alzheimer's disease, oxidative phosphorylation, and Parkinson's disease, respectively. Additionally, INSRR expression was correlated with dendritic cells activated, dendritic cells resting, T cells CD8, and T cell gamma delta. INSRR is associated with the immune microenvironment in GBM and is used as a biomarker to predict immune invasion.",37099121,,10.1007/s12032-023-02023-8,0,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",9435512,3.738,0.5189728140830994,0.14381270903010032,0.22073578595317725,0.38429338744651514
Untargeted Metabolomic Characterization of Glioblastoma Intra-Tumor Heterogeneity Using OrbiSIMS,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is an incurable brain cancer with a median survival of less than two years from diagnosis. The standard treatment of GBM is multimodality therapy comprising surgical resection, radiation, and chemotherapy. However, prognosis remains poor, and there is an urgent need for effective anticancer drugs. Since different regions of a single GBM contain multiple cancer subpopulations (""intra-tumor heterogeneity""), this likely accounts for therapy failure as certain cancer cells can escape from immune surveillance and therapeutic threats. Here, we present metabolomic data generated using the Orbitrap secondary ion mass spectrometry (OrbiSIMS) technique to investigate brain tumor metabolism within its highly heterogeneous tumor microenvironment. Our results demonstrate that an OrbiSIMS-based untargeted metabolomics method was able to discriminate morphologically distinct regions (viable, necrotic, and non-cancerous) within single tumors from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue archives. Specifically, cancer cells from necrotic regions were separated from viable GBM cells based on a set of metabolites including cytosine, phosphate, purine, xanthine, and 8-hydroxy-7-methylguanine. Moreover, we mapped ubiquitous metabolites across necrotic and viable regions into metabolic pathways, which allowed for the discovery of tryptophan metabolism that was likely essential for GBM cellular survival. In summary, this study first demonstrated the capability of OrbiSIMS for in situ investigation of GBM intra-tumor heterogeneity, and the acquired information can potentially help improve our understanding of cancer metabolism and develop new therapies that can effectively target multiple subpopulations within a tumor.",36995369,PMC10100400,10.1021/acs.analchem.2c05807,3,Analytical chemistry,0370536,0.0,0.517327070236206,0.47157190635451507,0.08361204013377926,0.4214330314393825
Revealing Genetic Dynamics: scRNA-seq Unravels Modifications in Human PDL Cells across In Vivo and In Vitro Environments,"The periodontal ligament (PDL) is a highly specialized fibrous tissue comprising heterogeneous cell populations of an intricate nature. These complexities, along with challenges due to cell culture, impede a comprehensive understanding of periodontal pathophysiology. This study aims to address this gap, employing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology to analyze the genetic intricacies of PDL both in vivo and in vitro. Primary human PDL samples (n= 7) were split for direct in vivo analysis and cell culture under serum-containing and serum-free conditions. Cell hashing and sorting, scRNA-seq library preparation using the 10x Genomics protocol, and Illumina sequencing were conducted. Primary analysis was performed using Cellranger, with downstream analysis via the R packages Seurat and SCORPIUS. Seven distinct PDL cell clusters were identified comprising different cellular subsets, each characterized by unique genetic profiles, with some showing donor-specific patterns in representation and distribution. Formation of these cellular clusters was influenced by culture conditions, particularly serum presence. Furthermore, certain cell populations were found to be inherent to the PDL tissue, while others exhibited variability across donors. This study elucidates specific genes and cell clusters within the PDL, revealing both inherent and context-driven subpopulations. The impact of culture conditions-notably the presence of serum-on cell cluster formation highlights the critical need for refining culture protocols, as comprehending these influences can drive the creation of superior culture systems vital for advancing research in PDL biology and regenerative therapies. These discoveries not only deepen our comprehension of PDL biology but also open avenues for future investigations into uncovering underlying mechanisms.",38731950,PMC11083143,10.3390/ijms25094731,0,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,6.208,0.5161533951759338,0.14715719063545152,0.44481605351170567,0.4280866859349917
MSH6Aggravates the Hypoxic Microenvironment via Regulating HIF1A to Promote the Metastasis of Glioblastoma Multiforme,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is characterized by diffuse infiltration of the brain, active regional recurrence, low cure proportion, and limited chemotherapy efficiency.MutS homolog 6 (MSH6)is a component of the mismatch repair system related to the oncogenesis, tumor evolution, and recurrence of GBM. The impact ofMSH6upregulation on the tumor microenvironment (TME) of GBM and the feasibility ofMSH6as a potential target to improve the prognosis remain unknown. The expression ofMSH6at mRNA level indicated thatMSH6expressed higher in GBM tissues than that in normal ones. The transwell assay and expression levels of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) suggested that the capability of invasion and migration in U251-MSH6 was more stubborn. The intracranial tumor model was established with nude mice to further explorein vivo. The time-weight curve, overall survival, tumor volumes, expression levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in tissue, and hematoxylin and eosin staining all indicated thatMSH6had a positive effect on metastasis. The expression levels of related proteins suggested that the hypoxia TME induced byMSH6may promote metastasis via epithelial to mesenchymal transition, stemness, and angiogenesis progress.MSH6is an overexpressed oncogene in human GBM tissues, which accelerated metastasis by regulating hypoxia inducible factor-1A (HIF1A) to form a hypoxic TME in GBM. TheMSH6was a vital marker of GBM, making it a promising therapeutic target.",33181035,,10.1089/dna.2020.5442,2,DNA and cell biology,9004522,3.55,0.515231192111969,0.4013377926421405,0.1939799331103679,0.42820226041768306

Immune-related lncRNAs signature and radiomics signature predict the prognosis and immune microenvironment of glioblastoma multiforme,"Background:Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common primary malignant brain tumor in adults. This study aimed to construct immune-related long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) signature and radiomics signature to probe the prognosis and immune infiltration of GBM patients.Methods:We downloaded GBM RNA-seq data and clinical information from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project database, and MRI data were obtained from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA). Then, we conducted a cox regression analysis to establish the immune-related lncRNAs signature and radiomics signature. Afterward, we employed a gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to explore the biological processes and pathways. Besides, we used CIBERSORT to estimate the abundance of tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TIICs). Furthermore, we investigated the relationship between the immune-related lncRNAs signature, radiomics signature and immune checkpoint genes. Finally, we constructed a multifactors prognostic model and compared it with the clinical prognostic model.Results:We identified four immune-related lncRNAs and two radiomics features, which show the ability to stratify patients into high-risk and low-risk groups with significantly different survival rates. The risk score curves and Kaplan-Meier curves confirmed that the immune-related lncRNAs signature and radiomics signature were a novel independent prognostic factor in GBM patients. The GSEA suggested that the immune-related lncRNAs signature were involved in L1 cell adhesion molecular (L1CAM) interactions and the radiomics signature were involved signaling by Robo receptors. Besides, the two signatures was associated with the infiltration of immune cells. Furthermore, they were linked with the expression of critical immune genes and could predict immunotherapy's clinical response. Finally, the area under the curve (AUC) (0.890,0.887) and C-index (0.737,0.817) of the multifactors prognostic model were greater than those of the clinical prognostic model in both the training and validation sets, indicated significantly improved discrimination.Conclusions:We identified the immune-related lncRNAs signature and tradiomics signature that can predict the outcomes, immune cell infiltration, and immunotherapy response in patients with GBM.",38279111,PMC10821572,10.1186/s12967-023-04823-y,0,Journal of translational medicine,101190741,8.44,0.5147356986999512,0.1505016722408027,0.6187290969899666,0.4626875730661245
Multiscale modeling of glioma pseudopalisades: contributions from the tumor microenvironment,"Gliomas are primary brain tumors with a high invasive potential and infiltrative spread. Among them, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) exhibits microvascular hyperplasia and pronounced necrosis triggered by hypoxia. Histological samples showing garland-like hypercellular structures (so-called pseudopalisades) centered around the occlusion site of a capillary are typical for GBM and hint on poor prognosis of patient survival. We propose a multiscale modeling approach in the kinetic theory of active particles framework and deduce by an upscaling process a reaction-diffusion model with repellent pH-taxis. We prove existence of a unique global bounded classical solution for a version of the obtained macroscopic system and investigate the asymptotic behavior of the solution. Moreover, we study two different types of scaling and compare the behavior of the obtained macroscopic PDEs by way of simulations. These show that patterns (not necessarily of Turing type), including pseudopalisades, can be formed for some parameter ranges, in accordance with the tumor grade. This is true when the PDEs are obtained via parabolic scaling (undirected tissue), while no such patterns are observed for the PDEs arising by a hyperbolic limit (directed tissue). This suggests that brain tissue might be undirected - at least as far as glioma migration is concerned. We also investigate two different ways of including cell level descriptions of response to hypoxia and the way they are related .",33846838,PMC8041715,10.1007/s00285-021-01599-x,1,Journal of mathematical biology,7502105,2.164,0.514514684677124,0.3177257525083612,0.13377926421404682,0.399009814150756
Cytokine CCL5 and receptor CCR5 axis in glioblastoma multiforme,"Background Glioblastoma is the most frequent and aggressive brain tumour in humans with median survival from 12 to 15 months after the diagnosis. This is mostly due to therapy resistant glioblastoma stem cells in addition to intertumour heterogeneity that is due to infiltration of a plethora of host cells. Besides endothelial cells, mesenchymal stem cells and their differentiated progenies, immune cells of various differentiation states, including monocytes, comprise resident, brain tumour microenvironment. There are compelling evidence for CCL5/CCR5 in the invasive and metastatic behaviour of many cancer types. CCR5, a G-protein coupled receptor, known to function as an essential co-receptor for HIV entry, is now known to participate in driving tumour heterogeneity, the formation of cancer stem cells and the promotion of cancer invasion and metastasis. Clinical trials have recently opened targeting CCR5 using a humanized monoclonal antibody (leronlimab) for metastatic triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) or a small molecule inhibitor (maraviroc) for metastatic colon cancer. There are important CCL5 and CCR5 structure and signalling mechanisms in glioblastoma. In addition, the CCL5/CCR5 axis directs infiltration and interactions with monocytes/macrophages and mesenchymal stem cells, comprising glioblastoma stem cell niches. Conclusions CCR5 is highly expressed in glioblastoma and is associated with poor prognosis of patients. CCL5/CCR5 is suggested to be an excellent new target for glioblastoma therapy. The molecular mechanisms, by which chemoattractant and receptor respond within the complex tissue microenvironment to promote cancer stem cells and tumour heterogeneity, should be considered in forthcoming studies.",31747383,PMC6884928,10.2478/raon-2019-0057,37,Radiology and oncology,9317213,4.214,0.5141944885253906,0.8862876254180602,0.2709030100334448,0.5399548202055354
DNA methylation heterogeneity attributable to a complex tumor immune microenvironment prompts prognostic risk in glioma,"Gliomas are malignant tumours of the human nervous system with different World Health Organization (WHO) classifications, glioblastoma (GBM) with higher grade and are more malignant than lower-grade glioma (LGG). To dissect how the DNA methylation heterogeneity in gliomas is influenced by the complex cellular composition of the tumour immune microenvironment, we first compared the DNA methylation profiles of purified human immune cells and bulk glioma tissue, stratifying three tumour immune microenvironmental subtypes for GBM and LGG samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We found that more intermediate methylation sites were enriched in glioma tumour tissues, and used the Proportion of sites with Intermediate Methylation (PIM) to compare intertumoral DNA methylation heterogeneity. A larger PIM score reflected stronger DNA methylation heterogeneity. Enhanced DNA methylation heterogeneity was associated with stronger immune cell infiltration, better survival rates, and slower tumour progression in glioma patients. We then created a Cell-type-associated DNA Methylation Heterogeneity Contribution (CMHC) score to explore the impact of different immune cell types on heterogeneous CpG site (CpGct) in glioma tissues. We identified eight prognosis-relatedCpGctto construct a risk score: the Cell-type-associated DNA Methylation Heterogeneity Risk (CMHR) score. CMHR was positively correlated with cytotoxic T-lymphocyte infiltration (CTL), and showed better predictive performance for IDH status (AUC = 0.96) and glioma histological phenotype (AUC = 0.81). Furthermore, DNA methylation alterations of eightCpGctmight be related to drug treatments of gliomas. In conclusion, we indicated that DNA methylation heterogeneity is associated with a complex tumour immune microenvironment, glioma phenotype, and patient's prognosis.",38439715,PMC10936651,10.1080/15592294.2024.2318506,1,Epigenetics,101265293,4.861,0.5128984451293945,0.3210702341137124,0.33444816053511706,0.4388427460074026
Glioblastoma cell fate is differentially regulated by the microenvironments of the tumor bulk and infiltrative margin,"Glioblastoma (GBM) recurrence originates from invasive margin cells that escape surgical debulking, but to what extent these cells resemble their bulk counterparts remains unclear. Here, we generated three immunocompetent somatic GBM mouse models, driven by subtype-associated mutations, to compare matched bulk and margin cells. We find that, regardless of mutations, tumors converge on common sets of neural-like cellular states. However, bulk and margin have distinct biology. Injury-like programs associated with immune infiltration dominate in the bulk, leading to the generation of lowly proliferative injured neural progenitor-like cells (iNPCs). iNPCs account for a significant proportion of dormant GBM cells and are induced by interferon signaling within T cell niches. In contrast, developmental-like trajectories are favored within the immune-cold margin microenvironment resulting in differentiation toward invasive astrocyte-like cells. These findings suggest that the regional tumor microenvironment dominantly controls GBM cell fate and biological vulnerabilities identified in the bulk may not extend to the margin residuum.",37149862,,10.1016/j.celrep.2023.112472,10,Cell reports,101573691,9.995,0.5127382874488831,0.6989966555183946,0.7926421404682275,0.6059707316666543
"The Na, K-ATPase Î²-Subunit Isoforms Expression in Glioblastoma Multiforme: Moonlighting Roles","Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common form of malignant glioma. Recent studies point out that gliomas exploit ion channels and transporters, including Na, K-ATPase, to sustain their singular growth and invasion as they invade the brain parenchyma. Moreover, the different isoforms of the Î²-subunit of Na, K-ATPase have been implicated in regulating cellular dynamics, particularly during cancer progression. The aim of this study was to determine the Na, K-ATPase Î² subunit isoform subcellular expression patterns in all cell types responsible for microenvironment heterogeneity of GBM using immunohistochemical analysis. All three isoforms, Î²1, Î²2/AMOG (Adhesion Molecule On Glia) and Î²3, were found to be expressed in GBM samples. Generally, Î²1 isoform was not expressed by astrocytes, in both primary and secondary GBM, although other cell types (endothelial cells, pericytes, telocytes, macrophages) did express this isoform. Î²2/AMOG and Î²3 positive expression was observed in the cytoplasm, membrane and nuclear envelope of astrocytes and GFAP (Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein) negative cells. Interestingly, differences in isoforms expression have been observed between primary and secondary GBM: in secondary GBM, Î²2 isoform expression in astrocytes was lower than that observed in primary GBM, while the expression of the Î²3 subunit was more intense. These changes in Î² subunit isoforms expression in GBM could be related to a different ionic handling, to a different relationship between astrocyte and neuron (Î²2/AMOG) and to changes in the moonlighting roles of Na, K-ATPase Î² subunits as adaptor proteins and transcription factors.",29117147,PMC5713338,10.3390/ijms18112369,9,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,6.208,0.5123876333236694,0.6722408026755853,0.44816053511705684,0.5315128475527301
Development of a prognostic model for glioblastoma multiforme based on the expression levels of efferocytosis-related genes,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is one of the most common and aggressive brain tumors. The microenvironment of GBM is characterized by its highly immunosuppressive nature with infiltration of immunosuppressive cells and the expression levels of cytokines. Efferocytosis is a biological process in which phagocytes remove apoptotic cells and vesicles from tissues. Efferocytosis plays a noticeable function in the formation of immunosuppressive environment. This study aimed to develop an efferocytosis-related prognostic model for GBM. The bioinformatic methods were utilized to analyze the transcriptomic data of GBM and normal samples. Clinical and RNA-seq data were sourced from TCGA database comprising 167 tumor samples and 5 normal samples, and 167 tumor samples for which survival information was available. Transcriptomic data of 1034 normal samples were collected from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) database as a control sample supplement to the TCGA database. In the end, 167 tumor samples and 1039 normal samples were obtained for transcriptome analysis. Efferocytosis-related differentially expressed genes (ERDEGs) were obtained by intersecting 7487 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between GBM and normal samples along with 1189 hub genes. Functional enrichment analyses revealed that ERDEGs were mainly involved in cytokine-mediated immune responses. Moreover, 9 prognosis-related genes (PRGs) were identified by the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analysis, and a prognostic model was therefore developed. The nomogram combining age and risk score could effectively predict GBM patients' prognosis. GBM patients in the high-risk group had higher immune infiltration, invasion, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, angiogenesis scores and poorer tumor purity. In addition, the high-risk group exhibited higher half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values for temozolomide, carmustine, and vincristine. Expression analysis indicated that PRGs were overexpressed in GBM cells. PDIA4 knockdown reduced efferocytosisin vitro. In summary, the proposed prognostic model for GBM based on efferocytosis-related genes exhibited a robust performance.",38159261,PMC10781462,10.18632/aging.205422,0,Aging,101508617,5.955,0.51205974817276,0.15384615384615385,0.411371237458194,0.42027932716452554
Scaling up single-cell RNA-seq data analysis with CellBridge workflow,"Summary:Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revolutionized the study of gene expression at the individual cell level, unraveling unprecedented insights into cellular heterogeneity.

Integration Analysis of Single-Cell Multi-Omics Reveals Prostate Cancer Heterogeneity,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is an extensive heterogeneous disease with a complex cellular ecosystem in the tumor microenvironment (TME). However, the manner in which heterogeneity is shaped by tumors and stromal cells, or vice versa, remains poorly understood. In this study, single-cell RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, and bulk ATAC-sequence are integrated from a series of patients with PCa and healthy controls. A stemness subset of club cells marked with SOX9highARlowexpression is identified, which is markedly enriched after neoadjuvant androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT). Furthermore, a subset of CD8+CXCR6+T cells that function as effector T cells is markedly reduced in patients with malignant PCa. For spatial transcriptome analysis, machine learning and computational intelligence are comprehensively utilized to identify the cellular diversity of prostate cancer cells and cell-cell communication in situ. Macrophage and neutrophil state transitions along the trajectory of cancer progression are also examined. Finally, the immunosuppressive microenvironment in advanced PCa is found to be associated with the infiltration of regulatory T cells (Tregs), potentially induced by an FAP+fibroblast subset. In summary, the cellular heterogeneity is delineated in the stage-specific PCa microenvironment at single-cell resolution, uncovering their reciprocal crosstalk with disease progression, which can be helpful in promoting PCa diagnosis and therapy.",38483933,PMC11095148,10.1002/advs.202305724,0,"Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)",101664569,17.521,0.5113201141357422,0.1605351170568562,0.919732441471572,0.5228455801871309
Exploring the role of m6A methylation regulators in glioblastoma multiforme and their impact on the tumor immune microenvironment,"Although the role of N6-Methyladenosine (m6A) methylation factors has been established in multiple cancer types, its involvement in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) remains limited. This study aims to explore the involvement of m6A regulators in GBM and examine their association with the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). A comprehensive set of 24 candidate m6A RNA regulators was procured. Consensus clustering was performed based on these regulators to identify distinct GBM clusters. PD-L1 and PD-1 levels, immune cell infiltration, and immune scores were evaluated between two clusters. Prognostic signatures and correlation analysis with TIME were analyzed using Lasso and Spearman's analysis. GBM tissue was collected to verify the correlations. Eighteen m6A regulators (WTAP, YTHDF2, HNRNPC, CAPRIN1, YTHDF3, METTL14, GNL3, ZCCHC4, HNRNPD, YTHDF1, RBM15, PCIF1, RBM27, KIAA1429, MSI2, FTO, ALKBH5, and METTL3), PD-L1, and PD-1 were significantly upregulated in GBM tissue. These regulators were divided into two distinct molecular subtypes (clusters 1 and 2). Cluster 2 exhibited a significant increase in immune score, monocytes, M1 macrophages, activated mast cells, and eosinophils. HNRNPC, YWHAG, and ALKBH5 were significantly associated with TIME and positively correlated with PD-L1. Immune cell invasiveness profiles dynamically changed with copy number changes of these three m6A regulators. Finally, YWHAG and ALKBH5 were found to be independent prognostic indicators of GBM through risk analysis and were experimentally verified with clinical samples. YWHAG and ALKBH5 may be used as prognostic markers for patients with GBM. m6A methylation regulators may play an important role in regulating PD-L1/PD-1 expression and immune infiltration, thus having a significant impact on GBM TIME.",37606566,,10.1096/fj.202301343,6,FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for,8804484,5.834,0.5104736089706421,0.5819397993311036,0.39464882943143814,0.5016018911348936
Heterogeneity of cancer-associated fibroblasts: Opportunities for precision medicine,"Despite marked development in cancer therapies during recent decades, the prognosis for advanced cancer remains poor. The conventional tumor-cell-centric view of cancer can only explain part of cancer progression, and thus a thorough understanding of the tumor microenvironment (TME) is crucial. Among cells within the TME, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are attracting attention as a target for cancer therapy. However, CAFs present a heterogeneous population of cells and more detailed classification of CAFs and investigation of functions of each subset is needed to develop novel CAF-targeted therapies. In this context, application of newly developed approaches to single-cell analysis has already made an impact on our understanding of the heterogeneity of CAFs. Here, we review the recent literature on CAF heterogeneity and function, and discuss the possibility of novel therapies targeting CAF subsets.",32573845,PMC7419037,10.1111/cas.14537,82,Cancer science,101168776,6.518,0.5104050040245056,0.959866220735786,0.4782608695652174,0.5938684204749041
Combining Global-Constrained Concept Factorization and a Regularized Gaussian Graphical Model for Clustering Single-Cell RNA-seq Data,"Single-cell RNA sequencing technology is one of the most cost-effective ways to uncover transcriptomic heterogeneity. With the rapid rise of this technology, enormous amounts of scRNA-seq data have been produced. Due to the high dimensionality, noise, sparsity and missing features of the available scRNA-seq data, accurately clustering the scRNA-seq data for downstream analysis is a significant challenge. Many computational methods have been designed to address this issue; nevertheless, the efficacy of the available methods is still inadequate. In addition, most similarity-based methods require a number of clusters as input, which is difficult to achieve in real applications. In this study, we developed a novel computational method for clustering scRNA-seq data by considering both global and local information, named GCFG. This method characterizes the global properties of data by applying concept factorization, and the regularized Gaussian graphical model is utilized to evaluate the local embedding relationship of data. To learn the cell-cell similarity matrix, we integrated the two components, and an iterative optimization algorithm was developed. The categorization of single cells is obtained by applying Louvain, a modularity-based community discovery algorithm, to the similarity matrix. The behavior of the GCFG approach is assessed on 14 real scRNA-seq datasets in terms of ACC and ARI, and comparison results with 17 other competitive methods suggest that GCFG is effective and robust.",37815679,,10.1007/s12539-023-00587-7,0,"Interdisciplinary sciences, computational life sciences",101515919,3.492,0.5100999474525452,0.16387959866220736,0.19063545150501673,0.37696297850497196
Chemoresistance caused by the microenvironment of glioblastoma and the corresponding solutions,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and aggressive primary human brain tumor. Although comprehensive therapies combining radiotherapy and chemotherapy after surgery can prolong survival, the prognosis is still poor with a median survival of only 14.6 months. Chemoresistance is one of the major causes of relapse as well as poor survival in glioma patients. Therefore, novel strategies to overcome chemoresistance are desperately needed for improved treatment of human GBM. Recent studies have demonstrated that the tumor microenvironment plays a critical role in the chemoresistance of various tumor types, which makes it a suitable target in anti-cancer therapies, as well as a valuable biomarker for prognostic purposes. This review focuses on chemoresistance in GBM induced by stromal cells, including the endothelium of blood vessels, astrocytes, and myeloid cells, as well as non-cellular factors in the tumor microenvironment. Corresponding therapies are discussed, including progressive strategies involving 3-dimensional models integrating engineering as well as biological advances.",30391707,,10.1016/j.biopha.2018.10.063,27,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,8213295,7.419,0.5097948908805847,0.8260869565217391,0.5351170568561873,0.5781177372039361
Single-Cell RNAseq Clustering,"Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) allows the creation of large collections of individual cells transcriptome. Unsupervised clustering is an essential element for the analysis of these data, and it represents the initial step for the identification of different cell types to investigate the cell subpopulation organization of a sample. In this chapter, we describe how to approach the clustering of single-cell RNAseq transcriptomics data using various clustering tools, and we provide some information on the limitations affecting the clustering procedure.",36495454,,10.1007/978-1-0716-2756-3_12,0,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,0.0,0.509741485118866,0.16722408026755853,0.08695652173913043,0.35668101147265735
Pericytes Are Immunoregulatory Cells in Glioma Genesis and Progression,"Vascular co-option is a consequence of the direct interaction between perivascular cells, known as pericytes (PCs), and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cells (GBMcs). This process is essential for inducing changes in the pericytes' anti-tumoral and immunoreactive phenotypes. Starting from the initial stages of carcinogenesis in GBM, PCs conditioned by GBMcs undergo proliferation, acquire a pro-tumoral and immunosuppressive phenotype by expressing and secreting immunosuppressive molecules, and significantly hinder the activation of T cells, thereby facilitating tumor growth. Inhibiting the pericyte (PC) conditioning mechanisms in the GBM tumor microenvironment (TME) results in immunological activation and tumor disappearance. This underscores the pivotal role of PCs as a key cell in the TME, responsible for tumor-induced immunosuppression and enabling GBM cells to evade the immune system. Other cells within the TME, such as tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and microglia, have also been identified as contributors to this immunomodulation. In this paper, we will review the role of these three cell types in the immunosuppressive properties of the TME. Our conclusion is that the cellular heterogeneity of immunocompetent cells within the TME may lead to the misinterpretation of cellular lineage identification due to different reactive stages and the identification of PCs as TAMs. Consequently, novel therapies could be developed to disrupt GBM-PC interactions and/or PC conditioning through vascular co-option, thereby exposing GBMcs to the immune system.",38791110,PMC11120873,10.3390/ijms25105072,0,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,6.208,0.509482204914093,0.1705685618729097,0.451505016722408,0.43010403866751934
Glutamine Metabolism Heterogeneity in Glioblastoma Unveils an Innovative Combination Therapy Strategy,"Treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) remains challenging. Unraveling the orchestration of glutamine metabolism may provide a novel viewpoint on GBM therapy. The study presented a full and comprehensive comprehending of the glutamine metabolism atlas and heterogeneity in GBM for facilitating the development of a more effective therapeutic choice. Transcriptome data from large GBM cohorts were integrated in this study. A glutamine metabolism-based classification was established through consensus clustering approach, and a classifier by LASSO analysis was defined for differentiating the classification. Prognosis, signaling pathway activity, tumor microenvironment, and responses to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) and small molecular drugs were characterized in each cluster. A combinational therapy of glutaminase inhibitor CB839 with dihydroartemisinin (DHA) was proposed, and the influence on glutamine metabolism, apoptosis, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and migration was measured in U251 and U373 cells. We discovered that GBM presented heterogeneous glutamine metabolism-based clusters, with unique survival outcomes, activity of signaling pathways, tumor microenvironment, and responses to ICB and small molecular compounds. In addition, the classifier could accurately differentiate the two clusters. Strikingly, the combinational therapy of CB839 with DHA synergistically attenuated glutamine metabolism, triggered apoptosis and ROS accumulation, and impaired migrative capacity in GBM cells, demonstrating the excellent preclinical efficacy. Altogether, our findings unveil the glutamine metabolism heterogeneity in GBM and propose an innovative combination therapy of CB839 with DHA for this malignant disease.",38724832,,10.1007/s12031-024-02201-x,0,Journal of molecular neuroscience : MN,9002991,2.866,0.5090855956077576,0.17391304347826086,0.14715719063545152,0.36966540418739696
Single-cell transcriptome analysis upon ECM-remodeling meningioma cells,"Meningiomas are the most common tumours that primarily arise in the central nervous system, but their intratumoural heterogeneity has not yet been thoroughly studied. We aimed to investigate the transcriptome characteristics and biological properties of ECM-remodeling meningioma cells. Single-cell RNA sequencing (ScRNA-seq) data from meningioma samples were acquired and used for analyses. We conducted comprehensive bioinformatics analyses, including screening for differentially expressed genes (DEGs), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) signaling pathway and Gene Ontology (GO) term enrichment analyses, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis, and copy number variation (CNV) analysis on single-cell sequencing data from meningiomas. Eighteen cell types, including six meningioma subtypes, were identified in the data. ECM-remodeling meningioma cells (MGCs) were mainly distributed in brain-tumour interface tissues. KEGG and GO enrichment analyses revealed that 908 DEGs were mainly related to cell adhesion, extracellular matrix organization, and ECM-receptor interaction. GSEA analysis demonstrated that homophilic cell adhesion via plasma membrane adhesion molecules was significantly enriched (NES = 2.375, P < 0.001). CNV analysis suggested that ECM-remodeling MGCs showed considerably lower average CNV scores. ECM-remodeling MGCs predominantly localized at the brain-tumour interface area and adhere stably to the basement membrane with a lower degree of malignancy. This study provides novel insights into the malignancy of meningiomas.",38491247,,10.1007/s10143-024-02349-5,0,Neurosurgical review,7908181,2.8,0.50788813829422,0.17725752508361203,0.13712374581939799,0.367609137157134
The role of APOBEC3C in modulating the tumor microenvironment and stemness properties of glioma: evidence from pancancer analysis,"Background:It is now understood that APOBEC3 family proteins (A3s) are essential in tumor progression, yet their involvement in tumor immunity and stemness across diverse cancer types remains poorly understood.Methods:In the present study, comprehensive genome-wide statistical and bioinformatic analyses were conducted to elucidate A3 family expression patterns, establishing clinically relevant correlations with prognosis, the tumor microenvironment(TME), immune infiltration, checkpoint blockade, and stemness across cancers. Different experimental techniques were applied, including RT-qPCR, immunohistochemistry, sphere formation assays, Transwell migration assays, and wound-healing assays, to investigate the impact of A3C on low-grade glioma (LGG) and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), as well as its function in glioma stem cells(GSCs).Results:Dysregulated expression of A3s was observed in various human cancer tissues. The prognostic value of A3 expression differed across cancer types, with a link to particularly unfavorable outcomes in gliomas. A3s are associated with the the TME and stemness in multiple cancers. Additionally, we developed an independent prognostic model based on A3s expression, which may be an independent prognostic factor for OS in patients with glioma. Subsequent validation underscored a strong association between elevated A3C expression and adverse prognostic outcomes, higher tumor grades, and unfavorable histology in glioma. A potential connection between A3C and glioma progression was established. Notably, gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses implicated A3C in immune system-related diseases, with heightened A3C levels contributing to an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) in glioma. Furthermore,in vitroexperiments substantiated the role of A3C in sustaining and renewing glioma stem cells, as A3C deletion led to diminished proliferation, invasion, and migration of glioma cells.Conclusion:The A3 family exhibits heterogeneous expression across various cancer types, with its expression profile serving as a predictive marker for overall survival in glioma patients. A3C emerges as a regulator of glioma progression, exerting its influence through modulation of the tumor microenvironment and regulation of stemness.",37809064,PMC10551170,10.3389/fimmu.2023.1242972,0,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,8.786,0.5076250433921814,0.1806020066889632,0.7491638795986622,0.49052820329283386
Upregulated functional gene expression programmes in tumour pericytes mark progression in patients with low-grade glioma,"Pericytes conceivably play important roles in the tumour microenvironment of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) by allowing for an aberrant vasculature and acting as a component in the perivascular niche that supports glioma stem-like cells. However, a lack of specific markers has hampered in-depth elucidation of the functional contribution of pericytes to GBM. This study provides a comprehensive computational biology approach to annotate pericyte marker genes in the GBM vasculature through integration of data from single-cell RNA-sequencing studies of both mouse and human tissue, as well as bulk tumour and healthy tissue gene expression data from patients with GBM. We identified distinct vascular- and immune-related gene expression programmes in tumour pericytes that we assessed for association with GBM characteristics and patient survival. Most compellingly, pericyte gene signatures that were upregulated in tumours compared with normal brain tissue were indicative of progression of low-grade gliomas into high-grade glioma, suggested by a markedly shorter overall survival. Our results underline the functional importance of tumour pericytes in low-grade glioma and may serve as a starting point for efforts for precision targeting of pericytes.",34018679,PMC8763650,10.1002/1878-0261.13016,5,Molecular oncology,101308230,7.449,0.5075219869613647,0.5551839464882943,0.5451505016722408,0.5245800818089259
The Many Facets of Therapy Resistance and Tumor Recurrence in Glioblastoma,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most lethal type of primary brain cancer. Standard care using chemo- and radio-therapy modestly increases the overall survival of patients; however, recurrence is inevitable, due to treatment resistance and lack of response to targeted therapies. GBM therapy resistance has been attributed to several extrinsic and intrinsic factors which affect the dynamics of tumor evolution and physiology thus creating clinical challenges. Tumor-intrinsic factors such as tumor heterogeneity, hypermutation, altered metabolomics and oncologically activated alternative splicing pathways change the tumor landscape to facilitate therapy failure and tumor progression. Moreover, tumor-extrinsic factors such as hypoxia and an immune-suppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) are the chief causes of immunotherapy failure in GBM. Amid the success of immunotherapy in other cancers, GBM has occurred as a model of resistance, thus focusing current efforts on not only alleviating the immunotolerance but also evading the escape mechanisms of tumor cells to therapy, caused by inter- and intra-tumoral heterogeneity. Here we review the various mechanisms of therapy resistance in GBM, caused by the continuously evolving tumor dynamics as well as the complex TME, which cumulatively contribute to GBM malignancy and therapy failure; in an attempt to understand and identify effective therapies for recurrent GBM.",33668200,PMC7995978,10.3390/cells10030484,49,Cells,101600052,7.666,0.5061871409416199,0.9096989966555183,0.5953177257525084,0.6047156290465773
Spatially gradated hydrogel platform as a 3D engineered tumor microenvironment,There is an acute need for biomaterial tools that recreate the heterogeneous brain-tumor microenvironment.

This approach permits in situ analysis of glioma cells at the molecular and genomic level as well as the potential for clinical insight.,25521283,,10.1002/adma.201404896,51,"Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)",9885358,32.086,0.5033530592918396,0.9163879598662207,0.9698996655518395,0.6792693606587157
[Latest Research Findings on the Role of Non-Tumor Cells in Glioma Microenvironment],"As the tumor cell-centered treatment strategies cannot curb the malignant progression of glioblastoma effectively, the therapeutic effect of glioblastoma is still not satisfactory. In addition to glioma cells, glioma microenvironment (GME) comprises massive numbers of non-tumor cells and soluble cytokines. The non-tumor cells include endothelial cells, pericytes, microglia/macrophages, mesenchymal cells, astrocytes, neurons, etc. These non-tumor cell components, together with glioma cells, form one organism which regulates the progression of glioma. Considerable progress has been been in research on GME, which will be conducive to the development of non-tumor cell targeted therapies and and improvements in the prognosis of glioma patients. Herein, we summarized the interaction of glioma cells with endothelial cells, pericytes, microglia/macrophages, astrocytes, neurons and mesenchymal cells, a topic that has been extensively researched, as well as the corresponding translational studies. We also discussed the potential challenges and opportunities of developing glioma treatments based on tumor microenvironment.",35871725,PMC10409475,10.12182/20220760204,0,Sichuan da xue xue bao.

"An ultra high-throughput, massively multiplexable, single-cell RNA-seq platform in yeasts","Yeasts are naturally diverse, genetically tractable, and easy to grow such that researchers can investigate any number of genotypes, environments, or interactions thereof. However, studies of yeast transcriptomes have been limited by the processing capabilities of traditional RNA sequencing techniques. Here we optimize a powerful, high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) platform, SPLiT-seq (Split Pool Ligation-based Transcriptome sequencing), for yeasts and apply it to 43,388 cells of multiple species and ploidies. This platform utilizes a combinatorial barcoding strategy to enable massively parallel RNA sequencing of hundreds of yeast genotypes or growth conditions at once. This method can be applied to most species or strains of yeast for a fraction of the cost of traditional scRNAseq approaches. Thus, our technology permits researchers to leverage ""the awesome power of yeast"" by allowing us to survey the transcriptome of hundreds of strains and environments in a short period of time and with no specialized equipment. The key to this method is that sequential barcodes are probabilistically appended to cDNA copies of RNA while the molecules remain trapped inside of each cell. Thus, the transcriptome of each cell is labeled with a unique combination of barcodes. Since SPLiT-seq uses the cell membrane as a container for this reaction, many cells can be processed together without the need to physically isolate them from one another in separate wells or droplets. Further, the first barcode in the sequence can be chosen intentionally to identify samples from different environments or genetic backgrounds, enabling multiplexing of hundreds of unique perturbations in a single experiment. In addition to greater multiplexing capabilities, our method also facilitates a deeper investigation of biological heterogeneity, given its single-cell nature. For example, in the data presented here, we detect transcriptionally distinct cell states related to cell cycle, ploidy, metabolic strategies, and so forth, all within clonal yeast populations grown in the same environment. Hence, our technology has two obvious and impactful applications for yeast research: the first is the general study of transcriptional phenotypes across many strains and environments, and the second is investigating cell-to-cell heterogeneity across the entire transcriptome.",38282330,,10.1002/yea.3927,0,"Yeast (Chichester, England)",8607637,3.325,0.5021629333496094,0.18729096989966554,0.18394648829431437,0.3755452516485616
Single-cell transcriptome analysis reveals the clinical implications of myeloid-derived suppressor cells in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC) is the most common malignant tumor that arises in the epithelium of the head and neck regions. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are one of the tumor-infiltrating immune cell populations, which play a powerful role in inhibiting anti-tumor immune response. Herein, we employed a single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) dataset to dissect the heterogeneity of myeloid cells. We found thatSPP1+tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and MDSCs were the most abundant myeloid cells in the microenvironment. By cell cluster deconvolution from bulk RNA-seq datasets of larger patient groups, we observed that highly-infiltrated MDSC was a poor prognostic marker for patients' overall survival (OS) probabilities. To better apply the MDSC OS prediction values, we identified a set of six MDSC-related genes (ALDOA,CD52,FTH1,RTN4,SLC2A3, andTNFAIP6) as the prognostic signature. In both training and test cohorts, MDSC-related prognostic signature showed a promising value for predicting patients' prognosis outcomes. Further parsing the ligand-receptor pairs of intercellular communications by CellChat, we found that MDSCs could frequently interact with cytotoxicCD8+T cells,SPP1+TAMs, and endothelial cells. These interactions likely contributed to the establishment of an immunosuppressive microenvironment and the promotion of tumor angiogenesis. Our findings suggest that targeting MDSCs may serve as an alternative and promising target for the immunotherapy of HNSC.",37475874,PMC10354270,10.3389/pore.2023.1611210,1,Pathology oncology research : POR,9706087,2.874,0.5021151900291443,0.32441471571906355,0.15384615384615385,0.39692128793053005
Changes in the tumor microenvironment and outcome for TME-targeting therapy in glioblastoma: A pilot study,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is a hypervascular and aggressive primary malignant tumor of the central nervous system. Recent investigations showed that traditional therapies along with antiangiogenic therapies failed due to the development of post-therapy resistance and recurrence. Previous investigations showed that there were changes in the cellular and metabolic compositions in the tumor microenvironment (TME). It can be said that tumor cell-directed therapies are ineffective and rethinking is needed how to treat GBM. It is hypothesized that the composition of TME-associated cells will be different based on the therapy and therapeutic agents, and TME-targeting therapy will be better to decrease recurrence and improve survival. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to determine the changes in the TME in respect of T-cell population, M1 and M2 macrophage polarization status, and MDSC population following different treatments in a syngeneic model of GBM. In addition to these parameters, tumor growth and survival were also studied following different treatments. The results showed that changes in the TME-associated cells were dependent on the therapeutic agents, and the TME-targeting therapy improved the survival of the GBM bearing animals. The current GBM therapies should be revisited to add agents to prevent the accumulation of bone marrow-derived cells in the TME or to prevent the effect of immune-suppressive myeloid cells in causing alternative neovascularization, the revival of glioma stem cells, and recurrence. Instead of concurrent therapy, a sequential strategy would be better to target TME-associated cells.",33544755,PMC7864405,10.1371/journal.pone.0246646,14,PloS one,101285081,3.752,0.5018939971923828,0.7424749163879598,0.22742474916387959,0.49511633142579753
A simple agent-based hybrid model to simulate the biophysics of glioblastoma multiforme cells and the concomitant evolution of the oxygen field,"Background and objectives:Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is one of the most aggressive cancers of the central nervous system. It is characterized by a high mitotic activity and an infiltrative ability of the glioma cells, neovascularization and necrosis. GBM evolution entails the continuous interplay between heterogeneous cell populations, chemotaxis, and physical cues through different scales. In this work, an agent-based hybrid model is proposed to simulate the coupling of the multiscale biological events involved in the GBM invasion, specifically the individual and collective migration of GBM cells and the concurrent evolution of the oxygen field and phenotypic plasticity. An asset of the formulation is that it is conceptually and computationally simple but allows to reproduce the complexity and the progression of the GBM micro-environment at cell and tissue scales simultaneously.Methods:The migration is reproduced as the result of the interaction between every single cell and its micro-environment. The behavior of each individual cell is formulated through genotypic variables whereas the cell micro-environment is modeled in terms of the oxygen concentration and the cell density surrounding each cell. The collective behavior is formulated at a cellular scale through a flocking model. The phenotypic plasticity of the cells is induced by the micro-environment conditions, considering five phenotypes.Results:The model has been contrasted by benchmark problems and experimental tests showing the ability to reproduce different scenarios of glioma cell migration. In all cases, the individual and collective cell migration and the coupled evolution of both the oxygen field and phenotypic plasticity have been properly simulated. This simple formulation allows to mimic the formation of relevant hallmarks of glioblastoma multiforme, such as the necrotic cores, and to reproduce experimental evidences related to the mitotic activity in pseudopalisades.Conclusions:In the collective migration, the survival of the clusters prevails at the expense of cell mitosis, regardless of the size of the groups, which delays the formation of necrotic foci and reduces the rate of oxygen consumption.",38301393,,10.1016/j.cmpb.2024.108046,0,Computer methods and programs in biomedicine,8506513,7.027,0.5009565353393555,0.19063545150501673,0.5183946488294314,0.4423799412705029
Accurate integration of multiple heterogeneous single-cell RNA-seq data sets by learning contrastive biological variation,"For most biological and medical applications of single-cell transcriptomics, an integrative study of multiple heterogeneous single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data sets is crucial. However, present approaches are unable to integrate diverse data sets from various biological conditions effectively because of the confounding effects of biological and technical differences. We introduce single-cell integration (scInt), an integration method based on accurate, robust cell-cell similarity construction and unified contrastive biological variation learning from multiple scRNA-seq data sets. scInt provides a flexible and effective approach to transfer knowledge from the already integrated reference to the query. We show that scInt outperforms 10 other cutting-edge approaches using both simulated and real data sets, particularly in the case of complex experimental designs. Application of scInt to mouse developing tracheal epithelial data shows its ability to integrate development trajectories from different developmental stages. Furthermore, scInt successfully identifies functionally distinct condition-specific cell subpopulations in single-cell heterogeneous samples from a variety of biological conditions.",37308294,PMC10317120,10.1101/gr.277522.122,0,Genome research,9518021,9.438,0.5001410245895386,0.1939799331103679,0.7658862876254181,0.49205785890088033
Major Challenges and Potential Microenvironment-Targeted Therapies in Glioblastoma,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is considered one of the most malignant, genetically heterogeneous, and therapy-resistant solid tumor. Therapeutic options are limited in GBM and involve surgical resection followed by chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. Adjuvant therapies, including antiangiogenic treatments (AATs) targeting the VEGF-VEGFR pathway, have witnessed enhanced infiltration of bone marrow-derived myeloid cells, causing therapy resistance and tumor relapse in clinics and in preclinical models of GBM. This review article is focused on gathering previous clinical and preclinical reports featuring major challenges and lessons in GBM. Potential combination therapies targeting the tumor microenvironment (TME) to overcome the myeloid cell-mediated resistance problem in GBM are discussed. Future directions are focused on the use of TME-directed therapies in combination with standard therapy in clinical trials, and the exploration of novel therapies and GBM models for preclinical studies.

Glucose fluxes in glycolytic and oxidative pathways detected in vivo by deuterium magnetic resonance spectroscopy reflect proliferation in mouse glioblastoma,"Objectives:Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most aggressive glial brain tumors, can metabolize glucose through glycolysis and mitochondrial oxidation pathways. While specific dependencies on those pathways are increasingly associated with treatment response, detecting such GBM subtypes in vivo remains elusive. Here, we develop a dynamic glucose-enhanced deuterium spectroscopy (DGE2H-MRS) approach for differentially assessing glucose turnover rates through glycolysis and mitochondrial oxidation in mouse GBM and explore their association with histologic features of the tumor and its microenvironment.Materials and methods:GL261 and CT2A glioma allografts were induced in immunocompetent mice and scanned in vivo at 9.4 Tesla, harnessing DGE2H-MRS with volume selection and Marchenko-Pastur PCA (MP-PCA) denoising to achieve high temporal resolution. Each tumor was also classified by histopathologic analysis and assessed for cell proliferation (Ki67 immunostaining), while the respective cell lines underwent in situ extracellular flux analysis to assess mitochondrial function.Results:MP-PCA denoising of in vivo DGE2H-MRS data significantly improved the time-course detection (~2-fold increased Signal-to-Noise Ratio) and fitting precision (-19 Â± 1 % CramÃ©r-Rao Lower Bounds) of2H-labelled glucose, and glucose-derived glutamate-glutamine (Glx) and lactate pools in GL261 and CT2A orthotopic tumors. Kinetic modeling further indicated inter-tumor heterogeneity of glucose consumption rate for glycolysis and oxidation during a defined epoch of active proliferation in both cohorts (19 Â± 1 days post-induction), with consistent volumes (38.3 Â± 3.4 mm3) and perfusion properties prior to marked necrosis. Histopathologic analysis of these tumors revealed clear differences in tumor heterogeneity between the two GBM models, aligned with metabolic differences of the respective cell lines monitored in situ. Importantly, glucose oxidation (i.e. Glx synthesis and elimination rates: 0.40 Â± 0.08 and 0.12 Â± 0.03 mM min-1, respectively) strongly correlated with cell proliferation across the pooled cohorts (R = 0.82, p = 0.001; and R = 0.80, p = 0.002, respectively), regardless of tumor morphologic features or in situ metabolic characteristics of each GBM model.Conclusions:Our fast DGE2H-MRS enables the quantification of glucose consumption rates through glycolysis and mitochondrial oxidation in mouse GBM, which is relevant for assessing their modulation in vivo according to tumor microenvironment features such as cell proliferation. This novel application augurs well for non-invasive metabolic characterization of glioma or other cancers with mitochondrial oxidation dependencies.",35026626,PMC8760481,10.1016/j.nicl.2021.102932,10,NeuroImage.

The PTEN-associated immune prognostic signature reveals the landscape of the tumor microenvironment in glioblastoma,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is a common brain tumor with a complex and diverse tumor microenvironment (TME). As PTEN mutation is the most common mutation in GBM, we aimed to investigate how PTEN mutation regulates the immune response in GBM TME and thus affects the prognosis of GBM patients. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of multiple levels of data, including whole-exome sequencing (WES), transcriptome RNA sequencing, patient survival and immune signatures, to study the relationship between PTEN mutation and TME in GBM. We developed an immune-related prognostic signature (IPS) based on the PTEN-associated immune-related genes (IRGs), and the IPS exhibited a powerful prognosis prediction capacity in different GBM cohorts. A scoring nomogram based on the IPS was also established for clinical application. In addition, the correlations of the IPS with tumor immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoints were systematically analyzed. This study illustrates the influence of PTEN mutation on the immune microenvironment of GBM. Our IPS, which is sensitive to PTEN mutation status, can enhance the prognosis prediction ability for GBM patients and provides potential targets for immunotherapy.",36791582,,10.1016/j.jneuroim.2023.578034,2,Journal of neuroimmunology,8109498,3.221,0.4985971450805664,0.4080267558528428,0.1605351170568562,0.41287066163027963
The CNS and the Brain Tumor Microenvironment: Implications for Glioblastoma Immunotherapy,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive malignant primary brain tumor in adults. Its aggressive nature is attributed partly to its deeply invasive margins, its molecular and cellular heterogeneity, and uniquely tolerant site of origin-the brain. The immunosuppressive central nervous system (CNS) and GBM microenvironments are significant obstacles to generating an effective and long-lasting anti-tumoral response, as evidenced by this tumor's reduced rate of treatment response and high probability of recurrence. Immunotherapy has revolutionized patients' outcomes across many cancers and may open new avenues for patients with GBM. There is now a range of immunotherapeutic strategies being tested in patients with GBM that target both the innate and adaptive immune compartment. These strategies include antibodies that re-educate tumor macrophages, vaccines that introduce tumor-specific dendritic cells, checkpoint molecule inhibition, engineered T cells, and proteins that help T cells engage directly with tumor cells. Despite this, there is still much ground to be gained in improving the response rates of the various immunotherapies currently being trialed. Through historical and contemporary studies, we examine the fundamentals of CNS immunity that shape how to approach immune modulation in GBM, including the now revamped concept of CNS privilege. We also discuss the preclinical models used to study GBM progression and immunity. Lastly, we discuss the immunotherapeutic strategies currently being studied to help overcome the hurdles of the blood-brain barrier and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment.",33027976,PMC7582539,10.3390/ijms21197358,34,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,6.208,0.4981803596019745,0.8762541806020067,0.45819397993311034,0.5657978478682081
Multispecific targeting of glioblastoma with tumor microenvironment-responsive multifunctional engineered NK cells,"Tumor antigen heterogeneity, a severely immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) and lymphopenia resulting in inadequate immune intratumoral trafficking, have rendered glioblastoma (GBM) highly resistant to therapy. To address these obstacles, here we describe a unique, sophisticated combinatorial platform for GBM: a cooperative multifunctional immunotherapy based on genetically engineered human natural killer (NK) cells bearing multiple antitumor functions including local tumor responsiveness that addresses key drivers of GBM resistance to therapy: antigen escape, immunometabolic reprogramming of immune responses, and poor immune cell homing. We engineered dual-specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) NK cells to bear a third functional moiety that is activated in the GBM TME and addresses immunometabolic suppression of NK cell function: a tumor-specific, locally released antibody fragment which can inhibit the activity of CD73 independently of CAR signaling and decrease the local concentration of adenosine. The multifunctional human NK cells targeted patient-derived GBM xenografts, demonstrated local tumor site-specific activity in the tissue, and potently suppressed adenosine production. We also unveil a complex reorganization of the immunological profile of GBM induced by inhibiting autophagy. Pharmacologic impairment of the autophagic process not only sensitized GBM to antigenic targeting by NK cells but promoted a chemotactic profile favorable to NK infiltration. Taken together, our study demonstrates a promising NK cell-based combinatorial strategy that can target multiple clinically recognized mechanisms of GBM progression simultaneously.",34740973,PMC8609337,10.1073/pnas.2107507118,41,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,12.779,0.4978180229663849,0.8996655518394648,0.8327759197324415,0.6451791080942122
Ferroptosis Activation Scoring Model Assists in Chemotherapeutic Agents' Selection and Mediates Cross-Talk With Immunocytes in Malignant Glioblastoma,"Gliomas are aggressive tumors in the central nervous system and glioblastoma is the most malignant type. Ferroptosis is a programmed cell death that can modulate tumor resistance to therapy and the components of tumor microenvironment. However, the relationship between ferroptosis, tumor immune landscape, and glioblastoma progression is still elusive. In this work, data from bulk RNA-seq analysis, single cell RNA-seq analysis, and our own data (the Xiangya cohort) are integrated to reveal their relationships. A scoring system is constructed according to ferroptosis related gene expression, and high scoring samples resistant to ferroptosis and show worse survival outcome than low scoring samples. Notably, most of the high scoring samples are aggressive glioblastoma subtype, mesenchymal, and classical, by calculating RNA velocity. Cross-talk between high scoring glioblastoma cells and immunocytes are explored by R package 'celltalker'. Ligand-receptor pairs like the TRAIL or TWEAK signaling pathway are identified as novel bridges implying how ferroptosis modulate immunocytes' function and shape tumor microenvironment. Critically, potential drugs target to high scoring samples are predicted, namely, SNX2112, AZ628, and bortezomib and five compounds from the CellMiner database. Taken together, ferroptosis associates with glioblastoma aggressiveness, cross-talk with immunocytes and offer novel chemotherapy strategy.",35126346,PMC8807564,10.3389/fimmu.2021.747408,14,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,8.786,0.49765586853027344,0.745819397993311,0.7525083612040134,0.598259072957629
Glioblastoma Chemoresistance: The Double Play by Microenvironment and Blood-Brain Barrier,"For glioblastoma, the tumor microenvironment (TME) is pivotal to support tumor progression and therapeutic resistance. TME consists of several types of stromal, endothelial and immune cells, which are recruited by cancer stem cells (CSCs) to influence CSC phenotype and behavior. TME also promotes the establishment of specific conditions such as hypoxia and acidosis, which play a critical role in glioblastoma chemoresistance, interfering with angiogenesis, apoptosis, DNA repair, oxidative stress, immune escape, expression and activity of multi-drug resistance (MDR)-related genes. Finally, the blood brain barrier (BBB), which insulates the brain microenvironment from the blood, is strongly linked to the drug-resistant phenotype of glioblastoma, being a major physical and physiological hurdle for the delivery of chemotherapy agents into the brain. Here, we review the features of the glioblastoma microenvironment, focusing on their involvement in the phenomenon of chemoresistance; we also summarize recent advances in generating systems to modulate or bypass the BBB for drug delivery into the brain. Genetic aspects associated with glioblastoma chemoresistance and current immune-based strategies, such as checkpoint inhibitor therapy, are described too.",30248992,PMC6213072,10.3390/ijms19102879,95,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,6.208,0.49763303995132446,0.9698996655518395,0.46153846153846156,0.5848674493888548
scDFC: A deep fusion clustering method for single-cell RNA-seq data,"Clustering methods have been widely used in single-cell RNA-seq data for investigating tumor heterogeneity. Since traditional clustering methods fail to capture the high-dimension methods, deep clustering methods have drawn increasing attention these years due to their promising strengths on the task. However, existing methods consider either the attribute information of each cell or the structure information between different cells. In other words, they cannot sufficiently make use of all of this information simultaneously. To this end, we propose a novel single-cell deep fusion clustering model, which contains two modules, i.e. an attributed feature clustering module and a structure-attention feature clustering module. More concretely, two elegantly designed autoencoders are built to handle both features regardless of their data types. Experiments have demonstrated the validity of the proposed approach, showing that it is efficient to fuse attributes, structure, and attention information on single-cell RNA-seq data. This work will be further beneficial for investigating cell subpopulations and tumor microenvironment.

Hallmarks of transcriptional intratumour heterogeneity across a thousand tumours,"Each tumour contains diverse cellular states that underlie intratumour heterogeneity (ITH), a central challenge of cancer therapeutics1. Dozens of recent studies have begun to describe ITH by single-cell RNA sequencing, but each study typically profiled only a small number of tumours and provided a narrow view of transcriptional ITH2. Here we curate, annotate and integrate the data from 77 different studies to reveal the patterns of transcriptional ITH across 1,163 tumour samples covering 24 tumour types. Among the malignant cells, we identify 41 consensus meta-programs, each consisting of dozens of genes that are coordinately upregulated in subpopulations of cells within many tumours. The meta-programs cover diverse cellular processes including both generic (for example, cell cycle and stress) and lineage-specific patterns that we map into 11 hallmarks of transcriptional ITH. Most meta-programs of carcinoma cells are similar to those identified in non-malignant epithelial cells, suggesting that a large fraction of malignant ITH programs are variable even before oncogenesis, reflecting the biology of their cell of origin. We further extended the meta-program analysis to six common non-malignant cell types and utilize these to map cell-cell interactions within the tumour microenvironment. In summary, we have assembled a comprehensive pan-cancer single-cell RNA-sequencing dataset, which is available through the Curated Cancer Cell Atlas website, and leveraged this dataset to carry out a systematic characterization of transcriptional ITH.",37258682,,10.1038/s41586-023-06130-4,30,Nature,0410462,0.0,0.4956589937210083,0.8528428093645485,0.09364548494983277,0.4866930550954812
Tumoral and immune heterogeneity in an anti-PD-1-responsive glioblastoma: a case study,"Clinical benefit of immune checkpoint blockade in glioblastoma (GBM) is rare, and we hypothesize that tumor clonal evolution and the immune microenvironment are key determinants of response. Here, we present a detailed molecular characterization of the intratumoral and immune heterogeneity in anIDHwild-type,MGMT-negative GBM patient who plausibly benefited from anti-PD-1therapy with an unusually long 25-mo overall survival time. We leveraged multiplex immunohistochemistry, RNA-seq, and whole-exome data from the primary tumor and three resected regions of recurrent disease to survey regional tumor-immune interactions, genomic instability, mutation burden, and expression profiles. We found significant regional heterogeneity in the neoantigenic and immune landscape, with a differential T-cell signature among recurrent sectors, a uniform loss of focal amplifications inEGFR, and a novel subclonalEGFRmutation. Comparisons with recently reported correlates of checkpoint blockade in GBM and with TCGA-GBM revealed appreciable intratumoral heterogeneity that may have contributed to a differentialPD-1blockade response.",31907277,PMC7133743,10.1101/mcs.a004762,4,Cold Spring Harbor molecular case studies,101660017,0.0,0.49343910813331604,0.5083612040133779,0.09698996655518395,0.41713369899370206
Analysis of U87 glioma cells by dielectrophoresis,"Glioblastoma multiforme is the most aggressive and invasive brain cancer consisting of genetically and phenotypically altering glial cells. It has massive heterogeneity due to its highly complex and dynamic microenvironment. Here, electrophysiological properties of U87 human glioma cell line were measured based on a dielectrophoresis phenomenon to quantify the population heterogeneity of glioma cells. Dielectrophoretic forces were generated using a gold-microelectrode array within a microfluidic channel when 3 Vppand 100, 200, 300, 400, 500 kHz, 1, 2, 5, and 10 MHz frequencies were applied. We analyzed the dielectrophoretic behavior of 500 glioma cells, and revealed that the crossover frequency of glioma cells was around 140 kHz. A quantifying dielectrophoretic movement of the glioma cells exhibited three distinct glioma subpopulations: 50% of the glioma cells experienced strong, 30% of the cells were spread in the microchannel by moderate, and the rest of the cells experienced very weak positive dielectrophoretic forces. Our results demonstrated the dielectrophoretic spectra of U87 glioma cell line. Dielectrophoretic responses of glioma cells linked population heterogeneity to membrane properties of glioma cells rather than their size distribution in the population.",35366348,,10.1002/elps.202100374,3,Electrophoresis,8204476,3.595,0.4928174316883087,0.47491638795986624,0.19732441471571907,0.43013861954810234
Glioblastoma stem cell-specific histamine secretion drives pro-angiogenic tumor microenvironment remodeling,"The communication between glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) and the surrounding microenvironment is a prominent feature accounting for the aggressive biology of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). However, the mechanisms by which GSCs proactively drive interactions with microenvironment is not well understood. In this study, we interrogated metabolites that are preferentially secreted from GSCs and found that GSCs produce and secrete histamine to shape a pro-angiogenic tumor microenvironment. This histamine-producing ability is attributed to H3K4me3 modification-activated histidine decarboxylase (HDC) transcription via MYC. Notably, HDC is highly expressed in GBM, which is associated with poor survival of these patients. GSC-secreted histamine activates endothelial cells by triggering a histamine H1 receptor (H1R)-Ca2+-NF-ÎºB axis, thereby promoting angiogenesis and GBM progression. Importantly, pharmacological blockage of H1R using antihistamines impedes the growth of GBM xenografts in mice. Our findings establish that GSC-specific metabolite secretion remodels the tumor microenvironment and highlight histamine targeting as a potential strategy for GBM therapy.",36265493,,10.1016/j.stem.2022.09.009,9,Cell stem cell,101311472,25.269,0.49239784479141235,0.6755852842809364,0.9632107023411371,0.6231979041992621
Metabolic heterogeneity in clear cell renal cell carcinoma revealed by single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics,"Background:Clear cell renal cell carcinoma is a prototypical tumor characterized by metabolic reprogramming, which extends beyond tumor cells to encompass diverse cell types within the tumor microenvironment. Nonetheless, current research on metabolic reprogramming in renal cell carcinoma mostly focuses on either tumor cells alone or conducts analyses of all cells within the tumor microenvironment as a mixture, thereby failing to precisely identify metabolic changes in different cell types within the tumor microenvironment.Methods:Gathering 9 major single-cell RNA sequencing databases of clear cell renal cell carcinoma, encompassing 195 samples. Spatial transcriptomics data were selected to conduct metabolic activity analysis with spatial localization. Developing scMet program to convert RNA-seq data into scRNA-seq data for downstream analysis.Results:Diverse cellular entities within the tumor microenvironment exhibit distinct infiltration preferences across varying histological grades and tissue origins. Higher-grade tumors manifest pronounced immunosuppressive traits. The identification of tumor cells in the RNA splicing state reveals an association between the enrichment of this particular cellular population and an unfavorable prognostic outcome. The energy metabolism of CD8+T cells is pivotal not only for their cytotoxic effector functions but also as a marker of impending cellular exhaustion. Sphingolipid metabolism evinces a correlation with diverse macrophage-specific traits, particularly M2 polarization. The tumor epicenter is characterized by heightened metabolic activity, prominently marked by elevated tricarboxylic acid cycle and glycolysis while the pericapsular milieu showcases a conspicuous enrichment of attributes associated with vasculogenesis, inflammatory responses, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. The scMet facilitates the transformation of RNA sequencing datasets sourced from TCGA into scRNA sequencing data, maintaining a substantial degree of correlation.Conclusions:The tumor microenvironment of clear cell renal cell carcinoma demonstrates significant metabolic heterogeneity across various cell types and spatial dimensions. scMet exhibits a notable capability to transform RNA sequencing data into scRNA sequencing data with a high degree of correlation.",38414015,PMC10900752,10.1186/s12967-024-04848-x,0,Journal of translational medicine,101190741,8.44,0.4915855824947357,0.19732441471571907,0.6220735785953178,0.4588309481590488
Single-cell transcriptome analysis reveals cellular heterogeneity and highlights Fstl1-regulated alveolar myofibroblasts in mouse lung at birth,"The matricellular protein, follistatin-like 1 (FSTL1), regulates lung development and saccular formation. Here, we employed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to construct a transcriptomic atlas of 22,774 individual cells from wild-type (WT) and Fstl1-/-lung (E18.5) samples and identified 27 cell subtypes. We observed abnormal population sizes and gene expression profiles in diverse cell subtypes in Fstl1-/-lung samples. We identified Pdgfra and Tgfbi as genetic markers specifically expressed in postnatal myofibroblasts (MyoFBs). Fstl1 deletion decreased the number of MyoFB cells and downregulated their roles in ECM organization and muscle tissue/vasculature development, partly through the TGF-Î²1/BMP4 signaling pathway.

HSV1 microRNAs in glioblastoma development: an in silico study,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a highly aggressive primary brain tumor. Recent findings highlighted the significance of viral microRNAs (miRs) in regulating post-transcriptional mRNA expression in various human conditions. Although HSV1 encodes viral miRs and affects the central nervous system, no study investigated the roles of HSV1-encoding miRs in GBM development. This study applied in silico approaches to investigate whether HSV1-encoding miRs are involved in GBM development and, if so, how they regulate tumor-suppressive/oncogenes expression in GBM. This study leveraged bioinformatics approaches to identify the potential effect of HSV1 miRs in GBM development. The GSE158284, GSE153679, and GSE182109 datasets were analyzed to identify differentially expressed genes in GBM tissues and cell lines using the limma package in the R software. The GSE182109 dataset was analyzed to determine gene expression at the single-cell levels using the Seurat package in the R software. The TCGA-GTEX, GDSC, CTRP, immunogenetic, and enrichment analyses were performed to study the impact of identified viral HSV1 miRs targets in GBM development. hsv1-miR-H6-3p is upregulated in GBM and can be responsible for EPB41L1 and SH3PXD2A downregulation in GBM tissues. Also, hsv1-miR-H1-5p is upregulated in GBM and can decrease the expression of MELK, FZD2, NOVA1, TMEM97, PTPRZ1, and PDGFC in GBM development. The single-cell RNA sequencing analyses have demonstrated that MELK, FZD2, NOVA1, TMEM97, PTPRZ1, and PDGFC are expressed in astrocytes residing in the GBM microenvironment. This study provides novel insights into the potential roles of HSV1 miRs in GBM pathogenesis and offers a reference for further studies on the significance of HSV1 miRs in GBM development.",38167429,PMC10761845,10.1038/s41598-023-45249-2,0,Scientific reports,101563288,4.996,0.49145591259002686,0.2040133779264214,0.3612040133779264,0.40791702581488565
Pericyte-Glioblastoma Cell Interaction: A Key Target to Prevent Glioblastoma Progression,"Multiple biological processes rely on direct intercellular interactions to regulate cell proliferation and migration in embryonic development and cancer processes. Tumor development and growth depends on close interactions between cancer cells and cells in the tumor microenvironment. During embryonic development, morphogenetic signals and direct cell contacts control cell proliferation, polarity, and morphogenesis. Cancer cells communicate with cells in the tumor niche through molecular signals and intercellular contacts, thereby modifying the vascular architecture and antitumor surveillance processes and consequently enabling tumor growth and survival. While looking for cell-to-cell signaling mechanisms that are common to both brain development and cancer progression, we have studied the infiltration process in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), which is the most malignant primary brain tumor and with the worst prognosis. Cell-to-cell contacts, by means of filopodia-like structures, between GBM cells and brain pericytes (PCs) are necessary for adequate cell signaling during cancer infiltration; similarly, contacts between embryonic regions, via cytonemes, are required for embryo regionalization and development. This GBM-PC interaction provokes two important changes in the physiological function of these perivascular cells, namely, (i) vascular co-option with changes in cell contractility and vascular malformation, and (ii) changes in the PC transcriptome, modifying the microvesicles and protein secretome, which leads to the development of an immunosuppressive phenotype that promotes tumor immune tolerance. Moreover, the GTPase Cdc42 regulates cell polarity across organisms, from yeast to humans, playing a central role in GBM cell-PC interaction and maintaining vascular co-option. As such, a review of the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the development and maintenance of the physical interactions between cancer cells and PCs is of particular interest.",37174724,PMC10177553,10.3390/cells12091324,3,Cells,101600052,7.666,0.49139487743377686,0.4782608695652174,0.5986622073578596,0.5102215418448814
Development and validation of a novel mitophagy-related gene prognostic signature for glioblastoma multiforme,"Background:Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is one of the most malignant tumors in brain with high morbidity and mortality. Mitophagy plays a significant role in carcinogenesis, metastasis, and invasion. In our study, we aim to construct a mitophagy-related risk model to predict prognosis in GBM.Methods:RNA-seq data combined with clinical information were downloaded from TCGA. The 4-gene risk model and nomograph was then constructed and validated in external cohort. Evaluation of immune infiltration, functional enrichment and tumor microenvironment (TME) were then performed.Result:A mitophagy-related risk model was established and patients in TCGA and CGGA were classified into low-risk and high-risk groups. In both cohorts, patients in low-risk group had improved survival, while high-risk group had poor prognosis. Also, the risk model was identified as an independent factor for predicting overall survival via Cox regression. Furthermore, a prognostic nomogram including mitophagy signatures was established with excellent predictive performance. In addition, the risk model was closely associated with regulation of immune infiltration as well as TME.Conclusion:In conclusion, our study constructed a mitophagy-related risk model, which can be utilized for the clinical prognostic prediction in GBM.",35692054,PMC9190154,10.1186/s12885-022-09707-w,5,BMC cancer,100967800,4.638,0.4913414716720581,0.5585284280936454,0.31438127090301005,0.4693868228025659
Glioblastoma mechanobiology at multiple length scales,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), a primary brain cancer, is one of the most aggressive forms of human cancer, with a very low patient survival rate. A characteristic feature of GBM is the diffuse infiltration of tumor cells into the surrounding brain extracellular matrix (ECM) that provide biophysical, topographical, and biochemical cues. In particular, ECM stiffness and composition is known to play a key role in controlling various GBM cell behaviors including proliferation, migration, invasion, as well as the stem-like state and response to chemotherapies. In this review, we discuss the mechanical characteristics of the GBM microenvironment at multiple length scales, and how biomaterial scaffolds such as polymeric hydrogels, and fibers, as well as microfluidic chip-based platforms have been employed as tissue mimetic models to study GBM mechanobiology. We also highlight how such tissue mimetic models can impact the field of GBM mechanobiology.",38640876,,10.1016/j.bioadv.2024.213860,0,Biomaterials advances,9918383886206676,0.0,0.4904949367046356,0.20735785953177258,0.10033444816053512,0.3558354235612429
Single-cell transcriptome analysis reveals intratumoral heterogeneity in lung adenocarcinoma,"Introduction:Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is a major health concern worldwide. Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides a valuable platform for exploring the intratumoral heterogeneity in LUAD and holds great potential for facilitating the development and application of personalized therapeutic approaches.Methods:The TCGA-LUAD (n = 503), GSE68465 (n = 442), GSE72094 (n = 398), and GSE26939 (n = 115) datasets were retrieved for prognostic assessment.

The InferCNV software was used to calculate the copy number variations (CNVs) in tumor cell subgroups with normal epithelial cells as the reference. The association between the annotated cell types and survival was analyzed using the Scissor software.Results:We identified eight major cell types in LUAD, namely epithelial cells, NK cells, T and B cells, endothelial cells, mast cells, myeloid cells, and fibroblasts, of which the epithelial cells and B cells showed a marked increase in the tumor samples. In addition, we also detected an intense signal transduction network from the cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) to malignant cells, mainly involving the DCN/MET, COLA1/DDR1, COL1A1/SDC1, and COL1A2/SDC1 pathways. The tumor differentiation trajectory consisted of state 1 and state 2, which were enriched in HIF1A, and state 4. Furthermore, only a few B cells originated from the normal tissue, suggesting significant recruitment and infiltration of B cells in LUAD. Based on differentially upregulated genes in the cells positively and negatively associated with survival, we established a prognostic model that showed satisfactory predictive performance in three different cohorts. States 3 and 2 of epithelial cells included the majority of cells with KRAS mutation, whereas state 2 showed high frequency of EGFR mutations.Conclusion:We analyzed intra-tumor heterogeneity of LUAD at the single-cell level and developed a prognostic index that was highly effective across multiple cohorts.",38133212,,10.1002/tox.24048,0,Environmental toxicology,100885357,4.109,0.4903118312358856,0.21070234113712374,0.23745819397993312,0.3838192057649428
Understanding current experimental models of glioblastoma-brain microenvironment interactions,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is a common and devastating primary brain tumor, with median survival of 16-18 months after diagnosis in the setting of substantial resistance to standard-of-care and inevitable tumor recurrence. Recent work has implicated the brain microenvironment as being critical for GBM proliferation, invasion, and resistance to treatment. GBM does not operate in isolation, with neurons, astrocytes, and multiple immune populations being implicated in GBM tumor progression and invasiveness. The goal of this review article is to provide an overview of the available in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo experimental models for assessing GBM-brain interactions, as well as discuss each model's relative strengths and limitations. Current in vitro models discussed will include 2D and 3D co-culture platforms with various cells of the brain microenvironment, as well as spheroids, whole organoids, and models of fluid dynamics, such as interstitial flow. An overview of in vitro and ex vivo organotypic GBM brain slices is also provided. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of the various in vivo rodent models of GBM, including xenografts, syngeneic grafts, and genetically-engineered models of GBM.",38180686,PMC11056965,10.1007/s11060-023-04536-8,1,Journal of neuro-oncology,8309335,4.506,0.4901898503303528,0.3277591973244147,0.29431438127090304,0.41852862591727524
Single-cell transcriptome analysis reveals heterogeneity of neutrophils in non-small cell lung cancer,"Background:Lung cancer stands out as a highly perilous malignant tumor with severe implications for human health. There has been a growing interest in neutrophils as a result of their role in promoting cancer in recent years. Thus, the present study aimed to investigate the heterogeneity of neutrophils in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Methods:Single-cell RNA sequencing of tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) and polymorphonuclear neutrophils sourced from the Gene Expression Omnibus database was analyzed. Moreover, cell-cell communication, differentiation trajectories and transcription factor analyses were performed.Results:Neutrophils were found to be closely associated with macrophages. Four major types of TANs were identified: a transitional subcluster that migrated from blood to tumor microenvironment (TAN-0), an inflammatory subcluster (TAN-1), a subpopulation that displayed a distinctive transcriptional signature (TAN-2) and a final differentiation state that promoted tumor formation (TAN-3). Meanwhile, TAN-3 displayed a marked increase in glycolytic activity. Finally, transcription factors were analyzed to uncover distinct TAN cluster-specific regulons.Conclusions:The discovery of the dynamic characteristics of TANs in the present study is anticipated to contribute to yielding a better understanding of the tumor microenvironment and advancing the treatment of NSCLC.",38735760,,10.1002/jgm.3690,0,The journal of gene medicine,9815764,4.152,0.4901517629623413,0.2140468227424749,0.26755852842809363,0.39041212801151853
An End-to-End Deep Hybrid Autoencoder Based Method for Single-Cell RNA-Seq Data Analysis,"Single-cell RNA sequencing technology provides powerful support for researchers to understand the complex mechanisms of cells at the single-cell level. Due to the high sparsity, technical noise, and computational complexity of single-cell transcriptome data, the existing data analysis methods are unable to effectively extract the fine-grained characteristics of scRNA-seq data, resulting in inaccurately analyze the heterogeneity of the individual cell from a great quantity of cell mixtures. To address these shortcomings, we proposed an end-to-end analysis method called dhaSCA, which integrates the Graph convolutional neural network (GCN) feature learning and downstream tasks such as classification and imputation into a unified deep learning manner. dhaSCA uses hybrid GCN-MLP deep autoencoder and to capture structural information between cells, and learn the low dimensional cell representation. It also introduces downstream tasks as constraints to guide the model to learn more accurate cell features. We conducted various experiments to evaluate the performance of dhaSCA based on eight real RNA-Seq datasets, including classification, imputation, clustering, and visualization. The results show that dhaSCA outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in these downstream tasks. Therefore, dhaSCA is able to obtain a richer representation of cells, and provides strong support for efficient analysis of single-cell data.",37889828,,10.1109/TCBB.2023.3328029,2,IEEE/ACM transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics,101196755,3.702,0.4895263612270355,0.41471571906354515,0.21739130434782608,0.4201372214184955
scMuffin: an R package to disentangle solid tumor heterogeneity by single-cell gene expression analysis,"Introduction:Single-cell (SC) gene expression analysis is crucial to dissect the complex cellular heterogeneity of solid tumors, which is one of the main obstacles for the development of effective cancer treatments. Such tumors typically contain a mixture of cells with aberrant genomic and transcriptomic profiles affecting specific sub-populations that might have a pivotal role in cancer progression, whose identification eludes bulk RNA-sequencing approaches. We present scMuffin, an R package that enables the characterization of cell identity in solid tumors on the basis of a various and complementary analyses on SC gene expression data.Results:scMuffin provides a series of functions to calculate qualitative and quantitative scores, such as: expression of marker sets for normal and tumor conditions, pathway activity, cell state trajectories, Copy Number Variations, transcriptional complexity and proliferation state. Thus, scMuffin facilitates the combination of various evidences that can be used to distinguish normal and tumoral cells, define cell identities, cluster cells in different ways, link genomic aberrations to phenotypes and identify subtle differences between cell subtypes or cell states. We analysed public SC expression datasets of human high-grade gliomas as a proof-of-concept to show the value of scMuffin and illustrate its user interface. Nevertheless, these analyses lead to interesting findings, which suggest that some chromosomal amplifications might underlie the invasive tumor phenotype and the presence of cells that possess tumor initiating cells characteristics.Conclusions:The analyses offered by scMuffin and the results achieved in the case study show that our tool helps addressing the main challenges in the bioinformatics analysis of SC expression data from solid tumors.",38012590,PMC10680269,10.1186/s12859-023-05563-y,1,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,3.307,0.48938146233558655,0.3311036789297659,0.17391304347826086,0.39463222188295727
"Integrated multiomic analysis reveals disulfidptosis subtypes in glioblastoma: implications for immunotherapy, targeted therapy, and chemotherapy","Introduction:Glioblastoma (GBM) presents significant challenges due to its malignancy and limited treatment options. Precision treatment requires subtyping patients based on prognosis. Disulfidptosis, a novel cell death mechanism, is linked to aberrant glucose metabolism and disulfide stress, particularly in tumors expressing high levels of SLC7A11. The exploration of disulfidptosis may provide a new perspective for precise diagnosis and treatment of glioblastoma.Methods:Transcriptome sequencing was conducted on samples from GBM patients treated at Tiantan Hospital (January 2022 - December 2023). Data from CGGA and TCGA databases were collected. Consensus clustering based on disulfidptosis features categorized GBM patients into two subtypes (DRGclusters). Tumor immune microenvironment, response to immunotherapy, and drug sensitivity were analyzed. An 8-gene disulfidptosis-based subtype predictor was developed using LASSO machine learning algorithm and validated on CGGA dataset.Results:Patients in DRGcluster A exhibited improved overall survival (OS) compared to DRGcluster B. DRGcluster subtypes showed differences in tumor immune microenvironment and response to immunotherapy. The predictor effectively stratified patients into high and low-risk groups. Significant differences in IC50 values for chemotherapy and targeted therapy were observed between risk groups.Discussion:Disulfidptosis-based classification offers promise as a prognostic predictor for GBM. It provides insights into tumor immune microenvironment and response to therapy. The predictor aids in patient stratification and personalized treatment selection, potentially improving outcomes for GBM patients.",38504986,PMC10950096,10.3389/fimmu.2024.1362543,0,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,8.786,0.4890917241573334,0.21739130434782608,0.7558528428093646,0.48810386392583816
Comprehensive analysis of scRNA-Seq and bulk RNA-Seq reveals dynamic changes in the tumor immune microenvironment of bladder cancer and establishes a prognostic model,"Background:The prognostic management of bladder cancer (BLCA) remains a great challenge for clinicians. Recently, bulk RNA-seq sequencing data have been used as a prognostic marker for many cancers but do not accurately detect core cellular and molecular functions in tumor cells. In the current study, bulk RNA-seq and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data were combined to construct a prognostic model of BLCA.Methods:BLCA scRNA-seq data were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Bulk RNA-seq data were obtained from the UCSC Xena. The R package ""Seurat"" was used for scRNA-seq data processing, and the uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) were utilized for downscaling and cluster identification. The FindAllMarkers function was used to identify marker genes for each cluster. The limma package was used to obtain differentially expressed genes (DEGs) affecting overall survival (OS) in BLCA patients. Weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) was used to identify BLCA key modules. The intersection of marker genes of core cells and genes of BLCA key modules and DEGs was used to construct a prognostic model by univariate Cox and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) analyses. Differences in clinicopathological characteristics, immune microenvironment, immune checkpoints, and chemotherapeutic drug sensitivity between the high and low-risk groups were also investigated.Results:scRNA-seq data were analyzed to identify 19 cell subpopulations and 7 core cell types. The ssGSEA showed that all 7 core cell types were significantly downregulated in tumor samples of BLCA. We identified 474 marker genes from the scRNA-seq dataset, 1556 DEGs from the Bulk RNA-seq dataset, and 2334 genes associated with a key module identified by WGCNA. After performing intersection, univariate Cox, and LASSO analysis, we obtained a prognostic model based on the expression levels of 3 signature genes, namely MAP1B, PCOLCE2, and ELN. The feasibility of the model was validated by an internal training set and two external validation sets. Moreover, patients with high-risk scores are predisposed to experience poor OS, a larger prevalence of stage III-IV, a greater TMB, a higher infiltration of immune cells, and a lesser likelihood of responding favorably to immunotherapy.Conclusion:By integrating scRNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq data, we constructed a novel prognostic model to predict the survival of BLCA patients. The risk score is a promising independent prognostic factor that is closely correlated with the immune microenvironment and clinicopathological characteristics.",36973787,PMC10044739,10.1186/s12967-023-04056-z,17,Journal of translational medicine,101190741,8.44,0.4882681667804718,0.7692307692307693,0.6254180602006689,0.5718906659545707
Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals the cellular and molecular characteristics of high-grade and metastatic bladder cancer,"Purpose:Metastatic bladder cancer (BC) has the highest somatic mutation frequency and recurrence rate of all tumors. However, the cellular and molecular characteristics of BC remain unclear.Methods:We performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on the samples of paracancerous normal tissue (PNT), primary tumor (PT) and lymph node metastasis (LNM). The proportions and gene expression profiles of different cell types in the tumor microenvironment (TME) were investigated.Results:In total, 50,158 cells were classified into six populations. Malignant cells of PT and LNM exhibited large mutant DNA fragments, while the cell phenotypes and gene expression profiles differed during differentiation. Metastasis was associated with a poorer prognosis than PT. Tumor-associated stromal cells and inhibitory immune cells were the main cell populations in PT and LNM. Cell-cell communication analysis revealed the roles of signaling pathways of inflammatory cancer-associated fibroblast (iCAF) and tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) in exhaustion of T cells. In addition, iCAF may recruit TAM to promote formation of the TME earlier than the differentiation of tumor cells.Conclusion:This study through scRNA-seq enhanced our understanding of new features about the cellular and molecular similarities and differences of high-grade and metastatic bladder cancer, which might provide potential therapeutic targets in future treatment.",37170046,,10.1007/s13402-023-00820-x,1,Cellular oncology (Dordrecht),101552938,7.051,0.48803937435150146,0.33444816053511706,0.5250836120401338,0.46472997912595104
Data Analysis Pipeline for scRNA-seq Experiments to Study Early Oogenesis,"Germ cells as the means for the transmission of genetic information between generations have been a hot topic of research for decades. The analysis of the transcriptomes, that is of the RNA transcripts produced by the genotype at a given time, of germ cells and the surrounding somatic cells, is essential to unravel the cellular and molecular processes regulating gametogenesis. However, the asynchronized differentiation of germ cells and high cellular heterogeneity in the developing ovary or testis represent two unsurmountable challenges for delineating the transcription regulation mechanism of germ cells using traditional bulk RNA sequencing. By performing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), it is now possible to dissect the transcriptome of germ cell development at single-cell resolution, and apply powerful bioinformatics methods to translate raw sequencing data into meaningful information. Here, using the 10Ã Genomic platform and the most widely cited bioinformatics tools, we describe how to analyze early female germ cell development using scRNA-seq data generated from mouse E11.5 to E14.5 ovaries. This pipeline will provide a guide for exploring the processes of early germ cell development at single-cell resolution.",38351456,,10.1007/978-1-0716-3698-5_15,0,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,0.0,0.4862019717693329,0.22073578595317725,0.10367892976588629,0.35660412620541243
A bioinformatic analysis study of m7G regulator-mediated methylation modification patterns and tumor microenvironment infiltration in glioblastoma,"Background:Glioblastoma is one of the most common brain cancers in adults, and is characterized by recurrence and little curative effect. An effective treatment for glioblastoma patients remains elusive worldwide. 7-methylguanosine (m7G) is a common RNA modification, and its role in tumors has become a research hotspot.Methods:By searching for differentially expressed genes related to m7G, we generated a prognostic signature via cluster analysis and established classification criteria of high and low risk scores. The effectiveness of classification was validated using the Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithm, and repeatedly verified using training and test groups. The dimension reduction method was used to clearly show the difference and clinical significance of the data. All analyses were performed via R (version 4.1.2).Results:According to the signature that included four genes (TMOD2, CACNG2, PLOD3, and TMSB10), glioblastoma patients were divided into high and low risk score groups. The survival rates between the two groups were significantly different, and the predictive abilities for 1-, 3-, and 5-year survivals were effective. We further established a Nomogram model to further examine the signature,as well as other clinical factors, with remaining significant results. Our signature can act as an independent prognostic factor related to immune-related processes in glioblastoma.Conclusions:Our research addresses the gap in knowledge in the m7G and glioblastoma research fields. The establishment of a prognostic signature and the extended analysis of the tumor microenvironment, immune correlation, and tumor mutation burden further suggest the important role of m7G in the development and development of this disease.

Advancing single-cell RNA-seq data analysis through the fusion of multi-layer perceptron and graph neural network,"The advancement of single-cell sequencing technology has smoothed the ability to do biological studies at the cellular level. Nevertheless, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data presents several obstacles due to the considerable heterogeneity, sparsity and complexity. Although many machine-learning models have been devised to tackle these difficulties, there is still a need to enhance their efficiency and accuracy. Current deep learning methods often fail to fully exploit the intrinsic interconnections within cells, resulting in unsatisfactory results. Given these obstacles, we propose a unique approach for analyzing scRNA-seq data called scMPN. This methodology integrates multi-layer perceptron and graph neural network, including attention network, to execute gene imputation and cell clustering tasks. In order to evaluate the gene imputation performance of scMPN, several metrics like cosine similarity, median L1 distance and root mean square error are used. These metrics are utilized to compare the efficacy of scMPN with other existing approaches. This research utilizes criteria such as adjusted mutual information, normalized mutual information and integrity score to assess the efficacy of cell clustering across different approaches. The superiority of scMPN over current single-cell data processing techniques in cell clustering and gene imputation investigations is shown by the experimental findings obtained from four datasets with gold-standard cell labels. This observation demonstrates the efficacy of our suggested methodology in using deep learning methodologies to enhance the interpretation of scRNA-seq data.",38171931,PMC10764207,10.1093/bib/bbad481,0,Briefings in bioinformatics,100912837,13.994,0.48555395007133484,0.22408026755852842,0.8695652173913043,0.5100614670327674
Imputation for Single-cell RNA-seq Data with Non-negative Matrix Factorization and Transfer Learning,"Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has been proven to be an effective technology for investigating the heterogeneity and transcriptome dynamics due to the single-cell resolution. However, one of the major problems for data obtained by scRNA-seq is excessive zeros in the count matrix, which hinders the downstream analysis enormously. Here, we present a method that integrates non-negative matrix factorization and transfer learning (NMFTL) to impute the scRNA-seq data. It borrows gene expression information from the additional dataset and adds graph-regularized terms to the decomposed matrices. These strategies not only maintain the intrinsic geometrical structure of the data itself but also further improve the accuracy of estimating the expression values by adding the transfer term in the model. The real data analysis result demonstrates that the proposed method outperforms the existing matrix-factorization-based imputation methods in recovering dropout entries, preserving gene-to-gene and cell-to-cell relationships, and in the downstream analysis, such as cell clustering analysis, the proposed method also has a good performance. For convenience, we have implemented the ""NMFTL"" method with R scripts, which could be available at https://github.com/FocusPaka/NMFTL.",38248911,,10.1142/S0219720023500294,0,Journal of bioinformatics and computational biology,101187344,1.204,0.48494410514831543,0.22742474916387959,0.12040133779264214,0.3605316804802936
A deep convolutional neural network for segmentation of whole-slide pathology images identifies novel tumour cell-perivascular niche interactions that are associated with poor survival in glioblastoma,"Background:Glioblastoma is the most aggressive type of brain cancer with high-levels of intra- and inter-tumour heterogeneity that contribute to its rapid growth and invasion within the brain. However, a spatial characterisation of gene signatures and the cell types expressing these in different tumour locations is still lacking.Methods:We have used a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) as a semantic segmentation model to segment seven different tumour regions including leading edge (LE), infiltrating tumour (IT), cellular tumour (CT), cellular tumour microvascular proliferation (CTmvp), cellular tumour pseudopalisading region around necrosis (CTpan), cellular tumour perinecrotic zones (CTpnz) and cellular tumour necrosis (CTne) in digitised glioblastoma histopathological slides from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Correlation analysis between segmentation results from tumour images together with matched RNA expression data was performed to identify genetic signatures that are specific to different tumour regions.Results:We found that spatially resolved gene signatures were strongly correlated with survival in patients with defined genetic mutations. Further in silico cell ontology analysis along with single-cell RNA sequencing data from resected glioblastoma tissue samples showed that these tumour regions had different gene signatures, whose expression was driven by different cell types in the regional tumour microenvironment. Our results further pointed to a key role for interactions between microglia/pericytes/monocytes and tumour cells that occur in the IT and CTmvp regions, which may contribute to poor patient survival.Conclusions:This work identified key histopathological features that correlate with patient survival and detected spatially associated genetic signatures that contribute to tumour-stroma interactions and which should be investigated as new targets in glioblastoma.

Biosensor-Enhanced Organ-on-a-Chip Models for Investigating Glioblastoma Tumor Microenvironment Dynamics,"Glioblastoma, an aggressive primary brain tumor, poses a significant challenge owing to its dynamic and intricate tumor microenvironment. This review investigates the innovative integration of biosensor-enhanced organ-on-a-chip (OOC) models as a novel strategy for an in-depth exploration of glioblastoma tumor microenvironment dynamics. In recent years, the transformative approach of incorporating biosensors into OOC platforms has enabled real-time monitoring and analysis of cellular behaviors within a controlled microenvironment. Conventional in vitro and in vivo models exhibit inherent limitations in accurately replicating the complex nature of glioblastoma progression. This review addresses the existing research gap by pioneering the integration of biosensor-enhanced OOC models, providing a comprehensive platform for investigating glioblastoma tumor microenvironment dynamics. The applications of this combined approach in studying glioblastoma dynamics are critically scrutinized, emphasizing its potential to bridge the gap between simplistic models and the intricate in vivo conditions. Furthermore, the article discusses the implications of biosensor-enhanced OOC models in elucidating the dynamic features of the tumor microenvironment, encompassing cell migration, proliferation, and interactions.

Dissecting the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments in Glioblastoma-on-a-Chip for optimized PD-1 immunotherapy,"Programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) checkpoint immunotherapy efficacy remains unpredictable in glioblastoma (GBM) patients due to the genetic heterogeneity and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments. Here, we report a microfluidics-based, patient-specific 'GBM-on-a-Chip' microphysiological system to dissect the heterogeneity of immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments and optimize anti-PD-1 immunotherapy for different GBM subtypes. Our clinical and experimental analyses demonstrated that molecularly distinct GBM subtypes have distinct epigenetic and immune signatures that may lead to different immunosuppressive mechanisms. The real-time analysis in GBM-on-a-Chip showed that mesenchymal GBM niche attracted low number of allogeneic CD154+CD8+ T-cells but abundant CD163+ tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), and expressed elevated PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoints and TGF-Î²1, IL-10, and CSF-1 cytokines compared to proneural GBM. To enhance PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab efficacy, we co-administered a CSF-1R inhibitor BLZ945 to ablate CD163+ M2-TAMs and strengthened CD154+CD8+ T-cell functionality and GBM apoptosis on-chip.

"Cellular Conversations in Glioblastoma Progression, Diagnosis and Treatment","Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most frequent malignancy among primary brain tumors in adults and one of the worst 5-year survival rates (< 7%) among all human cancers. Till now, treatments that target particular cell or intracellular metabolism have not improved patients' survival. GBM recruits healthy brain cells and subverts their processes to create a microenvironment that contributes to supporting tumor progression. This microenvironment encompasses a complex network in which malignant cells interact with each other and with normal and immune cells to promote tumor proliferation, angiogenesis, metastasis, immune suppression, and treatment resistance. Communication can be direct via cell-to-cell contact, mainly through adhesion molecules, tunneling nanotubes, gap junctions, or indirect by conventional paracrine signaling by cytokine, neurotransmitter, and extracellular vesicles. Understanding these communication routes could open up new avenues for the treatment of this lethal tumor. Hence, therapeutic approaches based on glioma cells` communication have recently drawn attention. This review summarizes recent findings on the crosstalk between glioblastoma cells and their tumor microenvironment, and the impact of this conversation on glioblastoma progression. We also discuss the mechanism of communication of glioma cells and their importance as therapeutic targets and diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. Overall, understanding the biological mechanism of specific interactions in the tumor microenvironment may help in predicting patient prognosis and developing novel therapeutic strategies to target GBM.",35411434,,10.1007/s10571-022-01212-9,4,Cellular and molecular neurobiology,8200709,4.231,0.4833740293979645,0.5117056856187291,0.27424749163879597,0.44721505309028364
Integrated analysis of single-cell RNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq unravels T cell-related prognostic risk model and tumor immune microenvironment modulation in triple-negative breast cancer,"Background:Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive and fatal malignancy. The current success of tumor immunotherapy has focused attention on intermediate T-cell subsets and the tumor microenvironment, which are essential for activation of the anti-tumor response. Therefore, both areas require further research to accelerate progress in developing tailored immunotherapeutic approaches for patients with TNBC.Methods:We obtained scRNA-seq data of TNBC from the GEO database. A multiplex strategy was used to analyze and identify the T-cell heterogeneity of TNBC. By combining the METABRIC and GEO databases, a prognostic risk model for T-cell marker genes was constructed and validated. In addition, the immune-infiltrating cells of TNBC was analyzed using CIBERSORT, and the association between the risk model and response to immunotherapy was investigated.Results:Based on scRNA-seq data, 25,932 cells were identified for multiple analyzes. T cells were studied with a focus on 2 subtypes, including CD8+and CD4+. There were also communication relationships between T cells and multiple cell types. The results of the enrichment analysis showed that the T-cell marker genes were focused in pathways related to the immune system. In addition, OPTN, TMEM176A, PKM and HES1 deserve attention as prognostic markers in TNBC.

Relevance of Thymic Stromal Lymphopoietin on the Pathogenesis of Glioblastoma: Role of the Neutrophil,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most predominant and malignant primary brain tumor in adults. Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), a cytokine primarily generated by activated epithelial cells, has recently garnered attention in cancer research. This study was aimed to elucidate the significance of TSLP in GBM cells and its interplay with the immune system, particularly focused on granulocyte neutrophils. Our results demonstrate that the tumor produces TSLP when stimulated with epidermal growth factor (EGF) in both the U251 cell line and the GBM biopsy (GBM-b). The relevance of the TSLP function was evaluated using a 3D spheroid model. Spheroids exhibited increased diameter, volume, and proliferation. In addition, TSLP promoted the generation of satellites surrounding the main spheroids and inhibited apoptosis in U251 treated with temozolomide (TMZ). Additionally, the co-culture of polymorphonuclear (PMN) cells from healthy donors with the U251 cell line in the presence of TSLP showed a reduction in apoptosis and an increase in IL-8 production. TSLP directly inhibited apoptosis in PMN from GBM patients (PMN-p). Interestingly, the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production was elevated in PMN-p compared with PMN from healthy donors. Under these conditions, TSLP also increased VEGF production, in PMN from healthy donors. Moreover, TSLP upregulated programed death-ligand 1 (PDL-1) expression in PMN cultured with U251. On the other hand, according to our results, the analysis of RNA-seq datasets from Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencing platform performed with TIMER2.0 webserver demonstrated that the combination of TSLP with neutrophils decreases the survival of the patient. In conclusion, our results position TSLP as a possible new growth factor in GBM and indicate its modulation of the tumor microenvironment, particularly through its interaction with PMN.",38557942,PMC10984908,10.1007/s10571-024-01462-9,0,Cellular and molecular neurobiology,8200709,4.231,0.48139289021492004,0.23411371237458195,0.27759197324414714,0.39117687125269784
Breaking through the glioblastoma micro-environment via extracellular vesicles,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and most aggressive brain tumour. Prognosis remains poor, despite the combined treatment of radio- and chemotherapy following surgical removal. GBM cells coexist with normal non-neoplastic cells, including endothelial cells, astrocytes and immune cells, constituting a complex and dynamic tumour micro-environment (TME). Extracellular vesicles (EVs) provide a critical means of bidirectional inter-cellular communication in the TME. Through delivery of a diverse range of genomic, lipidomic and proteomic cargo to neighbouring and distant cells, EVs can alter the phenotype and function of the recipient cell. As such, EVs have demonstrated their role in promoting angiogenesis, immune suppression, invasion, migration, drug resistance and GBM recurrence. Moreover, EVs can reflect the phenotype of the cells within the TME. Thus, in conjunction with their accessibility in biofluids, they can potentially serve as a biomarker reservoir for patient prognosis, diagnosis and predictive therapeutic response as well as treatment follow-up. Furthermore, together with the ability of EVs to cross the blood-brain barrier undeterred and through the exploitation of their cargo, EVs may provide an effective mean of drug delivery to the target site. Unveiling the mechanisms by which EVs within the GBM TME are secreted and target recipient cells may offer an indispensable understanding of GBM that holds the potential to provide a better prognosis and overall quality of life for GBM patients.",32366909,PMC7269906,10.1038/s41388-020-1308-2,54,Oncogene,8711562,8.756,0.48133188486099243,0.919732441471572,0.6387959866220736,0.6005048165353246
Oligodendrocyte Progenitor Cells in the Tumor Microenvironment,"Glioblastoma (GBM) develops from adult brain white matter and is the most common and lethal primary brain tumor, characterized by rapid growth and invasion. GBM tumors frequently spread into the contralateral hemisphere, including in the beginning of tumor development. However, after complete resection of the tumor mass and chemo-radiotherapy, GBM commonly recurs around the tumor removal site, suggesting that the microenvironment at the tumor border provides therapeutic resistance to GBM cells. To improve patient prognosis, understanding the microenvironment at the tumor border is critical. Several microRNAs (miRNAs) show higher expression at the tumor border, with the top three involved in oligodendrocyte differentiation. Oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) may induce stemness and chemo-radioresistance in GBM cells, providing a supportive function to promote GBM. This review describes important features of OPCs and insights into the ""border niche,"" a unique microenvironment that allows GBM cells to survive and recur at the tumor border.",32040858,,10.1007/978-3-030-37184-5_8,9,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,0.0,0.4806767404079437,0.6789297658862876,0.11036789297658862,0.44626557601734157
scASGC: An adaptive simplified graph convolution model for clustering single-cell RNA-seq data,"Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is now a successful technique for identifying cellular heterogeneity, revealing novel cell subpopulations, and forecasting developmental trajectories. A crucial component of the processing of scRNA-seq data is the precise identification of cell subpopulations. Although many unsupervised clustering methods have been developed to cluster cell subpopulations, the performance of these methods is vulnerable to dropouts and high dimensionality. In addition, most existing methods are time-consuming and fail to adequately account for potential associations between cells. In the manuscript, we present an unsupervised clustering method based on an adaptive simplified graph convolution model called scASGC. The proposed method builds plausible cell graphs, aggregates neighbor information using a simplified graph convolution model, and adaptively determines the most optimal number of convolution layers for various graphs. Experiments on 12 public datasets show that scASGC outperforms both classical and state-of-the-art clustering methods. In addition, in a study of mouse intestinal muscle containing 15,983 cells, we identified distinct marker genes based on the clustering results of scASGC.

Glioblastoma: Relationship between Metabolism and Immunosuppressive Microenvironment,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive brain tumor in adults and is characterized by an immunosuppressive microenvironment. Different factors shaping this tumor microenvironment (TME) regulate tumor initiation, progression, and treatment response. Genetic alterations and metabolism pathways are two main elements that influence tumor immune cells and TME. In this manuscript, we review how both factors can contribute to an immunosuppressive state and overview the strategies being tested.",34944036,PMC8700075,10.3390/cells10123529,14,Cells,101600052,7.666,0.4805853068828583,0.7491638795986622,0.6020066889632107,0.5585852978420895
Glioblastoma Microenvironment and Invasiveness: New Insights and Therapeutic Targets,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and malignant primary brain cancer in adults. Without treatment the mean patient survival is approximately 6 months, which can be extended to 15 months with the use of multimodal therapies. The low effectiveness of GBM therapies is mainly due to the tumor infiltration into the healthy brain tissue, which depends on GBM cells' interaction with the tumor microenvironment (TME). The interaction of GBM cells with the TME involves cellular components such as stem-like cells, glia, endothelial cells, and non-cellular components such as the extracellular matrix, enhanced hypoxia, and soluble factors such as adenosine, which promote GBM's invasiveness. However, here we highlight the role of 3D patient-derived glioblastoma organoids cultures as a new platform for study of the modeling of TME and invasiveness. In this review, the mechanisms involved in GBM-microenvironment interaction are described and discussed, proposing potential prognosis biomarkers and new therapeutic targets.",37108208,PMC10139189,10.3390/ijms24087047,15,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,6.208,0.48040249943733215,0.7591973244147158,0.46488294314381273,0.533057553174105
Singleâcell multiâomics advances in lymphoma research (Review),"The evolution of lymphoma is a multifactorial process that leads to unavoidable lymphoma heterogeneity in the form of genetic mutations, chromosomal translocations and other variations. Multiâomics analyses based on singleâcell assays can reveal and characterize tumor components, enabling us to determine the timing of mutations and to profile disease progression. Increasing numbers of studies are using singleâcell transcriptomics to unravel the mechanisms of lymphoma evolution, drug resistance and therapeutic approaches. Various singleâcell multiâomics measurements involving genomics, transcriptomics and epigenomics have improved knowledge of the complex lymphatic system and made it possible to obtain individualized and precise tumor biological characteristics, which cannot be accessed from bulk cell analysis, and this can facilitate individualized treatment. In the present review, the advances in multiâomics analysis based on singleâcell assays of lymphoma specimens were systematically discussed, including the sequencing of the singleâcell from genomic and transcriptomic perspectives, the landscape of the lymphoma microenvironment, the development of singleâcell histology biomarkers, the identification of lymphoma origin and evolution, as well as the current challenges and future prospects of singleâcell multiâomics.

Different T-cell subsets in glioblastoma multiforme and targeted immunotherapy,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a brain tumor with a high mortality rate. Surgical resection combined with radiotherapy and chemotherapy is the standard treatment for GBM patients, but the 5-year survival rate of patients despite this treatment is low. Immunotherapy has attracted increasing attention in recent years. As the pioneer and the main effector cells of immunotherapy, T cells play a key role in tumor immunotherapy. However, the T cells in GBM microenvironment are inhibited by the highly immunosuppressive environment of GBM, posing huge challenges to T cell-based GBM immunotherapy. This review summarizes the effects of the GBM microenvironment on the infiltration and function of different T-cell subsets and the possible strategies to overcome immunosuppression, and thus enhance the effectiveness of GBM immunotherapy.",33022290,,10.1016/j.canlet.2020.09.028,33,Cancer letters,7600053,9.756,0.4786050319671631,0.8729096989966555,0.7859531772575251,0.618935594431134
Tetraspanins predict the prognosis and characterize the tumor immune microenvironment of glioblastoma,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive and lethal primary brain tumor. Conventional treatments have not achieved breakthroughs in improving survival. Therefore, novel molecular targets and biomarkers need to be identified. As signal transduction docks on the cell membrane, tetraspanins (TSPANs) are associated with various tumors; however, research on their role in GBM remains extremely scarce. Gene expression and clinicopathological characteristic data were obtained from GEPIA, CGGA, HPA, cBioPortal, and GSCA databases to analyze the mRNA and protein expression levels, prognostic value, clinical relevance, mutation status, and targeted drug sensitivity of TSPANs in GBM. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), Gene Ontology (GO), and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis were used for biological process enrichment. Data from TCGA and TCIA were used to construct the tumor immune microenvironment landscape of TSPANs. Different R software algorithms were used to analyze the immune score, immune cell infiltration, and immune checkpoint correlation. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed for TSPAN4, which had the most significant predictive prognostic value, and a nomogram model was constructed to predict individual outcomes. The expression and function of TSPAN4 were verified in vitro. TSPAN3/4/6/11/12/18/23/24/25/26/27/28/29/30/31expressions were significantly upregulated in GBM, and TSPAN3/4/6/11/18/24/25/26/29/30 were strongly correlated with prognosis. The expression of multiple TSPANs significantly correlated with 1p/19q co-deletion status, IDH mutation status, recurrence, age, and tumor grade. GSEA and GO analyses revealed the potential contribution of TSPANs in cell adhesion and migration. Immune correlation analysis revealed that TSPANs are related to the formation of the GBM tumor microenvironment (TME) and may influence immunotherapy outcomes. TSPAN4 is an independent prognostic factor and TSPAN4 knockdown has been demonstrated to strongly inhibit glioma cell proliferation, invasion, and migration in vitro. We comprehensively elaborated the prognostic value and potential role of differentially expressed TSPANs in GBM, including molecules that scientists have previously overlooked. This study provides a novel and comprehensive perspective on the pathological mechanisms of GBM and the future direction of individualized tumor immunotherapy, which may be a critical link between GBM malignant progression and TME remodeling.",37587203,PMC10432458,10.1038/s41598-023-40425-w,0,Scientific reports,101563288,4.996,0.4784527122974396,0.24414715719063546,0.36454849498327757,0.4088107578132464
The Association between Tumor-associated Macrophages and Glioblastoma: A Potential Target for Therapy,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common malignant brain tumor in adults, causing many deaths each year. The life expectancy of patients from the time of diagnosis does not exceed 15 months. Tumoral cells are generally surrounded by a bed of tumor microenvironment (TME), composed of various components such as different immune cells, stromal cells, and blood vessels. Previous studies on the treatment of this tumor have generally focused on cancerous cells and, therefore, have introduced conventional therapies for eradicating this tumor, including maximal safe surgery, chemotherapy with temozolomide (TMZ), and radiotherapy. Despite treatment with this method, tumors almost always recur, and life expectancy has not increased much. Recently, due to the discovery of the various roles of immune cells (including tumor-associated macrophages or TAMs) in the pathogenesis of this disease, the path of studies has moved towards targeting them as a treatment for glioblastoma. In this review, we aimed to investigate recent studies on the different roles of TME components, the role of TAM in the pathogenesis, and novel methods that target TAMs, including induction of TAM repolarization, inhibition of TAM-produced cytokines, and prohibition of immune system suppression induced by TAMs. In this regard, various targets, including colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF- 1) receptors, Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-ÎºB), or chemokine receptor (CXCR) pathways, are investigated.",34397322,,10.2174/1381612827666210816114003,4,Current pharmaceutical design,9602487,3.31,0.4775694012641907,0.5150501672240803,0.1806020066889632,0.4256720755411231
Ferroptosis heterogeneity within the tumor microenvironment revealed a genetic blueprint of breast cancer,"The tumor microenvironment (TME) significantly influences disease progression through immune infiltration, while ferroptosis, a recently discovered cell death mechanism, plays a crucial role in tumor suppression. However, its role in breast cancer is not clear. In this study, we analyzed bulk RNA and single-cell RNA sequencing data from 1217 samples, including 1104 breast cancer patients and 113 controls, to identify ferroptosis-related genes (FRGs) and construct a prognostic model. Using univariate cox regression, LASSO regression, and multivariate cox regression analysis, we discovered 21 FRGs and 3 TME-related immune cell types with prognostic value. Dimensionality reduction clustering and visualization were performed using the UMAP method, while the immune infiltration process was calculated with the TIP online tool. We employed GSEA enrichment analysis, WGCNA clustering analysis, and correlation analysis to examine functional differences, and the mutation analysis of the best and worst prognosis groups was conducted using the maftools package. Our findings revealed that knocking down the expression of the hub gene SLC39A7 significantly impacted cancer cell apoptosis and combining ferroptosis and TME scores yielded high prognostic power. Epithelial cells and B cells exhibited higher ferroptosis scores, which were independently associated with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) response and ICB gene expression. This study provides a foundation for further exploration of the relationship between ferroptosis and ICB response in breast cancer. In conclusion, we developed a prognostic model based on ferroptosis and infiltrated immune cells that effectively stratified breast cancer patients and demonstrated the role of SLC39A7 in breast cancer pathogenesis through the regulation of apoptosis.",38251953,,10.1002/tox.24142,0,Environmental toxicology,100885357,4.109,0.47715824842453003,0.24749163879598662,0.2408026755852843,0.3839538119309722
Tumor Cell Invasion and the Tumor Microenvironment: Special Focus on Brain Tumors,"Tumor cell invasion is a major issue in oncology since it leads to tumor dissemination and recurrence. In glioblastomas, invasion is an important characteristic, making the disease difficult to treat since tumor recurrence occurs from invasive areas at the borders of the resection cavity. We are discussing herein some of the principal mechanisms at a cellular and molecular level that are involved in glioblastoma invasion. These mechanisms are comprising tumor cell intrinsic factors as well as extrinsic factors and cues produced by the tumor microenvironment. Therapeutically interfering with tumor cell invasion may be useful to improve the clinical outcomes of glioblastoma patients.",34664236,,10.1007/978-3-030-73119-9_6,2,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,0.0,0.476533979177475,0.4180602006688963,0.11371237458193979,0.3922749025566522
An miR-340-5p-macrophage feedback loop modulates the progression and tumor microenvironment of glioblastoma multiforme,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to be involved in the progression and tumor microenvironment of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Our previous research has indicated that miR-340-5p has an antitumor effect in vitro. However, the role of miR-340-5p in GBM has not been fully elucidated. Here, we show that downregulation of miR-340-5p in GBM is correlated with tumor size, recurrence, and poor survival. Moreover, we found that miR-340-5p levels are correlated with the density of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and M2-polarized TAMs in GBM. Biofunctional investigations revealed that downregulation of miR-340-5p promoted TAM recruitment and M2-TAMs polarization in vitro and in vivo. In addition, we found that upregulation of miR-340-5p inhibited tumor growth and was associated with good prognosis in vivo. Through gene expression profiles and bioinformatics analysis, we showed that miR-340-5p directly targets POSTN, which recruited TAMs through integrin Î±vÎ²3. Downregulation of miR-340-5p in GBM did not induce the differentiation of TAMs into polarized M2 cells but was able to promote the M2 polarization of TAMs through directly targeting LTBP-1. Furthermore, we found that M2-TAMs promoted tumorigenesis and were associated with a poor prognosis in vivo. In an in vitro study, we demonstrated that M2-TAMs inhibited miR-340-5p expression in GBM cells by upregulation of TGFÎ²-1, which increased HMGA-2 expression in GBM. A ChIP assay confirmed that HMGA-2 transcriptionally suppressed miR-340-5p expression. Patients with low-miR-340-5p expression, high CD163, high POSTN, high LIBP1 levels, and high HMGA-2 had a poor prognosis with shorter overall survival, confirming data from the TCGA database. These findings suggest that an miR-340-5p-macrophage feedback loop modulates the progression and tumor microenvironment of GBM and may represent a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic strategy for GBM.",31427735,,10.1038/s41388-019-0952-x,37,Oncogene,8711562,8.756,0.47598591446876526,0.8896321070234113,0.6421404682274248,0.5919460637314263
Integrated analysis of single-cell sequencing and weighted co-expression network identifies a novel signature based on cellular senescence-related genes to predict prognosis in glioblastoma,"Background:Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly aggressive cancer with heavy mortality rates and poor prognosis. Cellular senescence exerts a pivotal influence on the development and progression of various cancers. However, the underlying effect of cellular senescence on the outcomes of patients with GBM remains to be elucidated.Methods:Transcriptome RNA sequencing data with clinical information and single-cell sequencing data of GBM cases were obtained from CGGA, TCGA, and GEO (GSE84465) databases respectively. Single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) analysis was utilized to calculate the cellular senescence score. WGCNA analysis was employed to ascertain the key gene modules and identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with the cellular senescence score in GBM. The prognostic senescence-related risk model was developed by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analyses. The immune infiltration level was calculated by microenvironment cell populations counter (MCPcounter), ssGSEA, and xCell algorithms. Potential anti-cancer small molecular compounds of GBM were estimated by ""oncoPredict"" R package.Results:A total of 150 DEGs were selected from the pink module through WGCNA analysis. The risk-scoring model was constructed based on 5 cell senescence-associated genes (CCDC151, DRC1, C2orf73, CCDC13, and WDR63). Patients in low-risk group had a better prognostic value compared to those in high-risk group. The nomogram exhibited excellent predictive performance in assessing the survival outcomes of patients with GBM. Top 30 potential anti-cancer small molecular compounds with higher drug sensitivity scores were predicted.Conclusion:Cellular senescence-related genes and clusters in GBM have the potential to provide valuable insights in prognosis and guide clinical decisions.",37565732,,10.1002/tox.23921,0,Environmental toxicology,100885357,4.109,0.47598591446876526,0.2508361204013378,0.24414715719063546,0.38458820419965384
Relationships of tumor differentiation and immune infiltration in gastric cancers revealed by single-cell RNA-seq analyses,"Gastric cancers are highly heterogeneous malignant tumors. To reveal the relationship between differentiation status of cancer cells and tumor immune microenvironments in gastric cancer, single-cell RNA-sequencing was performed on normal mucosa tissue, differentiated gastric cancer (DGC) tissue, poorly differentiated gastric cancer (PDGC) tissue and neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC) tissue sampled from surgically resected gastric cancer specimens. We identified the signature genes for both DGC and PDGC, and found that signature genes of PDGC strongly enriched in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) program. Furthermore, we found that DGC tends to be immune-rich type whereas PDGC tends to be immune-poor type defined according to the density of tumor-infiltrating CD8+T cells. Additionally, interferon alpha and gamma responding genes were specifically expressed in the immune-rich malignant cells compared with immune-poor malignant cells. Through analyzing the mixed adenoneuroendocrine carcinoma, we identified intermediate state malignant cells during the trans-differentiation process from DGC to NEC, which showed double-negative expressions of both DGC marker genes and NEC marker genes. Interferon-related pathways were gradually downregulated along the DGC to NEC trans-differentiation path, which was accompanied by reduced CD8+cytotoxic T-cell infiltration. In summary, molecular features of both malignant cells and immune microenvironment cells of DGC, PDGC and NEC were systematically revealed, which may partially explain the strong tumor heterogeneities of gastric cancer. Especially along the DGC to NEC trans-differentiation path, immune-evasion was gradually enhanced with the decreasing activities of interferon pathway responses in malignant cells.",36729271,PMC9894979,10.1007/s00018-023-04702-1,6,Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS,9705402,9.207,0.4756357669830322,0.5886287625418061,0.7591973244147158,0.5549466775811237
Cross-species cell-type assignment from single-cell RNA-seq data by a heterogeneous graph neural network,"Cross-species comparative analyses of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data allow us to explore, at single-cell resolution, the origins of the cellular diversity and evolutionary mechanisms that shape cellular form and function. Cell-type assignment is a crucial step to achieve that. However, the poorly annotated genome and limited known biomarkers hinder us from assigning cell identities for nonmodel species. Here, we design a heterogeneous graph neural network model, CAME, to learn aligned and interpretable cell and gene embeddings for cross-species cell-type assignment and gene module extraction from scRNA-seq data. CAME achieves significant improvements in cell-type characterization across distant species owing to the utilization of non-one-to-one homologous gene mapping ignored by early methods. Our large-scale benchmarking study shows that CAME significantly outperforms five classical methods in terms of cell-type assignment and model robustness to insufficiency and inconsistency of sequencing depths. CAME can transfer the major cell types and interneuron subtypes of human brains to mouse and discover shared cell-type-specific functions in homologous gene modules. CAME can align the trajectories of human and macaque spermatogenesis and reveal their conservative expression dynamics. In short, CAME can make accurate cross-species cell-type assignments even for nonmodel species and uncover shared and divergent characteristics between two species from scRNA-seq data.",36526433,PMC9977153,10.1101/gr.276868.122,8,Genome research,9518021,9.438,0.47460073232650757,0.6521739130434783,0.7692307692307693,0.5690413758507541
Integrated analysis of single-cell RNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq to unravel the molecular mechanisms underlying the immune microenvironment in the development of intestinal-type gastric cancer,"Intestinal-type gastric cancer (IGC) is the most frequent type of gastric cancer in high-incidence populations. The early stages of IGC growth successively include nonatrophic gastritis (NAG), chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG) and intestinal metaplasia (IM). However, the mechanisms of IGC development through these stages remain unclear. For this study, single-cell RNA-seq data related to IGC were downloaded from the GEO database, and immune cells of the tumor microenvironment (TME) were annotated using R software. Changes in the proportion of immune cells and altered cell-to-cell interactions were explored at different disease stages using R software, with a focus on plasma cells. Additionally, IGC samples from the TCGA database were used for immune cell infiltration analysis, and a Cox proportional risk regression model was constructed to identify possible prognostic genes. The results indicated that for precancerous lesions, interactions between immune cells were mainly dominated by chemokines to stimulate the infiltration and activation of immune cells. In tumors, intercellular movement of upregulated molecules and amplified signals were associated with the tumor necrosis factor family and immunosuppression to escape immune surveillance and promote tumor growth. Regarding prognostic analysis, IGLC3, IGLV1-44, IGKV1-16, IGHV3-21, IGLV1-51, and IGLV3-19 were found to be novel biomarkers for IGC. Our analysis of the IGC single-cell atlas together with bulk transcriptome data contributes to understanding TME heterogeneity at the molecular level during IGC development and provides insights for elucidating the mechanism of IGC and discovering novel targets for precise therapy.",37591405,,10.1016/j.bbadis.2023.166849,2,Biochimica et biophysica acta.

"Pyroptosis-related prognosis model, immunocyte infiltration characterization, and competing endogenous RNA network of glioblastoma","Background:Glioblastoma (GBM) has a high incidence rate, invasive growth, and easy recurrence, and the current therapeutic effect is less than satisfying. Pyroptosis plays an important role in morbidity and progress of GBM. Meanwhile, the tumor microenvironment (TME) is involved in the progress and treatment tolerance of GBM. In the present study, we analyzed prognosis model, immunocyte infiltration characterization, and competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network of GBM on the basis of pyroptosis-related genes (PRGs).Methods:The transcriptome and clinical data of 155 patients with GBM and 120 normal subjects were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx). Lasso (Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) Cox expression analysis was used in predicting prognostic markers, and its predictive ability was tested using a nomogram. A prognostic risk score formula was constructed, and CIBERSORT, ssGSEA algorithm, Tumor IMmune Estimation Resource (TIMER), and TISIDB database were used in evaluating the immunocyte infiltration characterization and tumor immune response of differential risk samples. A ceRNA network was constructed with Starbase, mirtarbase, and lncbase, and the mechanism of this regulatory axis was explored using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA).Results:Five PRGs (CASP3, NLRP2, TP63, GZMB, and CASP9) were identified as the independent prognostic biomarkers of GBM. Prognostic risk score formula analysis showed that the low-risk group had obvious survival advantage compared with the high-risk group, and significant differences in immunocyte infiltration and immune related function score were found. In addition, a ceRNA network of messenger RNA (CASP3, TP63)-microRNA (hsa-miR-519c-5p)-long noncoding RNA (GABPB1-AS1) was established. GSEA analysis showed that the regulatory axis played a considerable role in the extracellular matrix (ECM) and immune inflammatory response.Conclusions:Pyroptosis and TME-related independent prognostic markers were screened in this study, and a prognosis risk score formula was established for the first time according to the prognosis PRGs. TME immunocyte infiltration characterization and immune response were assessed using ssGSEA, CIBERSORT algorithm, TIMER, and TISIDB database. Besides a ceRNA network was built up. This study not only laid foundations for further exploring pyroptosis and TME in improving prognosis of GBM, but also provided a new idea for more effective guidance on clinical immunotherapy to patients and developing new immunotherapeutic drugs.",35658846,PMC9166343,10.1186/s12885-022-09706-x,3,BMC cancer,100967800,4.638,0.47411373257637024,0.4816053511705686,0.3210702341137124,0.4450033566026784
Transcriptomic and genomic profiling of multiple primary colorectal cancers reveals intratumor heterogeneity and a distinct immune microenvironment,"This study reported on the intratumor genomic and immunological heterogeneity of different tumor lesions from a single patient with multiple primary colorectal cancer (MPCC). The goal of this study was to explore the molecular and microenvironment characteristics of tumor lesions from different primary sites in a patient with MPCC. A total of three tumor lesions located in the hepatic flexure of the transverse colon, sigmoid colon, and rectum were collected from a 72-year-old male patient with MPCC. All three tumor samples were examined by using whole-exome sequencing (WES) and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). The transcriptome data of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) colon cancer (COAD) dataset were explored to characterize the biological impacts of certain immune cells. Only three nonsynonymous mutations were shared by all of the tumor lesions, whereas a number of single nucleotide variant (SNV) and copy number variation (CNV) mutations were shared by tumor samples from the sigmoid colon and rectum. Transcriptomic analysis showed that tumor lesions derived from the transverse colon had decreased levels of RTK, ERK, and AKT pathway activity, thus suggesting lower oncogenic properties in the transverse lesion compared to the other two samples. Further immune landscape evaluation by using single-cell transcriptomic analysis displayed significant intratumor heterogeneity in MPCC. Specifically, more abundant mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cell infiltration was found in transverse colon tumor lesions. Afterwards, we found that higher MAIT cell infiltration may correlate with a better prognosis of patients with colon cancer (immunohistochemical status was MSI-L/pMMR) by using a publicly available TCGA dataset.",38016348,,10.1016/j.intimp.2023.111276,0,International immunopharmacology,100965259,5.714,0.4732007682323456,0.25418060200668896,0.3879598662207358,0.4123485545848923
Expression and Prognostic Value of CD80 and CD86 in the Tumor Microenvironment of Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma,"Background:Strategies to modulate the tumor microenvironment (TME) have opened new therapeutic avenues with dramatic yet heterogeneous intertumoral efficacy in multiple cancers, including glioblastomas (GBMs). Therefore, investigating molecular actors of TME may help understand the interactions between tumor cells and TME. Immune checkpoint proteins such as a Cluster of Differentiation 80 (CD80) and CD86 are expressed on the surface of tumor cells and infiltrative tumor lymphocytes. However, their expression and prognostic value in GBM microenvironment are still unclear.Methods:In this study, we investigated, in a retrospective local discovery cohort and a validation TCGA dataset, expression of CD80 and CD86 at mRNA level and their prognostic significance in response to standard of care. Furthermore, CD80 and CD86 at the protein level were investigated in the discovery cohort.Results:Both CD80 and CD86 are expressed heterogeneously in the TME at mRNA and protein levels. In a univariate analysis, the mRNA expression of CD80 and CD86 was not significantly correlated with OS in both local OncoNeuroTek dataset and TCGA datasets. CD80 and CD86 mRNA high expression was significantly associated with shorter progression free survival (PFS) (p< 0.05). These findings were validated using the TCGA cohort; higher CD80 and CD86 expressions were correlated with shorter PFS (p< 0.05). In multivariate analysis, CD86 mRNA expression was an independent prognostic factor for PFS in the TCGA dataset only (p< 0.05).Conclusion:CD86 could be used as a potential biomarker for the prognosis of GBM patients treated with immunotherapy; however, additional studies are needed to validate these findings.",35022089,,10.1017/cjn.2022.5,2,The Canadian journal of neurological sciences.

An optimized graph-based structure for single-cell RNA-seq cell-type classification based on non-linear dimension reduction,"Background:It is now possible to analyze cellular heterogeneity at the single-cell level thanks to the rapid developments in single-cell sequencing technologies. The clustering of cells is a fundamental and common step in heterogeneity analysis. Even so, accurate cell clustering remains a challenge due to the high levels of noise, the high dimensions, and the high sparsity of data.Results:Here, we present SCEA, a clustering approach for scRNA-seq data. Using two consecutive units, an encoder based on MLP and a graph attention auto-encoder, to obtain cell embedding and gene embedding, SCEA can simultaneously achieve cell low-dimensional representation and clustering performing various examinations to obtain the optimal value for each parameter, the presented result is in its most optimal form. To evaluate the performance of SCEA, we performed it on several real scRNA-seq datasets for clustering and visualization analysis.Conclusions:The experimental results show that SCEA generally outperforms several popular single-cell analysis methods. As a result of using all available datasets, SCEA, in average, improves clustering accuracy by 4.4% in ARI Parameters over the well-known method scGAC. Also, the accuracy improvement of 11.65% is achieved by SCEA, compared to the Seurat model.",37127578,PMC10152777,10.1186/s12864-023-09344-y,1,BMC genomics,100965258,4.547,0.4723031222820282,0.3377926421404682,0.30434782608695654,0.41180996701470185
Targeting Microglial Metabolic Rewiring Synergizes with Immune-Checkpoint Blockade Therapy for Glioblastoma,"Glioblastoma (GBM) constitutes the most lethal primary brain tumor for which immunotherapy has provided limited benefit. The unique brain immune landscape is reflected in a complex tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) in GBM. Here, single-cell sequencing of the GBM TIME revealed that microglia were under severe oxidative stress, which induced nuclear receptor subfamily 4 group A member 2 (NR4A2)-dependent transcriptional activity in microglia. Heterozygous Nr4a2 (Nr4a2+/-) or CX3CR1+ myeloid cell-specific Nr4a2 (Nr4a2fl/flCx3cr1Cre) genetic targeting reshaped microglia plasticity in vivo by reducing alternatively activated microglia and enhancing antigen presentation capacity for CD8+ T cells in GBM. In microglia, NR4A2 activated squalene monooxygenase (SQLE) to dysregulate cholesterol homeostasis. Pharmacologic NR4A2 inhibition attenuated the protumorigenic TIME, and targeting the NR4A2 or SQLE enhanced the therapeutic efficacy of immune-checkpoint blockade in vivo. Collectively, oxidative stress promotes tumor growth through NR4A2-SQLE activity in microglia, informing novel immune therapy paradigms in brain cancer.Significance:Metabolic reprogramming of microglia in GBM informs synergistic vulnerabilities for immune-checkpoint blockade therapy in this immunologically cold brain tumor.
