However, little is known about which ML classifier, omics data, or        upstream dimension reduction strategy has the strongest influence on prediction        quality in such settings. Our study aimed to illustrate and compare different        machine learning strategies to predict CVD risk factors under different        scenarios. METHODS: We compared the use of six ML classifiers in predicting CVD        risk factors using blood-derived metabolomics, epigenetics and transcriptomics        data. Upstream omic dimension reduction was performed using either unsupervised        or semi-supervised autoencoders, whose downstream ML classifier performance we        compared. CVD risk factors included systolic and diastolic blood pressure        measurements and ultrasound-based biomarkers of left ventricular diastolic        dysfunction (LVDD; E/e' ratio, E/A ratio, LAVI) collected from 1,249 Finnish        participants, of which 80% were used for model fitting. We predicted individuals        with low, high or average levels of CVD risk factors, the latter class being the        most common. We constructed multi-omic predictions using a meta-learner that        weighted single-omic predictions. Model performance comparisons were based on the        F1 score. Finally, we investigated whether learned omic representations from        pre-trained semi-supervised autoencoders could improve outcome prediction in an        external cohort using transfer learning. RESULTS: Depending on the ML classifier        or omic used, the quality of single-omic predictions varied. Multi-omics        predictions outperformed single-omics predictions in most cases, particularly in        the prediction of individuals with high or low CVD risk factor levels.        Semi-supervised autoencoders improved downstream predictions compared to the use        of unsupervised autoencoders. In addition, median gains in Area Under the Curve        by transfer learning compared to modelling from scratch ranged from 0.09 to 0.14        and 0.07 to 0.11 units for transcriptomic and metabolomic data, respectively.        CONCLUSIONS: By illustrating the use of different machine learning strategies in        different scenarios, our study provides a platform for researchers to evaluate        how the choice of omics, ML classifiers, and dimension reduction can influence        the quality of CVD risk factor predictions.",PMC11064347,BMC medical informatics and decision making,101088682

The incorporation of multi-omics data specific to cancer        has demonstrated the capacity to enhance our comprehension of the molecular        mechanisms underpinning carcinogenesis. This report elucidates how the        integration of comprehensive data on methylation, gene expression, and copy        number variations can effectively facilitate the unsupervised clustering of        cancer samples. We have identified regressors that can effectively classify tumor        and normal samples with an optimal integration of RNA sequencing, DNA        methylation, and copy number variation while also achieving significant p-values.        Further, these regressors were trained using linear and logistic regression with        k-means clustering.

Conventional machine        learning techniques are not ideal for analyzing the complex interrelationships        among different categories of omics data. Numerous models have been suggested        using graph-based learning to uncover veiled representations and network        formations unique to distinct types of omics data to heighten predictions        regarding cancers and characterize patients' profiles, amongst other applications        aimed at improving disease management in medical research. The existing        graph-based state-of-the-art multi-omics integration approaches for cancer        subtype prediction, MOGONET, and SUPREME, use a graph convolutional network        (GCN), which fails to consider the level of importance of neighboring nodes on a        particular node. To address this gap, we hypothesize that paying attention to        each neighbor or providing appropriate weights to neighbors based on their        importance might improve the cancer subtype prediction. The natural choice to        determine the importance of each neighbor of a node in a graph is to explore the        graph attention network (GAT).

Methods: This        paper proposes a multi-omics data fusion algorithm based on a multi-view graph        neural network (MVGNN) for predicting cancer differentiation and subtype        classification. The model framework consists of a graph convolutional network        (GCN) module for learning features from different omics data and an attention        module for integrating multi-omics data.

In        this paper, we propose a deep learning method for multi-omics integration with        incomplete data by Cross-omics Linked unified embedding with Contrastive Learning        and Self Attention (CLCLSA). Utilizing complete multi-omics data as supervision,        the model employs cross-omics autoencoders to learn the feature representation        across different types of biological data. The multi-omics contrastive learning        is employed, which maximizes the mutual information between different types of        omics. In addition, the feature-level self-attention and omics-level        self-attention are employed to dynamically identify the most informative features        for multi-omics data integration.

Even with expert domain        knowledge, discerning the biological processes involved is a time-consuming        activity. Here we propose PathIntegrate, a method for integrating multi-omics        datasets based on pathways, designed to exploit knowledge of biological systems        and thus provide interpretable models for such studies.

Model outputs include multi-omics        pathways ranked by their contribution to the outcome prediction, the contribution        of each omics layer, and the importance of each molecule in a pathway.

However, existing research based on supervised        learning algorithms often fails to fully harness the information from unlabeled        nodes and overlooks the latent features within and among different omics, as well        as the various associations among features. Here, we present a novel multi-omics        integrative method MOSEGCN, based on the Transformer multi-head self-attention        mechanism and Graph Convolutional Networks(GCN),        withÂ theÂ aimÂ ofÂ enhancingÂ theÂ accuracyÂ ofÂ complexÂ diseaseÂ classification. MOSEGCN        first employs the Transformer multi-head self-attention mechanism and Similarity        Network Fusion (SNF) to separately learn the inherent correlations of latent        features within and among different omics, constructing a comprehensive view of        diseases. Subsequently, it feeds the learned crucial information into a        self-ensembling Graph Convolutional Network (SEGCN) built upon semi-supervised        learning methods for training and testing, facilitating a better analysis and        utilization of information from multi-omics data to achieve precise        classification of disease subtypes. RESULTS: The experimental results show that        MOSEGCN outperforms several state-of-the-art multi-omics integrative analysis        approaches on three types of omics data: mRNA expression data, microRNA        expression data, and DNA methylation data, with accuracy rates of 83.0% for        Alzheimer's disease and 86.7% for breast cancer subtyping.

Integrating multi-omics data has been proven to be effective for        building more precise classification models. Most current multi-omics integrative        models use either an early fusion in the form of concatenation or late fusion        with a separate feature extractor for each omic, which are mainly based on deep        neural networks. Due to the nature of biological systems, graphs are a better        structural representation of bio-medical data. Although few graph neural network        (GNN) based multi-omics integrative methods have been proposed, they suffer from        three common disadvantages. One is most of them use only one type of connection,        either inter-omics or intra-omic connection; second, they only consider one kind        of GNN layer, either graph convolution network (GCN) or graph attention network        (GAT); and third, most of these methods have not been tested on a more complex        classification task, such as cancer molecular subtypes. RESULTS: In this study,        we propose a novel end-to-end multi-omics GNN framework for accurate and robust        cancer subtype classification.

Importantly, using learning-based        models to distinguish the disease and control samples is expected to identify        important biomarkers more accurately than abundance-based statistical analysis.        However, available tools have not fully addressed two challenges associated with        this task: limited labeled microbiome data and decreased accuracy in        cross-studies. The confounding factors, such as the diet, technical biases in        sample collection/sequencing across different studies/cohorts often jeopardize        the generalization of the learning model.

Proximal femoral        strengths for specific loading conditions can be computed by subject-specific        finite element analysis (FEA) using quantitative computerized tomography (QCT)        images. However, the radiation and availability of QCT limit its clinical        usability. Alternative low-dose and widely available measurements, such as dual        energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and genetic factors, would be preferable for        bone strength assessment. The aim of this paper is to design a deep        learning-based model to predict proximal femoral strength using multi-view        information fusion. RESULTS: We developed new models using multi-view variational        autoencoder (MVAE) for feature representation learning and a product of expert        (PoE) model for multi-view information fusion. We applied the proposed models to        an in-house Louisiana Osteoporosis Study (LOS) cohort with 931 male subjects,        including 345 African Americans and 586 Caucasians. We performed genome-wide        association studies (GWAS) to select 256 genetic variants with the lowest        p-values for each proximal femoral strength and integrated whole genome sequence        (WGS) features and DXA-derived imaging features to predict proximal femoral        strength.

Additionally, the partial availability of these multimodal data        presents a challenge in developing these predictive models. METHOD: To address        these challenges, we developed DeepGAMI, an interpretable neural network model to        improve genotype-phenotype prediction from multimodal data. DeepGAMI leverages        functional genomic information, such as eQTLs and gene regulation, to guide        neural network connections.

37873011,"Multi-View Variational Autoencoder for Missing Value Imputation in Untargeted        Metabolomics.",,"BACKGROUND: Missing data is a common challenge in mass spectrometry-based        metabolomics, which can lead to biased and incomplete analyses. The integration        of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data with metabolomics data has emerged as a        promising approach to enhance the accuracy of data imputation in metabolomics        studies. METHOD: In this study, we propose a novel method that leverages the        information from WGS data and reference metabolites to impute unknown        metabolites. Our approach utilizes a multi-view variational autoencoder to        jointly model the burden score, polygenetic risk score (PGS), and linkage        disequilibrium (LD) pruned single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for feature        extraction and missing metabolomics data imputation. By learning the latent        representations of both omics data, our method can effectively impute missing        metabolomics values based on genomic information. RESULTS: We evaluate the        performance of our method on empirical metabolomics datasets with missing values        and demonstrate its superiority compared to conventional imputation techniques.        Using 35 template metabolites derived burden scores, PGS and LD-pruned SNPs, the        proposed methods achieved R2-scores > 0.01 for 71.55% of metabolites. CONCLUSION:        The integration of WGS data in metabolomics imputation not only improves data        completeness but also enhances downstream analyses, paving the way for more        comprehensive and accurate investigations of metabolic pathways and disease        associations. Our findings offer valuable insights into the potential benefits of        utilizing WGS data for metabolomics data imputation and underscore the importance        of leveraging multi-modal data integration in precision medicine research.",PMC10593076,ArXiv,101759493

In this paper, we propose a novel multi-modal data fusion method that        addresses these limitations.

Three omics        datasets comprising gene expression, DNA methylation and microRNA expression data        were integrated while considering the biological relationships among them, and a        self-attention module was applied to each omics dataset to capture the relative        importance of each feature. The features were then transformed to new        representations considering the respective learned importance, allowing        moBRCA-net to predict the subtype. CONCLUSIONS: Experimental results confirmed        that moBRCA-net has a significantly enhanced performance compared with other        methods, and the effectiveness of multi-omics integration and omics-level        attention were identified. moBRCA-net is publicly available at        https://github.com/cbi-bioinfo/moBRCA-net .",PMC10131354,BMC bioinformatics,100965194

Each omics technique only        provides a limited view of the underlying biological process and integrating        heterogeneous omics layers simultaneously would lead to a more comprehensive and        detailed understanding of diseases and phenotypes. However, one obstacle faced        when performing multi-omics data integration is the existence of unpaired        multi-omics data due to instrument sensitivity and cost. Studies may fail if        certain aspects of the subjects are missing or incomplete. In this paper, we        propose a deep learning method for multi-omics integration with incomplete data        by Cross-omics Linked unified embedding with Contrastive Learning and Self        Attention (CLCLSA). Utilizing complete multi-omics data as supervision, the model        employs cross-omics autoencoders to learn the feature representation across        different types of biological data. The multi-omics contrastive learning, which        is used to maximize the mutual information between different types of omics, is        employed before latent feature concatenation. In addition, the feature-level        self-attention and omics-level self-attention are employed to dynamically        identify the most informative features for multi-omics data integration.        Extensive experiments were conducted on four public multi-omics datasets.

DNA methylation alterations play a crucial        role in carcinogenesis and mark cell fate differentiation, thus can be used to        trace tumor tissue of origin. In this study, we employed a novel        tumor-type-specific hierarchical model using genome-scale DNA methylation data to        develop a multilayer perceptron model, HiTAIC, to trace tissue of origin and        tumor type in 27 cancers from 23 tissue sites in data from 7735 tumors with high        resolution, accuracy, and specificity. In tracing primary cancer origin, HiTAIC        accuracy was 99% in the test set and 93% in the external validation data set.        Metastatic cancers were identified with a 96% accuracy in the external data set.        HiTAIC is a user-friendly web-based application through        https://sites.dartmouth.edu/salaslabhitaic/.

We performed        retrospective evaluations of 133 patients with pathologically confirmed PTC, who        were assigned to the training cohort and validation cohort (7â:â3), and extracted        radiomics features from the preoperative US, T2-weighted        (T2WI),diffusion-weighted (DWI), and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted (CE-T1WI)        images. Optimal subsets were selected using minimum redundancy, maximum        relevance, and recursive feature elimination in the support vector machine (SVM).        For LNM prediction, the radiomics model was constructed by SVM, and Multi-Omics        Graph cOnvolutional NETworks (MOGONET) was used for the effective classification        of multiradiomics data.

Yet, a systematic        benchmarking of those methods using various combinations of omics data for the        prediction of asthma development is still lacking. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to        investigate the computational methods in disease status prediction using        multi-omics data. METHOD: We systematically benchmarked 18 computational methods        using all the 63 combinations of six omics data (GWAS, miRNA, mRNA, microbiome,        metabolome, DNA methylation) collected in The Vitamin D Antenatal Asthma        Reduction Trial (VDAART) cohort.

Presently, the majority        of studies rely far too heavily on gene expression data, omitting the enormous        power of multi-omics fusion data and the potential for patient similarities.        Method: In this study, we created a gastric cancer subtype classification model        called RRGCN based on residual graph convolutional network (GCN) using        multi-omics fusion data and patient similarity network. Given the multi-omics        data's high dimensionality, we built an artificial neural network Autoencoder        (AE) to reduce the dimensionality of the data and extract hidden layer features.        The model is then built using the feature data. In addition, we computed the        correlation between patients using the Pearson correlation coefficient, and this        relationship between patients forms the edge of the graph structure. Four graph        convolutional network layers and two residual networks with skip connections make        up RRGCN, which reduces the amount of information lost during transmission        between layers and prevents model degradation. Results: The results show that        RRGCN significantly outperforms other classification methods with an accuracy as        high as 0.87 when compared to four other traditional machine learning methods and        deep learning models.

Accurately        identifying TF-DNA bindings and constructing their relationships with chromatin        features is a long-standing goal in the bioinformatic field. However, this has        remained elusive due to the complex binding mechanisms and heterogeneity among        inputs. Here, we have developed the GHTNet (General Hybrid Transformer Network),        a transformer-based model to predict TF-DNA binding specificity. The GHTNet        decodes the relationship between tissue-specific TF-DNA binding and chromatin        features via a specific input scheme of alternative inputs and reveals important        gene regions and tissue-specific motifs. Our experiments show that the GHTNet has        excellent performance, achieving about a 5% absolute improvement over existing        methods. The TF-DNA binding mechanism analysis shows that the importance of        TF-DNA binding features varies across tissues. The best predictor is based on the        DNA sequence, followed by epigenomics and shape. In addition, cross-species        studies address the limited data, thus providing new ideas in this case.        Moreover, the GHTNet is applied to interpret the relationship among TFs,        chromatin features, and diseases associated with AD46 tissue.

To        efficiently analyze the big pan-cancer methylation data and to overcome the        co-methylation phenomenon, a MapReduce-based distributed and parallel-designed        partial least squares approach was proposed. The large-scale high-dimensional        methylation data were first decomposed into distributed blocks according to their        genome locations. A distributed and parallel data processing strategy was        proposed based on the framework of MapReduce, and then latent variables were        further extracted for each distributed block. A set of pan-cancer signatures        through a differential co-expression network followed by statistical tests was        further identified based on their gene expression profiles.

The        rumen microbiome can digest dietary components into utilizable sugars, proteins,        and volatile fatty acids, contributing to the energy intake and feed efficiency        of dairy animals, which has become one target of the basis for omics applications        in dairy science. Rumen, liver, and mammary gland are also frequently targeted in        omics because of their crucial impact on dairy animals' energy metabolism,        production performance, and health status. The application of omics has made        outstanding contributions to a more profound understanding of the physiology,        etiology, and optimizing the management strategy of dairy animals, while the        multi-omics method could draw information of different levels and organs        together, providing an unprecedented broad scope on traits of dairy animals. This        article reviewed recent omics and multi-omics researches on physiology, feeding,        and pathology on dairy animals and also performed the potential of multi-omics on        systematic dairy research.",PMC8955540,Metabolites,101578790
35154283,Machine Learning: A New Prospect in Multi-Omics Data Analysis of Cancer.,10.3389/fgene.2022.824451,"Cancer is defined as a large group of diseases that is associated with abnormal        cell growth, uncontrollable cell division, and may tend to impinge on other        tissues of the body by different mechanisms through metastasis. What makes cancer        so important is that the cancer incidence rate is growing worldwide which can        have major health, economic, and even social impacts on both patients and the        governments. Thereby, the early cancer prognosis, diagnosis, and treatment can        play a crucial role at the front line of combating cancer. The onset and        progression of cancer can occur under the influence of complicated mechanisms and        some alterations in the level of genome, proteome, transcriptome, metabolome etc.        Consequently, the advent of omics science and its broad research branches (such        as genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, and so forth) as        revolutionary biological approaches have opened new doors to the comprehensive        perception of the cancer landscape. Due to the complexities of the formation and        development of cancer, the study of mechanisms underlying cancer has gone beyond        just one field of the omics arena. Therefore, making a connection between the        resultant data from different branches of omics science and examining them in a        multi-omics field can pave the way for facilitating the discovery of novel        prognostic, diagnostic, and therapeutic approaches. As the volume and complexity        of data from the omics studies in cancer are increasing dramatically, the use of        leading-edge technologies such as machine learning can have a promising role in        the assessments of cancer research resultant data. Machine learning is        categorized as a subset of artificial intelligence which aims to data parsing,        classification, and data pattern identification by applying statistical methods        and algorithms. This acquired knowledge subsequently allows computers to learn        and improve accurate predictions through experiences from data processing. In        this context, the application of machine learning, as a novel computational        technology offers new opportunities for achieving in-depth knowledge of cancer by        analysis of resultant data from multi-omics studies. Therefore, it can be        concluded that the use of artificial intelligence technologies such as machine        learning can have revolutionary roles in the fight against cancer.",PMC8829119,Frontiers in genetics,101560621
35111809,Computational Methods for Single-Cell Imaging and Omics Data Integration.,10.3389/fmolb.2021.768106,"Integrating single cell omics and single cell imaging allows for a more effective        characterisation of the underlying mechanisms that drive a phenotype at the        tissue level, creating a comprehensive profile at the cellular level. Although        the use of imaging data is well established in biomedical research, its primary        application has been to observe phenotypes at the tissue or organ level, often        using medical imaging techniques such as MRI, CT, and PET. These imaging        technologies complement omics-based data in biomedical research because they are        helpful for identifying associations between genotype and phenotype, along with        functional changes occurring at the tissue level. Single cell imaging can act as        an intermediary between these levels. Meanwhile new technologies continue to        arrive that can be used to interrogate the genome of single cells and its related        omics datasets. As these two areas, single cell imaging and single cell omics,        each advance independently with the development of novel techniques, the        opportunity to integrate these data types becomes more and more attractive. This        review outlines some of the technologies and methods currently available for        generating, processing, and analysing single-cell omics- and imaging data, and        how they could be integrated to further our understanding of complex biological        phenomena like ageing. We include an emphasis on machine learning algorithms        because of their ability to identify complex patterns in large multidimensional        data.",PMC8801747,Frontiers in molecular biosciences,101653173

A systems biology approach to studying AD        involves analyses of various body systems, biological scales, environmental        elements, and clinical outcomes to understand the genotype to phenotype        relationship that potentially drives AD development. Currently, there are many        research investigations probing how modifiable and nonmodifiable factors impact        AD symptom presentation. This review specifically focuses on how imaging        modalities can be integrated into systems biology approaches using model mouse        populations to link brain level functional and structural changes to disease        onset and progression. Combining imaging and omics data promotes the        classification of AD into subtypes and paves the way for precision medicine        solutions to prevent and treat AD.",PMC10112395,Neurobiology of disease,9500169
34638627,"Risk Prediction of Cardiovascular Events by Exploration of Molecular Data with        Explainable Artificial Intelligence.",10.3390/ijms221910291,"Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) annually take almost 18 million lives worldwide.        Most lethal events occur months or years after the initial presentation. Indeed,        many patients experience repeated complications or require multiple interventions        (recurrent events). Apart from affecting the individual, this leads to high        medical costs for society. Personalized treatment strategies aiming at prediction        and prevention of recurrent events rely on early diagnosis and precise prognosis.        Complementing the traditional environmental and clinical risk factors,        multi-omics data provide a holistic view of the patient and disease progression,        enabling studies to probe novel angles in risk stratification. Specifically,        predictive molecular markers allow insights into regulatory networks, pathways,        and mechanisms underlying disease. Moreover, artificial intelligence (AI)        represents a powerful, yet adaptive, framework able to recognize complex patterns        in large-scale clinical and molecular data with the potential to improve risk        prediction. Here, we review the most recent advances in risk prediction of        recurrent cardiovascular events, and discuss the value of molecular data and        biomarkers for understanding patient risk in a systems biology context. Finally,        we introduce explainable AI which may improve clinical decision systems by making        predictions transparent to the medical practitioner.",PMC8508897,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791
