Epigenetic Changes in Alzheimer's Disease: DNA Methylation and Histone Modification,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive cognitive decline and memory loss, imposing a significant burden on affected individuals and their families. Despite the recent promising progress in therapeutic approaches, more needs to be done to understand the intricate molecular mechanisms underlying the development and progression of AD. Growing evidence points to epigenetic changes as playing a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of the disease. The dynamic interplay between genetic and environmental factors influences the epigenetic landscape in AD, altering gene expression patterns associated with key pathological events associated with disease pathogenesis. To this end, epigenetic alterations not only impact the expression of genes implicated in AD pathogenesis but also contribute to the dysregulation of crucial cellular processes, including synaptic plasticity, neuroinflammation, and oxidative stress. Understanding the complex epigenetic mechanisms in AD provides new avenues for therapeutic interventions. This review comprehensively examines the role of DNA methylation and histone modifications in the context of AD. It aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of AD pathogenesis and facilitate the development of targeted therapeutic strategies.",38667333,PMC11049073,10.3390/cells13080719,0,Cells,101600052,7.666,0.8785228729248047,0.0,0.8060200668896321,2.060313723754883
Epigenetics and the neurodegenerative process,"Neurological diseases are multifactorial, genetic and environmental. Environmental factors such as diet, physical activity and emotional state are epigenetic factors. Environmental markers are responsible for epigenetic modifications. The effect of epigenetic changes is increased inflammation of the nervous system and neuronal damage. In recent years, it has been shown that epigenetic changes may cause an increased risk of neurological disorders but, currently, the relationship between epigenetic modifications and neurodegeneration remains unclear. This review summarizes current knowledge about neurological disorders caused by epigenetic changes in diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, stroke and epilepsy. Advances in epigenetic techniques may be key to understanding the epigenetics of central changes in neurological diseases.",38511224,,10.2217/epi-2023-0416,0,Epigenomics,101519720,4.357,0.8299059271812439,0.0033444816053511705,0.45484949832775917,1.3700124526298167
Epigenetic Modifications by Estrogen and Androgen in Alzheimer's Disease,"For the development and maintenance of neuron networks in the brain, epigenetic mechanisms are necessary, as indicated by recent findings. This includes some of the high-order brain processes, such as behavior and cognitive functions. Epigenetic mechanisms could influence the pathophysiology or etiology of some neuronal diseases, altering disease susceptibility and therapy responses. Recent studies support epigenetic dysfunctions in neurodegenerative and psychiatric conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). These dysfunctions in epigenetic mechanisms also play crucial roles in the transgenerational effects of the environment on the brain and subsequently in the inheritance of pathologies. The possible role of gonadal steroids in the etiology and progression of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, has become the subject of a growing body of research over the last 20 years. Recent scientific findings suggest that epigenetic changes, driven by estrogen and androgens, play a vital role in brain functioning. Therefore, exploring the role of estrogen and androgen-based epigenetic changes in the brain is critical for the deeper understanding of AD. This review highlights the epigenetic modifications caused by these two gonadal steroids and the possible therapeutic strategies for AD.",35232367,,10.2174/1871527321666220225110501,1,CNS & neurological disorders drug targets,101269155,2.824,0.8124212622642517,0.12709030100334448,0.24749163879598662,1.0776708175592198
Neuroepigenetics and Alzheimer's Disease: An Update,"Epigenetics is the study of changes in gene expression which may be triggered by both genetic and environmental factors, and independent from changes to the underlying DNA sequence-a change in phenotype without a change in genotype-which in turn affects how cells read genes. Epigenetic changes represent a regular and natural occurrence but can be influenced also by factors such as age, environment, and disease state. Epigenetic modifications can manifest themselves not only as the manner in which cells terminally differentiate, but can have also deleterious effects, resulting in diseases such as cancer. At least three systems including DNA methylation, histone modification, and non-coding RNA (ncRNA)-associated gene silencing are thought to initiate and sustain epigenetic change. For example, in Alzheimer's disease (AD), both genetic and non-genetic factors contribute to disease etiopathology. While over 250 gene mutations have been related to familial AD, less than 5% of AD cases are explained by known disease genes. More than likely, non-genetic factors, probably triggered by environmental factors, are causative factors of late-onset AD. AD is associated with dysregulation of DNA methylation, histone modifications, and ncRNAs. Among the classes of ncRNA, microRNAs (miRNAs) have a well-established regulatory relevance. MicroRNAs are highly expressed in CNS neurons, where they play a major role in neuron differentiation, synaptogenesis, and plasticity. MicroRNAs impact higher cognitive functions, as their functional impairment is involved in the etiology of neurological diseases, including AD. Alterations in the miRNA network contribute to AD disease processes, e.g., in the regulation of amyloid peptides, tau, lipid metabolism, and neuroinflammation. MicroRNAs, both as biomarkers for AD and therapeutic targets, are in the early stages of exploration. In addition, emerging data suggest that altered transcription of long ncRNAs, endogenous, ncRNAs longer than 200 nucleotides, may be involved in an elevated risk for AD.",29991138,,10.3233/JAD-180259,13,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,4.16,0.7937461733818054,0.5886287625418061,0.36789297658862874,1.4259734565374445
Epigenetic Regulation of Neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's Disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic and progressive neurodegenerative disease and clinically manifests with cognitive decline and behavioral disabilities. Over the past years, mounting studies have demonstrated that the inflammatory response plays a key role in the onset and development of AD, and neuroinflammation has been proposed as the third major pathological driving factor of AD, ranking after the two well-known core pathologies, amyloid Î² (AÎ²) deposits and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Epigenetic mechanisms, referring to heritable changes in gene expression independent of DNA sequence alterations, are crucial regulators of neuroinflammation which have emerged as potential therapeutic targets for AD. Upon regulation of transcriptional repression or activation, epigenetic modification profiles are closely involved in inflammatory gene expression and signaling pathways of neuronal differentiation and cognitive function in central nervous system disorders. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge about epigenetic control mechanisms with a focus on DNA and histone modifications involved in the regulation of inflammatory genes and signaling pathways in AD, and the inhibitors under clinical assessment are also discussed.",38201283,PMC10778497,10.3390/cells13010079,1,Cells,101600052,7.666,0.7903685569763184,0.13043478260869565,0.8093645484949833,2.0335080907075302
Epigenetic Modifications in Neurological Diseases: Natural Products as Epigenetic Modulators a Treatment Strategy,"Epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation, covalent histone modifications, and small noncoding RNAs, play a key role in regulating the gene expression. This regulatory mechanism is important in cellular differentiation and development. Recent advances in the field of epigenetics extended the role of epigenetic mechanisms in controlling key biological processes such as genome imprinting and X-chromosome inactivation. Aberrant epigenetic modifications are associated with the development of many diseases. The role of epigenetic modifications in various neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington disease, epilepsy, and multiple sclerosis is rapidly emerging. The use of epigenetic modifying drugs to treat these diseases has been the interest in recent years. A number of natural products having diverse mechanism of action are used for drug discovery. For many years, natural compounds have been used to treat various neurodegenerative diseases, but the use of such compounds as epigenetic modulators to reverse or treat neurological diseases are not well studied. In this chapter, we mainly focus on how various epigenetic modifications play a key role in neurodegenerative diseases, their mechanism of action, and how it acts as a potential therapeutic target for epigenetic drugs to treat these diseases will be discussed.",27651245,,10.1007/978-3-319-28383-8_1,4,Advances in neurobiology,101571545,0.0,0.7856376767158508,0.3411371237458194,0.0,0.5396100307786744
Role of epigenetics in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis,"Advances in molecular biology technologies have allowed uncovering the role of epigenetic regulation in several complex diseases, such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. Although the role of epigenetic mechanisms in Alzheimer's disease is still little understood, recent findings clearly show that such mechanisms are dysregulated during disease progression, already in its early stages. However, it is not clear if the observed epigenetic changes represent a cause or a consequence of the disease. Promising results are emerging from studies performed in peripheral blood DNA that could provide early biomarkers of the pathology. Moreover, given the dynamic nature of the epigenetic marks, intense research is carried out to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of compounds exerting epigenetic properties.",29888987,,10.2217/nmt-2018-0004,35,Neurodegenerative disease management,101517977,0.0,0.7849791049957275,0.8260869565217391,0.0033444816053511705,0.6362048543017844
"Environment, epigenetics and neurodegeneration: Focus on nutrition in Alzheimer's disease","Many different environmental factors (nutrients, pollutants, chemicals, physical activity, lifestyle, physical and mental stress) can modulate epigenetic markers in the developing and adult organism. Epigenetics, in turn, can cause and is associated with several neurodegenerative and aging-dependent human diseases. Alzheimer's disease certainly represents one of the most relevant neurodegenerative disorders due to its incidence and its huge socio-economic impact. Therefore, it is easy to understand why recent literature focuses on the epigenetic modifications associated with Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders. One of the most intriguing and, at the same time, worrying evidence is that even ""mild"" environmental factors (such as behavioral or physical stress) as well as the under-threshold exposure to pollutants and chemicals, can be effective. Finally, even mild nutrients disequilibria can result in long-lasting and functional alterations of many epigenetic markers, although they don't have an immediate acute effect. Therefore, we will probably have to re-define the current risk threshold for many factors, molecules and stresses. Among the many different environmental factors affecting the epigenome, nutrition represents one of the most investigated fields; the reasons are probably that each person interacts with nutrients and that, in turn, nutrients can modulate at molecular level the epigenetic biochemical pathways. The role that nutrition can exert in modulating epigenetic modifications in Alzheimer's disease will be discussed with particular emphasis on the role of B vitamins and DNA methylation.",25456841,,10.1016/j.exger.2014.10.006,22,Experimental gerontology,0047061,0.0,0.7823300957679749,0.7290969899665551,0.006688963210702341,0.6152174554540959
Alzheimer's Disease-Related Epigenetic Changes: Novel Therapeutic Targets,"Aging is a significant risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), although the precise mechanism and molecular basis of AD are not yet fully understood. Epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation, mitochondrial DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), play a role in regulating gene expression related to neuron plasticity and integrity, which are closely associated with learning and memory development. This review describes the impact of dynamic and reversible epigenetic modifications and factors on memory and plasticity throughout life, emphasizing their potential as target for therapeutic intervention in AD. Additionally, we present insight from postmortem and animal studies on abnormal epigenetics regulation in AD, as well as current strategies aiming at targeting these factors in the context of AD therapy.",37700216,,10.1007/s12035-023-03626-y,2,Molecular neurobiology,8900963,5.682,0.7801604270935059,0.21070234113712374,0.568561872909699,1.6466367244835283
Epigenetic regulons in Alzheimer's disease,"Alzheimer's disease is one of the most prevalent forms of dementia that occur genetically or sporadically (with increasing age) in the population of 65 years and above. The pathological hallmarks of AD include the formation of extracellular senile plaques of amyloid beta peptides 42 (AÎ²42) and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles associated with hyperphosphorylated tau protein. AD has been reported as an outcome of multiple probabilistic factors such as age, lifestyle, oxidative stress, inflammation, insulin resistance, mitochondrial dysfunction, and epigenetics. Epigenetics are heritable changes in gene expression that give a phenotype without altering the DNA sequences. Epigenetic mechanisms include DNA methylation, hydroxymethylation, histone modifications, regulation of miRNAs and long non-coding RNAs, which are reported to be dysregulated in AD. Further, epigenetic mechanisms have been shown as a key player as they regulate memory development, where DNA methylation and post-translational modifications of histone tails are the prime epigenetic markers. Also, alterations of AD-related genes cause pathogenesis on the transcriptional level. In the current chapter, we summarize the role of epigenetics in the onset and progression of AD and the use of epigenetic therapeutics to ameliorate the constraints of AD.",37225321,,10.1016/bs.pmbts.2023.01.012,0,Progress in molecular biology and translational science,101498165,4.025,0.7689067125320435,0.006688963210702341,0.34448160535117056,1.2676818201613667
The emerging field of epigenetics in neurodegeneration and neuroprotection,"Epigenetic mechanisms - including DNA methylation, histone post-translational modifications and changes in nucleosome positioning - regulate gene expression, cellular differentiation and development in almost all tissues, including the brain. In adulthood, changes in the epigenome are crucial for higher cognitive functions such as learning and memory. Striking new evidence implicates the dysregulation of epigenetic mechanisms in neurodegenerative disorders and diseases. Although these disorders differ in their underlying causes and pathophysiologies, many involve the dysregulation of restrictive element 1-silencing transcription factor (REST), which acts via epigenetic mechanisms to regulate gene expression. Although not somatically heritable, epigenetic modifications in neurons are dynamic and reversible, which makes them good targets for therapeutic intervention.",28515491,PMC6380351,10.1038/nrn.2017.46,133,Nature reviews.

Epigenetics and DNA methylomic profiling in Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases,"Recent studies have suggested a role for epigenetic mechanisms in the complex etiology of various neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we discuss advances that have been made toward understanding the role of epigenetic processes in neurodegenerative disorders, with a particular focus on Alzheimer's disease, where the most extensive studies have been undertaken to date. We provide a brief overview of DNA modifications, followed by a summarization of studies of DNA modifications in Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases.",28805248,,10.1111/jnc.14148,36,Journal of neurochemistry,2985190R,0.0,0.7592254281044006,0.8327759197324415,0.010033444816053512,0.6220904408091287
Epigenetics of Alzheimer's Disease,"There are currently no validated biomarkers which can be used to accurately diagnose Alzheimer's disease (AD) or to distinguish it from other dementia-causing neuropathologies. Moreover, to date, only symptomatic treatments exist for this progressive neurodegenerative disorder. In the search for new, more reliable biomarkers and potential therapeutic options, epigenetic modifications have emerged as important players in the pathogenesis of AD. The aim of the article was to provide a brief overview of the current knowledge regarding the role of epigenetics (including mitoepigenetics) in AD, and the possibility of applying these advances for future AD therapy. Extensive research has suggested an important role of DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation, histone posttranslational modifications, and non-coding RNA regulation (with the emphasis on microRNAs) in the course and development of AD. Recent studies also indicated mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) as an interesting biomarker of AD, since dysfunctions in the mitochondria and lower mtDNA copy number have been associated with AD pathophysiology. The current evidence suggests that epigenetic changes can be successfully detected, not only in the central nervous system, but also in the cerebrospinal fluid and on the periphery, contributing further to their potential as both biomarkers and therapeutic targets in AD.",33573255,PMC7911414,10.3390/biom11020195,54,Biomolecules,101596414,6.064,0.7554566264152527,0.9130434782608695,0.6086956521739131,1.8486826715013254
Neurodegeneration and epigenetics: A review,"Neuronal function and differentiation are tightly regulated by both genome and epigenome. Based on the environmental information the epigenetic changes occur. Neurodegeneration is the consequence of dysregulation of both the genome and epigenome. In this study, we saw different types of alterations of epigenome present in neuronal cells of different model organisms for neurodegenerative disorders. The epigenetic modifications including chromatin modification, DNA methylation, and changes in regulatory RNAs (miRNA) are having a great impact on neurodegenerative disorders as well as memory. The effects of these re-editing in the neuronal cells cause Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease but an unusual form of neuroepigenetics has been seen in Prion Disease. Subsequently, for the development of treatment of these diseases, epigenetic modifications should be kept in mind. Although until now many reports came on drug discovery inhibiting histone deacetylases and DNA methyltransferases to reverse the epigenetic change but they lack targeted delivery and sometimes cause a cytotoxic effect on neuronal cells. In future, advancement in targeted and non-cytotoxic drugs should be the main focus for therapeutic treatment of the neurodegenerative disorders.",37344098,,10.1016/j.nrleng.2023.05.001,5,Neurologia,101778590,0.0,0.7520125508308411,0.3712374581939799,0.013377926421404682,0.5254550221373007
Multiregional analysis of global 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine throughout the progression of Alzheimer's disease,"Epigenetic modifications to cytosine are known to alter transcriptional states and deregulate gene expression in cancer, embryonic development, and most recently in neurodegeneration. To test the hypothesis that global levels of cytosine modification are altered throughout the progression of Alzheimer's disease, 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) were quantified using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and stable labeled internal standards of cytosine, 5-mC, and 5-hmC. Cytosine modifications were quantified in DNA extracted from tissue specimens of four brain regions (cerebellum, inferior parietal lobe, superior and middle temporal gyrus, and hippocampus/parahippocampal gyrus) of cognitively normal control (NC) subjects and subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), preclinical Alzheimer's disease (PCAD), late onset Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Repeated measures analyses of the data show significant alterations in 5-mC and 5-hmC in early stages of Alzheimer's disease (PCAD and MCI), as well as FTLD and DLB subjects, across multiple regions of the brain. These data suggest alterations in epigenetic regulation of genes may play an early role in the progression of AD as well as other types of neurodegeneration.",27889911,PMC5250541,10.1111/jnc.13912,21,Journal of neurochemistry,2985190R,0.0,0.7463239431381226,0.7190635451505016,0.016722408026755852,0.5916070749129739
Epigenetics of Aging and Alzheimer's Disease: Implications for Pharmacogenomics and Drug Response,"Epigenetic variability (DNA methylation/demethylation, histone modifications, microRNA regulation) is common in physiological and pathological conditions. Epigenetic alterations are present in different tissues along the aging process and in neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Epigenetics affect life span and longevity. AD-related genes exhibit epigenetic changes, indicating that epigenetics might exert a pathogenic role in dementia. Epigenetic modifications are reversible and can potentially be targeted by pharmacological intervention. Epigenetic drugs may be useful for the treatment of major problems of health (e.g., cancer, cardiovascular disorders, brain disorders). The efficacy and safety of these and other medications depend upon the efficiency of the pharmacogenetic process in which different clusters of genes (pathogenic, mechanistic, metabolic, transporter, pleiotropic) are involved. Most of these genes are also under the influence of the epigenetic machinery. The information available on the pharmacoepigenomics of most drugs is very limited; however, growing evidence indicates that epigenetic changes are determinant in the pathogenesis of many medical conditions and in drug response and drug resistance. Consequently, pharmacoepigenetic studies should be incorporated in drug development and personalized treatments.",26703582,PMC4691177,10.3390/ijms161226236,41,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,6.208,0.7269104719161987,0.8528428093645485,0.6287625418060201,1.8483148450226288
Histone H3 Lysine 4 and 27 Trimethylation Landscape of Human Alzheimer's Disease,"Background:Epigenetic remodeling is emerging as a critical process for both the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of neurodegenerative dementia. However, it is not clear to what extent the distribution of histone modifications is involved in AD.Methods:To investigate histone H3 modifications in AD, we compared the genome-wide distributions of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 in entorhinal cortices from severe sporadic AD patients and from age-matched healthy individuals of both sexes.Results:AD samples were characterized by typical average levels and distributions of the H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 signals. However, AD patients showed a lower H3K4me3 and higher H3K27me3 signal, particularly in males. Interestingly, the genomic sites found differentially trimethylated at the H3K4 between healthy and AD samples involve promoter regions of genes belonging to AD-related pathways such as glutamate receptor signaling.Conclusions:The signatures of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 identified in AD patients validate the role of epigenetic chromatin remodeling in neurodegenerative disease and shed light on the genomic adaptive mechanisms involved in AD.",35203383,PMC8870338,10.3390/cells11040734,6,Cells,101600052,7.666,0.7232117056846619,0.3979933110367893,0.8127090301003345,2.046725685618155
Alzheimer's Disorder: Epigenetic Connection and Associated Risk Factors,"The gene based therapeutics and drug targets have shown incredible and appreciable advances in alleviating human sufferings and complexities. Epigenetics simply means above genetics or which controls the organism beyond genetics. At present it is very clear that all characteristics of an individual are not determined by DNA alone, rather the environment, stress, life style and nutrition play a vital part in determining the response of an organism. Thus, nature (genetic makeup) and nurture (exposure) play equally important roles in the responses observed, both at the cellular and organism levels. Epigenetics influence plethora of complications at cellular and molecular levels that includes cancer, metabolic and cardiovascular complications including neurological (psychosis) and neurodegenerative disorders (Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson disease etc.). The epigenetic mechanisms include DNA methylation, histone modification and non coding RNA which have substantial impact on progression and pathways linked to Alzheimer's disease. The epigenetic mechanism gets deregulated in Alzheimer's disease and is characterized by DNA hyper methylation, deacetylation of histones and general repressed chromatin state which alter gene expression at the transcription level by upregulation, downregulation or silencing of genes. Thus, the processes or modulators of these epigenetic processes have shown vast potential as a therapeutic target in Alzheimer's disease.",31989902,PMC7536832,10.2174/1570159X18666200128125641,27,Current neuropharmacology,101157239,7.708,0.7164170145988464,0.7725752508361204,0.8361204013377926,2.125965258926532
Understanding Epigenetics in the Neurodegeneration of Alzheimer's Disease: SAMP8 Mouse Model,"Epigenetics is emerging as the missing link among genetic inheritance, environmental influences, and body and brain health status. In the brain, specific changes in nucleic acids or their associated proteins in neurons and glial cells might imprint differential patterns of gene activation that will favor either cognitive enhancement or cognitive loss for more than one generation. Furthermore, derangement of age-related epigenetic signaling is appearing as a significant risk factor for illnesses of aging, including neurodegeneration and Alzheimer's disease (AD). In addition, better knowledge of epigenetic mechanisms might provide hints and clues in the triggering and progression of AD. Intense research in experimental models suggests that molecular interventions for modulating epigenetic mechanisms might have therapeutic applications to promote cognitive maintenance through an advanced age. The SAMP8 mouse is a senescence model with AD traits in which the study of epigenetic alterations may unveil epigenetic therapies against the AD.",29562529,PMC5870033,10.3233/JAD-170664,42,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,4.16,0.7158214449882507,0.8662207357859532,0.3712374581939799,1.4347370141501412
Neuroprotective factors affect the progression of Alzheimer's disease,"Alzheimer's disease(AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that occurs mostly in the elderly and is characterized by chronic progressive cognitive dysfunction, which seriously threatens the health and life-quality of patients. Alterations at the molecular level, which causes pathological changes of AD brain, have impacted the progression of AD. In this review, we illustrate the recent evidence of the alteration of neuroprotective proteins in AD, such as changes in their contents and variants.

Recent studies on cellular and molecular mechanisms in Alzheimer's disease: focus on epigenetic factors and histone deacetylase,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders mainly affecting elderly people. It is characterized by progressive loss of memory and cognitive function. More than 95% of AD cases are related to sporadic or late-onset AD (LOAD). The etiology of LOAD is still unclear. It has been reported that environmental factors and epigenetic alterations play a significant role in AD pathogenesis. Furthermore, recently, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified 10 novel risk genes: ABCA7, APOE, BIN1, CD2AP, CD33, CLU, CR1, MS4A6A, MS4A4E, and PICALM, which play an important role for LOAD. In this review, the therapeutic approaches of AD by epigenetic modifications have been discussed. Nowadays, HDAC inhibitors have clinically proven its activity for epigenetic modifications. Furthermore, we try to establish the relationship between HDAC inhibitors and above mentioned LOAD risk genes. Finally, we are hoping that this review may open new area of research for AD treatment.",29397389,,10.1515/revneuro-2017-0049,15,Reviews in the neurosciences,8711016,4.703,0.7074047327041626,0.6421404682274248,0.4916387959866221,1.4934709332679827
Epigenetic regulation in Alzheimer's disease: is it a potential therapeutic target?,"Introduction: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder and the primary form of dementia in the elderly. Changes in DNA methylation and post-translational modifications of histone tails are increasingly observed in AD tissues, and likely contribute to disease onset and progression. The reversibility of these epigenetic marks offers the potential for therapeutic interventions.Areas covered: After a concise and updated overview of DNA methylation and post-translational modifications of histone tails in AD tissues, this review provides an overview of the animal and cell culture studies investigating the potential of targeting these modifications to attenuate AD-like features. PubMed was searched for relevant literature between 2003 and 2021.Expert opinion: Methyl donor compounds and drugs acting on histone tail modifications attenuated the AD-like features and improved cognition in several transgenic AD mice; however, there are concerns about safety and tolerability for long-term treatment in humans. The challenges will be to take advantage of recent epigenome-wide investigations to identify the principal targets for future interventions, and to design novel, selective and safer agents. Natural compounds exerting epigenetic properties could represent a promising opportunity to delay disease onset in middle-aged individuals at increased AD risk.",33843425,,10.1080/14728222.2021.1916469,9,Expert opinion on therapeutic targets,101127833,6.797,0.6956482529640198,0.4916387959866221,0.7357859531772575,1.875116710975736
Potential Epigenetic Targets for Combating Alzheimer's Disease,"Memory remains an obligatory regime of the human brain, and impaired memory causes serious obstacles in our everyday life. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one such neurodegenerative disease which mostly affects the elderly population, above the age of 60; marked by cognitive impairment of memory. Besides the known targets of AD against the several etiologies known to date, the zone of epigenetics has recently evolved as an ingenious field in AD. Epigenetic modifications do not affect DNA sequence but only long-term gene expression. Considering the complex multifactorial nature of AD, we herein discuss the various epigenetic targets which might give rise to potential therapeutic approaches. We reviewed the possible epigenetic targets for AD-like HDAC, Sirtuins, glial cells, miRNA and epigenetic modifications like DNA methylation. A deeper insight into these target areas can surely evolve AD diagnosis and therapeutics.",33371834,,10.2174/1389557521999201228191427,1,Mini reviews in medicinal chemistry,101094212,3.737,0.6824679374694824,0.13377926421404682,0.3277591973244147,1.1836366153244988
Gut Microbiota Composition and Epigenetic Molecular Changes Connected to the Pathogenesis of Alzheimer's Disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder, and its pathogenesis is not fully known. Although there are several hypotheses, such as neuroinflammation, tau hyperphosphorylation, amyloid-Î² plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and oxidative stress, none of them completely explain the origin and progression of AD. Emerging evidence suggests that gut microbiota and epigenetics can directly influence the pathogenesis of AD via their effects on multiple pathways, including neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and amyloid protein. Various gut microbes such as Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, E. coli, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Tenericutes, and Verrucomicrobia are known to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of AD. These microbes and their metabolites modulate various physiological processes that contribute to AD pathogenesis, such as neuroinflammation and other inflammatory processes, amyloid deposition, cytokine storm syndrome, altered BDNF and NMDA signaling, impairing neurodevelopmental processes. Likewise, epigenetic markers associated with AD mainly include histone modifications and DNA methylation, which are under the direct control of a variety of enzymes, such as acetylases and methylases. The activity of these enzymes is dependent upon the metabolites generated by the host's gut microbiome, suggesting the significance of epigenetics in AD pathogenesis. It is interesting to know that both gut microbiota and epigenetics are dynamic processes and show a high degree of variation according to diet, stressors, and environmental factors. The bidirectional relation between the gut microbiota and epigenetics suggests that they might work in synchrony to modulate AD representation, its pathogenesis, and progression. They both also provide numerous targets for early diagnostic biomarkers and for the development of AD therapeutics. This review discusses the gut microbiota and epigenetics connection in the pathogenesis of AD and aims to highlight vast opportunities for diagnosis and therapeutics of AD.",33829390,,10.1007/s12031-021-01829-3,20,Journal of molecular neuroscience : MN,9002991,2.866,0.6603914499282837,0.6989966555183946,0.25418060200668896,1.109234201060649
Epigenome-wide association studies in Alzheimer's disease; achievements and challenges,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents a devastating progressive neurodegenerative disease with a complex pathophysiology, affecting millions of people worldwide. Recent epigenome-wide association studies suggest a key role for epigenetic mechanisms in its development and course. Despite the fact that current evidence on the role of epigenetic dysregulation in aging and AD is convincing, the pioneering field of neuroepigenetics is still facing many challenges that need to be addressed to fundamentally increase our understanding about the underlying mechanisms of this neurodegenerative disorder. This perspective paper describes the current state of play for epigenetic research into AD and discusses how new methodological advances in the field of epigenetics and related data science disciplines could further spur the development of novel therapeutic agents and biomarker assays.",32654262,PMC8018126,10.1111/bpa.12880,6,"Brain pathology (Zurich, Switzerland)",9216781,7.611,0.6552256941795349,0.4013377926421405,0.7892976588628763,1.995602975036149
Uncovering the Role of the Methylome in Dementia and Neurodegeneration,"Our understanding of the epigenome has advanced dramatically over the past decade, particularly in terms of DNA methylation, a modification found throughout the genome. Studies of the brain and neurons have outlined an increasingly complex architecture involving not just CG dinucleotide methylation but also methylation of other dinucleotides, and modifications of methylated bases such as 5-hydroxymethylcytosine. Different modifications may play an important role in brain development, function and decline; recent descriptions of the effects of aging and neurodegenerative processes such as Alzheimer disease on methylation profiles have ushered in an era of DNA methylome-wide association studies. Rapidly improving technologies and study designs are returning robust results, and investigations of the human brain's epigenome are increasingly feasible, complementing insights gained from genetic studies.",27423266,,10.1016/j.molmed.2016.06.008,13,Trends in molecular medicine,100966035,15.272,0.6514657735824585,0.5919732441471572,0.9498327759197325,3.5636741129789065
Cross Talk Between Aluminum and Genetic Susceptibility and Epigenetic Modification in Alzheimer's Disease,"This chapter primarily focuses on two key aspects related to aluminum neurotoxicity and its mechanism in Alzheimer's disease (AD), which are genetic susceptibility and epigenetic modification. The toxicity of aluminum has been confirmed from plant experiments, animal experiments, in vitro experiments, and epidemiological studies. However, the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon have largely remained elusive. Furthermore, there are more and more genetic factors that have been found to be strongly implicated for causing or increasing the risk of AD development and have been proved to be associated with the neurotoxicity of Al and play a significant role in the initiation and progression of AD. Epigenetics provide a bridge between genes and environment to improve our understanding on the etiology of AD. Al can modify the epigenetic status by DNA methylation, histone modifications, and noncoding RNAs and might thereby contribute to the pathophysiology of AD. However, very little is known about exact epigenetic patterns in AD.",30315455,,10.1007/978-981-13-1370-7_10,5,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,0.0,0.642768919467926,0.3745819397993311,0.023411371237458192,0.46057773964062176
Neurofilament-labeled pyramidal neurons and astrocytes are deficient in DNA methylation marks in Alzheimer's disease,"There is increasing evidence that epigenetic alterations may play a role in Alzheimer's disease (AD); yet, there is little information regarding epigenetic modifications in specific cell types. We assessed DNA methylation (5-methylcytosine [5mC]) and hydroxymethylation (5-hydroxymethylcytosine [5hmC]) marks specifically in neuronal and glial cell types in the inferior temporal gyrus of human AD cases and age-matched controls. Interestingly, neurofilament (NF)-labeled pyramidal neurons that are vulnerable to AD pathology are deficient in extranuclear 5mC in AD cases compared with controls. We also found that fewer astrocytes exhibited nuclear 5mC and 5hmC marks in AD cases compared with controls. However, there were no alterations in 5mC and 5hmC in disease-resistant calretinin interneurons or microglia in AD, and there was no alteration in the density of 5mC- or 5hmC-labeled nuclei in near-plaque versus plaque-free regions in late-AD cases. 5mC and 5hmC were present in a high proportion of neurofibrillary tangles, suggesting no loss of DNA methylation marks in tangle bearing neurons. We provide evidence that epigenetic dysregulation may be occurring in astrocytes and NF-positive pyramidal neurons in AD.",27459923,,10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2016.05.003,18,Neurobiology of aging,8100437,5.133,0.6393983960151672,0.6688963210702341,0.5518394648829431,1.5440183018231473
Engrampigenetics: Epigenetics of engram memory cells,"For long time, the epidemiology of late-onset sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk factors has centered on adult life-style. Recent studies have, instead, focused on the role of early life experiences in progression of such disease especially in the context of prenatal and postnatal life. Although no single unfavorable environmental event has been shown to be neither necessary nor sufficient for AD development, it is possible that the sum of several environmentally induced effects, over time, contribute to its pathophysiology through epigenetic mechanisms. Indeed, epigenetic changes are influenced by environmental factors and have been proposed to play a role in multifactorial pathologies such as AD. At the same time, recent findings suggest that epigenetic mechanisms are one method that neurons use to translate transient stimuli into stable memories. Thus, the characteristics of epigenetics being a critical link between the environment and genes and playing a crucial role in memory formation make candidate epigenetic mechanisms a natural substrate for AD research. Indeed, independent groups have reported several epigenetically dysregulated genes in AD models; however, the role of epigenetic mechanisms in AD has remained elusive owing to contradictory results. Here, I propose that restricting the analysis of epigenetic changes specifically to subpopulations of neurons (namely, engram memory cells) might be helpful in understanding the role of the epigenetic process in the memory-related specific epigenetic code and might constitute a new template for therapeutic interventions against AD.",27899292,,10.1016/j.bbr.2016.11.043,4,Behavioural brain research,8004872,3.352,0.6245225667953491,0.34448160535117056,0.31438127090301005,1.1140098611474436
Alzheimer's disease: the potential of epigenetic treatments and current clinical candidates,"Alzheimer's disease is a progressive and fatal neurodegenerative disease affecting 50 million people worldwide, characterized by memory loss and neuronal degeneration. Current treatments have limited efficacy and there is no cure. Alzheimer's is likely caused by a combination of factors, providing several potential therapeutic targets. One area of interest is the epigenetic regulation of gene expression within the brain. Epigenetic marks, including DNA methylation and histone modifications, show consistent changes with age and in those with Alzheimer's. Some epigenetic regulation has been linked to disease pathology and progression and are the focus of current research. Epigenetic regulators might make promising therapeutic targets yet challenges need to be overcome to generate an efficacious drug lacking deleterious side effects.",32552286,,10.2217/nmt-2019-0034,7,Neurodegenerative disease management,101517977,0.0,0.6184347867965698,0.43478260869565216,0.026755852842809364,0.45801739381707235
Insight into the Epigenetics of Alzheimer's Disease: A Computational Study from Human Interactome,"Background:Alzheimer&amp;#039;s disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease throughout the world. Most of the clinical symptoms of AD appear at a very later stage, therefore, the identification of disease markers is essential which can help proper detection of AD at an earlier stage and slow down its progression. Studies have implicated that epigenetic biomarkers, such as DNA methylation, histone modification and non coding RNA mediated regulation serve crucial roles in several disease progression including AD.Objective:The aim of our study was to identify the topologically significant AD-related proteins from experimentally validated human protein-protein interaction database, HPRD (interactome) and find out novel epigenetic biomarkers.Method:In this computational work, we constructed AD specific diseasome from AD genelist and interactome. Using this diseasome we screened the interactome with the help of novel parameters namely degree band and similarity index and identified AD related proteins. Regulatory network involving AD related proteins, not previously known to be associated with AD was constructed. Several network motifs and epigenetic modification patterns of regulators of these motifs were studied.Result:Our study identified computationally predicted 22 epigenetic genes and 11 epigenetic miRs, not previously known to be associated with AD, from the network motifs. Most of these genes and miRs show brain specific expression. Further study on the epigenetic modification patterns of these regulators regarding histone modification, CpG island and lncRNAs strengthened their association in AD.Conclusion:Computationally predicted genes and miRs identified in our study might provide insight into new epigenetic AD therapeutic targets.",27492077,,10.2174/1567205013666160803151101,0,Current Alzheimer research,101208441,3.04,0.6161855459213257,0.013377926421404682,0.26755852842809363,0.9803869128370764
Histone Methylation Regulation in Neurodegenerative Disorders,"Advances achieved with molecular biology and genomics technologies have permitted investigators to discover epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation and histone posttranslational modifications, which are critical for gene expression in almost all tissues and in brain health and disease. These advances have influenced much interest in understanding the dysregulation of epigenetic mechanisms in neurodegenerative disorders. Although these disorders diverge in their fundamental causes and pathophysiology, several involve the dysregulation of histone methylation-mediated gene expression. Interestingly, epigenetic remodeling via histone methylation in specific brain regions has been suggested to play a critical function in the neurobiology of psychiatric disorders, including that related to neurodegenerative diseases. Prominently, epigenetic dysregulation currently brings considerable interest as an essential player in neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and drugs of abuse, including alcohol abuse disorder, where it may facilitate connections between genetic and environmental risk factors or directly influence disease-specific pathological factors. We have discussed the current state of histone methylation, therapeutic strategies, and future perspectives for these disorders. While not somatically heritable, the enzymes responsible for histone methylation regulation, such as histone methyltransferases and demethylases in neurons, are dynamic and reversible. They have become promising potential therapeutic targets to treat or prevent several neurodegenerative disorders. These findings, along with clinical data, may provide links between molecular-level changes and behavioral differences and provide novel avenues through which the epigenome may be targeted early on in people at risk for neurodegenerative disorders.",33925016,PMC8125694,10.3390/ijms22094654,23,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,6.208,0.612831175327301,0.7324414715719063,0.6321070234113713,1.755786999510762
Neurogenesis-based epigenetic therapeutics for Alzheimer's disease (Review),"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a worldwide health problem with multiple pathogenic causes including aging, and genetic and environmental factors. As the interfaces between genes and the environment, epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation, histone modification and microRNAs, are also involved in the pathogenesis of AD. Neurogenesis occurs throughout life in the normal adult brain of mammals. The neurogenic process, consisting of the proliferation, differentiation and maturation of neural stem cells (NSC), is regulated via epigenetic mechanisms by controlling the expression of specific sets of genes. In the pathology of AD, due to impairments in epigenetic mechanisms, the generation of neurons from NSCs is damaged, which exacerbates the loss of neurons and the deficits in learning and memory function associated with AD. Based on neurogenesis, a number of therapeutic strategies have shown capability in promoting neuronal generation to compensate for the neurons lost in AD, thereby improving cognitive function through epigenetic modifications. This provides potential for the treatment of AD by stimulating neurogenesis using epigenetic strategies. The present review discusses the epigenetics of AD and adult neurogenesis, and summarizes the neurogenesis-based epigenetic therapies targeted at AD. Such a review may offer information for the guidance of future developments of therapeutic strategies for AD.",27314984,,10.3892/mmr.2016.5390,15,Molecular medicine reports,101475259,3.423,0.6122517585754395,0.6454849498327759,0.3210702341137124,1.1810480451118188
Recent Findings in Alzheimer Disease and Nutrition Focusing on Epigenetics,"Alzheimer disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease with no effective cure so far. The current review focuses on the epigenetic mechanisms of AD and how nutrition can influence the course of this disease through regulation of gene expression, according to the latest scientific findings. The search strategy was the use of scientific databases such as PubMed and Scopus in order to find relative research or review articles published in the years 2012-2015. By showing the latest data of various nutritional compounds, this study aims to stimulate the scientific community to recognize the value of nutrition in this subject. Epigenetics is becoming a very attractive subject for researchers because it can shed light on unknown aspects of complex diseases like AD. DNA methylation, histone modifications, and microRNAs are the principal epigenetic mechanisms involved in AD pathophysiology. Nutrition is an environmental factor that is related to AD through epigenetic pathways. Vitamin B-12, for instance, can alter the one-carbon metabolism and thus interfere in the DNA methylation process. The research results might seem ambiguous about the clinical role of nutrition, but there is strengthening evidence that proper nutrition can not only change epigenetic biomarker levels but also prevent the development of late-onset AD and attenuate cognition deficit. Nutrition might grow to become a preventive and even therapeutic alternative against AD, especially if combined with other antidementia interventions, brain exercise, physical training, etc. Epigenetic biomarkers can be a very helpful tool to help researchers find the exact nutrients needed to create specific remedies, and perhaps the same biomarkers can be used even in patient screening in the future.",27633107,PMC5015036,10.3945/an.116.012229,31,"Advances in nutrition (Bethesda, Md.)",101540874,11.567,0.6099308133125305,0.7993311036789298,0.9163879598662207,2.8392247087233047
Gut microbiota defined epigenomes of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases reveal novel targets for therapy,"The origins of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) involve genetic mutations, epigenetic changes, neurotoxin exposure and gut microbiota dysregulation. The gut microbiota's dynamic composition and its metabolites influence intestinal and blood-brain barrier integrity, contributing to AD and PD development. This review explores protein misfolding, aggregation and epigenetic links in AD and PD pathogenesis. It also highlights the role of a leaky gut and the microbiota-gut-brain axis in promoting these diseases through inflammation-induced epigenetic alterations. In addition, we investigate the potential of diet, probiotics and microbiota transplantation for preventing and treating AD and PD via epigenetic modifications, along with a discussion related to current challenges and future considerations. These approaches offer promise for translating research findings into practical clinical applications.",38088063,,10.2217/epi-2023-0342,0,Epigenomics,101519720,4.357,0.6028802394866943,0.016722408026755852,0.45819397993311034,1.236472625297368
Targeting epigenetics: A novel promise for Alzheimer's disease treatment,"So far, the search for a cure for Alzheimer Disease (AD) has been unsuccessful. The only approved drugs attenuate some symptoms, but do not halt the progress of this disease, which affects 50 million people worldwide and will increase its incidence in the coming decades. Such scenario demands new therapeutic approaches to fight against this devastating dementia. In recent years, multi-omics research and the analysis of differential epigenetic marks in AD subjects have contributed to our understanding of AD; however, the impact of epigenetic research is yet to be seen. This review integrates the most recent data on pathological processes and epigenetic changes relevant for aging and AD, as well as current therapies targeting epigenetic machinery in clinical trials. Evidence shows that epigenetic modifications play a key role in gene expression, which could provide multi-target preventative and therapeutic approaches in AD. Both novel and repurposed drugs are employed in AD clinical trials due to their epigenetic effects, as well as increasing number of natural compounds. Given the reversible nature of epigenetic modifications and the complexity of gene-environment interactions, the combination of epigenetic-based therapies with environmental strategies and drugs with multiple targets might be needed to properly help AD patients.",37422087,,10.1016/j.arr.2023.102003,4,Ageing research reviews,101128963,11.788,0.6007155179977417,0.34782608695652173,0.9230769230769231,2.7875945281899495
Understanding Epigenetic Alterations in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Disease: Towards Targeted Biomarkers and Therapies,"Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease represent the two most common neurodegenerative disorders, affecting an increasing number of patients worldwide. Population ageing and lack of effective therapies and biomarkers strongly contribute to the socio-economical impact of these conditions. Message and Conclusion: The aim of the review is to present a summary of the discoveries made on the epigenetics of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, with a special focus on the recent advances towards the identification of new targeted therapies and biomarkers. Data supporting broad spectrum and selective small-molecule inhibition of enzymes controlling DNA methylation and histone modifications are discussed in the context of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. The results obtained from studies performed on patients samples are also mentioned, to provide a picture of the efforts made toward identification of epigenetic-based biomarkers.

Epigenetics in Alzheimer's Disease: Perspective of DNA Methylation,"Research over the years has shown that causes of Alzheimer's disease are not well understood, but over the past years, the involvement of epigenetic mechanisms in the developing memory formation either under pathological or physiological conditions has become clear. The term epigenetics represents the heredity of changes in phenotype that are independent of altered DNA sequences. Different studies validated that cytosine methylation of genomic DNA decreases with age in different tissues of mammals, and therefore, the role of epigenetic factors in developing neurological disorders in aging has been under focus. In this review, we summarized and reviewed the involvement of different epigenetic mechanisms especially the DNA methylation in Alzheimer's disease (AD), late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD), familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD), and autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease (ADAD). Down to the minutest of details, we tried to discuss the methylation patterns like mitochondrial DNA methylation and ribosomal DNA (rDNA) methylation. Additionally, we mentioned some therapeutic approaches related to epigenetics, which could provide a potential cure for AD. Moreover, we reviewed some recent studies that validate DNA methylation as a potential biomarker and its role in AD. We hope that this review will provide new insights into the understanding of AD pathogenesis from the epigenetic perspective especially from the perspective of DNA methylation.",28092081,,10.1007/s12035-016-0357-6,58,Molecular neurobiology,8900963,5.682,0.6001297831535339,0.919732441471572,0.5719063545150501,1.6804243581864349
The effect of epigenetic aging on neurodegenerative diseases: a Mendelian randomization study,"Background:Aging has always been considered as a risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases, but there are individual differences and its mechanism is not yet clear. Epigenetics may unveil the relationship between aging and neurodegenerative diseases.Methods:Our study employed a bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) design to assess the potential causal association between epigenetic aging and neurodegenerative diseases. We utilized publicly available summary datasets from several genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Our investigation focused on multiple measures of epigenetic age as potential exposures and outcomes, while the occurrence of neurodegenerative diseases served as potential exposures and outcomes. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the accuracy of the results.Results:The results show a significant decrease in risk of Parkinson's disease with GrimAge (OR = 0.8862, 95% CI 0.7914-0.9924,p= 0.03638). Additionally, we identified that HannumAge was linked to an increased risk of Multiple Sclerosis (OR = 1.0707, 95% CI 1.0056-1.1401,p= 0.03295). Furthermore, we also found that estimated plasminogen activator inhibitor-1(PAI-1) levels demonstrated an increased risk for Alzheimer's disease (OR = 1.0001, 95% CI 1.0000-1.0002,p= 0.04425). Beyond that, we did not observe any causal associations between epigenetic age and neurodegenerative diseases risk.Conclusion:The findings firstly provide evidence for causal association of epigenetic aging and neurodegenerative diseases.

The Role of DNA Methylation and Histone Modifications in Neurodegenerative Diseases: A Systematic Review,"Importance:Epigenetic modifications of the genome, such as DNA methylation and histone modifications, have been reported to play a role in neurodegenerative diseases (ND) such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD).Objective:To systematically review studies investigating epigenetic marks in AD or PD.Methods:Eleven bibliographic databases (Embase.com, Medline (Ovid), Web-of-Science, Scopus, PubMed, Cinahl (EBSCOhost), Cochrane Central, ProQuest, Lilacs, Scielo and Google Scholar) were searched until July 11th 2016 to identify relevant articles. We included all randomized controlled trials, cohort, case-control and cross-sectional studies in humans that examined associations between epigenetic marks and ND. Two independent reviewers, with a third reviewer available for disagreements, performed the abstract and full text selection. Data was extracted using a pre-designed data collection form.Results:Of 6,927 searched references, 73 unique case-control studies met our inclusion criteria. Overall, 11,453 individuals were included in this systematic review (2,640 AD and 2,368 PD outcomes). There was no consistent association between global DNA methylation pattern and any ND. Studies reported epigenetic regulation of 31 genes (including cell communication, apoptosis, and neurogenesis genes in blood and brain tissue) in relation to AD and PD. Methylation at the BDNF, SORBS3 and APP genes in AD were the most consistently reported associations. Methylation of Î±-synuclein gene (SNCA) was also found to be associated with PD. Seven studies reported histone protein alterations in AD and PD.Conclusion:Many studies have investigated epigenetics and ND. Further research should include larger cohort or longitudinal studies, in order to identify clinically significant epigenetic changes.

Age-related epigenetic regulation in the brain and its role in neuronal diseases,"Accumulating evidence indicates many brain functions are mediated by epigenetic regulation of neural genes, and their dysregulations result in neuronal disorders. Experiences such as learning and recall, as well as physical exercise, induce neuronal activation through epigenetic modifications and by changing the noncoding RNA profiles. Animal models, brain samples from patients, and the development of diverse analytical methods have broadened our understanding of epigenetic regulation in the brain. Diverse and specific epigenetic changes are suggested to correlate with neuronal development, learning and memory, aging and age-related neuronal diseases. Although the results show some discrepancies, a careful comparison of the data (including methods, regions and conditions examined) would clarify the problems confronted in understanding epigenetic regulation in the brain.

Opportunities for Cellular Rejuvenation in Alzheimer's Disease: How Epigenetic Reprogramming and Chaperone-Mediated Autophagy Are Enabling Next Generation Therapeutic Approaches,"Age remains the largest risk factor in the development of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Numerous cellular hallmarks of aging contribute to the advancement of the pathologies associated with neurodegenerative disease. Not all cellular hallmarks of aging are independent and several fall into the broader category of cellular rejuvenation, which captures returning cells to a more youthful, improved functional state. Cellular rejuvenation is quickly becoming a hot topic in the development of novel therapeutic modalities for a range of diseases. Therapeutic approaches utilizing cellular rejuvenation technologies are rapidly advancing and will represent the next phase of AD therapeutics. This review focuses on two important processes, epigenetic reprogramming, and chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) that play a critical role in aging and in neurodegenerative diseases and the potential therapeutic approaches (gene therapy, small molecule) towards targeting these mechanisms. In aging and in AD, epigenetic changes on DNA (e.g., hypermethylation on CpG islands) lead to alterations in gene expression. Partial epigenetic reprogramming utilizes transcription factors to remove the epigenetic marks and to rejuvenate cells to a more youthful state. During aging and in neurodegenerative disorders, CMA becomes impaired resulting in a buildup of proteins known to be associated with neurodegenerative pathologies. The protein buildups lead to aggregates that preclude proteostasis leading to cell toxicity. Small-molecule CMA activators restore proteostasis and limit toxicity enabling cellular rejuvenation.",37874086,,10.14283/jpad.2023.106,0,The journal of prevention of Alzheimer's disease,101638820,5.02,0.5688350200653076,0.023411371237458192,0.5284280936454849,1.349983286286676
Exploring the Genetic Predisposition to Epigenetic Changes in Alzheimer's Disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent type of dementia in elderly populations with a significant genetic component. The accumulating evidence suggests that AD involves a reconfiguration of the epigenetic landscape, including DNA methylation, post-translational modification of histone proteins, and chromatin remodeling. Along with environmental factors, individual specific genetic features play a considerable role in the formation of epigenetic architecture. In this study, we attempt to identify the non-coding regulatory SNPs (rSNPs) able to affect the epigenetic mechanisms in AD. To this end, the multi-omics approach is used. The GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus) available data (GSE153875) for AD patients and controls are integrated to reveal the rSNPs that display allele-specific features in both ChIP-seq profiles of four histone modifications and RNA-seq. Furthermore, we analyze the presence of rSNPs in the promoters of genes reported to be differentially expressed between AD and the normal brain (AD-related genes) and involved in epigenetic regulation according to the EpiFactors database. We also searched for the rSNPs in the promoters of the genes coding for transcription regulators of the identified AD-related genes. These regulators were selected based on the corresponding ChIP-seq peaks (ENCODE) in the promoter regions of these genes. Finally, we formed a panel of rSNPs localized to the promoters of genes that contribute to the epigenetic landscape in AD and, thus, to the genetic predisposition for this disease.",37175659,PMC10177989,10.3390/ijms24097955,1,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,6.208,0.5643985867500305,0.13712374581939799,0.6354515050167224,1.607663901213898
Alzheimer's Precision Neurology: Epigenetics of Cytochrome P450 Genes in Circulating Cell-Free DNA for Disease Prediction and Mechanism,"Precision neurology combines high-throughput technologies and statistical modeling to identify novel disease pathways and predictive biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Brain cytochrome P450 (CYP) genes are major regulators of cholesterol, sex hormone, and xenobiotic metabolism, and they could play important roles in neurodegenerative disorders. Increasing evidence suggests that epigenetic factors contribute to AD development. We evaluated cytosine ('CpG')-based DNA methylation changes in AD using circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA), to which neuronal cells are known to contribute. We investigated CYP-based mechanisms for AD pathogenesis and epigenetic biomarkers for disease detection. We performed a case-control study using 25 patients with AD and 23 cognitively healthy controls using the cfDNA of CYP genes. We performed a logistic regression analysis using the MetaboAnalyst software computer program and a molecular pathway analysis based on epigenetically altered CYP genes using the Cytoscape program. We identified 130 significantly (false discovery rate correction q-value < 0.05) differentially methylated CpG sites within the CYP genes. The top two differentially methylated genes identified wereCYP51A1andCYP2S1. The significant molecular pathways that were perturbed in AD cfDNA were (i) androgen and estrogen biosynthesis and metabolism, (ii) C21 steroid hormone biosynthesis and metabolism, and (iii) arachidonic acid metabolism. Existing evidence suggests a potential role of each of these biochemical pathways in AD pathogenesis. Next, we randomly divided the study group into discovery and validation sub-sets, each consisting of patients with AD and control patients. Regression models for AD prediction based on CYP CpG methylation markers were developed in the discovery or training group and tested in the independent validation group. The CYP biomarkers achieved a high predictive accuracy. After a 10-fold cross-validation, the combination of cg17852385/cg23101118 + cg14355428/cg22536554 achieved an AUC (95% CI) of 0.928 (0.787~1.00), with 100% sensitivity and 92.3% specificity for AD detection in the discovery group. The performance remained high in the independent validation or test group, achieving an AUC (95% CI) of 0.942 (0.905~0.979) with a 90% sensitivity and specificity. Our findings suggest that the epigenetic modification of CYP genes may play an important role in AD pathogenesis and that circulating CYP-based cfDNA biomarkers have the potential to accurately and non-invasively detect AD.",36769199,PMC9917756,10.3390/ijms24032876,1,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,6.208,0.5551036596298218,0.14046822742474915,0.6387959866220736,1.602755841262843
Single-Base Resolution Mapping of 5-Hydroxymethylcytosine Modifications in Hippocampus of Alzheimer's Disease Subjects,"Epigenetic modifications to cytosine have been shown to regulate transcription in cancer, embryonic development, and recently neurodegeneration. While cytosine methylation studies are now common in neurodegenerative research, hydroxymethylation studies are rare, particularly genome-wide mapping studies. As an initial study to analyze 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) genome, reduced representation hydroxymethylation profiling (RRHP) was used to analyze more than 2 million sites of possible modification in hippocampal DNA of sporadic AD and normal control subjects. Genes with differentially hydroxymethylated regions were filtered based on previously published microarray data for altered gene expression in hippocampal DNA of AD subjects. Our data show significant pathways for altered levels of 5-hmC in the hippocampus of AD subjects compared to age-matched normal controls involved in signaling, energy metabolism, cell function, gene expression, protein degradation, and cell structure and stabilization. Overall, our data suggest a possible role for the dysregulation of epigenetic modifications to cytosine in late stage AD.",28866733,PMC5909840,10.1007/s12031-017-0969-y,13,Journal of molecular neuroscience : MN,9002991,2.866,0.5538069605827332,0.5953177257525084,0.25752508361204013,1.0245477215001415
Targeted Mitochondrial Epigenetics: A New Direction in Alzheimer's Disease Treatment,"Mitochondrial epigenetic alterations are closely related to Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is described in this review. Reports of the alteration of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) methylation in AD demonstrate that the disruption of the dynamic balance of mtDNA methylation and demethylation leads to damage to the mitochondrial electron transport chain and the obstruction of mitochondrial biogenesis, which is the most studied mitochondrial epigenetic change. Mitochondrial noncoding RNA modifications and the post-translational modification of mitochondrial nucleoproteins have been observed in neurodegenerative diseases and related diseases that increase the risk of AD. Although there are still relatively few mitochondrial noncoding RNA modifications and mitochondrial nuclear protein post-translational modifications reported in AD, we have reason to believe that these mitochondrial epigenetic modifications also play an important role in the AD process. This review provides a new research direction for the AD mechanism, starting from mitochondrial epigenetics. Further, this review summarizes therapeutic approaches to targeted mitochondrial epigenetics, which is the first systematic summary of therapeutic approaches in the field, including folic acid supplementation, mitochondrial-targeting antioxidants, and targeted ubiquitin-specific proteases, providing a reference for therapeutic targets for AD.",36077101,PMC9456144,10.3390/ijms23179703,3,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,6.208,0.5525397062301636,0.29431438127090304,0.6421404682274248,1.6319866999922787
Epigenetic Basis of Lead-Induced Neurological Disorders,"Environmental lead (Pb) exposure is closely associated with pathogenesis of a range of neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), etc. Epigenetic machinery modulates neural development and activities, while faulty epigenetic regulation contributes to the diverse forms of CNS (central nervous system) abnormalities and diseases. As a potent epigenetic modifier, lead is thought to cause neurological disorders through modulating epigenetic mechanisms. Specifically, increasing evidence linked aberrant DNA methylations, histone modifications as well as ncRNAs (non-coding RNAs) with AD cases, among which circRNA (circular RNA) stands out as a new and promising field for association studies. In 23-year-old primates with developmental lead treatment, Zawia group discovered a variety of epigenetic changes relating to AD pathogenesis. This is a direct evidence implicating epigenetic basis in lead-induced AD animals with an entire lifespan. Additionally, some epigenetic molecules associated with AD etiology were also known to respond to chronic lead exposure in comparable disease models, indicating potentially interlaced mechanisms with respect to the studied neurotoxic and pathological events. Of note, epigenetic molecules acted via globally or selectively influencing the expression of disease-related genes. Compared to AD, the association of lead exposure with other neurological disorders were primarily supported by epidemiological survey, with fewer reports connecting epigenetic regulators with lead-induced pathogenesis. Some pharmaceuticals, such as HDAC (histone deacetylase) inhibitors and DNA methylation inhibitors, were developed to deal with CNS disease by targeting epigenetic components. Still, understandings are insufficient regarding the cause-consequence relations of epigenetic factors and neurological illness. Therefore, clear evidence should be provided in future investigations to address detailed roles of novel epigenetic factors in lead-induced neurological disorders, and efforts of developing specific epigenetic therapeutics should be appraised.",32645824,PMC7370007,10.3390/ijerph17134878,20,International journal of environmental research and public health,101238455,4.614,0.5491570830345154,0.7023411371237458,0.4816053511705686,1.3927624772454583
"Relationship between Nutrition, Lifestyle, and Neurodegenerative Disease: Lessons fromADH1B,CYP1A2andMTHFR","In the present review, the main features involved in the susceptibility and progression of neurodegenerative disorders (NDDs) have been discussed, with the purpose of highlighting their potential application for promoting the management and treatment of patients with NDDs. In particular, the impact of genetic and epigenetic factors, nutrients, and lifestyle will be presented, with particular emphasis on Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Metabolism, dietary habits, physical exercise and microbiota are part of a complex network that is crucial for brain function and preservation. This complex equilibrium can be disrupted by genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors causing perturbations in central nervous system homeostasis, contributing thereby to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Diet and physical activity can directly act on epigenetic modifications, which, in turn, alter the expression of specific genes involved in NDDs onset and progression. On this subject, the introduction of nutrigenomics shed light on the main molecular players involved in the modulation of health and disease status. In particular, the review presents data concerning the impact ofADH1B,CYP1A2,andMTHFRon the susceptibility and progression of NDDs (especially AD and PD) and how they may be exploited for developing precision medicine strategies for the disease treatment and management.",36011409,PMC9408177,10.3390/genes13081498,0,Genes,101551097,4.141,0.5479781031608582,0.026755852842809364,0.3511705685618729,1.1623380324650767
Abnormal Homocysteine Metabolism: An Insight of Alzheimer's Disease from DNA Methylation,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease in the central nervous system that has complex pathogenesis in the elderly. The current review focuses on the epigenetic mechanisms of AD, according to the latest findings. One of the best-characterized chromatin modifications in epigenetic mechanisms is DNA methylation. Highly replicable data shows that AD occurrence is often accompanied by methylation level changes of the AD-related gene. Homocysteine (Hcy) is not only an intermediate product of one-carbon metabolism but also an important independent risk factor of AD; it can affect the cognitive function of the brain by changing the one-carbon metabolism and interfering with the DNA methylation process, resulting in cerebrovascular disease. In general, Hcy may be an environmental factor that affects AD via the DNA methylation pathway with a series of changes in AD-related substance. This review will concentrate on the relation between DNA methylation and Hcy and try to figure out their rule in the pathophysiology of AD.",32963633,PMC7495165,10.1155/2020/8438602,12,Behavioural neurology,8914585,3.112,0.5451646447181702,0.568561872909699,0.29431438127090304,1.0632111614128419
Epigenetics and pharmacology,"Recent advances in the understanding of gene regulation have shown there to be much more regulation of the genome than first thought, through epigenetic mechanisms. These epigenetic mechanisms are systems that have evolved to either switch off gene activity altogether, or fine-tune any existing genetic activation. Such systems are present in all genes and include chromatin modifications and remodelling, DNA methylation (such as CpG island methylation rates) and histone covalent modifications (e.g. acetylation, methylation), RNA interference by short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). These systems regulate genomic activity 'beyond' simple transcriptional factor inducer or repressor function of genes to generate mRNA. Epigenetic regulation of gene activity has been shown to be important in maintaining normal phenotypic activity of cells, as well as having a role in development and diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's. Newer classes of drugs regulate epigenetic mechanisms to counteract disease states in humans. The reports in this issue describe some advances in epigenetic understanding that relate to human disease, and our ability to control these mechanisms by pharmacological means. Increasingly the importance of epigenetics is being uncovered - it is pharmacology that will have to keep pace.",25966315,PMC4439868,10.1111/bph.13136,9,British journal of pharmacology,7502536,9.473,0.5391955375671387,0.49498327759197325,0.8862876254180602,2.317113978058678
Methylation as a key regulator of Tau aggregation and neuronal health in Alzheimer's disease,"Neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's disease involves abnormal aggregation and accumulation of toxic proteins aggregates. Post-translational modifications (PTMs) of the causative proteins play an important role in the etiology of disease as they could either slow down or accelerate the disease progression. Alzheimer disease is associated with the aggregation and accumulation of two major protein aggregates-intracellular neurofibrillary tangles made up of microtubule-associated protein Tau and extracellular Amyloid-Î² plaques. Post-translational modifications are important for the regulation of Tau`s function but an imbalance in PTMs may lead to abnormal Tau function and aggregation. Tau methylation is one of the important PTM of Tau in its physiological state. However, the methylation signature on Tau lysine changes once it acquires pathological aggregated form. Tau methylation can compete with other PTMs such as acetylation and ubiquitination. The state of PTM at these sites determines the fate of Tau protein in terms of its function and stability. The global methylation in neurons, microglia and astrocytes are involved in multiple cellular functions involving their role in epigenetic regulation of gene expression via DNA methylation. Here, we have discussed the effect of methylation on Tau function in a site-specific manner and their cross-talk with other lysine modifications. We have also elaborated the role of methylation in epigenetic aspects and neurodegenerative conditions associated with the imbalance in methylation metabolism affecting global methylation state of cells.

Bridging the age spectrum of neurodegenerative storage diseases,"For over a century, researchers have observed similar neurodegenerative hallmarks in brains of people affected by rare early-onset lysosomal storage diseases and late-onset neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. Increasing evidence suggests these apparently disparate diseases share a common underlying feature, namely, a dysfunctional clearance of cellular cargo through the secretory-endosomal-autophagic-lysosomal-exocytic (SEALE) network. By providing examples of rare and common neurodegenerative diseases known to have pathologically altered cargo flux through the SEALE network, we explore the unifying hypothesis that impaired catabolism or exocytosis of SEALE cargo, places a burden of stress on neurons that initiates pathogenesis. We also describe how a growing understanding of genetic, epigenetic and age-related modifications of the SEALE network, has inspired a number of novel disease-modifying therapeutic approaches aimed at alleviating SEALE storage and providing therapeutic benefit to people affected by these devastating diseases across the age spectrum.",25987168,,10.1016/j.beem.2014.08.009,11,Best practice & research.

Epigenomic analysis of Alzheimer's disease brains reveals diminished CTCF binding on genes involved in synaptic organization,"Epigenetic aberrations are suggested to play an important role in transcriptional alterations in Alzheimer's disease (AD). One of the key mechanisms of epigenetic regulation of gene expression is through the dynamic organization of chromatin structure via the master genome architecture protein, CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF). By forming chromatin loops, CTCF can influence gene transcription in a complex manner. To find out whether genome-wide DNA binding sites for CTCF are altered in AD, we compared CTCF chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) data from frontal cortex of human AD patients and normal controls (n = 9 pairs, all females). We have revealed that CTCF-binding affinity on many genes is significantly reduced in AD patients, and these genes are enriched in synaptic organization, cell adhesion, and actin cytoskeleton, including synaptic scaffolding molecules and receptors, such as SHANK2, HOMER1, NRXN1, CNTNAP2 and GRIN2A, and protocadherin (PCDH) and cadherin (CDH) family members. By comparing transcriptomic data from AD patients, we have discovered that many of the synaptic and adhesion genes with reduced CTCF binding in AD are significantly reduced in their mRNA expression. Moreover, a significant overlap of genes with the diminished CTCF binding and the reduced H3K27ac is identified in AD, with the common genes enriched in synaptic organization. These data suggest that the CTCF-controlled 3D chromatin organization is perturbed in AD, which may be linked to the diminished expression of target genes, probably through changes in histone modification.",37302762,PMC10519202,10.1016/j.nbd.2023.106192,3,Neurobiology of disease,9500169,7.046,0.5176928043365479,0.2976588628762542,0.745819397993311,1.7793474551771795
DNA methylation in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease: from gene to cognition,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a debilitating disorder that manifests with amyloid beta plaque deposition, neurofibrillary tangles, neuronal loss, and severe cognitive impairment. Although much effort has been made to decipher the pathogenesis of this disease, the mechanisms causing these detrimental outcomes remain obscure. Over the past few decades, neuroepigenetics has emerged as an important field that, among other things, explores how reversible modifications can change gene expression to control behavior and cognitive abilities. Among epigenetic modifications, DNA methylation requires further elucidation for the conflicting observations from AD research and its pivotal role in learning and memory. In this review, we focus on the essential components of DNA methylation, the effects of aberrant methylation on gene expressions in the amyloidogenic pathway and neurochemical processes, as well as memory epigenetics in Alzheimer's disease.",32491215,,10.1111/nyas.14373,15,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,7506858,6.499,0.5155436992645264,0.6488294314381271,0.725752508361204,1.738892105846341
Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis: Is there a role for folate?,"Epigenetic modifications, including changes in DNA methylation, have been implicated in a wide range of diseases including neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's. The role of dietary folate in providing methyl groups required for maintenance and modulation of DNA methylation makes it a nutrient of interest in Alzheimer's. Late onset Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia and at present its aetiology is largely undetermined. From epidemiological studies, the interactions between folate, B-vitamins and homocysteine as well as the long latency period has led to difficulties in interpretation of the data, thus current evidence exploring the role of dietary folate in Alzheimer's is contradictory and unresolved. Therefore, examining the effects at a molecular level and exploring potential epigenetic mechanisms could increase our understanding of the disease and aetiology. The aim of this review is to examine the role that folate could play in Alzheimer's disease neuropathology and will focus on the effects of folate on DNA methylation which link to disease pathology, initiation and progression.",29037490,,10.1016/j.mad.2017.10.001,25,Mechanisms of ageing and development,0347227,0.0,0.4916542172431946,0.745819397993311,0.033444816053511704,0.444156409944579
Disruption of Tip60 HAT mediated neural histone acetylation homeostasis is an early common event in neurodegenerative diseases,"Epigenetic dysregulation is a common mechanism shared by molecularly and clinically heterogenous neurodegenerative diseases (NDs). Histone acetylation homeostasis, maintained by the antagonistic activity of histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs), is necessary for appropriate gene expression and neuronal function. Disruption of neural acetylation homeostasis has been implicated in multiple types of NDs including Alzheimer's disease (AD), yet mechanisms underlying alterations remain unclear. We show that like AD, disruption of Tip60 HAT/HDAC2 balance with concomitant epigenetic repression of common Tip60 target neuroplasticity genes occurs early in multiple types of Drosophila ND models such as Parkinson's Disease (PD), Huntington's Disease (HD) and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). Repressed neuroplasticity genes show reduced enrichment of Tip60 and epigentic acetylation signatures at all gene loci examined with certain genes showing inappropriate HDAC2 repressor enrichment. Functional neuronal consequences for these disease conditions are reminiscent of human pathology and include locomotion, synapse morphology, and short-term memory deficits. Increasing Tip60 HAT levels specifically in the mushroom body learning and memory center in the Drosophila brain protects against locomotion and short-term memory function deficits in multiple NDs. Together, our results support a model by which Tip60 protects against neurological impairments in different NDs via similar modes of action.",33106538,PMC7588445,10.1038/s41598-020-75035-3,12,Scientific reports,101563288,4.996,0.49064749479293823,0.5719063545150501,0.5250836120401338,1.407969767778773
Differential Epigenetic Changes in the Dorsal Hippocampus of Male and Female SAMP8 Mice: A Preliminary Study,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common age-related neurodegenerative disease characterized by memory loss and cognitive impairment. The causes of the disease are not well understood, as it involves a complex interaction between genetic, environmental, and epigenetic factors. SAMP8 mice have been proposed as a model for studying late-onset AD, since they show age-related learning and memory deficits as well as several features of AD pathogenesis. Epigenetic changes have been described in SAMP8 mice, although sex differences have never been evaluated. Here we used western blot and qPCR analyses to investigate whether epigenetic markers are differentially altered in the dorsal hippocampus, a region important for the regulation of learning and memory, of 9-month-old male and female SAMP8 mice. We found that H3Ac was selectively reduced in male SAMP8 mice compared to male SAMR1 control mice, but not in female mice, whereas H3K27me3 was reduced overall in SAMP8 mice. Moreover, the levels of HDAC2 andJmjD3were increased, whereas the levels of HDAC4 andDnmt3awere reduced in SAMP8 mice compared to SAMR1. In addition, levels of HDAC1 were reduced, whereasUtxandJmjd3were selectively increased in females compared to males. Although our results are preliminary, they suggest that epigenetic mechanisms in the dorsal hippocampus are differentially regulated in male and female SAMP8 mice.",37685895,PMC10488283,10.3390/ijms241713084,2,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,6.208,0.47883346676826477,0.2140468227424749,0.6454849498327759,1.571709444609454
"Epigenetics in Lewy Body Diseases: Impact on Gene Expression, Utility as a Biomarker, and Possibilities for Therapy","Lewy body disorders (LBD) include Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). They are synucleinopathies with a heterogeneous clinical manifestation. As a cause of neuropathological overlap with other neurodegenerative diseases, the establishment of a correct clinical diagnosis is still challenging, and clinical management may be difficult. The combination of genetic variation and epigenetic changes comprising gene expression-modulating DNA methylation and histone alterations modifies the phenotype, disease course, and susceptibility to disease. In this review, we summarize the results achieved in the deciphering of the LBD epigenome. To provide an appropriate context, first LBD genetics is briefly outlined. Afterwards, a detailed review of epigenetic modifications identified for LBD in human cells, postmortem, and peripheral tissues is provided. We also focus on the difficulty of identifying epigenome-related biomarker candidates and discuss the results obtained so far. Additionally, epigenetic changes as therapeutic targets, as well as different epigenome-based treatments, are revised. The number of studies focusing on PD is relatively limited and practically inexistent for DLB. There is a lack of replication studies, and some results are even contradictory, probably due to differences in sample collection and analytical techniques.

Epigenetic Regulation of Amyloid-beta Metabolism in Alzheimer's Disease,"Senile plaques (SPs) are one of the pathological features of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and they are formed by the overproduction and aggregation of amyloid-beta (AÎ²) peptides derived from the abnormal cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP). Thus, understanding the regulatory mechanisms during AÎ² metabolism is of great importance to elucidate AD pathogenesis.

There are no effective treatments available for the disease, and it is associated with great societal concern because of the substantial costs of providing care to its sufferers, whose numbers will increase as populations age. While multiple causes have been proposed to be significant contributors to the onset of sporadic AD, increased age is a unifying risk factor. In addition to amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) and tau protein playing a key role in the initiation and progression of AD, impaired mitochondrial bioenergetics and dynamics are likely major etiological factors in AD pathogenesis and have many potential origins, including AÎ² and tau. Mitochondrial dysfunction is evident in the central nervous system (CNS) and systemically early in the disease process. Addressing these multiple mitochondrial deficiencies is a major challenge of mitochondrial systems biology. We review evidence for mitochondrial impairments ranging from mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations to epigenetic modification of mtDNA, altered gene expression, impaired mitobiogenesis, oxidative stress, altered protein turnover and changed organelle dynamics (fission and fusion). We also discuss therapeutic approaches, including repurposed drugs, epigenetic modifiers, and lifestyle changes that target each level of deficiency which could potentially alter the course of this progressive, heterogeneous Disease while being cognizant that successful future therapeutics may require a combinatorial approach.",34879805,PMC9178515,10.2174/1567205018666211208125855,6,Current Alzheimer research,101208441,3.04,0.45292913913726807,0.40468227424749165,0.2709030100334448,0.9606939383318591
"Dissecting Complex and Multifactorial Nature of Alzheimer's Disease Pathogenesis: a Clinical, Genomic, and Systems Biology Perspective","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by loss of memory and other cognitive functions. AD can be classified into familial AD (FAD) and sporadic AD (SAD) based on heritability and into early onset AD (EOAD) and late onset AD (LOAD) based on age of onset. LOAD cases are more prevalent with genetically complex architecture. In spite of significant research focused on understanding the etiological mechanisms, search for diagnostic biomarker(s) and disease-modifying therapy is still on. In this article, we aim to comprehensively review AD literature on established etiological mechanisms including role of beta-amyloid and apolipoprotein E (APOE) along with promising newer etiological factors such as epigenetic modifications that have been associated with AD suggesting its multifactorial nature. As genomic studies have recently played a significant role in elucidating AD pathophysiology, a systematic review of findings from genome-wide linkage (GWL), genome-wide association (GWA), genome-wide expression (GWE), and epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) was conducted. The availability of multi-dimensional genomic data has further coincided with the advent of computational and network biology approaches in recent years. Our review highlights the importance of integrative approaches involving genomics and systems biology perspective in elucidating AD pathophysiology. The promising newer approaches may provide reliable means of early and more specific diagnosis and help identify therapeutic interventions for LOAD.",26351077,,10.1007/s12035-015-9390-0,24,Molecular neurobiology,8900963,5.682,0.4398074746131897,0.7357859531772575,0.5752508361204013,1.5474416754033655
Epigenetic Peripheral Biomarkers for Early Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder and represents the leading cause of cognitive impairment and dementia in older individuals throughout the world. The main hallmarks of AD include brain atrophy, extracellular deposition of insoluble amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) plaques, and the intracellular aggregation of protein tau in neurofibrillary tangles. These pathological modifications start many years prior to clinical manifestations of disease and thespectrumof AD progresses along acontinuumfrom preclinical to clinical phases. Therefore, identifying specific biomarkers for detecting AD at early stages greatly improves clinical management. However, stable and non-invasive biomarkers are not currently available for the early detection of the disease. In the search for more reliable biomarkers, epigenetic mechanisms, able to mediate the interaction between the genome and the environment, are emerging as important players in AD pathogenesis. Herein, we discuss altered epigenetic signatures in blood as potential peripheral biomarkers for the early detection of AD in order to help diagnosis and improve therapy.",35893045,PMC9332601,10.3390/genes13081308,8,Genes,101551097,4.141,0.4359615445137024,0.46488294314381273,0.35451505016722407,1.1827535153369841
Genetic and epigenetic study of an Alzheimer's disease family with monozygotic triplets,"Age at onset of Alzheimer's disease is highly variable, and its modifiers (genetic or environmental) could act through epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation at CpG sites. DNA methylation is also linked to ageing-the strongest Alzheimer's disease risk factor. DNA methylation age can be calculated using age-related CpGs and might reflect biological ageing. We conducted a clinical, genetic and epigenetic investigation of a unique Ashkenazi Jewish family with monozygotic triplets, two of whom developed Alzheimer's disease at ages 73 and 76, while the third at age 85 has no cognitive complaints or deficits in daily activities. One of their offspring developed Alzheimer's disease at age 50. Targeted sequencing of 80 genes associated with neurodegeneration revealed that the triplets and the affected offspring are heterozygous carriers of the risk APOE Îµ4 allele, as well as rare substitutions in APP (p.S198P), NOTCH3 (p.H1235L) and SORL1 (p.W1563C). In addition, we catalogued 52 possibly damaging rare variants detected by NeuroX array in affected individuals. Analysis of family members on a genome-wide DNA methylation chip revealed that the DNA methylation age of the triplets was 6-10 years younger than chronological age, while it was 9 years older in the offspring with early-onset Alzheimer's disease, suggesting accelerated ageing.",31580390,PMC6821163,10.1093/brain/awz289,9,Brain : a journal of neurology,0372537,0.0,0.42042112350463867,0.5016722408026756,0.03678929765886288,0.35258712226331834
Novel Approaches for the Treatment of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Disease,"Neurodegenerative disorders affect around one billion people worldwide. They can arise from a combination of genomic, epigenomic, metabolic, and environmental factors. Aging is the leading risk factor for most chronic illnesses of old age, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. A progressive neurodegenerative process and neuroinflammation occur, and no current therapies can prevent, slow, or halt disease progression. To date, no novel disease-modifying therapies have been shown to provide significant benefit for patients who suffer from these devastating disorders. Therefore, early diagnosis and the discovery of new targets and novel therapies are of upmost importance. Neurodegenerative diseases, like in other age-related disorders, the progression of pathology begins many years before the onset of symptoms. Many efforts in this field have led to the conclusion that exits some similar events among these diseases that can explain why the aging brain is so vulnerable to suffer neurodegenerative diseases. This article reviews the current knowledge about these diseases by summarizing the most common features of major neurodegenerative disorders, their causes and consequences, and the proposed novel therapeutic approaches.",30743990,PMC6386829,10.3390/ijms20030719,67,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,6.208,0.4203020930290222,0.9364548494983278,0.6521739130434783,1.6810722257170787
[Signaling molecules in the brain and epigenetic factors in neurodegenerative and mental disorders],"The literature on a role of signaling molecules in the organization of memory and cognitive functions is analyzed basing on mechanisms of memory physiology determined by a complex of biochemical processes initiated by the transmission of the signal to the synapse and completed by the synthesis of functionally significant molecules in the neuronal genetic apparatus. The center of these processes is a coordinated system of signal transduction, transcription, epigenetic and neurotrophic molecules. The dissonance of signal mechanisms is a prime cause of memory impairment and cognitive dysfunction as social maladaptation factors. The results of experimental and clinical studies of a role of the multilevel signaling system in age-related, neurodegenerative (Alzheimerâs disease) and mental (depression) disorders are discussed. At the same time, signaling molecules may be considered as particular targets for new therapeutic approaches.",26649375,,10.17116/jnevro2015115101102-110,0,Zhurnal nevrologii i psikhiatrii imeni S.S.

Applying gene-editing technology to elucidate the functional consequence of genetic and epigenetic variation in Alzheimer's disease,"Recent studies have highlighted a potential role of genetic and epigenetic variation in the development of Alzheimer's disease. Application of the CRISPR-Cas genome-editing platform has enabled investigation of the functional impact that Alzheimer's disease-associated gene mutations have on gene expression. Moreover, recent advances in the technology have led to the generation of CRISPR-Cas-based tools that allow for high-throughput interrogation of different risk variants to elucidate the interplay between genomic regulatory features, epigenetic modifications, and chromatin structure. In this review, we examine the various iterations of the CRISPR-Cas system and their potential application for exploring the complex interactions and disruptions in gene regulatory circuits that contribute to Alzheimer's disease.",32654206,PMC8018012,10.1111/bpa.12881,6,"Brain pathology (Zurich, Switzerland)",9216781,7.611,0.4119977653026581,0.4080267558528428,0.7926421404682275,1.8510040103521632
Role of primary aging hallmarks in AlzheimerÂ´s disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease, which severely threatens the health of the elderly and causes significant economic and social burdens. The causes of AD are complex and include heritable but mostly aging-related factors. The primary aging hallmarks include genomic instability, telomere wear, epigenetic changes, and loss of protein stability, which play a dominant role in the aging process. Although AD is closely associated with the aging process, the underlying mechanisms involved in AD pathogenesis have not been well characterized. This review summarizes the available literature about primary aging hallmarks and their roles in AD pathogenesis. By analyzing published literature, we attempted to uncover the possible mechanisms of aberrant epigenetic markers with related enzymes, transcription factors, and loss of proteostasis in AD. In particular, the importance of oxidative stress-induced DNA methylation and DNA methylation-directed histone modifications and proteostasis are highlighted. A molecular network of gene regulatory elements that undergoes a dynamic change with age may underlie age-dependent AD pathogenesis, and can be used as a new drug target to treat AD.",36593969,PMC9800733,10.7150/thno.79535,6,Theranostics,101552395,11.6,0.41134732961654663,0.411371237458194,0.919732441471572,2.649082645261567
[The role of aluminum and lead in the development of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases],"The article summarizes the data available in the literature on the toxic effects of aluminum and lead on the human brain and assesses the relationship of these effects to the etiopathogenesis of the most common neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. The accumulation of ions of these metals in the brain structures leads to chronic intoxication that is manifested by the morphological signs that are typical for Alzheimer's disease, such as deposits of Î²-amyloid and Ï-protein mainly in the frontal and temporal regions of the cortex, and for Parkinson's disease, such as degeneration of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra and their accumulation of Î±-synuclein. The most likely forms of participation of aluminum and lead ions in the mechanisms of neurodegeneration are the replacement of bivalent metal ions necessary for brain functioning, oxidative stress initiation, epigenetic modifications of histones, and increased expression of noncoding ribonucleic acids.",34041898,,10.17116/patol20218303156,0,Arkhiv patologii,0370604,0.0,0.4083947539329529,0.033444816053511704,0.043478260869565216,0.2517258155704741
Assessment of suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid on a Alzheimer's disease model induced by Î²-amyloid(1-42)in aged female mice: Neuromodulatory and epigenetic effect,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that affects several elderly people per years. AD is a pathology of multifactorial etiology, resulting from multiple environmental and genetic determinants. However, there is no effective pharmacological alternative for the treatment of this illness. In this sense, the purpose of current study was to characterize the mechanisms by which AÎ²1-42injection via intracerebroventricular induces neurobehavioral changes in a time-course curve. In addition, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) inhibitor of histone deacetylase (HDAC) was used to investigate the involvement of epigenetic modifications AÎ²1-42-caused in aged female mice. In general manner, AÎ²1-42injection induced a major neurochemical disturbance in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of animals and a serious impairment of memory. Overall, SAHA treatment attenuated neurobehavioral changes caused by AÎ²1-42injection in aged female mice. The subchronic effects presented of SAHA were through modulation of HDAC activity, regulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels and expression of BDNF mRNA, accompanied by unlocking cAMP/PKA/pCREB pathway in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of animals.",36870467,,10.1016/j.cbi.2023.110429,2,Chemico-biological interactions,0227276,0.0,0.4049191474914551,0.21739130434782608,0.046822742474916385,0.28642974936443827
Prion-like mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets in neurodegenerative disorders,"Prion-like propagation of abnormal intracytoplasmic proteins, which are the defining features of major neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), has been proposed. A growing body of evidence strongly suggests that abnormal tau, Î±-synuclein and TDP-43 have prion-like properties, convert the corresponding normal proteins into abnormal forms, and are transmitted from cell to cell, spreading throughout the brain. This idea is extremely important not only for understanding the pathogenesis and progression of these diseases, but also for the development of molecular therapies. Since the distributions and spreading of the abnormal proteins are closely associated with disease symptoms and progression, gain-of-toxic-function of these proteins may affect the neurons and glial cells either directly or indirectly, or both. It is essential to regulate the aggregation of abnormal intracellular proteins and their cell-to-cell transmission in order to stop, or at least slow, the progression of these diseases.",27916654,,10.1016/j.pharmthera.2016.11.010,34,Pharmacology & therapeutics,7905840,13.4,0.38577955961227417,0.8193979933110368,0.9431438127090301,3.075347334429572
The contribution of DNA methylation to the (dys)function of oligodendroglia in neurodegeneration,"Neurodegenerative diseases encompass a heterogeneous group of conditions characterised by the progressive degeneration of the structure and function of the central or peripheral nervous systems. The pathogenic mechanisms underlying these diseases are not fully understood. However, a central feature consists of regional aggregation of proteins in the brain, such as the accumulation of Î²-amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD), inclusions of hyperphosphorylated microtubule-binding tau in AD and other tauopathies, or inclusions containing Î±-synuclein in Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and multiple system atrophy (MSA). Various pathogenic mechanisms are thought to contribute to disease, and an increasing number of studies implicate dysfunction of oligodendrocytes (the myelin producing cells of the central nervous system) and myelin loss. Aberrant DNA methylation, the most widely studied epigenetic modification, has been associated with many neurodegenerative diseases, including AD, PD, DLB and MSA, and recent findings highlight aberrant DNA methylation in oligodendrocyte/myelin-related genes. Here we briefly review the evidence showing that changes to oligodendrocytes and myelin are key in neurodegeneration, and explore the relevance of DNA methylation in oligodendrocyte (dys)function. As DNA methylation is reversible, elucidating its involvement in pathogenic mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases and in dysfunction of specific cell-types such as oligodendrocytes may bring opportunities for therapeutic interventions for these diseases.",37386505,PMC10311741,10.1186/s40478-023-01607-9,2,Acta neuropathologica communications,101610673,7.578,0.38110437989234924,0.22073578595317725,0.782608695652174,1.788409785126045
A Bird's-Eye View of the Multiple Biochemical Mechanisms that Propel Pathology of Alzheimer's Disease: Recent Advances and Mechanistic Perspectives on How to Halt the Disease Progression Targeting Multiple Pathways,"Neurons consume the highest amount of oxygen, depend on oxidative metabolism for energy, and survive for the lifetime of an individual. Therefore, neurons are vulnerable to death caused by oxidative-stress, accumulation of damaged and dysfunctional proteins and organelles. There is an exponential increase in the number of patients diagnosed with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's (AD) as the number of elderly increases exponentially. Development of AD pathology is a complex phenomenon characterized by neuronal death, accumulation of extracellular amyloid-Î² plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, and most importantly loss of memory and cognition. These pathologies are most likely caused by mechanisms including oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction/stress, accumulation of misfolded proteins, and defective organelles due to impaired proteasome and autophagy mechanisms. Currently, there are no effective treatments to halt the progression of this disease. In order to treat this complex disease with multiple biochemical pathways involved, a complex treatment regimen targeting different mechanisms should be investigated. Furthermore, as AD is a progressive disease-causing morbidity over many years, any chemo-modulator for treatment must be used over long period of time. Therefore, treatments must be safe and non-interfering with other processes. Ideally, a treatment like medicinal food or a supplement that can be taken regularly without any side effect capable of reducing oxidative stress, stabilizing mitochondria, activating autophagy or proteasome, and increasing energy levels of neurons would be the best solution. This review summarizes progress in research on different mechanisms of AD development and some of the potential therapeutic development strategies targeting the aforementioned pathologies.",31127770,PMC6598003,10.3233/JAD-181230,8,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,4.16,0.37376153469085693,0.4682274247491639,0.3745819397993311,1.149902405764347
Chaperoning shape-shifting tau in disease,"Many neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's, originate from the conversion of proteins into pathogenic conformations. The microtubule-associated protein tau converts into Î²-sheet-rich amyloid conformations, which underlie pathology in over 25 related tauopathies. Structural studies of tau amyloid fibrils isolated from human tauopathy tissues have revealed that tau adopts diverse structural polymorphs, each linked to a different disease. Molecular chaperones play central roles in regulating tau function and amyloid assembly in disease. New data supports the model that chaperones selectively recognize different conformations of tau to limit the accumulation of proteotoxic species. The challenge now is to understand how chaperones influence disease processes across different tauopathies, which will help guide the development of novel conformation-specific diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.",35045944,,10.1016/j.tibs.2021.12.009,8,Trends in biochemical sciences,7610674,14.264,0.3643251061439514,0.47157190635451507,0.9464882943143813,3.165709444957274
Mitochondria as a target for neuroprotection: implications for AlzheimerÂ´s disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, is marked by progressive loss of memory and impairment of cognitive ability. Despite decades of intensive research and scientific advances, the intricate pathogenic mechanisms of AD are still not fully understood and, consequently, an effective treatment is yet to be developed. As widely accepted, the alterations of mitochondrial function are actively engaged in a plethora of neurodegenerative diseases, including AD. With growing interest in the mitochondria as a potential target for understanding AD, it has even been hypothesized that deficits in these organelles may be at the heart of the progression of AD itself. Areas covered: The purpose of this review is to summarize relevant studies that suggest a role for mitochondrial (dys)function in AD and to provide a survey on latest developments regarding AD-related mitochondrial therapeutics. Expert commentary: As outlined in a plethora of studies, there is no doubt that mitochondria play a major role in several stages of AD progression. Even though more in-depth studies are needed before pharmaceutical industry can apply such knowledge to human medicine, the continuous advances in AD research field will certainly facilitate and accelerate the development of more effective preventive or therapeutic strategies to fight this devastating disease.",27366815,,10.1080/14737175.2016.1205488,14,Expert review of neurotherapeutics,101129944,4.287,0.3624049127101898,0.6153846153846154,0.44481605351170567,1.197919870703037
The DNA Methylation in Neurological Diseases,"DNA methylation is critical for the normal development and functioning of the human brain, such as the proliferation and differentiation of neural stem cells, synaptic plasticity, neuronal reparation, learning, and memory. Despite the physical stability of DNA and methylated DNA compared to other epigenetic modifications, some DNA methylation-based biomarkers have translated into clinical practice. Increasing reports indicate a strong association between DNA methylation profiles and various clinical outcomes in neurological diseases, making DNA methylation profiles valuable as novel clinical markers. In this review, we aim to discuss the latest evidence concerning DNA methylation alterations in the development of neurodegenerative, neurodevelopmental, and neuropsychiatric diseases. We also highlighted the relationship of DNA methylation alterations with the disease progression and outcome in many neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal dementia, and autism.",36359835,PMC9657829,10.3390/cells11213439,14,Cells,101600052,7.666,0.35958901047706604,0.6187290969899666,0.8160535117056856,1.872699225684233
[A new paradigm for the development of neurodegenerative diseases on the example of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease],"The role of neuronal inflammation developing during the formation of amyloid plaques and Lewy bodies has been investigated. The influence of various exogenous and endogenous factors on the development of neuroinflammation has been established, but the role of various infectious agents in the development of this process has been much less studied. Today, the existence of a universal trigger mechanism of the neurodegenerative process is obvious: a specific pathogen of a bacterial or viral nature (including a long-term persistent in the nervous tissue in a latent state), reactivating, penetrates into certain cerebral structures, where it is influenced by either AÎ² or resident macrophages of the central nervous system, which, in turn, are activated and induce the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, leading to the development of neuronal inflammation, autophagy and neurodegeneration. Reactivation of latent, such as herpes, infection in individuals who are carriers of APOE4 significantly increases the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. Class II genes of the HLA locus (HLA II) may be related to the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. The increase in iron levels in the glia is induced by inflammation, which leads to neurodegeneration. Disruption of the homeostasis of redox-active metals, iron and copper, is an integral part of the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. The developing neuroinflammation leads to the intensification of the processes of peroxidation, oxidation of metals and the development of ferroptosis.",35727933,,,0,Advances in gerontology = Uspekhi gerontologii,100971443,0.0,0.3544330596923828,0.03678929765886288,0.05016722408026756,0.22001769534720225
Complex and differential glial responses in Alzheimer's disease and ageing,"Glial cells and their association with neurones are fundamental for brain function. The emergence of complex neurone-glial networks assures rapid information transfer, creating a sophisticated circuitry where both types of neural cells work in concert, serving different activities. All glial cells, represented by astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia and NG2-glia, are essential for brain homeostasis and defence. Thus, glia are key not only for normal central nervous system (CNS) function, but also to its dysfunction, being directly associated with all forms of neuropathological processes. Therefore, the progression and outcome of neurological and neurodegenerative diseases depend on glial reactions. In this review, we provide a concise account of recent data obtained from both human material and animal models demonstrating the pathological involvement of glia in neurodegenerative processes, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), as well as physiological ageing.",26923267,,10.2174/1567205013666160229112911,38,Current Alzheimer research,101208441,3.04,0.35365137457847595,0.8394648829431438,0.27424749163879597,0.9880838013357144
Role of neurotoxicants in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease: a mechanistic insight,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most conspicuous chronic neurodegenerative syndrome, which has become a significant challenge for the global healthcare system. Multiple studies have corroborated a clear association of neurotoxicants with AD pathogenicity, such as Amyloid beta (AÎ²) proteins and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), signalling pathway modifications, cellular stress, cognitive dysfunctions, neuronal apoptosis, neuroinflammation, epigenetic modification, and so on. This review, therefore, aimed to address several essential mechanisms and signalling cascades, including Wnt (wingless and int.) signalling pathway, autophagy, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), protein kinase C (PKC) signalling cascades, cellular redox status, energy metabolism, glutamatergic neurotransmissions, immune cell stimulations (e.g. microglia, astrocytes) as well as an amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin-1 (PSEN1), presenilin-2 (PSEN2) and other AD-related gene expressions that have been pretentious and modulated by the various neurotoxicants. This review concluded that neurotoxicants play a momentous role in developing AD through modulating various signalling cascades. Nevertheless, comprehension of this risk agent-induced neurotoxicity is far too little. More in-depth epidemiological and systematic investigations are needed to understand the potential mechanisms better to address these neurotoxicants and improve approaches to their risk exposure that aid in AD pathogenesis.Key messagesInevitable cascade mechanisms of how Alzheimer's Disease-related (AD-related) gene expressions are modulated by neurotoxicants have been discussed.Involvement of the neurotoxicants-induced pathways caused an extended risk of AD is explicited.Integration of cell culture, animals and population-based analysis on the clinical severity of AD is addressed.",34433343,PMC8405119,10.1080/07853890.2021.1966088,4,Annals of medicine,8906388,5.348,0.3509773313999176,0.35451505016722407,0.5618729096989966,1.3510894088733953

"Catechol-O-methyltransferase, Cognition and Alzheimer's Disease","Objective:Cognition is a complex trait representing a set of all mental abilities and processes related to knowledge. Although diverse brain regions are involved, most cognitive processes appear to engage cortical regions. The activity of dopaminergic neurons in prefrontal cortex represents a biological substrate underlying cognitive functions. Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most frequent dementia associated with cognitive impairments. Cognitive impairment in AD starts slowly with discrete deterioration in memory, language, thinking and reasoning, but it progresses into more severe and debilitating cognitive dysfunction. Cognitive function is affected by the complex interactions between various genetic, epigenetic, developmental and environmental factors. One of the most studied genes, associated with cognitive disturbances, is the gene coding for Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), the enzyme with major role in dopamine metabolism and modulation of different brain functions. Therefore, COMT is studied as a target for many neuropsychiatric disorders, including dementias and AD. The COMT Val158/108Met functional polymorphism affects significantly the enzyme activity and consequently cognitive performance associated with altered dopamine function. The association of COMT Val158/108Met polymorphism with some cognitive domains and psychosis in AD was reported in some but not in all studies. Besides COMT Val158/108Met polymorphism, other risk genotypes or haplotypes should be evaluated to determine the association of COMT with cognitive decline in AD.Conclusion:Better understanding of the role of COMT in cognitive processes in AD, as well as integration of neurobiological, genetic, genomic and epigenetic data, might help in developing new potential therapies of cognitive impairments and psychotic symptoms, characteristic features of AD.",29231139,,10.2174/1567205015666171212094229,18,Current Alzheimer research,101208441,3.04,0.34975481033325195,0.6755852842809364,0.27759197324414714,0.9529699430561385
D-ribose and pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease,"It is estimated that the global prevalence of dementia will rise as high as 24 million and predicted to be double in every 20 years which is attributed to the fact that the ageing population is increasing and so more individuals are at risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's. Many scientists favored glycation of proteins such as tau, amyloid beta (AÎ²) etc. as one of the important risk factor in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Since, D-ribose shows highest glycation ability among other sugars hence, produces advanced glycation end products (AGEs) rapidly. However, there are several other mechanisms suggested by researchers through which D-ribose may cause cognitive impairments. There is a concern related to diabetic patients since they also suffer from D-ribose metabolism, may be more prone to AD risk. Thus, it is imperative that the pathogenesis and the pathways involved in AD progression are explored in the light of ribosylation and AGEs formation for identifying suitable diagnostics marker for early diagnosis or finding promising therapeutic outcomes.",31933261,,10.1007/s11033-020-05243-7,8,Molecular biology reports,0403234,0.0,0.34455370903015137,0.47491638795986624,0.056856187290969896,0.3017155030100641
Neuroepigenetic Mechanisms of Action of Ultrashort Peptides in Alzheimer's Disease,"Epigenetic regulation of gene expression is necessary for maintaining higher-order cognitive functions (learning and memory). The current understanding of the role of epigenetics in the mechanism of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is focused on DNA methylation, chromatin remodeling, histone modifications, and regulation of non-coding RNAs. The pathogenetic links of this disease are the misfolding and aggregation of tau protein and amyloid peptides, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, impaired energy metabolism, destruction of the blood-brain barrier, and neuroinflammation, all of which lead to impaired synaptic plasticity and memory loss. Ultrashort peptides are promising neuroprotective compounds with a broad spectrum of activity and without reported side effects. The main aim of this review is to analyze the possible epigenetic mechanisms of the neuroprotective action of ultrashort peptides in AD. The review highlights the role of short peptides in the AD pathophysiology. We formulate the hypothesis that peptide regulation of gene expression can be mediated by the interaction of short peptides with histone proteins, cis- and transregulatory DNA elements and effector molecules (DNA/RNA-binding proteins and non-coding RNA). The development of therapeutic agents based on ultrashort peptides may offer a promising addition to the multifunctional treatment of AD.",35457077,PMC9032300,10.3390/ijms23084259,5,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,6.208,0.3396085798740387,0.3779264214046823,0.6555183946488294,1.5209504322053597
Proteopathic Strains and the Heterogeneity of Neurodegenerative Diseases,"Most age-related neurodegenerative diseases are associated with the misfolding and aberrant accumulation of specific proteins in the nervous system. The proteins self-assemble and spread by a prion-like process of corruptive molecular templating, whereby abnormally folded proteins induce the misfolding and aggregation of like proteins into characteristic lesions. Despite the apparent simplicity of this process at the molecular level, diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Creutzfeldt-Jakob, and others display remarkable phenotypic heterogeneity, both clinically and pathologically. Evidence is growing that this variability is mediated, at least in part, by the acquisition of diverse molecular architectures by the misfolded proteins, variants referred to as proteopathic strains. The structural and functional diversity of the assemblies is influenced by genetic, epigenetic, and local contextual factors. Insights into proteopathic strains gleaned from the classical prion diseases can be profitably incorporated into research on other neurodegenerative diseases. Their potentially wide-ranging influence on disease phenotype also suggests that proteopathic strains should be considered in the design and interpretation of diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to these disorders.",27893962,PMC6690197,10.1146/annurev-genet-120215-034943,32,Annual review of genetics,0117605,0.0,0.3363310694694519,0.8093645484949833,0.06020066889632107,0.36367155138066776
Alzheimer's Disease: From Mitochondrial Perturbations to Mitochondrial Medicine,"Age-related neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) are distressing conditions causing countless levels of suffering for which treatment is often insufficient or inexistent. Considered to be the most common cause of dementia and an incurable, progressive neurodegenerative disorder, the intricate pathogenic mechanisms of AD continue to be revealed and, consequently, an effective treatment needs to be developed. Among the diverse hypothesis that have been proposed to explain AD pathogenesis, the one concerning mitochondrial dysfunction has raised as one of the most discussed with an actual acceptance in the field. It posits that manipulating mitochondrial function and understanding the deficits that result in mitochondrial injury may help to control and/or limit the development of AD. To achieve such goal, the concept of mitochondrial medicine places itself as a promising gathering of strategies to directly manage the major insidious disturbances of mitochondrial homeostasis as well as attempts to directly or indirectly manage its consequences in the context of AD. The aim of this review is to summarize the evolution that occurred from the establishment of mitochondrial homeostasis perturbation as masterpieces in AD pathogenesis up until the development of mitochondrial medicine. Following a brief glimpse in the past and current hypothesis regarding the triad of aging, mitochondria and AD, this manuscript will address the major mechanisms currently believed to participate in above mentioned events. Both pharmacological and lifestyle interventions will also be reviewed as AD-related mitochondrial therapeutics.",27327899,PMC8028979,10.1111/bpa.12402,26,"Brain pathology (Zurich, Switzerland)",9216781,7.611,0.33393749594688416,0.7625418060200669,0.7959866220735786,1.8750708587721436
The Role of Impaired Mitochondrial Transport in the Development of Neurodegenerative Diseases,"The fight against neurodegenerative diseases is one of the key direction of modern medicine. Unfortunately, the difficulties in understanding the factors underlying the development of neurodegeneration hinder the development of breakthrough therapeutics that can stop or at least greatly slow down the progression of these diseases. In this review, it is considered the disruption of mitochondrial transport as one of the pathogenesis factors contributing to neurodegeneration using the examples of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Huntington's disease. Here, the mechanism of mitochondrial transport under normal conditions and the mechanisms of disturbances for the indicated diseases will be considered.",37519177,,10.31083/j.jin2204086,1,Journal of integrative neuroscience,101156357,1.664,0.33317768573760986,0.14381270903010032,0.22073578595317725,0.5614691532485859
[Treatment-Quo vadis neurodegeneration?],"Background:Hallmarks of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease are pathological protein aggregation, neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration and progressive symptoms. Due to the limited causal treatment options they represent a big challenge.Objective:Overview of disease-modifying strategies in neurodegenerative diseases and outlook regarding future treatment development.Material and methods:Literature search regarding treatment development in neurodegenerative diseases and integration of the results. Additionally, consideration of expert opinions.Results:The development of biomarkers and genetic parameters for the detection of causal pathologies of neurodegenerative diseases as an indispensable basis for the development of disease-modifying treatment is rapidly advancing. Targets for causal interventions are all steps in the pathophysiological cascade of neurodegenerative diseases. Therapeutic antibodies are most advanced in the development and are able to remove protein deposits from the brain and to reduce the clinical progression in Alzheimer's disease. A combination of biomarkers, genetic characteristics and clinical parameters could enable an individualized treatment.Conclusion:The future of the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases focuses on disease modification using molecular-based approaches. Targeted interventions against protein aggregation, inflammation and genetic factors as well as a personalized stratification of treatment hold promise for more effective forms of treatment.

Abnormal interaction of Rlip with mutant APP/Abeta and phosphorylated tau reduces wild-type Rlip levels and disrupt Rlip function in Alzheimer's disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that affects a large proportion of the aging population. RalBP1 (Rlip) is a stress-activated protein, that plays an important role in aging and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Mutant APP and mutant Tau interact with the Rlip protein which leads to decreased wild-type Rlip levels and disrupt Rlip function in Alzheimer's disease.

Genomic mechanisms in Alzheimer's disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease and, owing to its increasing prevalence, represents one of the leading public health problems in aging populations. The molecular causes underlying the onset and progression of AD are manifold and hitherto still incompletely understood. Research over nearly four decades has clearly delineated genetics to play a crucial role in AD susceptibility, likely in concert with non-genetic factors. The field has gained considerable momentum and novel insights over the past 10 years owing to the advent and application of high-throughput genomics technologies in datasets of increasing size. In this contribution to the Mini-Symposium on the Molecular Etiology of Alzheimer's Disease, we review the current status of genomics research in AD. To this end, we scrutinize and discuss the main findings from the two largest and most current genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in the field, that is, the papers published by Jansen et al (Nat Genet 51:404-413) and Kunkle et al (Nat Genet 51:414-430). Particular focus is laid on genomics findings overlapping across both studies and on the novel insights they provide in terms of improving our understanding of the ""genomic mechanisms"" underlying this devastating disease.",32657454,PMC8018017,10.1111/bpa.12882,18,"Brain pathology (Zurich, Switzerland)",9216781,7.611,0.32241931557655334,0.6789297658862876,0.7993311036789298,1.8514375425231893
Identification and Prioritization of PET Neuroimaging Targets for Microglial Phenotypes Associated with Microglial Activity in Alzheimer's Disease,"Activation of microglial cells accompanies the progression of many neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Development of molecular imaging tools specific to microglia can help elucidate the mechanism through which microglia contribute to the pathogenesis and progression of neurodegenerative disorders. Through analysis of published genetic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data sets, we identified 19 genes with microglia-specific expression that we then ranked based on association with the AD characteristics, change in expression, and potential druggability of the target. We believe that the process we used to identify and rank microglia-specific genes is broadly applicable to the identification and evaluation of targets in other disease areas and for applications beyond molecular imaging.",36473177,,10.1021/acschemneuro.2c00607,2,ACS chemical neuroscience,101525337,5.78,0.32082128524780273,0.22408026755852842,0.5919732441471572,1.3933088246603873
Beyond association: successes and challenges in linking non-coding genetic variation to functional consequences that modulate Alzheimer's disease risk,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia, affecting millions of people worldwide; however, no disease-modifying treatments are currently available. Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified more than 40 loci associated with AD risk. However, most of the disease-associated variants reside in non-coding regions of the genome, making it difficult to elucidate how they affect disease susceptibility. Nonetheless, identification of the regulatory elements, genes, pathways and cell type/tissue(s) impacted by these variants to modulate AD risk is critical to our understanding of disease pathogenesis and ability to develop effective therapeutics. In this review, we provide an overview of the methods and approaches used in the field to identify the functional effects of AD risk variants in the causal path to disease risk modification as well as describe the most recent findings. We first discuss efforts in cell type/tissue prioritization followed by recent progress in candidate causal variant and gene nomination. We discuss statistical methods for fine-mapping as well as approaches that integrate multiple levels of evidence, such as epigenomic and transcriptomic data, to identify causal variants and risk mechanisms of AD-associated loci. Additionally, we discuss experimental approaches and data resources that will be needed to validate and further elucidate the effects of these variants and genes on biological pathways, cellular phenotypes and disease risk. Finally, we discuss future steps that need to be taken to ensure that AD GWAS functional mapping efforts lead to novel findings and bring us closer to finding effective treatments for this devastating disease.",33882988,PMC8061035,10.1186/s13024-021-00449-0,16,Molecular neurodegeneration,101266600,18.879,0.30881521105766296,0.6521739130434783,0.979933110367893,4.091523909243294
Connexins and pannexins in Alzheimer's disease,"By 2040 neurodegenerative diseases will become the world's second leading cause of death after cardiovascular disease (WHO). Major efforts are required to elucidate the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases. Connexin and pannexin membrane channel proteins are conduits through which neuronal, glial, and vascular tissues interact. In the normal brain, this interaction underlies homeostasis, metabolic supply and neuroprotection. In models of neuroinflammation these channels present aberrant functioning. Validation of the molecular mechanisms by which these membrane channels influence neurodegeneration particularly in Alzheimer's disease could lead to new and alternative therapeutic strategies targeting these channels.",28893592,,10.1016/j.neulet.2017.09.006,18,Neuroscience letters,7600130,3.197,0.30663084983825684,0.6822742474916388,0.3010033444816054,0.9598333594012818
DNA Damage-Induced Neurodegeneration in Accelerated Ageing and Alzheimer's Disease,"DNA repair ensures genomic stability to achieve healthy ageing, including cognitive maintenance. Mutations on genes encoding key DNA repair proteins can lead to diseases with accelerated ageing phenotypes. Some of these diseases are xeroderma pigmentosum group A (XPA, caused by mutation ofXPA), Cockayne syndrome group A and group B (CSA, CSB, and are caused by mutations ofCSAandCSB, respectively), ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T, caused by mutation ofATM), and Werner syndrome (WS, with most cases caused by mutations inWRN). Except for WS, a common trait of the aforementioned progerias is neurodegeneration. Evidence from studies using animal models and patient tissues suggests that the associated DNA repair deficiencies lead to depletion of cellular nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), resulting in impaired mitophagy, accumulation of damaged mitochondria, metabolic derailment, energy deprivation, and finally leading to neuronal dysfunction and loss. Intriguingly, these features are also observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common type of dementia affecting more than 50 million individuals worldwide. Further studies on the mechanisms of the DNA repair deficient premature ageing diseases will help to unveil the mystery of ageing and may provide novel therapeutic strategies for AD.",34201700,PMC8268089,10.3390/ijms22136748,16,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,6.208,0.3030094802379608,0.6555183946488294,0.6588628762541806,1.5545093670725425
Supramolecular organizing centers at the interface of inflammation and neurodegeneration,"The pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases involves the accumulation of misfolded protein aggregates. These deposits are both directly toxic to neurons, invoking loss of cell connectivity and cell death, and recognized by innate sensors that upon activation release neurotoxic cytokines, chemokines, and various reactive species. This neuroinflammation is propagated through signaling cascades where activated sensors/receptors, adaptors, and effectors associate into multiprotein complexes known as supramolecular organizing centers (SMOCs). This review provides a comprehensive overview of the SMOCs, involved in neuroinflammation and neurotoxicity, such as myddosomes, inflammasomes, and necrosomes, their assembly, and evidence for their involvement in common neurodegenerative diseases. We discuss the multifaceted role of neuroinflammation in the progression of neurodegeneration. Recent progress in the understanding of particular SMOC participation in common neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease offers novel therapeutic strategies for currently absent disease-modifying treatments.",35979366,PMC9377691,10.3389/fimmu.2022.940969,3,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,8.786,0.30280324816703796,0.30434782608695654,0.8662207357859532,1.999751514117614
"Alzheimer's disease: Insights and new prospects in disease pathophysiology, biomarkers and disease-modifying drugs","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative diseases that affect millions of people worldwide, with both prevalence and incidence increasing with age. It is characterized by cognitive decline associated, specifically, with degeneration of cholinergic neurons. The problem of this disease is even more fundamental as the available therapies remain fairly limited and mainly focused on symptoms' relief. Although the aetiology of the disease remains elusive, two main pathological hallmarks are described: i) presence of neurofibrillary tangles formed by unfolded protein aggregates (hyperphosphorylated Tau protein) and ii) presence of extracellular aggregates of amyloid-beta peptide. Given the complexity surrounding the pathogenesis of the disease, several potential targets have been highlighted and interrelated upon its progression, such as oxidative stress and the accumulation of metal ions. Thus, advances have been made on the development of innovative multitarget therapeutical compounds to delay the disease progression and restore cell function. This review focuses the ongoing research on new insights and emerging disease-modifying drugs for AD treatment. Furthermore, classical and novel potential biomarkers for early diagnosis of the disease, and their role in assisting on the improvement of targeted therapies will also be approached.",36996971,,10.1016/j.bcp.2023.115522,9,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,0.0,0.2995148003101349,0.5050167224080268,0.06688963210702341,0.28071222466768625
Influential role of 7-Ketocholesterol in the progression of Alzheimer's disease,"Millions of people are affected by neurodegenerative diseases worldwide. They occur due to the loss of brain functions or peripheral nervous system dysfunction. If untreated, prolonged condition ultimately leads to death. Mostly they are associated with stress, altered cholesterol metabolism, inï¬ammation and organelle dysfunction. Endogenous cholesterol and phospholipids in brain undergo auto-oxidation by enzymatic as well as non-enzymatic modes leading to the formation of by-products such as 4-hydroxynonenal and oxysterols. Among various oxysterols, 7-ketocholesterol (7KCh) is one of the major toxic components involved in altering neuronal lipid metabolism, contributing to inï¬ammation and nerve cell damage. More evidently 7KCh is proven to induce oxidative stress and affects membrane permeability. Loss in mitochondrial membrane potential affects metabolism of cell organelles such as lysosomes and peroxisomes which are involved in lipid and protein homeostasis. This in turn could affect amyloidogenesis, tau protein phosphorylation and accumulation in pathological conditions of neurodegenerative diseases. Lipid alterations and the consequent pathogenic protein accumulation, results in the damage of cell organelles and microglial cells. This could be a reason behind disease progression and predominantly reported characteristics of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. This review focuses on the role of 7KCh mediated neurodegenerative Alzheimer's disease with emphasis on alterations in the lipid raft microdomain. In addition, current trends in the significant therapies related to 7KCh inhibition are highlighted.",34273491,,10.1016/j.prostaglandins.2021.106582,10,Prostaglandins & other lipid mediators,9808648,3.813,0.2958398759365082,0.5217391304347826,0.3377926421404682,1.0444517516488614
Oncogenic Pathways in Neurodegenerative Diseases,"Cancer and neurodegenerative diseases are two of the leading causes of premature death in modern societies. Their incidence continues to increase, and in the near future, it is believed that cancer will kill more than 20 million people per year, and neurodegenerative diseases, due to the aging of the world population, will double their prevalence. The onset and the progression of both diseases are defined by dysregulation of the same molecular signaling pathways. However, whereas in cancer, these alterations lead to cell survival and proliferation, neurodegenerative diseases trigger cell death and apoptosis. The study of the mechanisms underlying these opposite final responses to the same molecular trigger is key to providing a better understanding of the diseases and finding more accurate treatments. Here, we review the ten most common signaling pathways altered in cancer and analyze them in the context of different neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's (AD), Parkinson's (PD), and Huntington's (HD) diseases.",35328644,PMC8952192,10.3390/ijms23063223,7,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,6.208,0.2936069667339325,0.43812709030100333,0.6622073578595318,1.5053895981005603
Neurodegenerative Pathways in Alzheimer's Disease: A Review,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disease that leads to insidious deterioration of brain functions and is considered the sixth leading cause of death in the world. Alzheimer's patients suffer from memory loss, cognitive deficit and behavioral changes; thus, they eventually follow a low-quality life. AD is considered as a multifactorial disorder involving different neuropathological mechanisms. Recent research has identified more than 20 pathological factors that are promoting disease progression. Three significant hypotheses are said to be the root cause of disease pathology, which include acetylcholine deficit, the formation of amyloid-beta senile plaques and tau protein hyperphosphorylation. Apart from these crucial factors, pathological factors such as apolipoprotein E (APOE), glycogen synthase kinase 3Î², notch signaling pathway, Wnt signaling pathway, etc., are considered to play a role in the advancement of AD and therefore could be used as targets for drug discovery and development. As of today, there is no complete cure or effective disease altering therapies for AD. The current therapy is assuring only symptomatic relief from the disease, and progressive loss of efficacy for these symptomatic treatments warrants the discovery of newer drugs by exploring these novel drug targets. A comprehensive understanding of these therapeutic targets and their neuropathological role in AD is necessary to identify novel molecules for the treatment of AD rationally.",32851951,PMC8573750,10.2174/1570159X18666200807130637,11,Current neuropharmacology,101157239,7.708,0.29098087549209595,0.5484949832775919,0.8394648829431438,1.8258875219507762
Molecular mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease: From therapeutic targets to promising drugs,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by cognitive impairment so widespread that it interferes with a person's ability to complete daily activities. AD is becoming increasingly common, and it is estimated that the number of patients will reach 152 million by 2050. Current treatment options for AD are symptomatic and have modest benefits. Therefore, considering the human, social, and economic burden of the disease, the development of drugs with the potential to alter disease progression has become a global priority. In this review, the molecular mechanisms involved in the pathology of AD were evaluated as therapeutic targets. The main aim of the review is to focus on new knowledge about mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and neuronal transmission in AD, as well as a range of cellular signaling mechanisms and associated treatments. Important molecular interactions leading to AD were described in amyloid cascade and in tau protein function, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, cholinergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission, cAMP-regulatory element-binding protein (CREB), the silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog 1 (SIRT-1), neuroinflammation (glial cells), and synaptic alterations. This review summarizes recent experimental and clinical research in AD pathology and analyzes the potential of therapeutic applications based on molecular disease mechanisms.",36576325,,10.1111/fcp.12861,2,Fundamental & clinical pharmacology,8710411,2.747,0.2894721031188965,0.22742474916387959,0.24414715719063546,0.7685682117041137
Tau Abnormalities and the Potential Therapy in Alzheimer's Disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative diseases that is characterized by progressive memory loss and two main pathological hallmarks, including the extracellular amyloid plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles. The microtubule-related protein tau is involved in the pathogenesis of many neurological diseases commonly known as tauopathies and is found to be abnormally hyperphosphorylated in AD and accumulated in neurons. Besides hyperphosphorylation, tau also undergoes abnormal glycosylation, ubiquitination, glycation, and other posttranslational modifications. These abnormalities lead to the aberrant aggregation of tau in the synaptic loci in AD. In this review, we highlighted the most recent studies about how tau is abnormally regulated and how those abnormalities play important roles in the pathogenesis of AD.",30507581,,10.3233/JAD-180868,10,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,4.16,0.2894721031188965,0.5250836120401338,0.3779264214046823,1.1106999842793646
Improving mouse models for the study of Alzheimer's disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disease whose risk is influenced by genetic and environmental factors. Although a number of pathological hallmarks have been extensively studied over the last several decades, a complete picture of disease initiation and progression remains unclear. We now understand that numerous cell types and systems are involved in AD pathogenesis, and that this cellular profile may present differently for each individual, making the creation of relevant mouse models challenging. However, with increasingly diverse data made available by genome-wide association studies, we can identify and examine new genes and pathways involved in genetic risk for AD, many of which involve vascular health and inflammation. When developing mouse models, it is critical to assess (1) an aging timeline that represents onset and progression in humans, (2) genetic variants and context, (3) environmental factors present in human populations that result in both neuropathological and functional changes-themes that we address in this chapter.",35461569,,10.1016/bs.ctdb.2021.12.005,0,Current topics in developmental biology,0163114,0.0,0.2879680097103119,0.046822742474916385,0.07023411371237458,0.1821453543211704
Potential of GPCRs to modulate MAPK and mTOR pathways in Alzheimer's disease,"Despite efforts to understand the mechanism of neuronal cell death, finding effective therapies for neurodegenerative diseases is still a challenge. Cognitive deficits are often associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Remarkably, in the absence of consensus biomarkers, diagnosis of diseases such as Alzheimer's still relies on cognitive tests. Unfortunately, all efforts to translate findings in animal models to the patients have been unsuccessful. Alzheimer's disease may be addressed from two different points of view, neuroprotection or cognitive enhancement. Based on recent data, the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway arises as a versatile player whose modulation may impact on mechanisms of both neuroprotection and cognition. Whereas direct targeting of mTOR does not seem to constitute a convenient approach in drug discovery, its indirect modulation by other signaling pathways seems promising. In fact, G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) remain the most common 'druggable' targets and as such pharmacological manipulation of GPCRs with selective ligands may modulate phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K), mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase and mTOR signaling pathways. Thus, GPCRs become important targets for potential drug treatments in different neurodegenerative disorders including, but not limited to, Alzheimer's disease. GPCR-mediated modulation of mTOR may take advantage of different GPCRs coupled to different G-dependent and G-independent signal transduction routes, of functional selectivity and/or of biased agonism. Signals mediated by GPCRs may act as coincidence detectors to achieve different benefits in different stages of the neurodegenerative disease.",28189739,,10.1016/j.pneurobio.2017.01.004,21,Progress in neurobiology,0370121,0.0,0.2833845913410187,0.7224080267558528,0.07357859531772576,0.31451236015578177
Neurodegenerative disorders: From clinicopathology convergence to systems biology divergence,"Neurodegenerative diseases are multifactorial. This means that several genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors contribute to their emergence. Therefore, for the future management of these highly prevalent diseases, it is necessary to change perspective. If a holistic viewpoint is assumed, the phenotype (the clinicopathological convergence) emerges from the perturbation of a complex system of functional interactions among proteins (systems biology divergence). The systems biology top-down approach starts with the unbiased collection of sets of data generated through one or more -omics techniques and has the aim to identify the networks and the components that participate in the generation of a phenotype (disease), often without any available a priori knowledge. The principle behind the top-down method is that the molecular components that respond similarly to experimental perturbations are somehow functionally related. This allows the study of complex and relatively poorly characterized diseases without requiring extensive knowledge of the processes under investigation. In this chapter, the use of a global approach will be applied to the comprehension of neurodegeneration, with a particular focus on the two most prevalent ones, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. The final purpose is to distinguish disease subtypes (even with similar clinical manifestations) to launch a future of precision medicine for patients with these disorders.",36796949,,10.1016/B978-0-323-85538-9.00007-9,1,Handbook of clinical neurology,0166161,0.0,0.2825919985771179,0.14715719063545152,0.07692307692307693,0.19898663727336105
Pathogenic Potential of Eomesodermin-Expressing T-Helper Cells in Neurodegenerative Diseases,"Eomesodermin-expressing (Eomes+) T-helper (Th) cells show cytotoxic characteristics in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. We found that Eomes+Th cell frequency was increased in the peripheral blood of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease patients. Furthermore, granzyme B production by Th cells from such patients was high compared with controls. A high frequency of Eomes+Th cells was observed in the initial (acutely progressive) stage of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and a positive correlation between Eomes+Th cell frequency and cognitive decline was observed in Alzheimer's disease patients. Therefore, Eomes+Th cells may be involved in the pathology of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease.

Chronic Sleep Disturbances Alters Sleep Structure and Tau Phosphorylation in AÎ²PP/PS1 AD Mice and Their Wild-Type Littermates,"Background:Emerging evidence indicates that sleep disorders are the common non-cognitive symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and they may contribute to the pathogenesis of this disease.Objective:In this study, we aim to investigate the effect of chronic sleep deprivation (CSD) on AD-related pathologies with a focus on tau phosphorylation and the underlying DNA methylation regulation.Methods:AÎ²PPswe/PS1ÎE9 AD mice and their wild-type (WT) littermates were subjected to a two-month CSD followed by electroencephalography and electromyography recording. The mice were examined for learning and memory evaluation, then pathological, biochemical, and epigenetic assessments including western blotting, immunofluorescence, dot blotting, and bisulfite sequencing.Results:The results show that CSD caused sleep disturbances shown as sleep pattern change, poor sleep maintenance, and increased sleep fragmentation. CSD increased tau phosphorylation at different sites and increased the level of tau kinases in AD and WT mice. The increased expression of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) may result from decreased DNA methylation of CpG sites in the promoter region of CDK5 gene, which might be associated with the downregulation of DNA methyltransferase 3A and 3B.Conclusion:CSD altered AD-related tau phosphorylation through epigenetic modification of tau kinase gene. The findings in this study may give insights into the mechanisms underlying the effects of sleep disturbances on AD pathology and provide new therapeutic targets for the treatment of this disease.",37038814,,10.3233/JAD-221048,2,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,4.16,0.27678826451301575,0.23076923076923078,0.38127090301003347,1.0442268048616556
The Phosphoinositide Signal Transduction Pathway in the Pathogenesis of Alzheimer's Disease,"Background:During aging and in age-associated disorders, such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD), learning abilities decline. Probably, disturbances in signal transduction in brain cells underlie the cognitive decline. The phosphorylation/dephosphorylation imbalance occurring in degenerating neurons was recently related to abnormal activity of one or more signal transduction pathways. AD is known to be associated with altered neuronal Ca2+homeostasis, as Ca2+accumulates in affected neurons leading to functional impairment. It is becoming more and more evident the involvement of signal transduction pathways acting upon Ca2+metabolism and phosphorylation regulation of proteins. A growing interest raised around the role of signal transduction systems in a number of human diseases including neurodegenerative diseases, with special regard to the systems related to the phosphoinositide (PI) pathway and AD. The PI signal transduction pathway plays a crucial role, being involved in a variety of cell functions, such as hormone secretion, neurotransmitter signal transduction, cell growth, membrane trafficking, ion channel activity, cytoskeleton regulation, cell cycle control, apoptosis, cell and tissue polarity, and contributes to regulate the Ca2+levels in the nervous tissue.Conclusion:A number of observations indicated that PI-specific phospholipase C (PLC) enzymes might be involved in the alteration of neurotransmission. To understand the role and the timing of action of the signalling pathways recruited during the brain morphology changes during the AD progression might help to elucidate the aetiopathogenesis of the disease, paving the way to prognosis refinement and/or novel molecular therapeutic strategies.",28847278,,10.2174/1567205014666170829100230,7,Current Alzheimer research,101208441,3.04,0.27542194724082947,0.4414715719063545,0.2809364548494983,0.8615474827257685
Tau seeds occur before earliest Alzheimer's changes and are prevalent across neurodegenerative diseases,"Tau neurofibrillary tangles are a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease neuropathological change. However, it remains largely unclear how distinctive Alzheimer's disease tau seeds (i.e. 3R/4R) correlate with histological indicators of tau accumulation. Furthermore, AD tau co-pathology is thought to influence features and progression of other neurodegenerative diseases including Lewy body disease; yet measurements of different types of tau seeds in the setting of such diseases is an unmet need. Here, we use tau real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) assays to selectively quantitate 3R/4R tau seeds in the frontal lobe which accumulates histologically identifiable tau pathology at late disease stages of AD neuropathologic change. Seed quantitation across a spectrum of neurodegenerative disease cases and controls indicated tau seeding activity can be detected well before accompanying histopathological indication of tau deposits, and even prior to the earliest evidence of Alzheimer's-related tau accumulation anywhere in the brain. In later stages of AD, 3R/4R tau RT-QuIC measures correlated with immunohistochemical tau burden. In addition, Alzheimer's tau seeds occur in the vast majority of cases evaluated here inclusive of primary synucleinopathies, frontotemporal lobar degeneration and even controls albeit at multi-log lower levels than Alzheimer's cases. Î±-synuclein seeding activity confirmed synucleinopathy cases and further indicated the co-occurrence of Î±-synuclein seeds in some Alzheimer's disease and primary tauopathy cases. Our analysis indicates that 3R/4R tau seeds in the mid-frontal lobe correlate with the overall Braak stage and Alzheimer's disease neuropathologic change, supporting the quantitative predictive value of tau RT-QuIC assays. Our data also indicate 3R/4R tau seeds are elevated in females compared to males at high (â¥ IV) Braak stages. This study suggests 3R/4R tau seeds are widespread even prior to the earliest stages of Alzheimer's disease changes, including in normal, and even young individuals, with prevalence across multiple neurodegenerative diseases to further define disease subtypes.",37154939,PMC10261243,10.1007/s00401-023-02574-0,4,Acta neuropathologica,0412041,0.0,0.2748376727104187,0.35785953177257523,0.0802675585284281,0.23647450998076627
Comprehensive Analysis of Long Non-Coding RNAs N4-Acetylcytidine in Alzheimer's Disease Mice Model Using High-Throughput Sequencing,"Background:N4-acetylcytidine (ac4C), an important posttranscriptional modification, is involved in various disease processes. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate gene expression mainly through epigenetic modification, transcription, and posttranscriptional modification. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by amyloidosis of the brain. However, the role of lncRNA ac4C modification in AD remains unclear.Objective:In this study, we investigated the association between ac4C modification and AD, and the underlying mechanisms of ac4C modification in AD.Methods:The male 9-month-old APP/PS1 double transgenic mice, age- and sex-matched wild type (WT) mice were used in this study. Then, ac4C-RIP-seq and RNA-seq were used to comprehensively analyze lncRNA ac4C modification in AD mice. The lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory networks using Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses showed the regulatory relationships among these three lncRNAs and AD.Results:The results showed that there were 120 significantly different ac4C peaks located on 102 lncRNAs in AD, of which 55 were hyperacetylated and 47 were hypoacetylated. Simultaneously, 231 differentially expressed lncRNAs were identified, including 138 upregulated lncRNAs and 93 downregulated lncRNAs. Moreover, 3 lncRNAs, lncRNA Gm26508, lncRNA A430046D13Rik, and lncRNA 9530059O14Rik, showed significant changes in both the ac4C and RNA levels using conjoint analysis.Conclusion:The abundance of lncRNA ac4C modification is significantly different in AD and indicates that lncRNA ac4C is associated with the occurrence and development of AD, which could provide a basis for further exploration of the related regulatory mechanisms.",36314201,,10.3233/JAD-220564,2,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,4.16,0.274545818567276,0.23411371237458195,0.38461538461538464,1.043550233615282
A New Kid on the Block? Carbonic Anhydrases as Possible New Targets in Alzheimer's Disease,"The increase in the incidence of neurodegenerative diseases, in particular Alzheimer's Disease (AD), is a consequence of the world's population aging but unfortunately, existing treatments are only effective at delaying some of the symptoms and for a limited time. Despite huge efforts by both academic researchers and pharmaceutical companies, no disease-modifying drugs have been brought to the market in the last decades. Recently, several studies shed light on Carbonic Anhydrases (CAs, EC 4.2.1.1) as possible new targets for AD treatment. In the present review we summarized preclinical and clinical findings regarding the role of CAs and their inhibitors/activators on cognition, aging and neurodegeneration and we discuss future challenges and opportunities in the field.",31554165,PMC6801497,10.3390/ijms20194724,31,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,6.208,0.2733803689479828,0.802675585284281,0.6655518394648829,1.5661633384256457
Neurodegeneration enters the era of functional genomics,"There are no cures for the most common neurodegenerative diseases. None of the currently approved treatments cure or halt these conditions; rather, they address symptoms or slow disease progression. A focus on protein deposits in the brain-a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD)-has led to the development of immunotherapy drugs. Other promising avenues of investigation include the roles of neuroinflammation in neurodegeneration. However, the clinical impact of these approaches is still uncertain. What about exploiting our knowledge of the human genome and the ability to modify it with surgically precise tools?

Role of Long Non-coding RNAs in the Pathogenesis of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Diseases,"Neurodegenerative diseases are a diverse group of diseases that are now one of the leading causes of morbidity in the elderly population. These diseases include Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), etc. Although these diseases have a common characteristic feature of progressive neuronal loss from various parts of the brain, they differ in the clinical symptoms and risk factors, leading to the development and progression of the diseases. AD is a neurological condition that leads to dementia and cognitive decline due to neuronal cell death in the brain, whereas PD is a movement disorder affecting neuro-motor function and develops due to the death of the dopaminergic neurons in the brain, resulting in decreased dopamine levels. Currently, the only treatment available for these neurodegenerative diseases involves reducing the rate of progression of neuronal loss. This necessitates the development of efficient early biomarkers and effective therapies for these diseases. Long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs) belong to a large family of non-coding transcripts with a minimum length of 200 nucleotides. They are implied to be involved in the development of the brain, a variety of diseases, and epigenetic, transcriptional, and posttranscriptional levels of gene regulation. Aberrant expression of lncRNAs in the CNS is considered to play a major role in the development and progression of AD and PD, two of the most leading causes of morbidity among elderly populations. In this mini-review, we discuss the role of various long non-coding RNAs in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, which can further be studied for the development of potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for various neurodegenerative diseases.",35081899,,10.2174/1874609815666220126095847,3,Current aging science,101473576,0.0,0.2713482081890106,0.3076923076923077,0.08695652173913043,0.22434738645186791
Alternative Splicing and Hypoxia Puzzle in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Diseases,"Alternative pre-mRNA splicing plays a very important role in expanding protein diversity as it generates numerous transcripts from a single protein-coding gene. Therefore, alterations lead this process to neurological human disorders, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Moreover, accumulating evidence indicates that the splicing machinery highly contributes to the cells' ability to adapt to different altered cellular microenvironments, such as hypoxia. Hypoxia is known to have an effect on the expression of proteins involved in a multiple of biological processes, such as erythropoiesis, angiogenesis, and neurogenesis, and is one of the important risk factors in neuropathogenesis. In this review, we discuss the current knowledge of alternatively spliced genes, which, as it is reported, are associated with Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Additionally, we highlight the possible influence of cellular hypoxic microenvironment for the formation of mRNA isoforms contributing to the development of these neurodegenerative diseases.",34440445,PMC8394294,10.3390/genes12081272,5,Genes,101551097,4.141,0.2689414322376251,0.38127090301003347,0.35785953177257523,1.0658190399445817
Looking Behind the Curtain: Patient Stratification According to Genetic or Demographic Factors May Yield Unexpected Results in Studies of Neurodegenerative Diseases,"Amyloid-PET studies of neurodegenerative diseases may yield inconclusive findings due to lacking stratification according to genetic or demographic variants. APOEÉ4 alleles are the major variants to increase disease susceptibility and cause earlier onset and more behavioral features in patients with late-onset Alzheimer's disease, but have no linear effects on cognitive or functional decline; thus, sample stratification according to APOEÉ4 carrier status may be the best option.

Interactions of Amyloid-Î² with Membrane Proteins,"In developing and developed countries, an increasing elderly population is observed. This affects the growing percentage of people struggling with neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. Nevertheless, the pathomechanism of this disease is still unknown. This contributes to problems with early diagnosis of the disease as well as with treatment. One of the most popular hypotheses of Alzheimer's disease is related to the pathological deposition of amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) in the brain of ill people. In this paper, we discuss issues related to AÎ² and its relationship in the development of Alzheimer's disease. The structure of AÎ² and its interaction with the cell membrane are discussed.

Revisiting the Cholinergic Hypothesis in Alzheimer's Disease: Emerging Evidence from Translational and Clinical Research,"Scientific evidence collected over the past 4 decades suggests that a loss of cholinergic innervation in the cerebral cortex of patients with Alzheimer's disease is an early pathogenic event correlated with cognitive impairment. This evidence led to the formulation of the ""Cholinergic Hypothesis of AD"" and the development of cholinesterase inhibitor therapies. Although approved only as symptomatic therapies, recent studies suggest that long-term use of these drugs may also have disease-modifying benefits. A Cholinergic System Workgroup reassessed the role of the cholinergic system on AD pathogenesis in light of recent data, including neuroimaging data charting the progression of neurodegeneration in the cholinergic system and suggesting that cholinergic therapy may slow brain atrophy. Other pathways that contribute to cholinergic synaptic loss and their effect on cognitive impairment in AD were also reviewed. These studies indicate that the cholinergic system as one of several interacting systems failures that contribute to AD pathogenesis.",30569080,,10.14283/jpad.2018.43,97,The journal of prevention of Alzheimer's disease,101638820,5.02,0.2617081105709076,0.9632107023411371,0.5317725752508361,1.353667006810772
The Role of Bioenergetics in Neurodegeneration,"Bioenergetic and mitochondrial dysfunction are common hallmarks of neurodegenerative diseases. Decades of research describe how genetic and environmental factors initiate changes in mitochondria and bioenergetics across Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Mitochondria control many cellular processes, including proteostasis, inflammation, and cell survival/death. These cellular processes and pathologies are common across neurodegenerative diseases. Evidence suggests that mitochondria and bioenergetic disruption may drive pathological changes, placing mitochondria as an upstream causative factor in neurodegenerative disease onset and progression. Here, we discuss evidence of mitochondrial and bioenergetic dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases and address how mitochondria can drive common pathological features of these diseases.",36012480,PMC9409169,10.3390/ijms23169212,7,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,6.208,0.26057758927345276,0.44481605351170567,0.6722408026755853,1.4869097642664129
The Immunopathogenesis of Alzheimer's Disease Is Related to the Composition of Gut Microbiota,"The microbiota-gut-brain axis plays an important role in the development of neurodegenerative diseases. Commensal and pathogenic enteric bacteria can influence brain and immune system function by the production of lipopolysaccharides and amyloid. Dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiome induces local and consecutively systemic immune-mediated inflammation. Proinflammatory cytokines then trigger neuroinflammation and finally neurodegeneration. Immune-mediated oxidative stress can lead to a deficiency of vitamins and essential micronutrients. Furthermore, the wrong composition of gut microbiota might impair the intake and metabolization of nutrients. In patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) significant alterations of the gut microbiota have been demonstrated. Standard Western diet, infections, decreased physical activity and chronic stress impact the composition and diversity of gut microbiota. A higher abundancy of ""pro-inflammatory"" gut microbiota goes along with enhanced systemic inflammation and neuroinflammatory processes. Thus, AD beginning in the gut is closely related to the imbalance of gut microbiota. Modulation of gut microbiota by Mediterranean diet, probiotics and curcumin can slow down cognitive decline and alter the gut microbiome significantly. A multi-domain intervention approach addressing underlying causes of AD (inflammation, infections, metabolic alterations like insulin resistance and nutrient deficiency, stress) appears very promising to reduce or even reverse cognitive decline by exerting positive effects on the gut microbiota.",33504065,PMC7912578,10.3390/nu13020361,45,Nutrients,101521595,6.706,0.25963789224624634,0.8795986622073578,0.7324414715719063,1.6729024677892195
[Mitochondrial genome variants and neurodegenerative diseases],"Neurodegenerative diseases are a group of diseases characterized by chronic progressive damage to tissues of central nervous system and peripheral nervous system, which include Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal dementia, etc. The etiology is mainly related to factors such as aging, genetics and environment. More and more evidence indicate that mitochondrial dysfunction plays a vital role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Variants of mitochondrial genes, including point variants, deletions, and copy number variations, have been recognized as important factors modulating genetic susceptibility to such diseases.

Additionally, piRNAs regulate chromatin modifications, such as trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me3) or DNA methylation. In the past decade, the roles of piRNAs have been characterized in somatic cells, including post-mitotic neurons. More recently, piRNAs have been shown to play important roles in brain functions and various neuronal diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders. In this review, we introduce recent findings showing the potential involvement of piRNAs in the etiology of different neurodegenerative diseases, includingamyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD).

MicroRNAs as a New Target for Alzheimer's Disease Treatment,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common progressive neurodegenerative disease associated with advanced age. It is characterized by cognitive decline and memory loss and accounts for most cases of dementia in older people. AD can be rooted in genetic, epigenetic, or environmental causes. No drugs or other therapeutic agents prevent or delay AD progression. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short and uncoded RNAs that can bind to 200 RNAs approximately. By inhibiting or destroying specific messenger RNAs (mRNAs), they control gene expression and broadly affect cellular functions. MiRNAs play important roles in regulating neuronal growth, neuronal differentiation, dendritic spine morphology, and synaptic flexibility in the nervous system. The expression levels of miRNAs are changed in neurological diseases, including AD, suggesting that they play an essential role in the pathogenesis of the disease. Therefore, targeting disrupted miRNAs may be a novel therapeutic approach against AD and offers multiple solutions, including harnessing the beneficial effects of beta-amyloid, reducing tau protein, reducing neuronal cell death, and protecting synapses in AD.",36173083,,10.2174/2211536611666220928154015,2,"MicroRNA (Shariqah, United Arab Emirates)",101631045,0.0,0.2577650845050812,0.23745819397993312,0.09364548494983277,0.20215068949903534
Mitochondrial mechanisms in Alzheimer's disease: Quest for therapeutics,"Mitochondrial function is essential for maintaining neuronal integrity, because neurons have a high energy demand. Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), are exacerbated by mitochondrial dysfunction. Mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy) attenuates neurodegenerative diseases by eradicating dysfunctional mitochondria. In neurodegenerative disorders, there is disruption of the mitophagy process. High levels of iron also interfere with the mitophagy process and the mtDNA released after mitophagy is proinflammatory and triggers the cGAS-STING pathway that aids AD pathology. In this review, we critically discuss the factors that affect mitochondrial impairment and different mitophagy processes in AD.

Impact of genetic predisposition to late-onset neurodegenerative diseases on early life outcomes and brain structure,"Most patients with late-onset neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's have a complex aetiology resulting from numerous genetic risk variants of small effects located across the genome, environmental factors, and the interaction between genes and environment. Over the last decade, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and post-GWAS analyses have shed light on the polygenic architecture of these diseases, enabling polygenic risk scores (PRS) to estimate an individual's relative genetic liability for presenting with the disease. PRS can screen and stratify individuals based on their genetic risk, potentially years or even decades before the onset of clinical symptoms. An emerging body of evidence from various research studies suggests that genetic susceptibility to late-onset neurodegenerative diseases might impact early life outcomes, including cognitive function, brain structure and function, and behaviour. This article summarises recent findings exploring the potential impact of genetic susceptibility to neurodegenerative diseases on early life outcomes. A better understanding of the impact of genetic susceptibility to neurodegenerative diseases early in life could be valuable in disease screening, detection, and prevention and in informing treatment strategies before significant neural damage has occurred. However, ongoing studies have limitations. Overall, our review found several studies focused on APOE haplotypes and Alzheimer's risk, but a limited number of studies leveraging polygenic risk scores or focused on genetic susceptibility to other late-onset conditions.",38605018,PMC11009228,10.1038/s41398-024-02898-9,0,Translational psychiatry,101562664,7.989,0.2546016275882721,0.056856187290969896,0.8494983277591973,1.761932214011157
Evolutionary and genomic perspectives of brain aging and neurodegenerative diseases,"This chapter utilizes genomic concepts and evolutionary perspectives to further understand the possible links between typical brain aging and neurodegenerative diseases, focusing on the two most prevalent of these: Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Aging is the major risk factor for these neurodegenerative diseases. Researching the evolutionary and molecular underpinnings of aging helps to reveal elements of the typical aging process that leave individuals more vulnerable to neurodegenerative pathologies. Very little is known about the prevalence and susceptibility of neurodegenerative diseases in nonhuman species, as only a few individuals have been observed with these neuropathologies. However, several studies have investigated the evolution of lifespan, which is closely connected with brain size in mammals, and insights can be drawn from these to enrich our understanding of neurodegeneration. This chapter explores the relationship between the typical aging process and the events in neurodegeneration. First, we examined how age-related processes can increase susceptibility to neurodegenerative diseases. Second, we assessed to what extent neurodegeneration is an accelerated form of aging. We found that while at the phenotypic level both neurodegenerative diseases and the typical aging process share some characteristics, at the molecular level they show some distinctions in their profiles, such as variation in genes and gene expression. Furthermore, neurodegeneration of the brain is associated with an earlier onset of cellular, molecular, and structural age-related changes. In conclusion, a more integrative view of the aging process, both from a molecular and an evolutionary perspective, may increase our understanding of neurodegenerative diseases.",36841568,,10.1016/bs.pbr.2022.10.004,2,Progress in brain research,0376441,0.0,0.25349122285842896,0.24414715719063546,0.09698996655518395,0.20092416515318448
[Causes and Consequences of Genome Instability in Psychiatric and Neurodegenerative Diseases],"Each neuron has 100-10000 connections (synapses) with other neural cells, therefore genome pathologies affecting a small proportion of brain cells are capable of causing dysfunction of the entire central nervous system (CNS). Recently, genome and chromosome instability has been uncovered in neurodegeneration (Alzheimer's disease, ataxia telangiectasia). Somatic tissue-specific mosaicism was observed in the brain of individuals with neuropsychiatric diseases including schizophrenia, autism, intellectual disability, and epilepsy. The study of genetic processes in neurons allows determination of a certain number of genetic pathways and candidate processes, modifications of which can cause impaired genome stability. Brain-specific somatic mutations generally occur at the earliest stages of development. Accordingly, genome variability and somatic mosaicism are expected to be mediated by cell cycle regulation, DNA repair, DNA replication, and programmed cell death in the brain. Endomitosis, endoreduplication, and abortive entrance to the cell cycle are also commonly observed in neurodegeneration. Brain-specific genome instability maybe a key element in the pathogenic cascade of neurodegeneration. Here we review the current state of knowledge concerning somatic genome variations in neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases and analyze the causes and consequences of genomic instability in the CNS.",33566024,,10.31857/S0026898421010158,8,Molekuliarnaia biologiia,0105454,0.0,0.2531217932701111,0.4782608695652174,0.10033444816053512,0.2475252498751101
New Insights into Molecular Mechanisms Underlying Neurodegenerative Disorders,"As a large and heterogeneous group of disorders, neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by the progressive loss of structure or function in neurons, finally leading to neuronal death. Neurodegenerative diseases cause serious threat to a patient's quality of life and the most common are Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Currently, little is known of the detailed etiology of these disorders; as such, there are no effective treatments available. Furthermore, the lack of targeted, effective, and resolvable therapy for neurodegenerative diseases, represents an expanding research field for the discovery of new therapeutic strategies. Investigations of the potential pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases will become the basis of preventing the occurrence and development of neurodegenerative diseases and finding effective therapies. Existing theories and mechanisms, such as genetic and environmental factors, abnormal protein accumulation, and oxidative stress, are intricately associated with each other. However, there is no molecular theory that can entirely explain the pathological processes underlying neurodegenerative diseases. Due to the development of experimental technology and the support of multidisciplinary integration, it has been possible to perform more in-depth research on potential targets for neurodegenerative diseases and there have been many exciting discoveries in terms of original theories and underlying mechanisms. With this review, we intend to review the existing literature and provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative diseases.",37258447,,10.31083/j.jin2203058,3,Journal of integrative neuroscience,101156357,1.664,0.25219982862472534,0.31438127090301005,0.22408026755852842,0.5469961513554372
A novel regulator in Alzheimer's disease progression: The astrocyte-derived extracellular vesicles,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is known as an age-related irreversible neurodegenerative disease. AD seriously endangers the health of the elderly, but there is still no effective treatment. In the past several decades, the significant role of astrocytes in the process of AD has been universally acknowledged. In addition, extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been recognized as an essential mediator in intercellular communication and participate in various pathophysiological processes by carrying and transporting diverse cargoes. Moreover, specific conditions and stimuli can modulate the amount and properties of astrocyte-derived EVs (ADEVs) to affect AD progression. Thus, recent studies focused on the involvement of ADEVs in the pathogenesis of AD and the potential application of ADEVs in the diagnosis and treatment of AD, which provides a new direction and possibility for revealing the mystery of AD. Interestingly, it can be concluded that ADEVs have both pathogenic and protective effects in the process of AD through a comprehensive generalization. In this review, we aim to summarize the multi-faces of ADEVs effects on AD development, which can provide a novel strategy to investigate the underlying mechanism in AD. We also summarize the current ADEVs clinically relevant studies to raise the potential use of ADEVs in the discovery of novel biomarkers for diagnosis and therapeutic targets for AD.",36736378,,10.1016/j.arr.2023.101871,2,Ageing research reviews,101128963,11.788,0.25183168053627014,0.24749163879598662,0.9264214046822743,2.5581973360809593
The regulatory mechanism and therapeutic potential of transcription factor EB in neurodegenerative diseases,"The autophagy-lysosomal pathway (ALP) is involved in the degradation of protein aggregates and damaged organelles. Transcription factor EB (TFEB), a major regulator of ALP, has emerged as a leading factor in addressing neurodegenerative disease pathology, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), PolyQ diseases, and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In this review, we delineate the regulation of TFEB expression and its functions in ALP. Dysfunctions of TFEB and its role in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases are reviewed. We summarize the protective effects and molecular mechanisms of some TFEB-targeted agonists in neurodegenerative diseases. We also offer our perspective on analyzing the pros and cons of these agonists in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases from the perspective of drug development. More studies on the regulatory mechanisms of TFEB in other biological processes will aid our understanding of the application of TFEB-targeted therapy in neurodegeneration.",36184826,PMC9804079,10.1111/cns.13985,1,CNS neuroscience & therapeutics,101473265,7.035,0.2514638304710388,0.15719063545150502,0.7424749163879598,1.5893164253729242
Review: Somatic mutations in neurodegeneration,"Somatic mutations are postzygotic mutations which may lead to mosaicism, the presence of cells with genetic differences in an organism. Their role in cancer is well established, but detailed investigation in health and other diseases has only been recently possible. This has been empowered by the improvements of sequencing techniques, including single-cell sequencing, which can still be error-prone but is rapidly improving. Mosaicism appears relatively common in the human body, including the normal brain, probably arising in early development, but also potentially during ageing. In this review, we first discuss theoretical considerations and current evidence relevant to somatic mutations in the brain. We present a framework to explain how they may be integrated with current views on neurodegeneration, focusing mainly on sporadic late-onset neurodegenerative diseases (Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). We review the relevant studies so far, with the first evidence emerging in Alzheimer's in particular. We also discuss the role of mosaicism in inherited neurodegenerative disorders, particularly somatic instability of tandem repeats. We summarize existing views and data to present a model whereby the time of origin and spatial distribution of relevant somatic mutations, combined with any additional risk factors, may partly determine the development and onset age of sporadic neurodegenerative diseases.",29369391,,10.1111/nan.12465,38,Neuropathology and applied neurobiology,7609829,6.25,0.2512800693511963,0.842809364548495,0.7157190635451505,1.569329914520417
O-GlcNAcylation and Its Roles in Neurodegenerative Diseases,"As a non-classical post-translational modification, O-linked Î²-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) modification (O-GlcNAcylation) is widely found in human organ systems, particularly in our brains, and is indispensable for healthy cell biology. With the increasing age of the global population, the incidence of neurodegenerative diseases is increasing, too. The common characteristic of these disorders is the aggregation of abnormal proteins in the brain. Current research has found that O-GlcNAcylation dysregulation is involved in misfolding or aggregation of these abnormal proteins to mediate disease progression, but the specific mechanism has not been defined. This paper reviews recent studies on O-GlcNAcylation's roles in several neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington's disease, Machado-Joseph's disease, and giant axonal neuropathy, and shows that O-GlcNAcylation, as glucose metabolism sensor, mediating synaptic function, participating in oxidative stress response and signaling pathway conduction, directly or indirectly regulates characteristic pathological protein toxicity and affects disease progression. The existing results suggest that targeting O-GlcNAcylation will provide new ideas for clinical diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.",38250776,,10.3233/JAD-230955,0,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,4.16,0.25109636783599854,0.06020066889632107,0.391304347826087,0.9946979544808634
Tau-mediated Neurodegeneration and Potential Implications in Diagnosis and Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease,"Objective:To review recent research advances on tau, a major player in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis, a biomarker for AD onset, and potential target for AD therapy.Data sources:This review was based on a comprehensive search using online literature databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar.Study selection:Literature search was based on the following keywords: Alzheimer's disease, tau protein, biomarker, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), therapeutics, plasma, imaging, propagation, spreading, seeding, prion, conformational templating, and posttranslational modification. Relevant articles were carefully reviewed, with no exclusions applied to study design and publication type.Results:Amyloid plaques enriched with extracellular amyloid beta (AÎ²) and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles comprised of hyperphosphorylated tau proteins are the two main pathological hallmarks of AD. Although the AÎ² hypothesis has dominated AD research for many years, clinical AÎ²-targeting strategies have consistently failed to effectively treat AD or prevent AD onset. The research focus in AD has recently shifted to the role of tau in AD. In addition to phosphorylation, tau is acetylated and proteolytically cleaved, which also contribute to its physiological and pathological functions. Emerging evidence characterizing pathological tau propagation and spreading provides new avenues for research into the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying AD pathogenesis. Techniques to detect tau at minute levels in CSF and blood have been developed, and improved tracers have facilitated tau imaging in the brain. These advances have potential to accurately determine tau levels at early diagnostic stages in AD. Given that tau is a potential therapeutic target, anti-tau immunotherapy may potentially be a viable treatment strategy in AD intervention.Conclusion:Detecting changes in tau and targeting tau pathology represent a promising lead in the diagnosis and treatment of AD.",29237931,PMC5742926,10.4103/0366-6999.220313,29,Chinese medical journal,7513795,6.133,0.25091278553009033,0.7859531772575251,0.6254180602006689,1.5343383067695593
Alzheimer's Disease: Lessons Learned from Amyloidocentric Clinical Trials,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most debilitating neurodegenerative diseases and is predicted to affect 1 in 85 people by 2050. Despite much effort to discover a therapeutic strategy to prevent progression or to cure AD, to date no effective disease-modifying agent is available that can prevent, halt, or reverse the cognitive and functional decline of patients with AD. Several underlying etiologies to this failure are proposed. First, accumulating evidence from past trials suggests a preventive as opposed to therapeutic paradigm, and the precise temporal and mechanistic relationship of Î²-amyloid (AÎ²) and tau protein should be elucidated to confirm this hypothesis. Second, we are in urgent need of revised diagnostic criteria to support future trials. Third, various technical and methodological improvements are required, based on the lessons learned from previous failed trials.",26187557,,10.1007/s40263-015-0257-8,20,CNS drugs,9431220,6.497,0.2503625452518463,0.705685618729097,0.7224080267558528,1.5907546508969272
The End of the Beginning of the Alzheimer's Disease Nightmare: A Devil's Advocate's View,"Although there have been so many failures in Alzheimer's disease (AD) modifying trials, there are still many compounds in the pipeline and the hope still remains that the entrance of disease-modifying treatment (DMT) for AD will positively and dramatically change the whole situation of AD treatment. However, if DMT does enter the market, it will be the beginning of a great number of challenges and problems. The current infrastructure for diagnostics of early (pre-dementia) AD does not have the capacity to meet the demands and expectations of the population. Neither is there capacity for treatment monitoring and follow-ups. If screening is considered, there will be a great risk for false positive cases and a great number of people who will have to undergo diagnostics. There will be high costs for diagnostics and treatment initially, while potential benefits will occur much later in other sectors than where the payers for treatment are. Although there are great hopes that prevention of cardiovascular risk factors and changes in lifestyle might impact the risk for dementia, there is still no consensus that this is the case. Finally, the relevance of different AD paradigms such as amyloid and tau is still a matter of discussion, particularly regarding the oldest old.",29710714,,10.3233/JAD-179905,6,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,4.16,0.2485341727733612,0.41471571906354515,0.39464882943143814,1.0640636474767258
The Pivotal Role of NF-kB in the Pathogenesis and Therapeutics of Alzheimer's Disease,"Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease worldwide, with a high prevalence that is expected to double every 20 years. Besides the formation of AÎ² plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, neuroinflammation is one the major phenotypes that worsens AD progression. Indeed, the nuclear factor-ÎºB (NF-ÎºB) is a well-established inflammatory transcription factor that fuels neurodegeneration. Thus, in this review, we provide an overview of the NF-ÎºB role in the pathogenesis of AD, including its interaction with various molecular factors in AD mice models, neurons, and glial cells. Some of these cell types and molecules include reactive microglia and astrocytes, Î²-secretase, APOE, glutamate, miRNA, and tau protein, among others. Due to the multifactorial nature of AD development and the failure of many drugs designed to dampen AD progression, the pursuit of novel targets for AD therapeutics, including the NF-ÎºB signaling pathway, is rising. Herein, we provide a synopsis of the drug development landscape for AD treatment, offering the perspective that NF-ÎºB inhibitors may generate widespread interest in AD research in the future. Ultimately, the additional investigation of compounds and small molecules that target NF-ÎºB signaling and the complete understanding of NF-ÎºB mechanistic activation in different cell types will broaden and provide more therapeutic options for AD patients.",36012242,PMC9408758,10.3390/ijms23168972,41,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,6.208,0.2483518421649933,0.8561872909698997,0.6755852842809364,1.5618485634929757
Evaluating the link between Paraoxonase-1 levels and Alzheimer's disease development,"At present, the etiopathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, remains far to be fully deciphered. In the recent years, also the centrality of amyloid-Î² peptide in the pathogenesis of the neurodegenerative disease has been questioned and other hypotheses have been advanced. Notably, a common denominator of many of these theoretical models is represented by oxidative stress, which is widely proposed to play a role in the disease initiation and/or progression. Paraoxonase 1 (PON1) is a high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-associated enzyme that endows its carrier with multiple biological functions, including the ability to contrast oxidative damage to lipid components of lipoproteins and cells and protect from toxicity of specific organophosphorus pesticides. The peculiar multi-functionality nature of PON1 might be the key for explaining the vast epidemiological data showing a close association between low serum PON1 activity and risk of several diseases, including cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases, in particular AD. In this review, we discuss the possible link between PON1 with AD pathogenesis and we hypothesize eventual mechanistic pathways that could account from epidemiological observations. We also highlight the methodological issue limitation in PON1 studies that still impede to give a definitive and certain picture of its effective biological impact on human health including AD.",30334443,PMC7451062,10.23736/S0026-4806.18.05875-5,20,Minerva medica,0400732,0.0,0.2465333193540573,0.7090301003344481,0.10367892976588629,0.289726011679324
Abnormal Glucose Metabolism in Alzheimer's Disease: Relation to Autophagy/Mitophagy and Therapeutic Approaches,"Diminished glucose metabolism accompanies many neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease. An understanding of the relation of these metabolic changes to the disease will enable development of novel therapeutic strategies. Following a metabolic challenge, cells generally conserve energy to preserve viability. This requires activation of many cellular repair/regenerative processes such as mitophagy/autophagy and fusion/fission. These responses may diminish cell function in the long term. Prolonged fission induces mitophagy/autophagy which promotes repair but if prolonged progresses to mitochondrial degradation. Abnormal glucose metabolism alters protein signaling including the release of proteins from the mitochondria or migration of proteins from the cytosol to the mitochondria or nucleus. This overview provides an insight into the different mechanisms of autophagy/mitophagy and mitochondrial dynamics in response to the diminished metabolism that occurs with diseases, especially neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. The review discusses multiple aspects of mitochondrial responses including different signaling proteins and pathways of mitophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis. Improving cellular bioenergetics and mitochondrial dynamics will alter protein signaling and improve cellular/mitochondrial repair and regeneration. An understanding of these changes will suggest new therapeutic strategies.",26077923,PMC4674363,10.1007/s11064-015-1631-0,20,Neurochemical research,7613461,4.414,0.24598956108093262,0.7123745819397993,0.4682274247491639,1.1728686530365193
Disruption of axonal transport in neurodegeneration,"Neurons are markedly compartmentalized, which makes them reliant on axonal transport to maintain their health. Axonal transport is important for anterograde delivery of newly synthesized macromolecules and organelles from the cell body to the synapse and for the retrograde delivery of signaling endosomes and autophagosomes for degradation. Dysregulation of axonal transport occurs early in neurodegenerative diseases and plays a key role in axonal degeneration. Here, we provide an overview of mechanisms for regulation of axonal transport; discuss how these mechanisms are disrupted in neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, hereditary spastic paraplegia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease; and discuss therapeutic approaches targeting axonal transport.",37259916,PMC10232001,10.1172/JCI168554,11,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,19.456,0.24508501589298248,0.5518394648829431,0.9899665551839465,4.148618902512378
Mechanisms associated with the dysregulation of mitochondrial function due to lead exposure and possible implications on the development of Alzheimer's disease,"Lead (Pb) is a multimedia contaminant with various pathophysiological consequences, including cognitive decline and neural abnormalities. Recent findings have reported an association of Pb toxicity with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Studies have revealed that mitochondrial dysfunction is a pathological characteristic of AD. According to toxicology reports, Pb promotes mitochondrial oxidative stress by lowering complex III activity in the electron transport chain, boosting reactive oxygen species formation, and reducing the cell's antioxidant defence system. Here, we review recent advances in the role of mitochondria in Pb-induced AD pathology, as well as the mechanisms associated with the mitochondrial dysfunction, such as the depolarisation of the mitochondrial membrane potential, mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening; mitochondrial biogenesis, bioenergetics and mitochondrial dynamics alterations; and mitophagy and apoptosis. We also discuss possible therapeutic options for mitochondrial-targeted neurodegenerative disease (AD).",35048237,,10.1007/s10534-021-00360-7,1,"Biometals : an international journal on the role of metal ions in biology,",9208478,3.378,0.24454335868358612,0.1605351170568562,0.3177257525083612,0.8544330386215229
Impact of Neuroinflammation on Hippocampal Neurogenesis: Relevance to Aging and Alzheimer's Disease,"The cognitive reserve is associated with the capacity of the brain to maintain cognitive performance in spite of being challenged by stressful degenerative insults related to aging. Hippocampal neurogenesis is a life-long process of continuous addition of functional new neurons in the memory processing circuits. Accordingly, adult hippocampal neurogenesis is increasingly seen as a key determinant of cognitive reserve robustness. On the other side, neuroinflammation, by releasing a plethora of proinflammatory cytokines and other inflammatory molecules, is increasingly shown to be one of the key determinant pathophysiological factors that negatively impact on neurogenesis and on the cognitive reserve, playing a detrimental role in hippocampal neurogenic niche dynamics and in the progression of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease. In the present manuscript, we highlight the functional interplay between neuroinflammation, dynamics of the neurogenic niche, and spatial memory performance in healthy and age-related pathological processes, including progression of Alzheimer's disease.",28671124,,10.3233/JAD-170239,35,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,4.16,0.24418270587921143,0.8294314381270903,0.3979933110367893,1.144395911152945
A Unique Microglia Type Associated with Restricting Development of Alzheimer's Disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a detrimental neurodegenerative disease with no effective treatments. Due to cellular heterogeneity, defining the roles of immune cell subsets in AD onset and progression has been challenging. Using transcriptional single-cell sorting, we comprehensively map all immune populations in wild-type and AD-transgenic (Tg-AD) mouse brains. We describe a novel microglia type associated with neurodegenerative diseases (DAM) and identify markers, spatial localization, and pathways associated with these cells. Immunohistochemical staining of mice and human brain slices shows DAM with intracellular/phagocytic AÎ² particles. Single-cell analysis of DAM in Tg-AD and triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (Trem2)-/-Tg-AD reveals that the DAM program is activated in a two-step process. Activation is initiated in a Trem2-independent manner that involves downregulation of microglia checkpoints, followed by activation of a Trem2-dependent program. This unique microglia-type has the potential to restrict neurodegeneration, which may have important implications for future treatment of AD and other neurodegenerative diseases.

"Emerging pathways to neurodegeneration: Dissecting the critical molecular mechanisms in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease","Neurodegenerative diseases are usually sporadic in nature and commonly influenced by a wide range of genetic, life style and environmental factors. A unifying feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) is the abnormal accumulation and processing of mutant or damaged intra and extracellular proteins; this leads to neuronal vulnerability and dysfunction in the brain. Through a detailed review of ubiquitin proteasome, mRNA splicing, mitochondrial dysfunction, and oxidative stress pathway interrelation on neurodegeneration can improve the understanding of the disease mechanism. The identified pathways common to AD and PD nominate promising new targets for further studies, and as well as biomarkers. These insights suggested would likely provide major stimuli for developing unified treatment approaches to combat neurodegeneration. More broadly, pathways can serve as vehicles for integrating findings from diverse studies of neurodegeneration. The evidence examined in this review provides a brief overview of the current literature on significant pathways in promoting in AD, PD.

Disruption of a RAC1-centred network is associated with Alzheimer's disease pathology and causes age-dependent neurodegeneration,"The molecular biological mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease (AD) involve disease-associated crosstalk through many genes and include a loss of normal as well as a gain of abnormal interactions among genes. A protein domain network (PDN) is a collection of physical bindings that occur between protein domains, and the states of the PDNs in patients with AD are likely to be perturbed compared to those in normal healthy individuals. To identify PDN changes that cause neurodegeneration, we analysed the PDNs that occur among genes co-expressed in each of three brain regions at each stage of AD. Our analysis revealed that the PDNs collapsed with the progression of AD stage and identified five hub genes, including Rac1, as key players in PDN collapse. Using publicly available as well as our own gene expression data, we confirmed that the mRNA expression level of the RAC1 gene was downregulated in the entorhinal cortex (EC) of AD brains. To test the causality of these changes in neurodegeneration, we utilized Drosophila as a genetic model and found that modest knockdown of Rac1 in neurons was sufficient to cause age-dependent behavioural deficits and neurodegeneration. Finally, we identified a microRNA, hsa-miR-101-3p, as a potential regulator of RAC1 in AD brains. As the Braak neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) stage progressed, the expression levels of hsa-miR-101-3p were increased specifically in the EC. Furthermore, overexpression of hsa-miR-101-3p in the human neuronal cell line SH-SY5Y caused RAC1 downregulation. These results highlight the utility of our integrated network approach for identifying causal changes leading to neurodegeneration in AD.",31942999,PMC7191305,10.1093/hmg/ddz320,18,Human molecular genetics,9208958,5.121,0.2420264333486557,0.68561872909699,0.5484949832775919,1.3065396058285914
The Amyloid Cascade Hypothesis in Alzheimer's Disease: Should We Change Our Thinking?,"Old age increases the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common neurodegenerative disease, a devastating disorder of the human mind and the leading cause of dementia. Worldwide, 50 million people have the disease, and it is estimated that there will be 150 million by 2050. Today, healthcare for AD patients consumes 1% of the global economy. According to the amyloid cascade hypothesis, AD begins in the brain by accumulating and aggregating AÎ² peptides and forming Î²-amyloid fibrils (AÎ²42). However, in clinical trials, reducing AÎ² peptide production and amyloid formation in the brain did not slow cognitive decline or improve daily life in AD patients. Prevention studies in cognitively unimpaired people at high risk or genetically destined to develop AD also have not slowed cognitive decline. These observations argue against the amyloid hypothesis of AD etiology, its development, and disease mechanisms. Here, we look at other avenues in the research of AD, such as the presenilin hypothesis, synaptic glutamate signaling, and the role of astrocytes and the glutamate transporter EAAT2 in the development of AD.",36979388,PMC10046826,10.3390/biom13030453,9,Biomolecules,101596414,6.064,0.24166831374168396,0.5083612040133779,0.6120401337792643,1.459473229047686
Structural basis of bioenergetic protein complexes in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease with no cure where the underlying causes remain elusive. Mitochondrial dysfunction has become a prime suspect in AD pathogenesis since bioenergetic deficits precede the pathology. With advancing structural biology techniques at synchrotrons and cryo-electron microscopes, it is becoming possible to determine the structures of key proteins suspected to contribute to the initiation and propagation of AD, and investigate their interactions. In this review, we provide an overview of the recent developments concerning the structural aspects of mitochondrial protein complexes and their assembly factors involved the production of energy, in pursuit of therapies to halt or even reverse this disease in the early stages when mitochondria are most sensitive to amyloid toxicity.",36966690,,10.1016/j.sbi.2023.102573,2,Current opinion in structural biology,9107784,7.786,0.24059611558914185,0.2508361204013378,0.8461538461538461,1.7517248934337526
The PERK-Dependent Molecular Mechanisms as a Novel Therapeutic Target for Neurodegenerative Diseases,"Higher prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases is strictly connected with progressive aging of the world population. Interestingly, a broad range of age-related, neurodegenerative diseases is characterized by a common pathological mechanism-accumulation of misfolded and unfolded proteins within the cells. Under certain circumstances, such protein aggregates may evoke endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress conditions and subsequent activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) signaling pathways via the protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK)-dependent manner. Under mild to moderate ER stress, UPR has a pro-adaptive role. However, severe or long-termed ER stress conditions directly evoke shift of the UPR toward its pro-apoptotic branch, which is considered to be a possible cause of neurodegeneration. To this day, there is no effective cure for Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), or prion disease. Currently available treatment approaches for these diseases are only symptomatic and cannot affect the disease progression. Treatment strategies, currently under detailed research, include inhibition of the PERK-dependent UPR signaling branches. The newest data have reported that the use of small-molecule inhibitors of the PERK-mediated signaling branches may contribute to the development of a novel, ground-breaking therapeutic approach for neurodegeneration. In this review, we critically describe all the aspects associated with such targeted therapy against neurodegenerative proteopathies.",32204380,PMC7139310,10.3390/ijms21062108,31,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,6.208,0.23970511555671692,0.8060200668896321,0.6822742474916388,1.5466270827119566
Tau filaments in neurodegenerative diseases,"The ordered assembly of Tau protein into abnormal filamentous inclusions is a defining characteristic of many human neurodegenerative diseases. Thirty years ago, we reported that Tau is an integral component of the intraneuronal filaments of Alzheimer's disease. All six brain Tau isoforms make up those filaments. Twenty years ago, we and others showed that mutations in MAPT, the Tau gene, cause familial forms of frontotemporal dementia, thus proving that dysfunction of Tau protein is sufficient to cause neurodegeneration and dementia. More recently, we showed that high-resolution structures of Tau filaments from human brain can be determined by electron cryo-microscopy. These filaments may form the seeds that underlie the prion-like properties of aggregated tau.",29790176,,10.1002/1873-3468.13108,63,FEBS letters,0155157,0.0,0.23970511555671692,0.9264214046822743,0.11036789297658862,0.329107350270485
Microbiome Influence in the Pathogenesis of Prion and Alzheimer's Diseases,"Misfolded and abnormal Î²-sheets forms of wild-type proteins, such as cellular prion protein (PrPC) and amyloid beta (AÎ²), are believed to be the vectors of neurodegenerative diseases, prion and Alzheimer's disease (AD), respectively. Increasing evidence highlights the ""prion-like"" seeding of protein aggregates as a mechanism for pathological spread in AD, tauopathy, as well as in other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's. Mutations in both PrPCand AÎ² precursor protein (APP), have been associated with the pathogenesis of these fatal disorders with clear evidence for their pathogenic significance. In addition, a critical role for the gut microbiota is emerging; indeed, as a consequence of gut-brain axis alterations, the gut microbiota has been involved in the regulation of AÎ² production in AD and, through the microglial inflammation, in the amyloid fibril formation, in prion diseases. Here, we aim to review the role of microbiome (""the other human genome"") alterations in AD and prion disease pathogenesis.",31547531,PMC6801937,10.3390/ijms20194704,28,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,6.208,0.23899394273757935,0.7759197324414716,0.68561872909699,1.540180312130842
Neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease: Current evidence and future directions,"Several attempts have been made to treat Alzheimer's disease (AD) using anti-amyloid strategies with disappointing results. It is clear that the ""amyloid cascade hypothesis"" alone cannot fully explain the neuronal damage in AD, as evidenced both by autopsy and imaging studies. Neuroinflammation plays a significant role in neurodegenerative diseases, whereas the debate is ongoing about its precise role, whether it is protective or harmful. In this review, we focus on the potential mechanism of glial activation and how local and systemic factors influence disease progression. We focus on neuroinflammation in AD, especially in the earliest stages, a vicious cycle of glial priming, release of pro-inflammatory factors, and neuronal damage. We review the evidence from imaging studies, regarding the temporal relationship between amyloid deposition and neuroinflammation, the influence of systemic inflammation on glial activation, both in acute and chronic stimulation and the relevance of inflammation as a diagnostic and therapeutic target.",27179961,,10.1016/j.jalz.2016.02.010,614,Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association,101231978,16.655,0.23775286972522736,0.9899665551839465,0.9632107023411371,3.6716450328719263
Palmitoylation in Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases,"Posttranslational modifications of proteins are important regulatory processes endowing the proteins functional complexity. Over the last decade, numerous studies have shed light on the roles of palmitoylation, one of the most common lipid modifications, in various aspects of neuronal functions. Major players regulating palmitoylation are the enzymes that mediate palmitoylation and depalmitoylation which are palmitoyl acyltransferases (PATs) and protein thioesterases, respectively. In this review, we will provide and discuss current understandings on palmitoyation/depalmitoylation control mediated by PATs and/or protein thioesterases for neuronal functions in general and also for Alzheimer's disease in particular, and other neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington's disease, schizophrenia and intellectual disability.",27293050,,10.1016/j.phrs.2016.06.008,59,Pharmacological research,8907422,10.334,0.23757591843605042,0.9230769230769231,0.903010033444816,2.393960935677015
Emerging therapeutic developments in neurodegenerative diseases: A clinical investigation,"Despite a century of intensive research, there is still a lack of disease-modifying treatments for neurodegenerative diseases that pose a threat to human society. A well-documented knowledge and resource gap has impeded the translation of fundamental research into promising therapies. In addition, the analysis of extensive preclinical data to allow the improved selection of therapeutic technologies and clinical candidates for further development is challenging. To address this need, we describe technologies that have emerged over the past decade that have enabled the development of novel, high-quality, cost-effective treatments for major neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Moreover, we benchmark emerging technologies that have been adopted by top pharmaceutical companies looking to bridge the gap between drug discovery and drug development in neurodegenerative disease.",35728774,,10.1016/j.drudis.2022.06.005,6,Drug discovery today,9604391,8.369,0.23739908635616302,0.4180602006688963,0.862876254180602,1.8998514919474772
"Pineal gland dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease: relationship with the immune-pineal axis, sleep disturbance, and neurogenesis","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a globally common neurodegenerative disease, which is accompanied by alterations to various lifestyle patterns, such as sleep disturbance. The pineal gland is the primary endocrine organ that secretes hormones, such as melatonin, and controls the circadian rhythms. The decrease in pineal gland volume and pineal calcification leads to the reduction of melatonin production. Melatonin has been reported to have multiple roles in the central nervous system (CNS), including improving neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity, suppressing neuroinflammation, enhancing memory function, and protecting against oxidative stress. Recently, reduced pineal gland volume and pineal calcification, accompanied by cognitive decline and sleep disturbances have been observed in AD patients. Here, I review current significant evidence of the contribution of pineal dysfunction in AD to the progress of AD neuropathology.

Current Concepts of Neurodegenerative Mechanisms in Alzheimer's Disease,"Neurodegenerative diseases are hereditary or sporadic conditions that result in the progressive loss of the structure and function of neurons as well as neuronal death. Although a range of diseases lie under this umbrella term, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are the most common neurodegenerative diseases that affect a large population around the globe. Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the abnormal accumulation of extracellular amyloid-Î²plaques and intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles in brain regions and manifests as a type of dementia in aged individuals that results in memory loss, multiple cognitive abnormalities, and intellectual disabilities that interfere with quality of life. Since the discovery of AD, a wealth of new information has emerged that delineates the causes, mechanisms of disease, and potential therapeutic agents, but an effective remedy to cure the diseases has not been identified yet. This could be because of the complexity of the disease process, as it involves various contributing factors that include environmental factors and genetic predispositions. This review summarizes the current understanding on neurodegenerative mechanisms that lead to the emergence of the pathology of AD.",29707568,PMC5863339,10.1155/2018/3740461,63,BioMed research international,101600173,3.246,0.23686911165714264,0.9297658862876255,0.3076923076923077,0.9772746442518108
Nutritional supplementation for Alzheimer's disease?,"Purpose of review:Evidence for the benefit of nutrition in Alzheimer's disease continues to accumulate. Many studies with individual vitamins or supplements show marginal, if any, benefit. However, new findings with combinatorial formulations demonstrate improvement in cognitive performance and behavioral difficulties that accompany Alzheimer's disease. Herein, we review some of the most recent clinical advances and summarize supportive preclinical studies.Recent findings:We present novel positive effects on Alzheimer's disease derived from diet, trace elements, vitamins and supplements. We discuss the inherent difficulty in conducting nutritional studies because of the variance in participants' nutritional history, versus pharmacological interventions in which participants are naive to the intervention. We examine the evidence that epigenetics play a role in Alzheimer's disease and how nutritional intervention can modify the key epigenetic events to maintain or improve cognitive performance.Summary:Overall consideration of the most recent collective evidence suggests that the optimal approach for Alzheimer's disease would seem to combine early, multicomponent nutritional approaches (a Mediterranean-style diet, multivitamins and key combinatorial supplements), along with lifestyle modifications such as social activity and mental and physical exercise, with ultimate addition of pharmacological agents when warranted.",25602242,,10.1097/YCO.0000000000000138,7,Current opinion in psychiatry,8809880,4.787,0.23651622235774994,0.44816053511705684,0.5050167224080268,1.1889418404380614
Trimethylamine N-Oxide Reduces Neurite Density and Plaque Intensity in a Murine Model of Alzheimer's Disease,"Background:Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common aging-associated neurodegenerative disease; nevertheless, the etiology and progression of the disease is still incompletely understood. We have previously shown that the microbially-derived metabolite trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) is elevated in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of individuals with cognitive impairment due to AD and positively correlates with increases in CSF biomarkers for tangle, plaque, and neuronal pathology.Objective:We assessed the direct impact of TMAO on AD progression.Methods:To do so, transgenic 5XFAD mice were supplemented with TMAO for 12 weeks. Neurite density was assessed through quantitative brain microstructure imaging with neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Label-free, quantitative proteomics was performed on cortex lysates from TMAO-treated and untreated animals. Amyloid-Î² plaques, astrocytes, and microglia were assessed by fluorescent immunohistochemistry and synaptic protein expression was quantified via western blot.Results:Oral TMAO administration resulted in significantly reduced neurite density in several regions of the brain. Amyloid-Î² plaque mean intensity was reduced, while plaque count and size remained unaltered. Proteomics analysis revealed that TMAO treatment impacted the expression of 30 proteins (1.5-fold cut-off) in 5XFAD mice, including proteins known to influence neuronal health and amyloid-Î² precursor protein processing. TMAO treatment did not alter astrocyte and microglial response nor cortical synaptic protein expression.Conclusion:These data suggest that elevated plasma TMAO impacts AD pathology via reductions in neurite density.",36155509,PMC9881463,10.3233/JAD-220413,2,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,4.16,0.23616375029087067,0.25418060200668896,0.4013377926421405,1.0245343705758603
Retinoic Acid and the Gut Microbiota in Alzheimer's Disease: Fighting Back-to-Back?,"Background:There is growing evidence that the gut microbiota may play an important role in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. However, how these commensals influence disease risk and progression still has to be deciphered.Objective:The objective of this review was to summarize current knowledge on the interplay between gut microbiota and retinoic acid. The latter one represents one of the important micronutrients, which have been correlated to Alzheimer's disease and are used in initial therapeutic intervention studies.Methods:A selective overview of the literature is given with the focus on the function of retinoic acid in the healthy and diseased brain, its metabolism in the gut, and the potential influence that the bioactive ligand may have on microbiota, gut physiology and, Alzheimer's disease.Results:Retinoic acid can influence neuronal functionality by means of plasticity but also by neurogenesis and modulating proteostasis. Impaired retinoid-signaling, therefore, might contribute to the development of diseases in the brain. Despite its rather direct impact, retinoic acid also influences other organ systems such as gut by regulating the residing immune cells but also factors such as permeability or commensal microbiota. These in turn can also interfere with retinoid-metabolism and via the gutbrain- axis furthermore with Alzheimer's disease pathology within the brain.Conclusion:Potentially, it is yet too early to conclude from the few reports on changed microbiota in Alzheimer's disease to a dysfunctional role in retinoid-signaling. However, there are several routes how microbial commensals might affect and might be affected by vitamin A and its derivatives.",30907321,,10.2174/1567205016666190321163705,12,Current Alzheimer research,101208441,3.04,0.2359876036643982,0.5752508361204013,0.2842809364548495,0.8646427294227191
Mitochondrial Dysfunction as a Causative Factor in Alzheimer's Disease-Spectrum Disorders: Lymphocytes as a Window to the Brain,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common progressive neurodegenerative disease. Today, AD affects millions of people worldwide and the number of AD cases will further increase with longer life expectancy. The AD brain is marked by severe neurodegeneration, such as the loss of synapses and neurons, atrophy and depletion of neurotransmitter systems, especially in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. Recent findings highlight the important role of mitochondrial dysfunction and increased oxidative stress in the pathophysiology of late-onset alzheimer's disease (LOAD). These alterations are not only observed in the brain of AD patients but also in the periphery. In this review, we discuss the potential role of elevated apoptosis, increased oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction as peripheral markers for the detection of AD in blood cells e.g. lymphocytes. We evaluate recent findings regarding impaired mitochondrial function comprising mitochondrial respiration, reduced complex activities of the respiratory chain and altered Mitochondrial Membrane Potential (MMP) in lymphocytes as well as in neurons. Finally, we will question whether these mitochondrial parameters might be suitable as an early peripheral marker for the detection of LOAD but also for the transitional stage between normal aging and Dementia, ""Mild Cognitive Impairment"" (MCI).",34879802,,10.2174/1567205018666211208141512,5,Current Alzheimer research,101208441,3.04,0.2359876036643982,0.38461538461538464,0.28762541806020064,0.8265156391217158
Spatial Relationships between Molecular Pathology and Neurodegeneration in the Alzheimer's Disease Continuum,"A deeper understanding of the spatial relationships of Î²-amyloid (AÎ²), tau, and neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD) could provide insight into pathogenesis and clinical trial design. We included 81 amyloid-positive patients (age 64.4 Â± 9.5) diagnosed with AD dementia or mild cognitive impairment due to AD and available 11C-PiB (PIB), 18F-Flortaucipir (FTP),18F-FDG-PET, and 3T-MRI, and 31 amyloid-positive, cognitively normal participants (age 77.3 Â± 6.5, no FDG-PET). W-score voxel-wise deviation maps were created and binarized for each imaging-modality (W > 1.64, P < 0.05) adjusting for age, sex, and total intracranial volume (sMRI-only) using amyloid-negative cognitively normal adults. For symptomatic patients, FDG-PET and atrophy W-maps were combined into neurodegeneration maps (ND). AÎ²-pathology showed the greatest proportion of cortical gray matter suprathreshold voxels (spatial extent) for both symptomatic and asymptomatic participants (median 94-55%, respectively), followed by tau (79-11%) and neurodegeneration (41-3%). Amyloid > tau > neurodegeneration was the most frequent hierarchy for both groups (79-77%, respectively), followed by tau > amyloid > neurodegeneration (13-10%) and amyloid > neurodegeneration > tau (6-13%). For symptomatic participants, most abnormal voxels were PIB+/FTP+/ND- (median 35%), and the great majority of ND+ voxels (91%) colocalized with molecular pathology. Amyloid spatially exceeded tau and neurodegeneration, with individual heterogeneities.

Association of TMEM106B with CorticalAPOEGene Expression in Neurodegenerative Conditions,"The e4 allele of the apolipoprotein E gene is the strongest genetic risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer's disease. Nevertheless, howAPOEis regulated is still elusive. In atrans-eQTL analysis, we found a genome-wide significant association between transmembrane protein 106B (TMEM106B) genetic variants and corticalAPOEmRNA levels in human brains. The goal of this study is to determine whether TMEM106B is mis-regulated in Alzheimer's disease or in other neurodegenerative conditions. Available genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic data from human brains were downloaded from the Mayo Clinic Brain Bank and the Religious Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project. An in-house mouse model of the hippocampal deafferentation/reinnervation was achieved via a stereotaxic lesioning surgery to the entorhinal cortex, and mRNA levels were measured using RNAseq technology. In human temporal cortices, the mean TMEM106B expression was significantly higher in Alzheimer's disease compared to cognitively unimpaired individuals. In the mouse model, hippocampalTmem106breached maximum levels during the early phase of reinnervation.

AÎ² propagation and strains: Implications for the phenotypic diversity in Alzheimer's disease,"The progressive nature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is thought to occur, at least in part, by the self-replication and spreading of AÎ² and Tau aggregates through a prion mechanism. Evidence now exists that structural variants of AÎ² prions can propagate their distinct conformations through template-directed folding of naÃ¯ve AÎ² peptides. This notion implicates that the first self-propagating AÎ² assembly to emerge in the brain dictates the conformation, anatomical spread and pace of subsequently formed deposits. It is hypothesized that a prion mechanism defines the molecular basis underlying the diverse clinicopathologic phenotypes observed across the spectrum of AD patients. Thus, distinct AD strains might require further sub-classification based on biochemical and structural characterization of aggregated AÎ². Here, we review the evidence for distinct, self-propagating AÎ² strains, and discuss potential cellular mechanisms that might contribute to their manifestation. From this perspective, we also explore the implications of AÎ² strains for current FDA-approved medical imaging probes and therapies for amyloid. Ultimately, the discovery of new molecular tools to differentiate AÎ² strains and dissect the heterogeneity of AD may lead to the development of more informative diagnostics and strain-specific therapeutics.",28359847,,10.1016/j.nbd.2017.03.014,42,Neurobiology of disease,9500169,7.046,0.2349328249692917,0.8729096989966555,0.7491638795986622,1.7247416347809061
[Focused ultrasound as a non-invasive method with therapeutic potential in patients with Alzheimer's disease],"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common, progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by abnormal deposition of Î²-amyloid (AÎ²) and hyperphosphorylated tau protein. Despite the fact that biomarkers and methods of treating AD are currently being actively studied, there is still no therapy that can significantly reduce the progression of this disease. Therefore, the search for therapeutic disease-modifying strategies is becoming increasingly popular. One such strategy is the use of focused ultrasound (FUS) under MRI guidance using a contrast agent (microbubbles). Under the influence of low-intensity FUS, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is temporarily opened, which is the main obstacle to the effective delivery of therapeutic compounds to the brain, imposing dimensional and biochemical restrictions on the passage of molecules. One of the processes associated with AD is BBB dysfunction, and therefore the study of the effects of FUS in patients with AD is of interest. The literature data show the effectiveness of FUS in animal models of AD. The researchers attribute the effectiveness of the method to the fact that exposure to FUS induces the opening of BBB and reduces the number of amyloid plaques. It has also been demonstrated that FUS can facilitate the delivery of therapeutic drugs to the brain. This allows considering FUS as a new non-invasive method of treatment. Further research is needed to assess the effectiveness of this method in patients with AD.",36279227,,10.17116/jnevro202212210138,0,Zhurnal nevrologii i psikhiatrii imeni S.S.

Physical activity delays hippocampal neurodegeneration and rescues memory deficits in an Alzheimer disease mouse model,"The evidence for a protective role of physical activity on the risk and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been growing in the last years. Here we studied the influence of a prolonged physical and cognitive stimulation on neurodegeneration, with special emphasis on hippocampal neuron loss and associated behavioral impairment in the Tg4-42 mouse model of AD. Tg4-42 mice overexpress AÎ²4-42 without any mutations, and develop an age-dependent hippocampal neuron loss associated with a severe memory decline. We demonstrate that long-term voluntary exercise diminishes CA1 neuron loss and completely rescues spatial memory deficits in different experimental settings. This was accompanied by changes in the gene expression profile of Tg4-42 mice. Deep sequencing analysis revealed an upregulation of chaperones involved in endoplasmatic reticulum protein processing, which might be intimately linked to the beneficial effects seen upon long-term exercise. We believe that we provide evidence for the first time that enhanced physical activity counteracts neuron loss and behavioral deficits in a transgenic AD mouse model. The present findings underscore the relevance of increased physical activity as a potential strategy in the prevention of dementia.",27138799,PMC5070068,10.1038/tp.2016.65,32,Translational psychiatry,101562664,7.989,0.23440666496753693,0.8127090301003345,0.8528428093645485,1.9009858050005888
O-GlcNAcylation: A regulator of tau pathology and neurodegeneration,"O-GlcNAcylation is the posttranslational modification of intracellular proteins by O-linked Î²-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc). The discovery of O-GlcNAc modification of tau and its impact on tau phosphorylation has attracted recent research interest in O-GlcNAc studies in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) field. Modification of proteins by O-GlcNAc occurs extensively in the brain. The expressions and activities of the enzymes catalyzing O-GlcNAc cycling are several-fold higher in the brain than in the peripheral tissues. The O-GlcNAcylation levels of brain proteins including tau are decreased in AD brain, probably due to decreased brain glucose metabolism. The reduction of brain O-GlcNAcylation appears to mediate the molecular mechanism by which decreased brain glucose metabolism contributes to neurodegeneration. Studies on mouse models of tauopathies suggest a neuroprotective role of pharmacological elevation of brain O-GlcNAc, which could potentially be a promising approach for treating AD and other neurodegenerative diseases.",27126545,,10.1016/j.jalz.2016.02.011,36,Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association,101231978,16.655,0.23388130962848663,0.8361204013377926,0.9665551839464883,3.638552866044651
[Genetic mechanism underlying the resilience to Alzheimer's disease and its prospect for clinical application],"As the most common neurodegenerative disease, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by progressive cognitive decline and is a major threat to the health of elderly worldwide. Aside from its pathogenesis, delineation of the protective mechanism of AD is also critical for the etiological treatment. AD resilience refers to a protective mechanism which can maintain the cognitive intactness of patients despite of genetic risk factors and/or related pathology. Studies on the genetic mechanism of AD resilience are of great importance for revealing novel mechanisms and therapeutic targets, as well as optimizing polygenic risk score which can facilitate early identification and intervention for individuals at risk.",36453972,,10.3760/cma.j.cn511374-20210828-00699,0,Zhonghua yi xue yi chuan xue za zhi = Zhonghua yixue yichuanxue zazhi = Chinese,9425197,0.0,0.23318208754062653,0.07357859531772576,0.11705685618729098,0.15462497158792105
Modifying the diet and gut microbiota to prevent and manage neurodegenerative diseases,"The global prevalence of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease is steadily increasing due to the aging population. The lack of effective drugs against these neurodegenerative disorders makes it imperative to identify new strategies for their prevention and treatment. Recent studies have revealed that harnessing the power of the gut microbiota through modification of diet may be a valuable approach for reducing the risk, modulating the symptoms, and ameliorating the pathophysiological aspects of neurodegenerative diseases. Consuming specific dietary components can alter the prevalence of bacterial communities within the gut to a healthy enterotype, which can influence the production of beneficial metabolites by microbiota. This article focuses on several dietary components, which have been demonstrated to affect the gut microbiota-brain axis and therefore could lead to attenuation of specific pathological processes in neurodegenerative diseases. Published evidence indicates that fermented foods, including kefir, and foods that are high in bioactive polyphenols and complex carbohydrates, such as grapes, pomegranates, and seaweed, may be effective at reducing neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, neurotransmitter dysfunction, and neuronal death associated with Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Even though experimental evidence supporting the protective properties of the above dietary components in these diseases is emerging, it is evident that further human clinical studies are required to conclusively establish the benefits of any suggested dietary interventions. The translational potential of such research is illustrated by the clinical success of the recently developed Alzheimer's drug, GV-971, which is a seaweed derivative that works by modulating the gut microbiota-brain axis.",35304983,PMC9514114,10.1515/revneuro-2021-0146,7,Reviews in the neurosciences,8711016,4.703,0.2330075204372406,0.451505016722408,0.49498327759197325,1.170705515606826
"The Role of Reactive Oxygen Species in the Pathogenesis of Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, and Huntington's Disease: A Mini Review","Neurodegenerative diseases affect not only the life quality of aging populations, but also their life spans. All forms of neurodegenerative diseases have a massive impact on the elderly. The major threat of these brain diseases includes progressive loss of memory, Alzheimer's disease (AD), impairments in the movement, Parkinson's disease (PD), and the inability to walk, talk, and think, Huntington's disease (HD). Oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction are highlighted as a central feature of brain degenerative diseases. Oxidative stress, a condition that occurs due to imbalance in oxidant and antioxidant status, has been known to play a vital role in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases including AD, PD, and HD. A large number of studies have utilized oxidative stress biomarkers to investigate the severity of these neurodegenerative diseases and medications are available, but these only treat the symptoms. In traditional medicine, a large number of medicinal plants have been used to treat the symptoms of these neurodegenerative diseases. Extensive studies scientifically validated the beneficial effect of natural products against neurodegenerative diseases using suitable animal models. This short review focuses the role of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of AD, PD, and HD and the protective efficacy of natural products against these diseases.",28116038,PMC5223034,10.1155/2016/8590578,182,Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity,101479826,7.31,0.2324843406677246,0.9765886287625418,0.7558528428093646,1.796808330153143
[Testosterone and Alzheimer's disease],"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that causes dementia in half of the cases. Asthma is usually found in people over 65 years of age. The etiopathogenesis of the disease is multifactorial and includes genetic factors, nutritional disorders, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and aging. Sex hormones have an important influence on the development of AD, as evidenced by a higher incidence in women than in men. Considering the significant influence of T on the maintenance of normal brain function, the present study is aimed at evaluating the impact of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), as well as testosterone therapy, on the risk of AD development and progression. Although there is some clinical inconsistency between studies, androgens have a significant effect on brain function and are beneficial for AD patients. Low levels of circulating androgens should be considered as a significant risk factor for the development of AD and memory loss. With a reduced level of T in the plasma of men, its administration improves cognitive performance and memory, treatment should be started at an early stage of the disease. In men and women with AD, androgens improve mental state and slow the progression of the disease, providing a protective effect. In the future, it is necessary to conduct studies on a large population, taking into account personality factors and a more specific approach to assessing cognitive functions and the causal relationship of T administration in AD.",36337024,PMC9762454,10.14341/probl13136,1,Problemy endokrinologii,0140673,0.0,0.23213601112365723,0.16387959866220736,0.12040133779264214,0.1720575264066358
Omics Data and Their Integrative Analysis to Support Stratified Medicine in Neurodegenerative Diseases,"Molecular and clinical heterogeneity is increasingly recognized as a common characteristic of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This heterogeneity makes difficult the development of early diagnosis and effective treatment approaches, as well as the design and testing of new drugs. As such, the stratification of patients into meaningful disease subgroups, with clinical and biological relevance, may improve disease management and the development of effective treatments. To this end, omics technologies-such as genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics-are contributing to offer a more comprehensive view of molecular pathways underlying the development of NDs, helping to differentiate subtypes of patients based on their specific molecular signatures. In this article, we discuss how omics technologies and their integration have provided new insights into the molecular heterogeneity underlying the most prevalent NDs, aiding to define early diagnosis and progression markers as well as therapeutic targets that can translate into stratified treatment approaches, bringing us closer to the goal of personalized medicine in neurology.",34062930,PMC8125201,10.3390/ijms22094820,10,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,6.208,0.23074638843536377,0.5284280936454849,0.6889632107023411,1.4857334517903154
Considerations for integrative multi-omic approaches to explore Alzheimer's disease mechanisms,"The past decade has seen the maturation of multiple different forms of high-dimensional molecular profiling to the point that these methods could be deployed in initially hundreds and more recently thousands of human samples. In the field of Alzheimer's disease (AD), these profiles have been applied to the target organ: the aging brain. In a growing number of cases, the same samples were profiled with multiple different approaches, yielding genetic, transcriptomic, epigenomic and proteomic data. Here, we review lessons learned so far as we move beyond quantitative trait locus (QTL) analyses which map the effect of genetic variation on molecular features to integrate multiple levels of ""omic"" data in an effort to identify the molecular drivers of AD. One thing is clear: no single layer of molecular or ""omic"" data is sufficient to capture the variance of AD or aging-related cognitive decline. Nonetheless, reproducible findings are emerging from current efforts, and there is evidence of convergence using different approaches. Thus, we are on the cusp of an acceleration of truly integrative studies as the availability of large numbers of well-characterized brain samples profiled in three or more dimensions enables the testing, comparison and refinement of analytic methods with which to dissect the molecular architecture of the aging brain.",32654306,PMC8018035,10.1111/bpa.12878,8,"Brain pathology (Zurich, Switzerland)",9216781,7.611,0.23057307302951813,0.4816053511705686,0.802675585284281,1.7568649140518247
Modulation of Mitochondrial Function as a Therapeutic Strategy for Neurodegenerative Diseases,"Despite recent FDA approval of anti-amyloid antibodies for Alzheimer's Disease, strategies that target early molecular mechanisms and could delay or change the disease trajectory are still needed. Mitochondria emerge as a signaling organelle that could modulate multiple molecular mechanisms to enhance cellular bioenergetics and promote neuronal survival. Approaches to enhance mitochondrial function could promote healthy aging delaying the onset of age-related diseases such as Alzheimer's Disease. Some of these strategies have been recently tested in clinical trials. Emerging evidence demonstrates that in response to mild energetic stress, mitochondria could orchestrate a robust adaptive stress response activating multiple neuroprotective mechanism. The objective of this review is to highlight recent development of mitochondria-targeting therapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases, mitochondria complex I inhibitors in particular.",37874088,,10.14283/jpad.2023.108,1,The journal of prevention of Alzheimer's disease,101638820,5.02,0.23022674024105072,0.16722408026755853,0.5351170568561873,1.1755808601981421
The Correlation between Diabetes Mellitus and Neurodegenerative Diseases,"Today there is no longer any doubt that diabetes mellitus is associated with cognitive impairment and neurodegenerative diseases. The two most common forms of diabetes mellitus are type 1 and type 2. Type 1 diabetes mellitus is characterized by an absolute insulin deficiency that is associated with a large number of metabolic changes. This type of diabetes requires insulin therapy. Without insulin, this disease is fatal. The far more common form of diabetes mellitus nowadays is type 2 diabetes mellitus. It is characterized by insulin resistance. For a number of years drugs have been available that can be used to treat this form of diabetes in a multimodal manner. These therapy options can not only improve metabolic control, but also prevent cardiovascular events. Different cognitive alterations associated with diabetes mellitus can be distinguished. On the one hand, the change in glucose homeostasis itself leads to cognitive alterations, i.e. blood sugar levels that are too high or acutely too low are regularly associated with significant impairments in mental performance, including loss of consciousness. But not only the momentary blood sugar levels, but also long-term changes in glucose metabolism might lead to neurodegeneration and even dementia in a way that has not yet been fully understood. Insulin or insulin-like molecules have important effects in the central nervous system. In the last decades, it has been shown that insulin receptors themselves are expressed in many regions of the brain and e.g. regulate food intake and memory formation in humans and in animal models. In the animal model, disturbances in insulin signal transduction influence the development of pathologies typical of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In humans, central insulin resistance is at least part of the formal pathogenesis of AD. Vascular changes (macroangiopathy) in patients with diabetes mellitus often lead to cerebral insults, microangiopathies and vascular dementia.",36626931,,10.1055/a-2009-9755,2,Klinische Monatsblatter fur Augenheilkunde,0014133,0.0,0.22953522205352783,0.25752508361204013,0.12374581939799331,0.18922614995452475
Genetic Dissection of Alzheimer's Disease UsingDrosophilaModels,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), a main cause of dementia, is the most common neurodegenerative disease that is related to abnormal accumulation of the amyloid Î² (AÎ²) protein. Despite decades of intensive research, the mechanisms underlying AD remain elusive, and the only available treatment remains symptomatic. Molecular understanding of the pathogenesis and progression of AD is necessary to develop disease-modifying treatment.Drosophila, as the most advanced genetic model, has been used to explore the molecular mechanisms of AD in the last few decades. Here, we introduceDrosophilaAD models based on human AÎ² and summarize the results of their genetic dissection. We also discuss the utility of functional genomics using theDrosophilasystem in the search for AD-associated molecular mechanisms in the post-genomic era.",32019113,PMC7037931,10.3390/ijms21030884,13,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,6.208,0.22729776799678802,0.6053511705685619,0.6923076923076923,1.4990488949117853
Neuronal activity induces symmetry breaking in neurodegenerative disease spreading,"Dynamical systems on networks typically involve several dynamical processes evolving at different timescales. For instance, in Alzheimer's disease, the spread of toxic protein throughout the brain not only disrupts neuronal activity but is also influenced by neuronal activity itself, establishing a feedback loop between the fast neuronal activity and the slow protein spreading. Motivated by the case of Alzheimer's disease, we study the multiple-timescale dynamics of a heterodimer spreading process on an adaptive network of Kuramoto oscillators. Using a minimal two-node model, we establish that heterogeneous oscillatory activity facilitates toxic outbreaks and induces symmetry breaking in the spreading patterns. We then extend the model formulation to larger networks and perform numerical simulations of the slow-fast dynamics on common network motifs and on the brain connectome. The simulations corroborate the findings from the minimal model, underscoring the significance of multiple-timescale dynamics in the modeling of neurodegenerative diseases.",38740613,,10.1007/s00285-024-02103-x,0,Journal of mathematical biology,7502105,2.164,0.22661244869232178,0.07692307692307693,0.23076923076923078,0.5841520846000086
Emerging Roles of Inhibitor of Differentiation-1 in Alzheimer's Disease: Cell Cycle Reentry and Beyond,"Inhibitor of DNA-binding/differentiation (Id) proteins, a family of helix-loop-helix (HLH) proteins that includes four members of Id1 to Id4 in mammalian cells, are critical for regulating cell growth, differentiation, senescence, cell cycle progression, and increasing angiogenesis and vasculogenesis, as well as accelerating the ability of cell migration. Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common neurodegenerative disease in the adult population, manifests the signs of cognitive decline, behavioral changes, and functional impairment. The underlying mechanisms for AD are not well-clarified yet, but the aggregation of amyloid-beta peptides (AÎ²s), the major components in the senile plaques observed in AD brains, contributes significantly to the disease progression. Emerging evidence reveals that aberrant cell cycle reentry may play a central role in AÎ²-induced neuronal demise. Recently, we have shown that several signaling mediators, including Id1, hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), cyclin-dependent kinases-5 (CDK5), and sonic hedgehog (Shh), may contribute to AÎ²-induced cell cycle reentry in postmitotic neurons; furthermore, Id1 and CDK5/p25 mutually antagonize the expression/activity of each other. Therefore, Id proteins may potentially have clinical applications in AD. In this review article, we introduce the underlying mechanisms for cell cycle dysregulation in AD and present some examples, including our own studies, to show different aspects of Id1 in terms of cell cycle reentry and other signaling that may be crucial to alter the neuronal fates in this devastating neurodegenerative disease. A thorough understanding of the underlying mechanisms may provide a rationale to make an earlier intervention before the occurrence of cell cycle reentry and subsequent apoptosis in the fully differentiated neurons during the progression of AD or other neurodegenerative diseases.",32708313,PMC7409121,10.3390/cells9071746,10,Cells,101600052,7.666,0.22439517080783844,0.5317725752508361,0.8193979933110368,1.7741916175348702
Alzheimer's disease and the autophagic-lysosomal system,"Age-related neurodegenerative diseases are of critical concern to the general population and research/medical community due to their health impact and socioeconomic consequences. A feature of most, if not all, neurodegenerative disorders is the presence of proteinopathies, in which misfolded or conformationally altered proteins drive disease progression and are often used as a primary neuropathological marker of disease. In particular, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by abnormal accumulation of protein aggregates, primarily extracellular plaques composed of the AÎ² peptide and intracellular tangles comprised of the tau protein, both of which may indicate a primary defect in protein clearance. Protein degradation is a key cellular mechanism for protein homeostasis and is essential for cell survival but is disrupted in neurodegenerative diseases. Dysregulation in proteolytic pathways - mainly the autophagic-lysosomal system (A-LS) and the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) - has been increasingly associated with proteinopathies in neurodegenerative diseases. Here we review the role of dysfunctional autophagy underlying AD-related proteinopathy and discuss how to model this aspect of disease, as well as summarize recent advances in translational strategies for targeted A-LS dysfunction in AD.",29758300,,10.1016/j.neulet.2018.05.017,28,Neuroscience letters,7600130,3.197,0.22371606528759003,0.7792642140468228,0.30434782608695654,0.9294824819819187
The existence of AÎ² strains and their potential for driving phenotypic heterogeneity in Alzheimer's disease,"Reminiscent of the human prion diseases, there is considerable clinical and pathological variability in Alzheimer's disease, the most common human neurodegenerative condition. As in prion disorders, protein misfolding and aggregation is a hallmark feature of Alzheimer's disease, where the initiating event is thought to be the self-assembly of AÎ² peptide into aggregates that deposit in the central nervous system. Emerging evidence suggests that AÎ², similar to the prion protein, can polymerize into a conformationally diverse spectrum of aggregate strains both in vitro and within the brain. Moreover, certain types of AÎ² aggregates exhibit key hallmarks of prion strains including divergent biochemical attributes and the ability to induce distinct pathological phenotypes when intracerebrally injected into mouse models. In this review, we discuss the evidence demonstrating that AÎ² can assemble into distinct strains of aggregates and how such strains may be primary drivers of the phenotypic heterogeneity in Alzheimer's disease.",32743745,,10.1007/s00401-020-02201-2,25,Acta neuropathologica,0412041,0.0,0.2206781804561615,0.7491638795986622,0.12709030100334448,0.2822396841934293
Engineering extracellular vesicles for Alzheimer's disease: An emerging cell-free approach for earlier diagnosis and treatment,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disorder affecting over five million people globally and has no established cure. Current AD-related treatments only alleviate cognitive and behavioral symptoms and do not address disease onset or progression, underlining the unmet need to create an effective, innovative AD therapeutic. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as a new class of nanotherapeutics. These secreted, lipid-bound cellular signaling carriers show promise for potential clinical applications for neurodegenerative diseases like AD. Additionally, analyzing contents and characteristics of patient-derived EVs may address the unmet need for earlier AD diagnostic techniques, informing physicians of altered genetic expression or cellular communications specific to healthy and diseased physiological states. There are numerous recent advances in regenerative medicine using EVs and include bioengineering perspectives to modify EVs, target glial cells in neurodegenerative diseases like AD, and potentially use EVs to diagnose and treat AD earlier.

"Cinnamon, a promising prospect towards Alzheimer's disease","Over the last decades, an exponential increase of efforts concerning the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been practiced. Phytochemicals preparations have a millenary background to combat various pathological conditions. Various cinnamon species and their biologically active ingredients have renewed the interest towards the treatment of patients with mild-to-moderate AD through the inhibition of tau protein aggregation and prevention of the formation and accumulation of amyloid-Î² peptides into the neurotoxic oligomeric inclusions, both of which are considered to be the AD trademarks. In this review, we presented comprehensive data on the interactions of a number of cinnamon polyphenols (PPs) with oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory signaling pathways in the brain. In addition, we discussed the potential association between AD and diabetes mellitus (DM), vis-Ã -vis the effluence of cinnamon PPs. Further, an upcoming prospect of AD epigenetic pathophysiological conditions and cinnamon has been sighted. Data was retrieved from the scientific databases such as PubMed database of the National Library of Medicine, Scopus and Google Scholar without any time limitation. The extract of cinnamon efficiently inhibits tau accumulations, AÎ² aggregation and toxicity in vivo and in vitro models. Indeed, cinnamon possesses neuroprotective effects interfering multiple oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory pathways. Besides, cinnamon modulates endothelial functions and attenuates the vascular cell adhesion molecules. Cinnamon PPs may induce AD epigenetic modifications. Cinnamon and in particular, cinnamaldehyde seem to be effective and safe approaches for treatment and prevention of AD onset and/or progression. However, further molecular and translational research studies as well as prolonged clinical trials are required to establish the therapeutic safety and efficacy in different cinnamon spp.",29258915,,10.1016/j.phrs.2017.12.011,30,Pharmacological research,8907422,10.334,0.22017472982406616,0.7926421404682275,0.9063545150501672,2.3574332659880852

In the current review we address the role of estrogen deficiency in the processes involved in the development of AD, including amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing to form senile plaques, Tau phosphorylation forming neurofibrillary tangles, Wnt signaling and AD neuropathology, the role of glucose brain metabolism, Wnt signaling and glucose transport in the brain, and our research contribution to these topics.",36339406,PMC9627150,10.3389/fendo.2022.1021796,3,Frontiers in endocrinology,101555782,6.055,0.21917034685611725,0.3177257525083612,0.6053511705685619,1.4060473586153424
Mitophagy in Alzheimer's Disease and Other Age-Related Neurodegenerative Diseases,"Mitochondrial dysfunction is a central aspect of aging and neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Huntington's disease. Mitochondria are the main cellular energy powerhouses, supplying most of ATP by oxidative phosphorylation, which is required to fuel essential neuronal functions. Efficient removal of aged and dysfunctional mitochondria through mitophagy, a cargo-selective autophagy, is crucial for mitochondrial maintenance and neuronal health. Mechanistic studies into mitophagy have highlighted an integrated and elaborate cellular network that can regulate mitochondrial turnover. In this review, we provide an updated overview of the recent discoveries and advancements on the mitophagy pathways and discuss the molecular mechanisms underlying mitophagy defects in Alzheimer's disease and other age-related neurodegenerative diseases, as well as the therapeutic potential of mitophagy-enhancing strategies to combat these disorders.",31936292,PMC7017092,10.3390/cells9010150,89,Cells,101600052,7.666,0.21800270676612854,0.9531772575250836,0.822742474916388,1.854637075564694
Role of neuroinflammation in neurodegeneration: new insights,"Previously, the contribution of peripheral infection to cognitive decline was largely overlooked however, the past 15 years have established a key role for infectious pathogens in the progression of age-related neurodegeneration. It is now accepted that the immune privilege of the brain is not absolute, and that cells of the central nervous system are sensitive to both the inflammatory events occurring in the periphery and to the infiltration of peripheral immune cells. This is particularly relevant for the progression of Alzheimer's disease, in which it has been demonstrated that patients are more vulnerable to infection-related cognitive changes. This can occur from typical infectious challenges such as respiratory tract infections, although a number of specific viral, bacterial, and fungal pathogens have also been associated with the development of the disease. To date, it is not clear whether these microorganisms are directly related to Alzheimer's disease progression or if they are opportune pathogens that easily colonize those with dementia and exacerbate the ongoing inflammation observed in these individuals. This review will discuss the impact of each of these challenges, and examine the changes known to occur with age in the peripheral immune system, which may contribute to the age-related vulnerability to infection-induced cognitive decline.",28259169,PMC5336609,10.1186/s13195-017-0241-2,111,Alzheimer's research & therapy,101511643,8.823,0.21733753383159637,0.9698996655518395,0.8762541806020067,2.0889824534093258
The Role of Cerebellum in Alzheimer's Disease: A Forgotten Research Corner,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex, heterogeneous, and progressive neurodegenerative dementia. Although the majority of AD research has primarily focused on disease-associated alterations of the cortex and hippocampus in the cerebrum, emerging evidence has highlighted the cerebellum's involvement in sleep, cognition, and AD. In this commentary, we discuss a recently published article in Alzheimer's and Dementia, which examines changes in cerebellar electrophysiology, sleep-wake cycles, and neuropathology in APPswe/PS1ÎE9 mice. We also explore the potential role of the cerebellum in AD, offering a fresh perspective on the study of cerebellar involvement in the disease.",37458038,,10.3233/JAD-230381,1,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,4.16,0.21683959662914276,0.1705685618729097,0.40468227424749165,0.9962174703520675
A Unifying Hypothesis for Alzheimer's Disease: From Plaques to Neurodegeneration,"Evidence suggests that amyloid Î² is highly toxic to synapses in a phospho-Tau-dependent manner. Here, I present a hypothesis that links previous evidence from the first rise of amyloid Î² through to Tau tangles and neurodegeneration. In the immediate vicinity of plaques, concentrated soluble amyloid Î² occurs in equilibrium with deposited forms. Initially, plaques cover only a small percentage of brain volume. Microglia, by efficiently removing damaged synapses, may prevent spread of damage along the axon, restricting damage to the immediate vicinity of plaques. However, as plaque load increases, as seen in Alzheimer's disease, an individual axon may suffer multiple points of damage, leading to dissociation of Tau, formation of a tangle, and loss of the axon. As more axons suffer this fate, the network eventually degenerates. According to this hypothesis, the degree of plaque load that an individual can tolerate would depend on the efficiency of their microglia in removing amyloid-Î²-damaged synapses and the distribution of plaques, relative to axon trajectories, would determine the eventual cognitive symptoms.",31006494,,10.1016/j.tins.2019.03.003,56,Trends in neurosciences,7808616,16.978,0.2163424789905548,0.9163879598662207,0.9765886287625418,3.708683079367577
Translational Research in Alzheimer's and Prion Diseases,"Translational neuroscience integrates the knowledge derived by basic neuroscience with the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic tools that may be applied to clinical practice in neurological diseases. This information can be used to improve clinical trial designs and outcomes that will accelerate drug development, and to discover novel biomarkers which can be efficiently employed to early recognize neurological disorders and provide information regarding the effects of drugs on the underlying disease biology. Alzheimer's disease (AD) and prion disease are two classes of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by incomplete knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying their occurrence and the lack of valid biomarkers and effective treatments. For these reasons, the design of therapies that prevent or delay the onset, slow the progression, or improve the symptoms associated to these disorders is urgently needed. During the last few decades, translational research provided a framework for advancing development of new diagnostic devices and promising disease-modifying therapies for patients with prion encephalopathies and AD. In this review, we provide present evidence of how supportive can be the translational approach to the study of dementias and show some results of our preclinical studies which have been translated to the clinical application following the 'bed-to-bench-and-back' research model.",29172000,PMC5869996,10.3233/JAD-170770,5,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,4.16,0.21617697179317474,0.391304347826087,0.4080267558528428,1.0399670526411222
Common Factors in Neurodegeneration: A Meta-Study Revealing Shared Patterns on a Multi-Omics Scale,"Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are heterogeneous, progressive diseases with frequently overlapping symptoms characterized by a loss of neurons. Studies have suggested relations between neurodegenerative diseases for many years (e.g., regarding the aggregation of toxic proteins or triggering endogenous cell death pathways). We gathered publicly available genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data from 177 studies and more than one million patients to detect shared genetic patterns between the neurodegenerative diseases on three analyzed omics-layers. The results show a remarkably high number of shared differentially expressed genes between the transcriptomic and proteomic levels for all conditions, while showing a significant relation between genomic and proteomic data between AD and PD and AD and ALS. We identified a set of 139 genes being differentially expressed in several transcriptomic experiments of all four diseases. These 139 genes showed overrepresented gene ontology (GO) Terms involved in the development of neurodegeneration, such as response to heat and hypoxia, positive regulation of cytokines and angiogenesis, and RNA catabolic process. Furthermore, the four analyzed neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) were clustered by their mean direction of regulation throughout all transcriptomic studies for this set of 139 genes, with the closest relation regarding this common gene set seen between AD and HD. GO-Term and pathway analysis of the proteomic overlap led to biological processes (BPs), related to protein folding and humoral immune response. Taken together, we could confirm the existence of many relations between Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis on transcriptomic and proteomic levels by analyzing the pathways and GO-Terms arising in these intersections. The significance of the connection and the striking relation of the results to processes leading to neurodegeneration between the transcriptomic and proteomic data for all four analyzed neurodegenerative diseases showed that exploring many studies simultaneously, including multiple omics-layers of different neurodegenerative diseases simultaneously, holds new relevant insights that do not emerge from analyzing these data separately. Furthermore, the results shed light on processes like the humoral immune response that have previously been described only for certain diseases. Our data therefore suggest human patients with neurodegenerative diseases should be addressed as complex biological systems by integrating multiple underlying data sources.",33302607,PMC7764447,10.3390/cells9122642,21,Cells,101600052,7.666,0.21617697179317474,0.725752508361204,0.8260869565217391,1.8080566847481456
[Research Progress of CD4+T Cells-mediated Regulation of Neuroinflammation Involved in Neurodegenerative Diseases],"Neurodegenerative diseases are associated with neuroinflammation,oxidative stress,and aging,which can lead to cognitive and motor dysfunctions.Recent studies suggest that the development of neurodegenerative diseases is related to adaptive immunity,in which CD4+T cells are involved as adaptive immune cells.Through different pathways,CD4+T cells differentiate into effector and regulatory subsets,which may have different effects on the progression of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease,Parkinson's disease,multiple sclerosis,and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.Here,we review the role and research progress of CD4+T cells in neurodegenerative diseases.",34494536,,10.3881/j.issn.1000-503X.13146,1,Zhongguo yi xue ke xue yuan xue bao.

[Alzheimer's disease],"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a serious medical and social problem of our time, while remaining the most common cause of dementia in the elderly. The leading symptom in the clinical picture of the disease is a progressive loss of memory with further development of behavioral disorders. In the early stages of AD, patients are mostly managed by neurologists and differential diagnosis is carried out with a variety of neurodegenerative diseases. The authors present clinical criteria of AD diagnosis and consider diagnostic possibilities in the predementia stage using biological markers. With this purpose, modern concepts of the etiology and pathogenesis of AD and genetic aspects of pathology are considered. Contribution of many environmental factors to the initiation and progression of the disease process is evaluated. Mechanisms of cerebral amyloidosis and its characteristic neurological manifestations are considered.",29460910,,10.17116/jnevro20181181177-81,1,Zhurnal nevrologii i psikhiatrii imeni S.S.

Neuroinflammation and microglial activation in Alzheimer disease: where do we go from here?,"Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common form of neurodegenerative disease, estimated to contribute 60-70% of all cases of dementia worldwide. According to the prevailing amyloid cascade hypothesis, amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) deposition in the brain is the initiating event in AD, although evidence is accumulating that this hypothesis is insufficient to explain many aspects of AD pathogenesis. The discovery of increased levels of inflammatory markers in patients with AD and the identification of AD risk genes associated with innate immune functions suggest that neuroinflammation has a prominent role in the pathogenesis of AD. In this Review, we discuss the interrelationships between neuroinflammation and amyloid and tau pathologies as well as the effect of neuroinflammation on the disease trajectory in AD. We specifically focus on microglia as major players in neuroinflammation and discuss the spatial and temporal variations in microglial phenotypes that are observed under different conditions. We also consider how these cells could be modulated as a therapeutic strategy for AD.",33318676,,10.1038/s41582-020-00435-y,809,Nature reviews.

Roles of Siglecs in neurodegenerative diseases,"Microglia are resident myeloid cells in the central nervous system (CNS) with a unique developmental origin, playing essential roles in developing and maintaining the CNS environment. Recent studies have revealed the involvement of microglia in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, through the modulation of neuroinflammation. Several members of the Siglec family of sialic acid recognition proteins are expressed on microglia. Since the discovery of the genetic association between a polymorphism in the CD33 gene and late-onset Alzheimer's disease, significant efforts have been made to elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying the association between the polymorphism and Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, recent studies have revealed additional potential associations between Siglecs and Alzheimer's disease, implying that the reduced signal from inhibitory Siglec may have an overall protective effect in lowering the disease risk. Evidences suggesting the involvement of Siglecs in other neurodegenerative diseases are also emerging. These findings could help us predict the roles of Siglecs in other neurodegenerative diseases. However, little is known about the functionally relevant Siglec ligands in the brain, which represents a new frontier. Understanding how microglial Siglecs and their ligands in CNS contribute to the regulation of CNS homeostasis and pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases may provide us with a new avenue for disease prevention and intervention.",36089405,,10.1016/j.mam.2022.101141,4,Molecular aspects of medicine,7603128,16.337,0.2148561030626297,0.3612040133779264,0.959866220735786,3.4685544645131627
Expression of Alzheimer's disease risk genes in ischemic brain degeneration,"We review the Alzheimer-related expression of genes following brain ischemia as risk factors for late-onset of sporadic Alzheimer's disease and their role in Alzheimer's disease ischemia-reperfusion pathogenesis. More recent advances in understanding ischemic etiology of Alzheimer's disease have revealed dysregulation of Alzheimer-associated genes including amyloid protein precursor, Î²-secretase, presenilin 1 and 2, autophagy, mitophagy and apoptosis. We review the relationship between these genes dysregulated by brain ischemia and the cellular and neuropathological characteristics of Alzheimer's disease. Here we summarize the latest studies supporting the theory that Alzheimer-related genes play an important role in ischemic brain injury and that ischemia is a needful and leading supplier to the onset and progression of sporadic Alzheimer's disease. Although the exact molecular mechanisms of ischemic dependent neurodegenerative disease and neuronal susceptibility finally are unknown, a downregulated expression of neuronal defense genes like alfa-secretase in the ischemic brain makes the neurons less able to resist injury. The recent challenge is to find ways to raise the adaptive reserve of the brain to overcome such ischemic-associated deficits and support and/or promote neuronal survival. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the association of these genes with risk for Alzheimer's disease will provide the most meaningful targets for therapeutic development to date.",27710863,,10.1016/j.pharep.2016.09.006,9,Pharmacological reports : PR,101234999,3.919,0.21386933326721191,0.5117056856187291,0.3411371237458194,1.014462737084073
The emerging roles of protein homeostasis-governing pathways in Alzheimer's disease,"Pathways governing protein homeostasis are involved in maintaining the structural, quantitative, and functional stability of intracellular proteins and involve the ubiquitin-proteasome system, autophagy, endoplasmic reticulum, and mTOR pathway. Due to the broad physiological implications of protein homeostasis pathways, dysregulation of proteostasis is often involved in the development of multiple pathological conditions, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Similar to other neurodegenerative diseases that feature pathogenic accumulation of misfolded proteins, Alzheimer's disease is characterized by two pathological hallmarks, amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) plaques and tau aggregates. Knockout or transgenic overexpression of various proteostatic components in mice results in AD-like phenotypes. While both AÎ² plaques and tau aggregates could in turn enhance the dysfunction of these proteostatic pathways, eventually leading to apoptotic or necrotic neuronal death and pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, targeting the components of proteostasis pathways may be a promising therapeutic strategy against Alzheimer's disease.",29992725,PMC6156496,10.1111/acel.12801,51,Aging cell,101130839,11.005,0.2133771777153015,0.8996655518394648,0.9096989966555183,2.508959416997074
"Role of Tau in Various Tauopathies, Treatment Approaches, and Emerging Role of Nanotechnology in Neurodegenerative Disorders","A few protein kinases and phosphatases regulate tau protein phosphorylation and an imbalance in their enzyme activity results in tau hyper-phosphorylation. Aberrant tau phosphorylation causes tau to dissociate from the microtubules and clump together in the cytosol to form neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), which lead to the progression of neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other tauopathies. Hence, targeting hyperphosphorylated tau protein is a restorative approach for treating neurodegenerative tauopathies. The cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk5) and the glycogen synthase kinase (GSK3Î²) have both been implicated in aberrant tau hyperphosphorylation. The limited transport of drugs through the blood-brain barrier (BBB) for reaching the central nervous system (CNS) thus represents a significant problem in the development of drugs. Drug delivery systems based on nanocarriers help solve this problem. In this review, we discuss the tau protein, regulation of tau phosphorylation and abnormal hyperphosphorylation, drugs in use or under clinical trials, and treatment strategies for tauopathies based on the critical role of tau hyperphosphorylation in the pathogenesis of the disease.

Mitophagy Regulates Neurodegenerative Diseases,"Mitochondria play an essential role in supplying energy for the health and survival of neurons. Mitophagy is a metabolic process that removes dysfunctional or redundant mitochondria. This process preserves mitochondrial health. However, defective mitophagy triggers the accumulation of damaged mitochondria, causing major neurodegenerative disorders. This review introduces molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways behind mitophagy regulation. Furthermore, we focus on the recent advances in understanding the potential role of mitophagy in the pathogenesis of major neurodegenerative diseases (Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, Huntington's, etc.) and aging. The findings will help identify the potential interventions of mitophagy regulation and treatment strategies of neurodegenerative diseases.",34440645,PMC8392649,10.3390/cells10081876,14,Cells,101600052,7.666,0.2112540602684021,0.6220735785953178,0.8294314381270903,1.784367151880105
"Melanin: a unifying theory of disease as exemplified by Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and Lewy body dementia","Melanin, a ubiquitous dark pigment, plays important roles in the immune system, including scavenging reactive oxygen species formed in response to ultraviolet radiation absorption, absorbing metals, thermal regulation, drug uptake, innate immune system functions, redox, and energy transduction. Many tissue types, including brain, heart, arteries, ovaries, and others, contain melanin. Almost all cells contain precursors to melanin. A growing number of diseases in which there is a loss of melanin and/or neuromelanin are increasingly thought to have infectious etiologies, for example, Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Lewy Body Dementia (LBD), and vitiligo. AD, PD, LBD, and vitiligo have been linked with herpesvirus, which enters melanosomes and causes apoptosis, and with gut dysbiosis and inflammation. Herpesvirus is also linked with gut dysbiosis and inflammation. We theorize that under normal healthy states, melanin retains some of the energy it absorbs from electromagnetic radiation, which is then used to fuel cells, and energy from ATP is used to compliment that energy supply. We further theorize that loss of melanin reduces the energy supply of cells, which in the case of AD, PD, and LBD results in an inability to sustain immune system defenses and remove the plaques associated with the disease, which appear to be part of the immune system's attempt to eradicate the pathogens seen in these neurodegenerative diseases. In addition, in an attempt to explain why removing these plaques does not result in improvements in cognition and mood and why cognitions and moods in these individuals have ebbs and flows, we postulate that it is not the plaques that cause the cognitive symptoms but, rather, inflammation in the brain resulting from the immune system's response to pathogens. Our theory that energy retained in melanin fuels cells in an inverse relationship with ATP is supported by studies showing alterations in ATP production in relationship to melanin levels in melanomas, vitiligo, and healthy cells. Therefore, alteration of melanin levels may be at the core of many diseases. We propose regulating melanin levels may offer new avenues for treatment development.",37841274,PMC10570809,10.3389/fimmu.2023.1228530,1,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,8.786,0.2107662856578827,0.1806020066889632,0.8695652173913043,1.919780172732522
The vicious circle of hypometabolism in neurodegenerative diseases: Ways and mechanisms of metabolic correction,"Hypometabolism, characterized by decreased brain glucose consumption, is a common feature of many neurodegenerative diseases. Initial hypometabolic brain state, created by characteristic risk factors, may predispose the brain to acquired epilepsy and sporadic Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, which are the focus of this review. Analysis of available data suggests that deficient glucose metabolism is likely a primary initiating factor for these diseases, and that resulting neuronal dysfunction further promotes the metabolic imbalance, establishing an effective positive feedback loop and a downward spiral of disease progression. Therefore, metabolic correction leading to the normalization of abnormalities in glucose metabolism may be an efficient tool to treat the neurological disorders by counteracting their primary pathological mechanisms. Published and preliminary experimental results on this approach for treating Alzheimer's disease and epilepsy models support the efficacy of metabolic correction, confirming the highly promising nature of the strategy.

The protective role of exercise against age-related neurodegeneration,"Endurance exercise is a widely accessible, low-cost intervention with a variety of benefits to multiple organ systems. Exercise improves multiple indices of physical performance and stimulates pronounced health benefits reducing a range of pathologies including metabolic, cardiovascular, and neurodegenerative disorders. Endurance exercise delays brain aging, preserves memory and cognition, and improves symptoms of neurodegenerative pathologies like Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and various ataxias. Potential mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of exercise include neuronal survival and plasticity, neurogenesis, epigenetic modifications, angiogenesis, autophagy, and the synthesis and release of neurotrophins and cytokines.

ADAM10 as a therapeutic target for brain diseases: from developmental disorders to Alzheimer's disease,"In the central nervous system a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 10 (ADAM10) controls several functions such as neurodevelopment, synaptic plasticity and dendritic spine morphology thanks to its activity towards a high number of substrates, including the synaptic cell adhesion molecules as the Amyloid Precursor Protein, N-cadherin, Notch and Ephrins. In particular, ADAM10 plays a key role in the modulation of the molecular mechanisms responsible for dendritic spine formation, maturation and stabilization and in the regulation of the molecular organization of the glutamatergic synapse. Consequently, an alteration of ADAM10 activity is strictly correlated to the onset of different types of synaptopathies, ranging from neurodevelopmental disorders, i.e. autism spectrum disorders, to neurodegenerative diseases, i.e. Alzheimer's Disease. Areas covered: We describe the most recent discoveries in understanding of the role of ADAM10 activity at the glutamatergic excitatory synapse and its involvement in the onset of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders.

Neuroimmune interactions in Alzheimer's disease-New frontier with old challenges?,"The perceived role of the immune system in neurodegenerative diseases has undergone drastic changes over time. Initially considered as a passive bystander, then condemned as a mediator of neurodegeneration and now established as an important player in the pathogenetic cascade, neuroimmune interactions have come a long way to arrive center stage in Alzheimer's disease research. Despite major breakthroughs in recent years, basic questions remain unanswered as conflicting data describe immune overactivation, inadequate response or exhaustion of the immune system in neurodegenerative diseases. Furthermore, difficulties in translating in vitro and in vivo studies in model systems to the complex human disease condition with multiple overlapping pathologies and the long disease duration in patients suffering from neurodegenerative diseases have hampered progress. Development of novel, advanced model systems, as well as new technologies to interrogate existing disease models and valuable collections of human tissue samples, including brain tissue in parallel with improved imaging and biomarker technologies are guiding the way to better understand the role of the immune system in Alzheimer's disease with hopes for more effective interventions in the future.",31699314,PMC6939624,10.1016/bs.pmbts.2019.10.002,7,Progress in molecular biology and translational science,101498165,4.025,0.2075357437133789,0.45819397993311034,0.34782608695652173,1.0211602422146495
PARP-1 involvement in neurodegeneration: A focus on Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases,"DNA damage is the prime activator of the enzyme poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase1 (PARP-1) whose overactivation has been proven to be associated with the pathogenesis of numerous central nervous system disorders, such as ischemia, neuroinflammation, and neurodegenerative diseases. Under oxidative stress conditions PARP-1 activity increases, leading to an accumulation of ADP-ribose polymers and NAD(+) depletion, that induces energy crisis and finally cell death.

Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases: Focus on mild cognitive impairment,"The mild cognitive impairment (MCI) concept was developed to identify the earliest stages of cognitive impairment. MCI and, more specifically, amnestic MCI were initially proposed as transitional states that ultimately progress to full blown Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, MCI subjects do not uniformly progress to dementia (either AD or another) and may revert back to normal cognitive state. The MCI as concept has been borrowed from AD to other neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Parkinson's disease (PD). However the operational definition of MCI may not adequately convey the intended concept. Additional modifications to the concept and its operationalization are needed in order to better identify patients with incipient cognitive impairment and to guide clinical and research practices. Patients with PD have a very high likelihood of developing dementia, insidiously over many years. Cognitive impairment may start even before other symptoms. No constellation of cognitive symptoms in an otherwise healthy individual will herald development of AD or indeed will progress to dementia, including PD-dementia, in high likelihood. At present, identification of subtle cognitive dysfunction even in a person with diagnosed PD does not benefit the patient and should be avoided, except for research purposes.",26516060,,10.1016/j.parkreldis.2015.09.053,7,Parkinsonism & related disorders,9513583,4.402,0.20593424141407013,0.46153846153846156,0.46488294314381273,1.0962682371561345
A Scoping Review of Dietary Factors Conferring Risk or Protection for Cognitive Decline in APOE Îµ4 Carriers,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and fatal neurodegenerative disease. The strongest genetic risk factor for sporadic AD is carriage of the Îµ4 allele of the Apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene. Strategies to slow the progression of AD, including dietary interventions, may be modified by the pathogenic effect of this polymorphism. Our objective in this review was to determine the extent and quality of the literature investigating how dietary factors and interventions interact with the APOE Îµ4 genotype to impact cognitive decline in AD. To that end, we performed a systematic scoping review of published English-language articles involving human subjects. We found evidence suggesting that adherence to a Mediterranean diet may reduce cognitive decline among APOE Îµ4 carriers, whereas ketogenic agents appear to be ineffective. Diets high in saturated fats may be particularly harmful for APOE Îµ4 carriers. We identified several topics, including the use of Ï-3 fatty acid and antioxidant supplements, for which additional high level evidence is needed.",34866144,PMC8890439,10.1007/s12603-021-1705-4,1,"The journal of nutrition, health & aging",100893366,5.285,0.20529620349407196,0.18394648829431437,0.5585284280936454,1.216967019755306
Mechanisms of neurodegeneration - Insights from familial Alzheimer's disease,"The rising prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD), together with the lack of effective treatments, portray it as one of the major health challenges of our times. Untangling AD implies advancing the knowledge of the biology that gets disrupted during the disease while deciphering the molecular and cellular mechanisms leading to AD-related neurodegeneration. In fact, a solid mechanistic understanding of the disease processes stands as an essential prerequisite for the development of safe and effective treatments. Genetics has provided invaluable clues to the genesis of the disease by revealing deterministic genes - Presenilins (PSENs) and the Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) - that, when affected, lead in an autosomal dominant manner to early-onset, familial AD (FAD). PSEN is the catalytic subunit of the membrane-embedded Î³-secretase complexes, which act as proteolytic switches regulating key cell signalling cascades. Importantly, these intramembrane proteases are responsible for the production of Amyloid Î² (AÎ²) peptides from APP. The convergence of pathogenic mutations on one functional pathway, the amyloidogenic cleavage of APP, strongly supports the significance of this process in AD pathogenesis. Here, we review and discuss the state-of-the-art knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying FAD, their implications for the sporadic form of the disease and for the development of safe AD therapeutics.",32418657,,10.1016/j.semcdb.2020.03.005,24,Seminars in cell & developmental biology,9607332,7.499,0.2045007199048996,0.7424749163879598,0.7759197324414716,1.7709954152205316
Brain regions show different metabolic and protein arginine methylation phenotypes in frontotemporal dementias and Alzheimer's disease,"Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a heterogeneous neurodegenerative disease with multiple histopathological subtypes. FTD patients share similar symptoms with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Hence, FTD patients are commonly misdiagnosed as AD, despite the consensus clinical diagnostic criteria. It is therefore of great clinical need to identify a biomarker that can distinguish FTD from AD and control individuals, and potentially further differentiate between FTD pathological subtypes. We conducted a metabolomic analysis on post-mortem human brain tissue from three regions: cerebellum, frontal cortex and occipital cortex from control, FTLD-TDP type A, type A-C9, type C and AD. Our results indicate that the brain subdivisions responsible for different functions show different metabolic patterns. We further explored the region-specific metabolic characteristics of different FTD subtypes and AD patients. Different FTD subtypes and AD share similar metabolic phenotypes in the cerebellum, but AD exhibited distinct metabolic patterns in the frontal and occipital regions compared to FTD. The identified brain region-specific metabolite biomarkers could provide a tool for distinguishing different FTD subtypes and AD and provide the first insights into the metabolic changes of FTLD-TDP type A, type A-C9, type C and AD in different regions of the brain. The importance of protein arginine methylation in neurodegenerative disease has come to light, so we investigated whether the arginine methylation level contributes to disease pathogenesis. Our findings provide new insights into the relationship between arginine methylation and metabolic changes in FTD subtypes and AD that could be further explored, to study the molecular mechanism of pathogenesis.",36581185,,10.1016/j.pneurobio.2022.102400,2,Progress in neurobiology,0370121,0.0,0.20370754599571228,0.2608695652173913,0.14715719063545152,0.17439844064090565
Research Progress in Predicting DNA Methylation Modifications and the Relation with Human Diseases,"DNA methylation is an important mode of regulation in epigenetic mechanisms, and it is one of the research foci in the field of epigenetics. DNA methylation modification affects a series of biological processes, such as eukaryotic cell growth, differentiation, and transformation mechanisms, by regulating gene expression. In this review, we systematically summarized the DNA methylation databases, prediction tools for DNA methylation modification, machine learning algorithms for predicting DNA methylation modification, and the relationship between DNA methylation modification and diseases such as hypertension, Alzheimer's disease, diabetic nephropathy, and cancer. An in-depth understanding of DNA methylation mechanisms can promote accurate prediction of DNA methylation modifications and the treatment and diagnosis of related diseases.",34533438,,10.2174/0929867328666210917115733,5,Current medicinal chemistry,9440157,4.74,0.2030746340751648,0.39464882943143814,0.5016722408026756,1.1487745463313865
Alzheimer's Disease Puzzle: Delving into Pathogenesis Hypotheses,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disease characterized by both amnestic and non-amnestic clinical manifestations. It accounts for approximately 60-70% of all dementia cases worldwide. With the increasing number of AD patients, elucidating underlying mechanisms and developing corresponding interventional strategies are necessary. Hypotheses about AD such as amyloid cascade, Tau hyper-phosphorylation, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, cholinergic, and vascular hypotheses are not mutually exclusive, and all of them play a certain role in the development of AD. The amyloid cascade hypothesis is currently the most widely studied; however, other hypotheses are also gaining support. This article summarizes the recent evidence regarding major pathological hypotheses of AD and their potential interplay, as well as the strengths and weaknesses of each hypothesis and their implications for the development of effective treatments. This could stimulate further studies and promote the development of more effective therapeutic strategies for AD.",37450931,PMC10796101,10.14336/AD.2023.0608,8,Aging and disease,101540533,9.968,0.2024431973695755,0.48494983277591974,0.8996655518394648,2.2120558849769294
Interconnection between brain and retinal neurodegenerations,"The eye is a special sensory organ, which is basically an extension of the brain. Both are derived from neural tube and consist of neurons. Therefore, diseases of both the brain and eye should have some similarity. Neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the major cause of dementia in the world. Amyloid deposition in the cerebral cortex and hippocampal region is the basic pathology in AD. But along with it, there are various changes that take place in the eye, i.e., abnormal pupillary reaction, decreased vision, decreased contrast sensitivity, visual field changes, loss of retinal ganglionic cells and retinal fiber layer, peripapillary atrophy, increased cup-disk ratio, retinal thinning, tortuosity of blood vessels, and deposition of AÎ²-like substance in the retina. And these changes are present in the early part of the disease when only mild cognitive impairment is there. As the brain is covered by a hard bony skull which makes it difficult to directly visualize the changes occurring in the brain at molecular levels, finer details of disease progression are not available with us. But the eye is the window of the brain; with advanced modern techniques, we can directly visualize the changes in the retina at a very fine level. Therefore, by depicting neurodegenerative changes in the eye, we can diagnose and manage AD at very early stages. Along with it, retinal neurodegenerations like glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) are the major cause of loss of vision, and still, there are no effective treatment modalities for these blinding conditions. So if we can understand its pathogenesis and progression by correlating with brain neurodegenerations, we can come up with a better therapy for glaucoma and ARMD.",24826919,,10.1007/s12035-014-8733-6,30,Molecular neurobiology,8900963,5.682,0.20212802290916443,0.7959866220735786,0.5819397993311036,1.4168741381602143
Genome-Wide Mapping Implicates 5-Hydroxymethylcytosines in Diabetes Mellitus and Alzheimer's Disease,"Background:Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a recognized risk factor for dementia. Because DM is a potentially modifiable condition, greater understanding of the mechanisms linking DM to the clinical expression of Alzheimer's disease dementia may provide insights into much needed dementia therapeutics.Objective:In this feasibility study, we investigated DM as a dementia risk factor by examining genome-wide distributions of the epigenetic DNA modification 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC).Methods:We obtained biologic samples from the Rush Memory and Aging Project and used the highly sensitive 5hmC-Seal technique to perform genome-wide profiling of 5hmC in circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) from antemortem serum samples and in genomic DNA from postmortem prefrontal cortex brain tissue from 80 individuals across four groups: Alzheimer's disease neuropathologically defined (AD), DM clinically defined, AD with DM, and individuals with neither disease (controls).Results:Distinct 5hmC signatures and biological pathways were enriched in persons with both AD and DM versus AD alone, DM alone, or controls, including genes inhibited by EGFR signaling in oligodendroglia and those activated by constitutive RHOA. We also demonstrate the potential diagnostic value of 5hmC profiling in circulating cfDNA. Specifically, an 11-gene weighted model distinguished AD from non-AD/non-DM controls (AUC = 91.8%; 95% CI, 82.9-100.0%), while a 4-gene model distinguished DM-associated AD from AD alone (AUC = 87.9%; 95% CI, 77.5-98.3%).Conclusion:We demonstrate in this small sample, the feasibility of detecting and characterizing 5hmC in DM-associated AD and of using 5hmC information contained in circulating cfDNA to detect AD in high-risk individuals, such as those with diabetes.",37182870,PMC10490934,10.3233/JAD-221113,2,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,4.16,0.2018132209777832,0.26421404682274247,0.411371237458194,1.0059307419512185
Molecular imaging of neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease,"Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are very common in neurodegenerative diseases and are a major contributor to disability and caregiver burden. There is accumulating evidence that NPS may be a prodrome and/or a ""risk factor"" of neurodegenerative diseases. The medications used to treat these symptoms in younger patients are not very effective in patients with neurodegenerative disease and may have serious side effects. An understanding of the neurobiology of NPS is critical for the development of more effective intervention strategies. Targeting these symptoms may also have implications for prevention of cognitive or motor decline. Molecular brain imaging represents a bridge between basic and clinical observations and provides many opportunities for translation from animal models and human post-mortem studies to in vivo human studies. Molecular brain imaging studies in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are reviewed with a primary focus on positron emission tomography studies of NPS. Future directions for the field of molecular imaging in AD and PD to understand the neurobiology of NPS will be discussed.",25446948,PMC4806385,10.1016/j.neubiorev.2014.11.010,14,Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews,7806090,9.052,0.20149880647659302,0.6254180602006689,0.882943143812709,2.0563828959260895

From Neurodegeneration to Brain Health: An Integrated Approach,"The term ""brain health"" integrates general health and well-being with cognitive fitness, in the context of an environment that includes the spectrum of positive and negative factors affecting the individual. Brain health incorporates the effects of neurodegeneration in an ecological sense and the effects of environment and health practices on brain function. It also provides a framework for understanding and maximizing cognitive function across the lifespan. Despite decades of research into the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders, our understanding of how to treat them is relatively rudimentary. Unidimensional approaches, such as medication monotherapies, have generally produced negative results in treatment trials. New integrative paradigms that cut across the molecular and cellular level to the individual and societal level may provide new approaches to understand and treat these disorders. This report on proceedings of a multi-disciplinary conference held in Cleveland, Ohio, in October 2013 summarizes research progress in understanding neurodegenerative disorders in a brain health context. A new ""brain health"" paradigm is essential to finally understand neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and overcome the relative stand-still in therapeutics research that has characterized the last decade. The authors summarize progress in these emerging areas with the aim of producing new integrated scientific models for understanding brain health, potentially modifying disease course and advancing care for individuals and families affected by neurodegenerative conditions.",25720413,,10.3233/JAD-150043,1,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,4.16,0.19977594912052155,0.18729096989966554,0.41471571906354515,0.989323763452246
"Airborne Magnetite- and Iron-Rich Pollution Nanoparticles: Potential Neurotoxicants and Environmental Risk Factors for Neurodegenerative Disease, Including Alzheimer's Disease","Fewer than 5% of Alzheimer's disease (AD) cases are demonstrably directly inherited, indicating that environmental factors may be important in initiating and/or promoting the disease. Excess iron is toxic to cells; iron overload in the AD brain may aggressively accelerate AD. Magnetite nanoparticles, capable of catalyzing formation of reactive oxygen species, occur in AD plaques and tangles; they are thought to form in situ, from pathological iron dysfunction. A recent study has identified in frontal cortex samples the abundant presence of magnetite nanoparticles consistent with high-temperature formation; identifying therefore their external, not internal source. These magnetite particles range from â¼10 to 150 nm in size, and are often associated with other, non-endogenous metals (including platinum, cadmium, cerium). Some display rounded crystal morphologies and fused surface textures, reflecting cooling and crystallization from an initially heated, iron-bearing source material. Precisely-matching magnetite 'nanospheres' occur abundantly in roadside air pollution, arising from vehicle combustion and, especially, frictional brake-wear. Airborne magnetite pollution particles < â¼200 nm in size can access the brain directly via the olfactory and/or trigeminal nerves, bypassing the blood-brain barrier. Given their toxicity, abundance in roadside air, and nanoscale dimensions, traffic-derived magnetite pollution nanoparticles may constitute a chronic and pernicious neurotoxicant, and hence an environmental risk factor for AD, for large population numbers globally. Olfactory nerve damage displays strong association with AD development. Reported links between AD and occupational magnetic fields (e.g., affecting welders, machinists) may instead reflect inhalation exposure to airborne magnetic nanoparticles.",31381513,,10.3233/JAD-190204,11,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,4.16,0.199619859457016,0.5585284280936454,0.4180602006688963,1.0634776012929386
"Multiproteinopathy, neurodegeneration and old age: a case study",A complex spectrum of mixed brain pathologies is common in older people. This clinical pathologic conference case study illustrates the challenges of formulating clinicopathologic correlations in late-onset neurodegenerative diseases featuring cognitive-behavioral syndromes with underlying multiple proteinopathy.

"Genetic and Transcriptomic Profiles of Inflammation in Neurodegenerative Diseases: Alzheimer, Parkinson, Creutzfeldt-Jakob and Tauopathies","Polymorphisms in certain inflammatory-related genes have been identified as putative differential risk factors of neurodegenerative diseases with abnormal protein aggregates, such as sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) and sporadic Parkinson's disease (sPD). Gene expression studies of cytokines and mediators of the immune response have been made in post-mortem human brain samples in AD, sPD, sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD) subtypes MM1 and VV2, Pick's disease (PiD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration linked to mutation P301L in MAPT Frontotemporal lobar degeneration-tau (FTLD-tau). The studies have disclosed variable gene regulation which is: (1) disease-dependent in the frontal cortex area 8 in AD, sPD, sCJD MM1 and VV2, PiD, PSP and FTLD-tau; (2) region-dependent as seen when comparing the entorhinal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, and frontal cortex area 8 (FC) in AD; the substantia nigra, putamen, FC, and angular gyrus in PD, as well as the FC and cerebellum in sCJD; (3) genotype-dependent as seen considering sCJD MM1 and VV2; and (4) stage-dependent as seen in AD at different stages of disease progression. These observations show that regulation of inflammation is much more complicated and diverse than currently understood, and that new therapeutic approaches must be designed in order to selectively act on specific targets in particular diseases and at different time points of disease progression.",26861289,PMC4783939,10.3390/ijms17020206,41,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,6.208,0.1994638890028,0.8595317725752508,0.6956521739130435,1.5331846879167301
Instantiated mixed effects modeling of Alzheimer's disease markers,"The assessment and prediction of a subject's current and future risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease are of great interest in both the design of clinical trials as well as in clinical decision making. Exploring the longitudinal trajectory of markers related to neurodegeneration is an important task when selecting subjects for treatment in trials and the clinic, in the evaluation of early disease indicators and the monitoring of disease progression. Given that there is substantial intersubject variability, models that attempt to describe marker trajectories for a whole population will likely lack specificity for the representation of individual patients. Therefore, we argue here that individualized models provide a more accurate alternative that can be used for tasks such as population stratification and a subject-specific prognosis. In the work presented here, mixed effects modeling is used to derive global and individual marker trajectories for a training population. Test subject (new patient) specific models are then instantiated using a stratified ""marker signature"" that defines a subpopulation of similar cases within the training database. From this subpopulation, personalized models of the expected trajectory of several markers are subsequently estimated for unseen patients. These patient specific models of markers are shown to provide better predictions of time-to-conversion to Alzheimer's disease than population based models.",27381077,,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2016.06.049,14,NeuroImage,9215515,7.4,0.19915220141410828,0.6287625418060201,0.7591973244147158,1.7252438292096692
Î±-synuclein as an emerging pathophysiological biomarker of Alzheimer's disease,"Introduction:Î±-syn aggregates represent the pathological hallmark of synucleinopathies as well as a frequent copathology (almost 1/3 of cases) in AD. Recent research indicates a potential role of Î±-syn species, measured in CSF with conventional analytical techniques, in the differential diagnosis between AD and synucleinopathies (such as DLB). Pioneering studies report the detection of Î±-syn in blood, however, conclusive investigations are controversial. Ultrasensitive seed amplification techniques, enabling the selective quantification of Î±-syn seeds, may represent an effective solution to identify the Î±-syn component in AD and facilitate a biomarker-guided stratification.Areas covered:We performed a PubMed-based review of the latest findings on Î±-syn-related biomarkers for AD, focusing on bodily fluids. A dissertation on the role of ultrasensitive seed amplification assays, detecting Î±-syn seeds from different biological samples, was conducted.Expert opinion:Î±-syn may contribute to progressive AD neurodegeneration through cross-seeding especially with tau protein. Ultrasensitive seed amplification techniques may support a biomarker-drug co-development pathway and may be a pathophysiological candidate biomarker for the evolving ATX(N) system to classify AD and the spectrum of primary NDDs. This would contribute to a precise approach to AD, aimed at implementing disease-modifying treatments.",35443850,,10.1080/14737159.2022.2068952,2,Expert review of molecular diagnostics,101120777,5.67,0.19899649918079376,0.26755852842809363,0.5652173913043478,1.306909605194095
Polygenic score for Alzheimer's disease identifies differential atrophy in hippocampal subfield volumes,"Hippocampal subfield atrophy is a prime structural change in the brain, associated with cognitive aging and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Recent developments in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified genetic loci that characterize the risk of hippocampal volume loss based on the processes of normal and abnormal aging. Polygenic risk scores are the genetic proxies mimicking the genetic role of the pre-existing vulnerabilities of the underlying mechanisms influencing these changes. Discriminating the genetic predispositions of hippocampal subfield atrophy between cognitive aging and neurodegenerative diseases will be helpful in understanding the disease etiology. In this study, we evaluated the polygenic risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD PGRS) for hippocampal subfield atrophy in 1,086 individuals (319 cognitively normal (CN), 591 mild cognitively impaired (MCI), and 176 Alzheimer's disease dementia (ADD)). Our results showed a stronger association of AD PGRS effect on the left hemisphere than on the right hemisphere for all the hippocampal subfield volumes in a mixed clinical population (CN+MCI+ADD). The subfields CA1, CA4, hippocampal tail, subiculum, presubiculum, molecular layer, GC-ML-DG, and HATA showed stronger AD PGRS associations with the MCI+ADD group than with the CN group. The subfields CA3, parasubiculum, and fimbria showed moderately higher AD PGRS associations with the MCI+ADD group than with the CN group. Our findings suggest that the eight subfield regions, which were strongly associated with AD PGRS are likely involved in the early stage ADD and a specific focus on the left hemisphere could enhance the early prediction of ADD.",35830443,PMC9278752,10.1371/journal.pone.0270795,0,PloS one,101285081,3.752,0.19884087145328522,0.08361204013377926,0.33444816053511706,0.8864269308987269
Loss of gait control assessed by cognitive-motor dual-tasks: pros and cons in detecting people at risk of developing Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases,"Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases are age-related progressive neurodegenerative diseases of increasing prevalence worldwide. In the absence of curative therapy, current research is interested in prevention, by identifying subtle signs of early-stage neurodegeneration. Today, the field of behavioral neuroscience has emerged as one of the most promising areas of research on this topic. Recently, it has been shown that the exacerbation of gait disorders under dual-task conditions (i.e., simultaneous performance of cognitive and motor tasks) could be a characteristic feature of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. The cognitive-motor dual-task paradigm during walking allows to assess whether (i) executive attention is abnormally impaired in prodromal Alzheimer's disease or (ii) compensation strategies are used in order to preserve gait function when the basal ganglia system is altered in prodromal Parkinson's disease. This review aims at (i) identifying patterns of dual-task-related gait changes that are specific to Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, respectively, (ii) demonstrating that these changes could potentially be used as prediagnostic markers for disease onset, (iii) reviewing pros and cons of existing dual-task studies, and (iv) proposing future directions for clinical research.",28551877,PMC5505895,10.1007/s11357-017-9977-7,38,GeroScience,101686284,7.581,0.19837458431720734,0.8461538461538461,0.7859531772575251,1.8044555198210936
Locus coeruleus integrity is related to tau burden and memory loss in autosomal-dominant Alzheimer's disease,"Abnormally phosphorylated tau, an indicator of Alzheimer's disease, accumulates in the first decades of life in the locus coeruleus (LC), the brain's main noradrenaline supply. However, technical challenges in in-vivo assessments have impeded research into the role of the LC in Alzheimer's disease. We studied participants with or known to be at-risk for mutations in genes causing autosomal-dominant Alzheimer's disease (ADAD) with early onset, providing a unique window into the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's largely disentangled from age-related factors. Using high-resolution MRI and tau PET, we found lower rostral LC integrity in symptomatic participants. LC integrity was associated with individual differences in tau burden and memory decline. Post-mortem analyses in a separate set of carriers of the same mutation confirmed substantial neuronal loss in the LC. Our findings link LC degeneration to tau burden and memory in Alzheimer's, and highlight a role of the noradrenergic system in this neurodegenerative disease.",35045380,PMC8976827,10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2021.11.006,38,Neurobiology of aging,8100437,5.133,0.19728974997997284,0.8494983277591973,0.5551839464882943,1.3148735155398232
Increased plasma DYRK1A with aging may protect against neurodegenerative diseases,"Early markers are needed for more effective prevention of Alzheimer's disease. We previously showed that individuals with Alzheimer's disease have decreased plasma DYRK1A levels compared to controls. We assessed DYRK1A in the plasma of cognitively healthy elderly volunteers, individuals with either Alzheimer's disease (AD), tauopathies or Down syndrome (DS), and in lymphoblastoids from individuals with DS. DYRK1A levels were inversely correlated with brain amyloid Î² burden in asymptomatic elderly individuals and AD patients. Low DYRK1A levels were also detected in patients with tauopathies. Individuals with DS had higher DYRK1A levels than controls, although levels were lower in individuals with DS and with dementia. These data suggest that plasma DYRK1A levels could be used for early detection of at risk individuals of AD and for early detection of AD. We hypothesize that lack of increase of DYRK1A at middle age (40-50 years) could be a warning before the cognitive decline, reflecting increased risk for AD.",37015911,PMC10073199,10.1038/s41398-023-02419-0,1,Translational psychiatry,101562664,7.989,0.19698064029216766,0.19063545150501673,0.8561872909698997,1.7541154744763037
Pre-diagnostic cognitive and functional impairment in multiple sporadic neurodegenerative diseases,"Introduction:The pathophysiological processes of neurodegenerative diseases begin years before diagnosis. However, pre-diagnostic changes in cognition and physical function are poorly understood, especially in sporadic neurodegenerative disease.Methods:UK Biobank data were extracted. Cognitive and functional measures in individuals who subsequently developed Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson disease, frontotemporal dementia, progressive supranuclear palsy, dementia with Lewy bodies, or multiple system atrophy were compared against individuals without neurodegenerative diagnoses. The same measures were regressed against time to diagnosis, after adjusting for the effects of age.Results:There was evidence for pre-diagnostic cognitive impairment and decline with time, particularly in AD. Pre-diagnostic functional impairment and decline were observed in multiple diseases.Discussion:The scale and longitudinal follow-up of UK Biobank participants provides evidence for cognitive and functional decline years before symptoms become obvious in multiple neurodegenerative diseases.

Personalized Protein-Protein Interaction Networks Towards Unraveling the Molecular Mechanisms of Alzheimer's Disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a highly heterogenous neurodegenerative disease, and several omic-based datasets were generated in the last decade from the patients with the disease. However, the vast majority of studies evaluate these datasets in bulk by considering all the patients as a single group, which obscures the molecular differences resulting from the heterogeneous nature of the disease. In this study, we adopted a personalized approach and analyzed the transcriptome data from 403 patients individually by mapping the data on a human protein-protein interaction network. Patient-specific subnetworks were discovered and analyzed in terms of the genes in the subnetworks, enriched functional terms, and known AD genes. We identified several affected pathways that could not be captured by the bulk comparison. We also showed that our personalized findings point to patterns of alterations consistent with the recently suggested AD subtypes.",37855983,,10.1007/s12035-023-03690-4,0,Molecular neurobiology,8900963,5.682,0.19559408724308014,0.08695652173913043,0.5852842809364549,1.2711477566936744
Mitophagy in neurodegenerative diseases,"Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), Huntington's disease (HD), and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), are a complex ""family"" of pathologies, characterised by the progressive loss of neurons and/or neuronal functions, leading to severe physical and cognitive inabilities in affected patients. These syndromes, despite differences in the causative events, the onset, and the progression of the disease, share as common features the presence of aggregate-prone neuro-toxic proteins, in the form of aggresomes and/or inclusion bodies, perturbing cellular homeostasis and neuronal function (Popovic et al., 2014), and the presence of dysfunctional mitochondria. The removal of protein aggregates and of damaged organelles, through the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and/or the autophagy/lysosome machinery, is a crucial step for the maintenance of neuronal homeostasis. Indeed, their impairment has been reported as associated with the development of these diseases. In this review, we focus on the role played by mitophagy, a specialised form of autophagy, in the onset and progression of major neurodegenerative diseases, as well as on possible therapeutic approaches involving mitophagy modulation.",28797885,,10.1016/j.neuint.2017.08.004,51,Neurochemistry international,8006959,4.297,0.19544048607349396,0.903010033444816,0.44816053511705684,1.1572662983330595
Shared and unique effects of ApoEÎµ4 and pathogenic gene mutation on cognition and imaging in preclinical familial Alzheimer's disease,"Background:Neuropsychology and imaging changes have been reported in the preclinical stage of familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD). This study investigated the effects of APOEÎµ4 and known pathogenic gene mutation on different cognitive domains and circuit imaging markers in preclinical FAD.Methods:One hundred thirty-nine asymptomatic subjects in FAD families, including 26 APOEÎµ4 carriers, 17 APP and 20 PS1 mutation carriers, and 76 control subjects, went through a series of neuropsychological tests and MRI scanning. Test scores and imaging measures including volumes, diffusion indices, and functional connectivity (FC) of frontostriatal and hippocampus to posterior cingulate cortex pathways were compared between groups and analyzed for correlation.Results:Compared with controls, the APOEÎµ4 group showed increased hippocampal volume and decreased FC of fronto-caudate pathway. The APP group showed increased recall scores in auditory verbal learning test, decreased fiber number, and increased radial diffusivity and FC of frontostriatal pathway. All three genetic groups showed decreased fractional anisotropy of hippocampus to posterior cingulate cortex pathway. These neuropsychological and imaging measures were able to discriminate genetic groups from controls, with areas under the curve from 0.733 to 0.837. Circuit imaging measures are differentially associated with scores in various cognitive scales in control and genetic groups.Conclusions:There are neuropsychological and imaging changes in the preclinical stage of FAD, some of which are shared by APOEÎµ4 and known pathogenic gene mutation, while some are unique to different genetic groups. These findings are helpful for the early identification of Alzheimer's disease and for developing generalized and individualized prevention and intervention strategies.",36850008,PMC9972804,10.1186/s13195-023-01192-y,0,Alzheimer's research & therapy,101511643,8.823,0.1949802190065384,0.0903010033444816,0.8795986622073578,1.8996483320728195
The Influence of the Gut Microbiota on Alzheimer's Disease: A Narrative Review,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disease that tends to occur in the elderly. The main symptom is hypomnesia. More and more older people are suffering from this disease worldwide. By 2050, 152 million people worldwide are expected to have AD. It is thought that the aggregation of amyloid-beta peptides and hyper-phosphorylated tau tangles contribute to AD. The microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis appears as a new concept. The MGB axis is a collection of microbial molecules produced in the gastrointestinal tract that influence the physiological function of the brain. In this review, we discuss how the gut microbiota (GM) and its metabolites affect AD in different ways. Dysregulation of the GM has been shown to be involved in various mechanisms involved in memory and learning functions. We review the current literature on the role of the entero-brain axis in the pathogenesis of AD and its potential role as a future therapeutic target in the treatment and/or prevention of AD.",36992601,,10.31083/j.jin2202038,4,Journal of integrative neuroscience,101156357,1.664,0.1949802190065384,0.36454849498327757,0.22742474916387959,0.5226978304005785
The role of the locus coeruleus/norepinephrine system in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders: An update,"Purpose of review:The aim of this review was to provide an update on current and emerging knowledge of the neuropathological processes affecting the locus coeruleus/norepinephrine (LC/NE) system, their effect on Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease symptomatology, including efforts to translate these notions into therapeutic actions targeting the noradrenergic system.Recent findings:Over the past 2 years, work from multiple groups has contributed to support an early role of locus coeruleus degeneration and/or hyperactivation in the neurodegenerative process, including a trigger of neuroinflammation. Imaging advances are allowing the quantification of locus coeruleus structural features in vivo, which is critical in the early stages of disease. Nonmotor and noncognitive symptoms, often secondary to the involvement of the LC/NE system, are becoming more important in the definition of these diseases and their treatment.Summary:The diverse symptomatology of Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, which is not limited to cardinal motor and cognitive abnormalities, strongly suggests a multisystem neurodegenerative process. In this context, it is increasingly clear how the LC/NE system plays a key role in the initiation and maintenance of the neurodegenerative process.",35175974,,10.1097/WCO.0000000000001042,4,Current opinion in neurology,9319162,6.283,0.19482699036598206,0.36789297658862874,0.7190635451505016,1.447074789537315
The six brain-specific TAU isoforms and their role in Alzheimer's disease and related neurodegenerative dementia syndromes,"Introduction:Alternative splicing of the human MAPT gene generates six brain-specific TAU isoforms. Imbalances in the TAU isoform ratio can lead to neurodegenerative diseases, underscoring the need for precise control over TAU isoform balance. Tauopathies, characterized by intracellular aggregates of hyperphosphorylated TAU, exhibit extensive neurodegeneration and can be classified by the TAU isoforms present in pathological accumulations.Methods:A comprehensive review of TAU and related dementia syndromes literature was conducted using PubMed, Google Scholar, and preprint server.Results:While TAU is recognized as key driver of neurodegeneration in specific tauopathies, the contribution of the isoforms to neuronal function and disease development remains largely elusive.Discussion:In this review we describe the role of TAU isoforms in health and disease, and stress the importance of comprehending and studying TAU isoforms in both, physiological and pathological context, in order to develop targeted therapeutic interventions for TAU-associated diseases.Highlights:MAPT splicing is tightly regulated during neuronal maturation and throughout life. TAU isoform expression is development-, cell-type and brain region specific. The contribution of TAU to neurodegeneration might be isoform-specific. Ineffective TAU-based therapies highlight the need for specific targeting strategies.",38556838,PMC11095451,10.1002/alz.13784,0,Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association,101231978,16.655,0.1945207715034485,0.09364548494983277,0.9732441471571907,3.4664415598920355
Capturing Measures That Matter: The Potential Value of Digital Measures of Physical Behavior for Alzheimer's Disease Drug Development,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease and the primary cause of dementia worldwide. Despite the magnitude of AD's impact on patients, caregivers, and society, nearly all AD clinical trials fail. A potential contributor to this high rate of failure is that established clinical outcome assessments fail to capture subtle clinical changes, entail high burden for patients and their caregivers, and ineffectively address the aspects of health deemed important by patients and their caregivers. AD progression is associated with widespread changes in physical behavior that have impacts on the ability to function independently, which is a meaningful aspect of health for patients with AD and important for diagnosis. However, established assessments of functional independence remain underutilized in AD clinical trials and are limited by subjective biases and ceiling effects. Digital measures of real-world physical behavior assessed passively, continuously, and remotely using digital health technologies have the potential to address some of these limitations and to capture aspects of functional independence in patients with AD. In particular, measures of real-world gait, physical activity, and life-space mobility captured with wearable sensors may offer value. Additional research is needed to understand the validity, feasibility, and acceptability of these measures in AD clinical research.",37545234,PMC10578291,10.3233/JAD-230152,0,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,4.16,0.19406214356422424,0.09698996655518395,0.4214046822742475,0.9678352794495714

Microglia in Alzheimer's disease,"Microglia are brain-resident myeloid cells that mediate key functions to support the CNS. Microglia express a wide range of receptors that act as molecular sensors, which recognize exogenous or endogenous CNS insults and initiate an immune response. In addition to their classical immune cell function, microglia act as guardians of the brain by promoting phagocytic clearance and providing trophic support to ensure tissue repair and maintain cerebral homeostasis. Conditions associated with loss of homeostasis or tissue changes induce several dynamic microglial processes, including changes of cellular morphology, surface phenotype, secretory mediators, and proliferative responses (referred to as an ""activated state""). Activated microglia represent a common pathological feature of several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cumulative evidence suggests that microglial inflammatory activity in AD is increased while microglial-mediated clearance mechanisms are compromised. Microglia are perpetually engaged in a mutual interaction with the surrounding environment in CNS; thus, diverse microglial reactions at different disease stages may open new avenues for therapeutic intervention and modification of inflammatory activities. In this Review, the role of microglia in the pathogenesis of AD and the modulation of microglia activity as a therapeutic modality will be discussed.",28862638,PMC5669553,10.1172/JCI90606,395,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,19.456,0.193451926112175,0.9866220735785953,0.9933110367892977,4.204595570383024
Effects of Exercise Training on Immune-Related Genes and Pathways in the Cortex of Animal Models of Alzheimer's Disease: A Systematic Review,"Background:Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease that affects the immune system due to the accumulation of amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) and tau associated molecular pathology and other pathogenic processes. To address AD pathogenesis, various approaches had been conducted from drug development to lifestyle modification to reduce the prevalence of AD. Exercise is considered a prominent lifestyle modification to combat AD.Objective:This observation prompted us to review the literature on exercise related to immune genes in the cortex of animal models of AD. We focused on animal model studies due to their prevalence in this domain.Methods:The systematic review was conducted according to PRISMA standards using Web of Science (WoS) and PubMed databases. Any kind of genes, proteins, and molecular molecules were included in this systematic review. The list of these immune-related molecules was analyzed in the STRING database for functional enrichment analysis.Results:We found that 17 research studies discussed immune-related molecules and 30 immune proteins. These studies showed that exercise had the ability to ameliorate dysfunction in AD-related pathways, which led to decreasing the expression of microglia-related pathways and Th17-related immune pathways. As a result of decreasing the expression of immune-related pathways, the expression of apoptosis-related pathways was also decreasing, and neuronal survival was increased by exercise activity.Conclusions:Based on functional enrichment analysis, exercise not only could reduce apoptotic factors and immune components but also could increase cell survival and AÎ² clearance in cortex samples.

Dysfunction of the neurovascular unit in diabetes-related neurodegeneration,"In current aging societies, diabetes mellitus and neurodegenerative diseases represented by Alzheimer's disease are highly prevalent among adults, especially the elderly all over the world. It is worth noting that a substantial body of evidence suggests diabetes contributes to accelerated neurodegenerative processes and the decline of cognition. Over the last few years, some studies have indicated neurovascular uncoupling and disrupted functional connectivity in the early stages of many neurodegenerative diseases, and the concept of the neurovascular unit (NVU) has been highlighted to understand the initiation and progression of neurodegenerative diseases recently. Considering that some components of the NVU are also demonstrated to have abnormal morphology and function under the condition of diabetes, we propose the hypothesis that diabetes may promote the onset and development of neurodegenerative diseases by impairing the integrity of the NVU, named Diabetes-NVU-Neurodegeneration Hypothesis. The existing body of literature supporting the hypothesis and elucidating the underlying mechanisms will be summarized in this review.",32841897,,10.1016/j.biopha.2020.110656,12,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,8213295,7.419,0.19314736127853394,0.5785953177257525,0.7692307692307693,1.7154074803122707
Investigating hypotheses of neurodegeneration by learning dynamical systems of protein propagation in the brain,"We introduce a theoretical framework for estimating, comparing and interpreting mechanistic hypotheses on long term protein propagation across brain networks in neurodegenerative disorders (ND). The model is expressed within a Bayesian non-parametric regression setting, where mechanisms of protein dynamics are inferred by means of gradient matching on dynamical systems (DS). The Bayesian formalism, combined with stochastic variational inference, naturally allows for model comparison via assessment of model evidence, while providing uncertainty quantification of causal relationship underlying protein progressions. When applied to in-vivo AV45-PET brain imaging data measuring topographic amyloid deposition in Alzheimer's disease (AD), our model identified the mechanisms of accumulation, clearance and propagation as the best suited DS for bio-mechanical description of amyloid dynamics in AD, enabling realistic and accurate personalized simulation of amyloidosis.",33823273,,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2021.117980,3,NeuroImage,9215515,7.4,0.19284319877624512,0.32441471571906355,0.7625418060200669,1.66058886240956
Microglial Progranulin: Involvement in Alzheimer's Disease and Neurodegenerative Diseases,"Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease have proven resistant to new treatments. The complexity of neurodegenerative disease mechanisms can be highlighted by accumulating evidence for a role for a growth factor, progranulin (PGRN). PGRN is a glycoprotein encoded by the GRN/Grn gene with multiple cellular functions, including neurotrophic, anti-inflammatory and lysosome regulatory properties. Mutations in the GRN gene can lead to frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), a cause of dementia, and neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL), a lysosomal storage disease. Both diseases are associated with loss of PGRN function resulting, amongst other features, in enhanced microglial neuroinflammation and lysosomal dysfunction. PGRN has also been implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Unlike FTLD, increased expression of PGRN occurs in brains of human AD cases and AD model mice, particularly in activated microglia. How microglial PGRN might be involved in AD and other neurodegenerative diseases will be discussed. A unifying feature of PGRN in diseases might be its modulation of lysosomal function in neurons and microglia. Many experimental models have focused on consequences of PGRN gene deletion: however, possible outcomes of increasing PGRN on microglial inflammation and neurodegeneration will be discussed. We will also suggest directions for future studies on PGRN and microglia in relation to neurodegenerative diseases.",30862089,PMC6468562,10.3390/cells8030230,33,Cells,101600052,7.666,0.19253936409950256,0.8160535117056856,0.8327759197324415,1.8119343208008387
Abnormal Structural Brain Connectome in Individuals with Preclinical Alzheimer's Disease,"Alzheimer's disease has a long preclinical phase during which amyloid pathology and neurodegeneration accumulate in the brain without producing overt cognitive deficits. It is currently unclear whether these early disease stages are associated with a progressive disruption in the communication between brain regions that subsequently leads to cognitive decline and dementia. In this study we assessed the organization of structural networks in cognitively normal (CN) individuals harboring amyloid pathology (A+N-), neurodegeneration (A-N+), or both (A+N+) from the prospective and longitudinal Swedish BioFINDER study. We combined graph theory with diffusion tensor imaging to investigate integration, segregation, and centrality measures in the brain connectome in the previous groups. At baseline, our findings revealed a disrupted network topology characterized by longer paths, lower efficiency, increased clustering and modularity in CN A-N+ and CN A+N+, but not in CN A+N-. After 2 years, CN A+N+ showed significant abnormalities in all global network measures, whereas CN A-N+ only showed abnormalities in the global efficiency. Network connectivity and organization were associated with memory in CN A+N+ individuals. Altogether, our findings suggest that amyloid pathology is not sufficient to disrupt structural network topology, whereas neurodegeneration is.",29028937,,10.1093/cercor/bhx236,19,"Cerebral cortex (New York, N.Y. : 1991)",9110718,4.861,0.19208428263664246,0.6923076923076923,0.5117056856187291,1.225912108043524
ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE AND ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE MICROBIOTA-GUT-BRAIN AXIS,"Background:Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and irreversible neurodegenerative disease, characterized by the accumulation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. Several pathways enable bidirectional communication between the central nervous system (CNS), the intestine and its microbiota, constituting the microbiota-gut-brain axis.Objective:Review the pathophysiology of AD, relate it to the microbiota-gut-brain axis and discuss the possibility of using probiotics in the treatment and/or prevention of this disease.Methods:Search of articles from the PubMed database published in the last 5 years (2017 to 2022) structure the narrative review.Results:The composition of the gut microbiota influences the CNS, resulting in changes in host behavior and may be related to the development of neurodegenerative diseases. Some metabolites produced by the intestinal microbiota, such as trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), may be involved in the pathogenesis of AD, while other compounds produced by the microbiota during the fermentation of food in the intestine, such as D-glutamate and fatty acids short chain, are beneficial in cognitive function. The consumption of live microorganisms beneficial to health, known as probiotics, has been tested in laboratory animals and humans to evaluate the effect on AD.Conclusion:Although there are few clinical trials evaluating the effect of probiotic consumption in humans with AD, the results to date indicate a beneficial contribution of the use of probiotics in this disease.",37194773,,10.1590/S0004-2803.202301000-17,2,Arquivos de gastroenterologia,15310600R,0.0,0.1911766231060028,0.2709030100334448,0.16387959866220736,0.16888657587029066
"The Immune System and Neuroinflammation as Potential Sources of Blood-Based Biomarkers for Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, and Huntington's Disease","Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by a loss of neurons that leads to cognitive and behavioral dysfunction. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder affecting millions of people in the United States and worldwide, followed by Parkinson's disease (PD). While some early onset forms of AD and PD are hereditary, the sporadic or late-onset cases are believed to result from lifestyle and environmental factors. On the contrary, Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disease solely caused by mutations in the gene for huntingtin protein. The disease mechanisms at play for all three disorders remain elusive, hampering efforts to develop effective therapeutic interventions. In light of this, the discovery of robust biomarkers is crucial in order to identify people at risk for AD and PD, preferably before symptoms arise. For all three diseases, the identification of biomarkers would not only allow development of treatments but also evaluation and adjustment of these with disease progression. It is now understood that neuroinflammation plays a crucial role in neurodegenerative diseases, along with subsequent immune activation. Therefore, research is actively ongoing to discover and evaluate inflammatory and immune-related biomarkers. Recent progress in this area for AD, PD, and HD is presented here.",27046268,,10.1021/acschemneuro.6b00042,28,ACS chemical neuroscience,101525337,5.78,0.19102567434310913,0.782608695652174,0.5953177257525084,1.4271371437363003
A mathematical model on the propagation of tau pathology in neurodegenerative diseases,"A system of partial differential equations is developed to study the spreading of tau pathology in the brain for Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases. Two cases are considered with one assuming intracellular diffusion through synaptic activities or the nanotubes that connect the adjacent cells. The other, in addition to intracellular spreading, takes into account of the secretion of the tau species which are able to diffuse, move with the interstitial fluid flow and subsequently taken up by the surrounding cells providing an alternative pathway for disease spreading. Cross membrane transport of the tau species are considered enabling us to examine the role of extracellular clearance of tau protein on the disease status. Bifurcation analysis is carried out for the steady states of the spatially homogeneous system yielding the results that fast cross-membrane transport combined with effective extracellular clearance is key to maintain the brain's healthy status. Numerical simulations of the first case exhibit solutions of travelling wave form describing the gradual outward spreading of the pathology; whereas the second case shows faster spreading with the buildup of neurofibrillary tangles quickly elevated throughout. Our investigation thus indicates that the gradual progression of the intracellular spreading case is more consistent with the clinical observations of the development of Alzheimer's disease.",38750128,,10.1007/s00285-024-02101-z,0,Journal of mathematical biology,7502105,2.164,0.19087480008602142,0.10702341137123746,0.23411371237458195,0.5687295623258604
Biomarkers for Managing Neurodegenerative Diseases,"Neurological disorders are the leading cause of cognitive and physical disability worldwide, affecting 15% of the global population. Due to the demographics of aging, the prevalence of neurological disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases, will double over the next two decades. Unfortunately, while available therapies provide symptomatic relief for cognitive and motor impairment, there is an urgent unmet need to develop disease-modifying therapies that slow the rate of pathological progression. In that context, biomarkers could identify at-risk and prodromal patients, monitor disease progression, track responses to therapy, and parse the causality of molecular events to identify novel targets for further clinical investigation. Thus, identifying biomarkers that discriminate between diseases and reflect specific stages of pathology would catalyze the discovery and development of therapeutic targets. This review will describe the prevalence, known mechanisms, ongoing or recently concluded therapeutic clinical trials, and biomarkers of three of the most prevalent neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Parkinson's disease (PD).",38672416,PMC11048498,10.3390/biom14040398,0,Biomolecules,101596414,6.064,0.19072403013706207,0.11036789297658862,0.6153846153846154,1.349307996677555
Caspases: therapeutic targets in neurologic disease,"Specific therapies for neurologic diseases such as Alzheimer's disease provide the potential for better clinical outcomes. Expression of caspases in the brain is developmentally regulated, and dysregulated in neurologic disease, supporting that caspases may be therapeutic targets. The activity of caspases is carefully regulated via binding partners, cleavage, or endogenous inhibitors to prevent spontaneous activation, which could lead to aberrant cell death. This review serves as a brief examination of the current understanding of the regulation and function of caspases, and approaches to specifically target aberrant caspase activity. The use of proper tools to investigate individual caspases is addressed. Moreover, it summarizes the reports of various caspases in Alzheimer's disease studies.

Low levels of aluminum can lead to behavioral and morphological changes associated with Alzheimer's disease and age-related neurodegeneration,"Aluminum (Al) is a very common component of the earth's mineral composition. It is not essential element for life and is a constituent of rather inert minerals. Therefore, it has often been regarded as not presenting a significant health hazard. As a result, aluminum-containing agents been used in the preparation of many foodstuffs processing steps and also in elimination of particulate organic matter from water. More recently, the reduced pH of bodies of water resulting from acid rain has led to mobilization of aluminum-containing minerals into a more soluble form, and these have thus entered residential drinking water resources. By this means, the body burden of aluminum in humans has increased. Epidemiological and experimental findings indicate that aluminum is not as harmless as was previously thought, and that aluminum may contribute to the inception and advancement of Alzheimer's disease. Epidemiological data is reinforced by indications that aluminum exposure can result in excess inflammatory activity within the brain. Activation of the immune system not initiated by an infectious agent, typifies the aging brain and is even more augmented in several neurodegenerative diseases. The origin of most age-related neurological disorders is generally not known but as they are largely not of genetic derivation, their development is likely triggered by unknown environmental factors. There is a growing and consistent body of evidence that points to aluminum as being one such significant influence. Evidence is presented that reinforces the likelihood that aluminum is a factor speeding the rate of brain aging. Such acceleration would inevitably enlarge the incidence of age-related neurological diseases.",26687397,,10.1016/j.neuro.2015.12.002,51,Neurotoxicology,7905589,4.398,0.1905733346939087,0.9063545150501672,0.46153846153846156,1.1752149038263786
Biological Basis for Amyloidogenesis in Alzheimer's Disease,"Certain cellular proteins normally soluble in the living organism under certain conditions form aggregates with a specific cross-Î² sheet structure called amyloid. These intra- or extracellular insoluble aggregates (fibers or plaques) are hallmarks of many neurodegenerative pathologies including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, prion disease, and other progressive neurological diseases that develop in the aging human central nervous system. Amyloid diseases (amyloidoses) are widespread in the elderly human population, a rapidly expanding demographic in many global populations. Increasing age is the most significant risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases associated with amyloid plaques. To date, nearly three dozen different misfolded proteins targeting brain and other organs have been identified in amyloid diseases and AD, the most prevalent neurodegenerative amyloid disease affecting over 15 million people worldwide. Here we (i) highlight the latest data on mechanisms of amyloid formation and further discuss a hypothesis on the amyloid cascade as a primary mechanism of AD pathogenesis and (ii) review the evolutionary aspects of amyloidosis, which allow new insight on human-specific mechanisms of dementia development.",28320296,,10.1134/S0006297917020043,14,Biochemistry.

miRNAs Identify Shared Pathways in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Diseases,"Despite the identification of several dozens of common genetic variants associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), most of the genetic risk remains uncharacterised. Therefore, it is important to understand the role of regulatory elements, such as miRNAs. Dysregulated miRNAs are implicated in AD and PD, with potential value in dissecting the shared pathophysiology between the two disorders. miRNAs relevant to both neurodegenerative diseases are related to axonal guidance, apoptosis, and inflammation, therefore, AD and PD likely arise from similar underlying biological pathway defects. Furthermore, pathways regulated by APP, L1CAM, and genes of the caspase family may represent promising therapeutic miRNA targets in AD and PD since they are targeted by dysregulated miRNAs in both disorders.",31221572,,10.1016/j.molmed.2019.05.006,20,Trends in molecular medicine,100966035,15.272,0.1901218295097351,0.7157190635451505,0.9531772575250836,3.311616910414871
Insulin signaling pathway and related molecules: Role in neurodegeneration and Alzheimer's disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases. Its major pathological hallmarks, neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), and amyloid-Î² plaques can result from dysfunctional insulin signaling. Insulin is an important growth factor that regulates cell growth, energy utilization, mitochondrial function, autophagy, oxidative stress, synaptic plasticity, and cognitive function. Insulin and its downstream signaling molecules are located majorly in the regions of cortex and hippocampus. The major molecules involved in impaired insulin signaling include IRS, PI3K, Akt, and GSK-3Î². Activation or inactivation of these major molecules through increased or decreased phosphorylation plays a role in insulin signaling abnormalities or insulin resistance. Insulin resistance, therefore, is considered as a major culprit in generating the hallmarks of AD arising from neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, etc. Moreover, caspases, Nrf2, and NF-ÎºB influence this pathway in an indirect way. Various studies also suggest a strong link between Diabetes Mellitus and AD due to the impairment of insulin signaling pathway. Moreover, studies also depict a strong correlation of other neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease with insulin resistance. Hence this review will provide an insight into the role of insulin signaling pathway and related molecules as therapeutic targets in AD and other neurodegenerative diseases.",32092326,,10.1016/j.neuint.2020.104707,72,Neurochemistry international,8006959,4.297,0.18937113881111145,0.9431438127090301,0.451505016722408,1.1616514458284728
Mitochondria in Alzheimer's Disease and Diabetes-Associated Neurodegeneration: License to Heal!,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a difficult puzzle to solve, in part because the etiology of this devastating neurodegenerative disorder remains murky. However, diabetes has been pinpointed as a major risk factor for the sporadic forms of AD. Several overlapping neurodegenerative mechanisms have been identified between AD and diabetes, including mitochondrial malfunction. This is not surprising taking into account that neurons are cells with a complex morphology, long lifespan, and high energetic requirements which make them particularly reliant on a properly organized and dynamic mitochondrial network to sustain neuronal function and integrity. In this sense, this chapter provides an overview on the role of mitochondrial bioenergetics and dynamics to the neurodegenerative events that occur in AD and diabetes, and how these organelles may represent a mechanistic link between these two pathologies. From a therapeutic perspective, it will be discussed how mitochondria can be targeted in order to efficaciously counteract neurodegeneration associated with AD and diabetes.",28251365,,10.1007/164_2017_3,12,Handbook of experimental pharmacology,7902231,0.0,0.18922126293182373,0.5819397993311036,0.1705685618729097,0.229920717625315
Synapses in neurodegenerative diseases,"Synapse is the basic structural and functional component for neural communication in the brain. The presynaptic terminal is the structural and functionally essential area that initiates communication and maintains the continuous functional neural information flow. It contains synaptic vesicles (SV) filled with neurotransmitters, an active zone for release, and numerous proteins for SV fusion and retrieval. The structural and functional synaptic plasticity is a representative characteristic; however, it is highly vulnerable to various pathological conditions. In fact, synaptic alteration is thought to be central to neural disease processes. In particular, the alteration of the structural and functional phenotype of the presynaptic terminal is a highly significant evidence for neural diseases. In this review, we specifically describe structural and functional alteration of nerve terminals in several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Huntington's disease (HD).

Precision medicine: Clarity for the clinical and biological complexity of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases,"The goal of precision medicine is to deliver optimally targeted and timed interventions tailored to an individual's molecular drivers of disease. This concept has wide currency in cancer care and in some diseases caused by monogenetic mutations, such as cystic fibrosis, and recently has been endorsed by the White House Office of Science and Technology for more widespread application in medicine. Here we describe our vision of how precision medicine can bring greater clarity to the clinical and biological complexity of the two most common neurodegenerative diseases, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.",25941321,PMC4419342,10.1084/jem.20150656,13,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,0.0,0.18847329914569855,0.6086956521739131,0.17391304347826086,0.23482310992220173
Role of Cholinergic Signaling in Alzheimer's Disease,"Acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter secreted by cholinergic neurons, is involved in signal transduction related to memory and learning ability. Alzheimer's disease (AD), a progressive and commonly diagnosed neurodegenerative disease, is characterized by memory and cognitive decline and behavioral disorders. The pathogenesis of AD is complex and remains unclear, being affected by various factors. The cholinergic hypothesis is the earliest theory about the pathogenesis of AD. Cholinergic atrophy and cognitive decline are accelerated in age-related neurodegenerative diseases such as AD. In addition, abnormal central cholinergic changes can also induce abnormal phosphorylation of ttau protein, nerve cell inflammation, cell apoptosis, and other pathological phenomena, but the exact mechanism of action is still unclear. Due to the complex and unclear pathogenesis, effective methods to prevent and treat AD are unavailable, and research to explore novel therapeutic drugs is various and active in the world. This review summaries the role of cholinergic signaling and the correlation between the cholinergic signaling pathway with other risk factors in AD and provides the latest research about the efficient therapeutic drugs and treatment of AD.",35335180,PMC8949236,10.3390/molecules27061816,72,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",100964009,4.927,0.18787656724452972,0.9464882943143813,0.5217391304347826,1.287423599209594
"Pathogenesis, therapeutic strategies and biomarker development based on ""omics"" analysis related to microglia in Alzheimer's disease","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease and the most common cause of dementia. Among various pathophysiological aspects, microglia are considered to play important roles in the pathogenesis of AD. Genome wide association studies (GWAS) showed that the majority of AD risk genes are highly or exclusively expressed in microglia, underscoring the critical roles of microglia in AD pathogenesis. Recently, omics technologies have greatly advanced our knowledge of microglia biology in AD. Omics approaches, including genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics/lipidomics, present remarkable opportunities to delineate the underlying mechanisms, discover novel diagnostic biomarkers, monitor disease progression, and shape therapeutic strategies for diseases. In this review, we summarized research based on microglial ""omics"" analysis in AD, especially the recent research advances in the identification of AD-associated microglial subsets. This review reinforces the important role of microglia in AD and advances our understanding of the mechanism of microglia in AD pathogenesis. Moreover, we proposed the value of microglia-based omics in the development of therapeutic strategies and biomarkers for AD.",36058959,PMC9441025,10.1186/s12974-022-02580-1,8,Journal of neuroinflammation,101222974,9.587,0.18772760033607483,0.4882943143812709,0.8929765886287625,2.127695423077899
Genetic insights into immune mechanisms of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease,"Microglia, the macrophages of the brain, are vital for brain homeostasis and have been implicated in a broad range of brain disorders. Neuroinflammation has gained traction as a possible therapeutic target for neurodegeneration, however, the precise function of microglia in specific neurodegenerative disorders is an ongoing area of research. Genetic studies offer valuable insights into understanding causality, rather than merely observing a correlation. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified many genetic loci that are linked to susceptibility to neurodegenerative disorders. (Post)-GWAS studies have determined that microglia likely play an important role in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). The process of understanding how individual GWAS risk loci affect microglia function and mediate susceptibility is complex. A rapidly growing number of publications with genomic datasets and computational tools have formulated new hypotheses that guide the biological interpretation of AD and PD genetic risk. In this review, we discuss the key concepts and challenges in the post-GWAS interpretation of AD and PD GWAS risk alleles. Post-GWAS challenges include the identification of target cell (sub)type(s), causal variants, and target genes. Crucially, the prediction of GWAS-identified disease-risk cell types, variants and genes require validation and functional testing to understand the biological consequences within the pathology of the disorders. Many AD and PD risk genes are highly pleiotropic and perform multiple important functions that might not be equally relevant for the mechanisms by which GWAS risk alleles exert their effect(s). Ultimately, many GWAS risk alleles exert their effect by changing microglia function, thereby altering the pathophysiology of these disorders, and hence, we believe that modelling this context is crucial for a deepened understanding of these disorders.",37359515,PMC10285485,10.3389/fimmu.2023.1168539,3,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,8.786,0.18772760033607483,0.3277591973244147,0.8729096989966555,1.9353883996665278
The neuropathological diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease,"Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease most often associated with memory deficits and cognitive decline, although less common clinical presentations are increasingly recognized. The cardinal pathological features of the disease have been known for more than one hundred years, and today the presence of these amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are still required for a pathological diagnosis. Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia globally. There remain no effective treatment options for the great majority of patients, and the primary causes of the disease are unknown except in a small number of familial cases driven by genetic mutations. Confounding efforts to develop effective diagnostic tools and disease-modifying therapies is the realization that Alzheimer's disease is a mixed proteinopathy (amyloid and tau) frequently associated with other age-related processes such as cerebrovascular disease and Lewy body disease. Defining the relationships between and interdependence of various co-pathologies remains an active area of investigation. This review outlines etiologically-linked pathologic features of Alzheimer's disease, as well as those that are inevitable findings of uncertain significance, such as granulovacuolar degeneration and Hirano bodies. Other disease processes that are frequent, but not inevitable, are also discussed, including pathologic processes that can clinically mimic Alzheimer's disease. These include cerebrovascular disease, Lewy body disease, TDP-43 proteinopathies and argyrophilic grain disease. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of Alzheimer's disease pathology, its defining pathologic substrates and the related pathologies that can affect diagnosis and treatment.",31375134,PMC6679484,10.1186/s13024-019-0333-5,927,Molecular neurodegeneration,101266600,18.879,0.1875787377357483,0.9966555183946488,0.9866220735785953,4.087678346320379
Aplysia Neurons as a Model of Alzheimer's Disease: Shared Genes and Differential Expression,"Although Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia in the United States, development of therapeutics has proven difficult. Invertebrate alternatives to current mammalian AD models have been successfully employed to study the etiology of the molecular hallmarks of AD. The marine snail Aplysia californica offers a unique and underutilized system in which to study the physiological, behavioral, and molecular impacts of AD. Mapping of the Aplysia proteome to humans and cross-referencing with two databases of genes of interest in AD research identified 898 potential orthologs of interest in Aplysia. Included among these orthologs were alpha, beta and gamma secretases, amyloid-beta, and tau. Comparison of age-associated differential expression in Aplysia sensory neurons with that of late-onset AD in the frontal lobe identified 59 ortholog with concordant differential expression across data sets. The 21 concordantly upregulated genes suggested increased cellular stress and protein dyshomeostasis. The 47 concordantly downregulated genes included important components of diverse neuronal processes, including energy metabolism, mitochondrial homeostasis, synaptic signaling, Ca++regulation, and cellular cargo transport. Compromised functions in these processes are known hallmarks of both human aging and AD, the ramifications of which are suggested to underpin cognitive declines in aging and neurodegenerative disease.",34664226,PMC8840921,10.1007/s12031-021-01918-3,2,Journal of molecular neuroscience : MN,9002991,2.866,0.18742996454238892,0.27424749163879597,0.2608695652173913,0.7405074770531925
Current understanding of the Alzheimer's disease-associated microbiome and therapeutic strategies,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a fatal progressive neurodegenerative disease. Despite tremendous research efforts to understand this complex disease, the exact pathophysiology of the disease is not completely clear. Recently, anti-AÎ² antibodies have been shown to remove amyloid from the brain and slow the clinical progression of mild dementia by ~30%. However, exploring alternative strategies is crucial to understanding and developing more effective therapeutic interventions. In recent years, the microbiota-gut-brain axis has received significant attention in the AD field. Numerous studies have suggested that alterations in the gut microbiota composition are associated with the progression of AD, and several underlying mechanisms have been proposed. However, studies in this area are still in their infancy, and many aspects of this field are just beginning to be explored and understood. Gaining a deeper understanding of the intricate interactions and signaling pathways involved in the microbiota-AD interaction is crucial for optimizing therapeutic strategies targeting gut microbiota to positively impact AD. In this review, we aim to summarize the current understanding of the microbiota-gut-brain axis in AD. We will discuss the existing evidence regarding the role of gut microbiota in AD pathogenesis, suggested underlying mechanisms, biological factors influencing the microbiome-gut-brain axis in AD, and remaining questions in the field. Last, we will discuss potential therapeutic approaches to recondition the community of gut microbiota to alleviate disease progression. An ongoing exploration of the gut-brain axis and the development of microbiota-based therapies hold the potential for advancing AD management in the future.",38172602,PMC10834451,10.1038/s12276-023-01146-2,1,Experimental & molecular medicine,9607880,12.153,0.1872812658548355,0.1939799331103679,0.9364548494983278,2.581764746134975
Acute versus Chronic Exposures to Inhaled Particulate Matter and Neurocognitive Dysfunction: Pathways to Alzheimer's Disease or a Related Dementia,"An estimated 92% of the world's population live in regions where people are regularly exposed to high levels of anthropogenic air pollution. Historically, research on the effects of air pollution have focused extensively on cardiovascular and pulmonary health. However, emerging evidence from animal and human studies has suggested that chronic exposures to air pollution detrimentally change the functioning of the central nervous system with the result being proteinopathy, neurocognitive impairment, and neurodegenerative disease. Case analyses of aging World Trade Center responders suggests that a single severe exposure may also induce a neuropathologic response. The goal of this report was to explore the neuroscientific support for the hypothesis that inhaled particulate matter might cause an Alzheimer's-like neurodegenerative disease, in order to consider proposed mechanisms and latency periods linking inhaled particulate matter and neurodegeneration, and to propose new directions in this line of research.",33074229,PMC7704925,10.3233/JAD-200679,10,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,4.16,0.18683576583862305,0.5384615384615384,0.4280936454849498,1.0517937671954816
Blood-Brain Barrier and Neurovascular Unit In Vitro Models for Studying Mitochondria-Driven Molecular Mechanisms of Neurodegeneration,"Pathophysiology of chronic neurodegeneration is mainly based on complex mechanisms related to aberrant signal transduction, excitation/inhibition imbalance, excitotoxicity, synaptic dysfunction, oxidative stress, proteotoxicity and protein misfolding, local insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction, excessive cell death, development of glia-supported neuroinflammation, and failure of neurogenesis. These mechanisms tightly associate with dramatic alterations in the structure and activity of the neurovascular unit (NVU) and the blood-brain barrier (BBB). NVU is an ensemble of brain cells (brain microvessel endothelial cells (BMECs), astrocytes, pericytes, neurons, and microglia) serving for the adjustment of cell-to-cell interactions, metabolic coupling, local microcirculation, and neuronal excitability to the actual needs of the brain. The part of the NVU known as a BBB controls selective access of endogenous and exogenous molecules to the brain tissue and efflux of metabolites to the blood, thereby providing maintenance of brain chemical homeostasis critical for efficient signal transduction and brain plasticity. In Alzheimer's disease, mitochondria are the target organelles for amyloid-induced neurodegeneration and alterations in NVU metabolic coupling or BBB breakdown. In this review we discuss understandings on mitochondria-driven NVU and BBB dysfunction, and how it might be studied in current and prospective NVU/BBB in vitro models for finding new approaches for the efficient pharmacotherapy of Alzheimer's disease.",33925080,PMC8125678,10.3390/ijms22094661,17,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,6.208,0.18624301254749298,0.6622073578595318,0.6989966555183946,1.485787279100402
From chronic cerebral hypoperfusion to Alzheimer-like brain pathology and neurodegeneration,"Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) is a common consequence of various cerebral vascular disorders and hemodynamic and blood changes. Recent studies have revealed an important role of CCH in neurodegeneration and dementia, including vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD). This article reviews the recent advances in understanding CCH-induced neurodegeneration and AD-related brain pathology and cognitive impairment. We discuss the causes and assessment of CCH, the possible mechanisms by which CCH promotes Alzheimer-like pathology and neurodegeneration, and animal models of CCH. It appears that CCH promotes neurodegeneration and AD through multiple mechanisms, including induction of oxidative stress, AÎ² accumulation and aggravation, tau hyperphosphorylation, synaptic dysfunction, neuronal loss, white matter lesion, and neuroinflammation. Better understanding of the mechanisms of CCH will help develop therapeutic strategies for preventing and treating neurodegeneration, including sporadic AD and vascular dementia, caused by CCH.",25352419,,10.1007/s10571-014-0127-9,64,Cellular and molecular neurobiology,8200709,4.231,0.18609505891799927,0.9331103678929766,0.4414715719063545,1.1444791089293949
Selective vulnerability in neurodegeneration: insights from clinical variants of Alzheimer's disease,"Selective vulnerability in the nervous system refers to the fact that subpopulations of neurons in different brain systems may be more or less prone to abnormal function or death in response to specific types of pathological states or injury. The concept has been used extensively as a potential way of explaining differences in degeneration patterns and the clinical presentation of different neurodegenerative diseases. Yet the increasing complexity of molecular histopathology at the cellular level in neurodegenerative disorders frequently appears at odds with phenotyping based on clinically-directed, macroscopic regional brain involvement. While cross-disease comparisons can provide insights into the differential vulnerability of networks and neuronal populations, we focus here on what is known about selective vulnerability-related factors that might explain the differential phenotypic expressions of the same disease-in this case, typical and atypical forms of Alzheimer's disease. Whereas considerable progress has been made in this area, much is yet to be elucidated; further studies comparing different phenotypic variants aimed at identifying both vulnerability and resilience factors may provide valuable insights into disease pathogenesis, and suggest novel targets for therapy.",26746185,,10.1136/jnnp-2015-311321,41,"Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry",2985191R,0.0,0.1856517344713211,0.862876254180602,0.17725752508361203,0.28396629151891306
Friend or enemy? Review of 17Î²-HSD10 and its role in human health or disease,"17Î²-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17Î²-HSD10) is a multifunctional human enzyme with important roles both as a structural component and also as a catalyst of many metabolic pathways. This mitochondrial enzyme has important functions in the metabolism, development and aging of the neural system, where it is involved in the homeostasis of neurosteroids, especially in regard to estradiol, changes in which make it an essential part of neurodegenerative pathology. These roles therefore, indicate that 17Î²-HSD10 may be a possible druggable target for neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD), and in hormone-dependent cancer. The objective of this review was to provide a summary about physiological functions and pathological roles of 17Î²-HSD10 and the modulators of its activity.",32306391,,10.1111/jnc.15027,14,Journal of neurochemistry,2985190R,0.0,0.18550412356853485,0.6354515050167224,0.1806020066889632,0.23839277514446539
Role of hippocampal subfields in neurodegenerative disease progression analyzed with a multi-scale attention-based network,"Background and objective:Both Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are progressive neurodegenerative diseases. Early identification is very important for the prevention and intervention of their progress. Hippocampus plays a crucial role in cognition, in which there are correlations between atrophy of Hippocampal subfields and cognitive impairment in neurodegenerative diseases. Exploring biomarkers in the prediction of early cognitive impairment in AD and PD is significant for understanding the progress of neurodegenerative diseases.Methods:A multi-scale attention-based deep learning method is proposed to perform computer-aided diagnosis for neurodegenerative disease based on Hippocampal subfields. First, the two dimensional (2D) Hippocampal Mapping Image (HMI) is constructed and used as input of three branches of the following network. Second, the multi-scale module and attention module are integrated into the 2D residual network to improve the diversity of the extracted features and capture significance of various voxels for classification. Finally, the role of Hippocampal subfields in the progression of different neurodegenerative diseases is analyzed using the proposed method.Results:Classification experiments between normal control (NC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), AD, PD with normal cognition (PD-NC) and PD with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) are carried out using the proposed method. Experimental results show that subfields subiculum, presubiculum, CA1, and molecular layer are strongly correlated with cognitive impairment in AD and MCI, subfields GC-DG and fimbria are sensitive in detecting early stage of cognitive impairment in MCI, subfields CA3, CA4, GC-DG, and CA1 show significant atrophy in PD. For exploring the role of Hippocampal subfields in PD cognitive impairment, we find that left parasubiculum, left HATA and left presubiculum could be important biomarkers for predicting conversion from PD-NC to PD-MCI.Conclusion:The proposed multi-scale attention-based network can effectively discover the correlation between subfields and neurodegenerative diseases. Experimental results are consistent with previous clinical studies, which will be useful for further exploring the role of Hippocampal subfields in neurodegenerative disease progression.",36948139,PMC10034639,10.1016/j.nicl.2023.103370,3,NeuroImage.

Modification of the gut microbiome to combat neurodegeneration,"The gut microbiome was extensively researched for its biological variety and its potential role in propagating diseases outside of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Recently, a lot of effort was focused on comprehending the gut-brain axis and the bizarre communication between the GI system and the nervous system. Ample amount of studies being carried out also revealed the involvement of the gut microbiome in enhancing the degree of many neurological disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases. It was widely observed that there were distinct microbiome profiles and dysbiosis within patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and multiple sclerosis. Various approaches to re-establish the balance of the gut microbiome, from antibiotic therapy, fecal microbiota transplant, or ingestion of psychobiotics, are discussed within this review within the specific context of combating neurodegenerative diseases. Present studies and clinical trials indicate that although there is an immense potential of gut microbiome modification to be preventive or therapeutic, there are still many intercalated components of the gut-brain axis at play and thus, more research needs to be carried out to delineate microbiome factors that may potentially alleviate symptoms of neurodegeneration.",31095511,,10.1515/revneuro-2019-0005,19,Reviews in the neurosciences,8711016,4.703,0.1846204549074173,0.6956521739130435,0.4983277591973244,1.1905027077270591
"Cerebral hypoperfusion and glucose hypometabolism: Key pathophysiological modulators promote neurodegeneration, cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer's disease","Aging, hypertension, diabetes, hypoxia/obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), obesity, vitamin B12/folate deficiency, depression, and traumatic brain injury synergistically promote diverse pathological mechanisms including cerebral hypoperfusion and glucose hypometabolism. These risk factors trigger neuroinflammation and oxidative-nitrosative stress that in turn decrease nitric oxide and enhance endothelin, Amyloid-Î² deposition, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, and blood-brain barrier disruption. Proinflammatory cytokines, endothelin-1, and oxidative-nitrosative stress trigger several pathological feedforward and feedback loops. These upstream factors persist in the brain for decades, upregulating amyloid and tau, before the cognitive decline. These cascades lead to neuronal Ca2+increase, neurodegeneration, cognitive/memory decline, and Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, strategies are available to attenuate cerebral hypoperfusion and glucose hypometabolism and ameliorate cognitive decline. AD is the leading cause of dementia among the elderly. There is significant evidence that pathways involving inflammation and oxidative-nitrosative stress (ONS) play a key pathophysiological role in promoting cognitive dysfunction. Aging and several comorbid conditions mentioned above promote diverse pathologies. These include inflammation, ONS, hypoperfusion, and hypometabolism in the brain. In AD, chronic cerebral hypoperfusion and glucose hypometabolism precede decades before the cognitive decline. These comorbid disease conditions may share and synergistically activate these pathophysiological pathways. Inflammation upregulates cerebrovascular pathology through proinflammatory cytokines, endothelin-1, and nitric oxide (NO). Inflammation-triggered ONS promotes long-term damage involving fatty acids, proteins, DNA, and mitochondria; these amplify and perpetuate several feedforward and feedback pathological loops. The latter includes dysfunctional energy metabolism (compromised mitochondrial ATP production), amyloid-Î² generation, endothelial dysfunction, and blood-brain-barrier disruption. These lead to decreased cerebral blood flow and chronic cerebral hypoperfusion- that would modulate metabolic dysfunction and neurodegeneration. In essence, hypoperfusion deprives the brain from its two paramount trophic substances, viz., oxygen and nutrients. Consequently, the brain suffers from synaptic dysfunction and neuronal degeneration/loss, leading to both gray and white matter atrophy, cognitive dysfunction, and AD. This Review underscores the importance of treating the above-mentioned comorbid disease conditions to attenuate inflammation and ONS and ameliorate decreased cerebral blood flow and hypometabolism. Additionally, several strategies are described here to control chronic hypoperfusion of the brain and enhance cognition.

"Neurodegenerative Disorders of Alzheimer, Parkinsonism, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Multiple Sclerosis: An Early Diagnostic Approach for Precision Treatment","Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) are characterised by progressive dysfunction of synapses, neurons, glial cells and their networks. Neurodegenerative diseases can be classified according to primary clinical features (e.g., dementia, parkinsonism, or motor neuron disease), anatomic distribution of neurodegeneration (e.g., frontotemporal degenerations, extrapyramidal disorders, or spinocerebellar degenerations), or principal molecular abnormalities. The most common neurodegenerative disorders are amyloidosis, tauopathies, a-synucleinopathy, and TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) proteopathy. The protein abnormalities in these disorders have abnormal conformational properties along with altered cellular mechanisms, and they exhibit motor deficit, mitochondrial malfunction, dysfunctions in autophagic-lysosomal pathways, synaptic toxicity, and more emerging mechanisms such as the roles of stress granule pathways and liquid-phase transitions. Finally, for each ND, microglial cells have been reported to be implicated in neurodegeneration, in particular, because the microglial responses can shift from neuroprotective to a deleterious role. Growing experimental evidence suggests that abnormal protein conformers act as seed material for oligomerization, spreading from cell to cell through anatomically connected neuronal pathways, which may in part explain the specific anatomical patterns observed in brain autopsy sample. In this review, we mention the human pathology of select neurodegenerative disorders, focusing on how neurodegenerative disorders (i.e., Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and multiple sclerosis) represent a great healthcare problem worldwide and are becoming prevalent because of the increasing aged population. Despite many studies have focused on their etiopathology, the exact cause of these diseases is still largely unknown and until now with the only available option of symptomatic treatments. In this review, we aim to report the systematic and clinically correlated potential biomarker candidates. Although future studies are necessary for their use in early detection and progression in humans affected by NDs, the promising results obtained by several groups leads us to this idea that biomarkers could be used to design a potential therapeutic approach and preclinical clinical trials for the treatments of NDs.",34719771,,10.1007/s11011-021-00800-w,13,Metabolic brain disease,8610370,3.655,0.18432661890983582,0.6120401337792643,0.32441471571906355,0.9640039981017543
Exosome Biomarkers Revolutionize Preclinical Diagnosis of Neurodegenerative Diseases and Assessment of Treatment Responses in Clinical Trials,"Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases have long preclinical phases with active and progressively irreversible pathology. Therefore, biomarkers are essential for identifying patients early in the course of these diseases, when they may benefit the most from disease-modifying interventions. A limitation of biomarkers measured in the soluble phase of blood is their tenuous link to brain pathology. A new approach to biomarker discovery that addresses this limitation is deriving extracellular vesicles (EVs) enriched for neuronal and astrocytic origin from peripheral blood. EVs are membranous particles (subdivided into smaller exosomes and larger microvesicles) that are shed by all cells and found in all biofluids. Neuronal and astrocytic EVs have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases. Given their origin, neuronal and astrocytic enriched EVs harvested from blood can be used to interrogate brain pathologic processes previously inaccessible in vivo. In a long series of case control studies based on these EV subpopulations, we have identified candidate protein biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases. In GeNeDis 2018, an update of these studies and results from a validation study of these biomarkers in preclinical Alzheimer's disease will be presented. In addition, we will present results from studies demonstrating EV biomarker responses to experimental interventions. EV-based biomarkers are a valuable new tool that will enable researchers to test hypotheses in proof of concept studies with carefully selected participants at the preclinical phase, spearheading therapeutic discovery in neurodegenerative disease.",32468469,,10.1007/978-3-030-32633-3_19,14,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,0.0,0.18403315544128418,0.6387959866220736,0.18394648829431437,0.23817909058918524
"Unraveling the Genetic Landscape of Neurological Disorders: Insights into Pathogenesis, Techniques for Variant Identification, and Therapeutic Approaches","Genetic abnormalities play a crucial role in the development of neurodegenerative disorders (NDDs). Genetic exploration has indeed contributed to unraveling the molecular complexities responsible for the etiology and progression of various NDDs. The intricate nature of rare and common variants in NDDs contributes to a limited understanding of the genetic risk factors associated with them. Advancements in next-generation sequencing have made whole-genome sequencing and whole-exome sequencing possible, allowing the identification of rare variants with substantial effects, and improving the understanding of both Mendelian and complex neurological conditions. The resurgence of gene therapy holds the promise of targeting the etiology of diseases and ensuring a sustained correction. This approach is particularly enticing for neurodegenerative diseases, where traditional pharmacological methods have fallen short. In the context of our exploration of the genetic epidemiology of the three most prevalent NDDs-amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease, our primary goal is to underscore the progress made in the development of next-generation sequencing. This progress aims to enhance our understanding of the disease mechanisms and explore gene-based therapies for NDDs. Throughout this review, we focus on genetic variations, methodologies for their identification, the associated pathophysiology, and the promising potential of gene therapy. Ultimately, our objective is to provide a comprehensive and forward-looking perspective on the emerging research arena of NDDs.",38396996,PMC10889342,10.3390/ijms25042320,1,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,6.208,0.18315489590168,0.19732441471571907,0.7023411371237458,1.3909578204841517
Multifactorial Causation of Alzheimer's Disease Due to COVID-19,"There are several implications of the surge in the incidence of pandemics and epidemics in the last decades. COVID-19 being the most remarkable one, showed the vulnerability of patients with neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD). This review studies the pathological interlinks and triggering factors between the two illnesses and proposes a multifactorial pathway of AD causation due to COVID-19. The article evaluates and describes all the postulated hypotheses which explain the etiology and possible pathogenesis of the disease in four domains: Inflammation & Neurobiochemical interactions, Oxidative Stress, Genetic Factors, and Social Isolation. We believe that a probable hypothesis of an underlying cause of AD after COVID-19 infection could be the interplay of all these factors.",38007649,,10.3233/JAD-230396,0,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,4.16,0.18315489590168,0.11371237458193979,0.431438127090301,0.964635412457396
The Therapeutic Potential of Mitochondria Transplantation Therapy in Neurodegenerative and Neurovascular Disorders,"Neurodegenerative and neurovascular disorders affect millions of people worldwide and account for a large and increasing health burden on the general population. Thus, there is a critical need to identify potential disease-modifying treatments that can prevent or slow the disease progression. Mitochondria are highly dynamic organelles and play an important role in energy metabolism and redox homeostasis, and mitochondrial dysfunction threatens cell homeostasis, perturbs energy production, and ultimately leads to cell death and diseases. Impaired mitochondrial function has been linked to the pathogenesis of several human neurological disorders. Given the significant contribution of mitochondrial dysfunction in neurological disorders, there has been considerable interest in developing therapies that can attenuate mitochondrial abnormalities and proffer neuroprotective effects. Unfortunately, therapies that target specific components of mitochondria or oxidative stress pathways have exhibited limited translatability. To this end, mitochondrial transplantation therapy (MTT) presents a new paradigm of therapeutic intervention, which involves the supplementation of healthy mitochondria to replace the damaged mitochondria for the treatment of neurological disorders. Prior studies demonstrated that the supplementation of healthy donor mitochondria to damaged neurons promotes neuronal viability, activity, and neurite growth and has been shown to provide benefits for neural and extra-neural diseases. In this review, we discuss the significance of mitochondria and summarize an overview of the recent advances and development of MTT in neurodegenerative and neurovascular disorders, particularly Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and stroke. The significance of MTT is emerging as they meet a critical need to develop a diseasemodifying intervention for neurodegenerative and neurovascular disorders.",36089791,PMC10286589,10.2174/1570159X05666220908100545,2,Current neuropharmacology,101157239,7.708,0.18257121741771698,0.27759197324414714,0.842809364548495,1.7066611250994597
"Brain aging, Alzheimer's disease, and the role of stem cells in primate comparative studies","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that is ultimately fatal. Currently, millions of Americans are living with AD, and this number is predicted to grow with increases in the aging population. Interestingly, despite the prevalence of AD in human populations, the full AD phenotype has not been observed in any nonhuman primate (NHP) species, and it has been suggested that NHPs are immune to neurodegenerative diseases such as AD. Here, we review the typical age-related changes and pathologies in humans along with the neuropathologic changes associated with AD, and we place this information in the context of the comparative neuropathology of NHPs. We further propose the use of induced pluripotent stem cell technology as a way of addressing initial molecular processes and changes that occur in neurons and glia (in both humans and NHPs) when exposed to AD-inducing pathology prior to cell death.",35929189,,10.1002/cne.25394,2,The Journal of comparative neurology,0406041,0.0,0.18242552876472473,0.2809364548494983,0.18729096989966554,0.1656426082287345
The Gut Microbiota and Alzheimer's Disease,"The gut microbiota comprises a complex community of microorganism species that resides in our gastrointestinal ecosystem and whose alterations influence not only various gut disorders but also central nervous system disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD, the most common form of dementia, is a neurodegenerative disorder associated with impaired cognition and cerebral accumulation of amyloid-Î² peptides (AÎ²). Most notably, the microbiota-gut-brain axis is a bidirectional communication system that is not fully understood, but includes neural, immune, endocrine, and metabolic pathways. Studies in germ-free animals and in animals exposed to pathogenic microbial infections, antibiotics, probiotics, or fecal microbiota transplantation suggest a role for the gut microbiota in host cognition or AD-related pathogenesis. The increased permeability of the gut and blood-brain barrier induced by microbiota dysbiosis may mediate or affect AD pathogenesis and other neurodegenerative disorders, especially those associated with aging. In addition, bacteria populating the gut microbiota can secrete large amounts of amyloids and lipopolysaccharides, which might contribute to the modulation of signaling pathways and the production of proinflammatory cytokines associated with the pathogenesis of AD. Moreover, imbalances in the gut microbiota can induce inflammation that is associated with the pathogenesis of obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and AD. The purpose of this review is to summarize and discuss the current findings that may elucidate the role of the gut microbiota in the development of AD. Understanding the underlying mechanisms may provide new insights into novel therapeutic strategies for AD.",28372330,,10.3233/JAD-161141,322,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,4.16,0.18227991461753845,0.9832775919732442,0.43478260869565216,1.1380234671651719
Role of Autophagy and Mitophagy in Neurodegenerative Disorders,"Autophagy is a self-destructive cellular process that removes essential metabolites and waste from inside the cell to maintain cellular health. Mitophagy is the process by which autophagy causes disruption inside mitochondria and the total removal of damaged or stressed mitochondria, hence enhancing cellular health. The mitochondria are the powerhouses of the cell, performing essential functions such as ATP (adenosine triphosphate) generation, metabolism, Ca2+buffering, and signal transduction. Many different mechanisms, including endosomal and autophagosomal transport, bring these substrates to lysosomes for processing. Autophagy and endocytic processes each have distinct compartments, and they interact dynamically with one another to complete digestion. Since mitophagy is essential for maintaining cellular health and using genetics, cell biology, and proteomics techniques, it is necessary to understand its beginning, particularly in ubiquitin and receptor-dependent signalling in injured mitochondria. Despite their similar symptoms and emerging genetic foundations, Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) have all been linked to abnormalities in autophagy and endolysosomal pathways associated with neuronal dysfunction. Mitophagy is responsible for normal mitochondrial turnover and, under certain physiological or pathological situations, may drive the elimination of faulty mitochondria. Due to their high energy requirements and post-mitotic origin, neurons are especially susceptible to autophagic and mitochondrial malfunction. This article focused on the importance of autophagy and mitophagy in neurodegenerative illnesses and how they might be used to create novel therapeutic approaches for treating a wide range of neurological disorders.",36974405,,10.2174/1871527322666230327092855,1,CNS & neurological disorders drug targets,101269155,2.824,0.18227991461753845,0.20066889632107024,0.2508361204013378,0.714301728034737
Neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's Disease: Current Progress in Molecular Signaling and Therapeutics,"Alzheimer's disease, a neurodegenerative disease with amyloid beta accumulation as a major hallmark, has become a dire global health concern as there is a lack of clear understanding of the causative agent. It is a major cause of dementia which is increasing exponentially with age. Alzheimer's disease is marked by tau hyperphosphorylation and amyloid beta accumulation that robs people of their memories. Amyloid beta deposition initiated a spectrum of microglia-activated neuroinflammation, and microglia and astrocyte activation elicited expressions of various inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Neuroinflammation is one of the cardinal features of Alzheimer's disease. Pro-inflammatory cytokine signaling plays multifarious roles in neurodegeneration and neuroprotection. Induction of proinflammatory signaling leads to discharge of immune mediators which affect functions of neurons and cause cell death. Sluggish anti-inflammatory system also contributes to neuroinflammation. Numerous pathways like NFÎºB, p38 MAPK, Akt/mTOR, caspase, nitric oxide, and COX are involved in triggering brain immune cells like astrocytes and microglia to secrete inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor, interleukins, and chemokines and participate in Alzheimer's disease pathology. PPAR-Î³ agonists tend to boost the phagocytosis of amyloid beta and decrease the inflammatory cytokine IL-1Î². Recent findings suggest the cross-link between gut microbiota and neuroinflammation contributing in AD which has been explained in this study. The role of cellular, molecular pathways and involvement of inflammatory mediators in neuroinflammation has also been described; targeting them could be a potential therapeutic strategy for treatment of AD.",35986874,,10.1007/s10753-022-01721-1,46,Inflammation,7600105,4.657,0.18198898434638977,0.8929765886287625,0.48494983277591974,1.2191887083335864
Functional Connectivity in Neurodegenerative Disorders: Alzheimer's Disease and Frontotemporal Dementia,"Neurodegenerative disorders are a growing cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Onset is typically insidious and clinical symptoms of behavioral change, memory loss, or cognitive dysfunction may not be evident early in the disease process. Efforts have been made to discover biomarkers that allow for earlier diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders, to initiate treatment that may slow the course of clinical deterioration. Neuronal dysfunction occurs earlier than clinical symptoms manifest. Thus, assessment of neuronal function using functional brain imaging has been examined as a potential biomarker. While most early studies used task-functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), with the more recent technique of resting-state fMRI, ""intrinsic"" relationships between brain regions or brain networks have been studied in greater detail in neurodegenerative disorders. In Alzheimer's disease, the most common neurodegenerative disorder, and frontotemporal dementia, another of the common dementias, specific brain networks may be particularly susceptible to dysfunction. In this review, we highlight the major findings of functional connectivity assessed by resting state fMRI in Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia.",31794504,,10.1097/RMR.0000000000000223,17,Topics in magnetic resonance imaging : TMRI,8913523,0.0,0.18169839680194855,0.6655518394648829,0.19063545150501673,0.24212940597414573
Proteomics of neurodegenerative diseases: analysis of human post-mortem brain,"Dementias are prevalent brain disorders in the aged population. Dementias pose major socio-medical burden, but currently there is no cure available. Novel proteomics approaches hold promise to identify alterations of the brain proteome that could provide clues on disease etiology, and identify candidate proteins to develop further as a biomarker. In this review, we focus on recent proteomics findings from brains affected with Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson Disease Dementia, Frontotemporal Dementia, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. These studies confirmed known cellular changes, and in addition identified novel proteins that may underlie distinct aspects of the diseases. This article is part of the special issue ""Proteomics"".",30289976,PMC6899881,10.1111/jnc.14603,25,Journal of neurochemistry,2985190R,0.0,0.18126320838928223,0.7558528428093646,0.1939799331103679,0.25992849359544223
Role of the Insulin-like Growth Factor System in Neurodegenerative Disease,"The insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system has paracrine and endocrine roles in the central nervous system. There is evidence that IGF signalling pathways have roles in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative disease. This review focusses on Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, the two most common neurodegenerative disorders that are increasing in prevalence globally in relation to the aging population and the increasing prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes. Rodent models used in the study of the molecular pathways involved in neurodegeneration are described. However, currently, no animal model fully replicates these diseases. Mice with triple mutations inAPP,PSENandMAPTshow promise as models for the testing of novel Alzheimer's therapies. While a causal relationship is not proven, the fact that age, obesity and T2D are risk factors in both strengthens the case for the involvement of the IGF system in these disorders. The IGF system is an attractive target for new approaches to management; however, there are gaps in our understanding that first need to be addressed. These include a focus beyond IGF-I on other members of the IGF system, including IGF-II, IGF-binding proteins and the type 2 IGF receptor.",38674097,PMC11049992,10.3390/ijms25084512,0,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,6.208,0.18111833930015564,0.11705685618729098,0.705685618729097,1.3736823748175515
Brain metabolism as a modulator of autophagy in neurodegeneration,"Emerging evidence that autophagy serves as a sweeper for toxic materials in the brain gives us new insight into the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases. Autophagy is important for maintaining cellular homeostasis associated with metabolism. Some neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer×³s and Parkinson×³s diseases are accompanied by altered metabolism and autophagy in the brain.

Cell models for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease: At the interface of biology and drug discovery,"Neurodegenerative diseases are severely debilitating conditions characterized primarily by progressive neuronal loss and impairment of the nervous system. Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases are the most common neurodegenerative disorders, and their impact is increasing as average life expectancy increases worldwide. Although the underlying mechanisms of both progressive diseases have been extensively studied, we still lack a comprehensive understanding of the molecular basis of both diseases. Current therapeutic options do not slow the progression of the diseases and only provide symptom relief. Cell models that resemble the characteristics of the disease in question are important in drug discovery projects because they provide information about the therapeutic benefits of drugs under development. Here, we review current in vitro cell models used to study the molecular basis of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease focusing on their potential for discovering of disease-modifying therapeutics to combat neurodegenerative diseases. We discuss phenotypic screening as an important approach for identifying novel therapeutic molecules. Advances in the development of cell-based assays for drug discovery are discussed, ranging from simple monoculture cell models to high-throughput three-dimensional cell models. Finally, we critically present the limitations of cell models and the caveats encountered in drug discovery to find effective treatment for neurodegenerative diseases.",36068783,,10.1016/j.biopha.2022.112924,12,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,8213295,7.419,0.18025091290473938,0.5852842809364549,0.7725752508361204,1.7090074039301346
The Exceptional Vulnerability of Humans to Alzheimer's Disease,"Like many humans, non-human primates deposit copious misfolded AÎ² protein in the brain as they age. Nevertheless, the complete behavioral and pathologic phenotype of Alzheimer's disease, including AÎ² plaques, neurofibrillary (tau) tangles, and dementia, has not yet been identified in a non-human species. Recent research suggests that the crucial link between AÎ² aggregation and tauopathy is somehow disengaged in aged monkeys. Understanding why Alzheimer's disease fails to develop in species that are biologically proximal to humans could disclose new therapeutic targets in the chain of events leading to neurodegeneration and dementia.",28483344,PMC5521004,10.1016/j.molmed.2017.04.001,45,Trends in molecular medicine,100966035,15.272,0.1792430430650711,0.8862876254180602,0.9565217391304348,3.339203350922655
Determinants of approved acetylcholinesterase inhibitor response outcomes in Alzheimer's disease: relevance for precision medicine in neurodegenerative diseases,"Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (ChEI) are the global standard of care for the symptomatic treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and show significant positive effects in neurodegenerative diseases with cognitive and behavioral symptoms. Although experimental and large-scale clinical evidence indicates the potential long-term efficacy of ChEI, primary outcomes are generally heterogeneous across outpatient clinics and regional healthcare systems. Sub-optimal dosing or slow tapering, heterogeneous guidelines about the timing for therapy initiation (prodromal versus dementia stages), healthcare providers' ambivalence to treatment, lack of disease awareness, delayed medical consultation, prescription of ChEI in non-AD cognitive disorders, contribute to the negative outcomes. We present an evidence-based overview of determinants, spanning genetic, molecular, and large-scale networks, involved in the response to ChEI in patients with AD and other neurodegenerative diseases. A comprehensive understanding of cerebral and retinal cholinergic system dysfunctions along with ChEI response predictors in AD is crucial since disease-modifying therapies will frequently be prescribed in combination with ChEI. Therapeutic algorithms tailored to genetic, biological, clinical (endo)phenotypes, and disease stages will help leverage inter-drug synergy and attain optimal combined response outcomes, in line with the precision medicine model.",36526257,,10.1016/j.arr.2022.101819,6,Ageing research reviews,101128963,11.788,0.1790994256734848,0.4214046822742475,0.9331103678929766,2.5493405918589405
ETHICAL AND GENETIC ASPECTS REGARDING PRESYMPTOMATIC TESTING FOR NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES,"Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's dementia, Huntington's chorea, Parkinson's disease or spinocerebellar ataxia, manifests into adulthood with an insidious onset, slowly of progressive symptoms. All of these diseases are characterized by presimptomatic stages that preceded with many years of clinical debut. In Parkinson's disease, more than half of the dopaminergic neurons of the black substance are lost before the advent of motor characteristic manifestations. In Huntington's chorea, the progressive neurodegenerative disease could be diagnose prenatal and presymptomatic by analyse of the number of CAG repeats in exon 1 of the huntingtin gene. A similar mechanism represented by expansion of trinucleotide repeats during hereditary transmission from parents to children was identified in fragile X syndrome, spinocerebellar ataxia, spinal muscular and bulbar atrophy, or myotonic dystrophy. Presymptomatic diagnosis in all these progressive diseases raise many ethical issues, due to the psychological impact that can cause the prediction of a disease for which there is currently no curative treatment. Therefore, a positive result can produce serious psychological trauma and major changes in the lifestyle of the individual, instead, a negative result can bring joy and tranquillity. But the problem arises if presymptomatic testing in these neurodegenerative diseases brings greater benefits compared to the possible psychological damage, which can add the risk of stigmatization or discrimination.",27125067,,,2,Revista medico-chirurgicala a Societatii de Medici si Naturalisti din Iasi,0413735,0.0,0.17895588278770447,0.2842809364548495,0.20066889632107024,0.1642297169635926
Glial Cells - The Key Elements of AlzheimerÂ´s Disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder with major clinical hallmarks of memory loss, dementia, and cognitive impairment. Besides the extensive neuron-oriented research, an increasing body of evidence suggests that glial cells, namely astrocytes, microglia, NG2 glia and oligodendrocytes, may play an important role in the pathogenesis of this disease. In the first part of this review, AD pathophysiology in humans is briefly described and compared with disease progression in routinely used animal models. The relevance of findings obtained in animal models of AD is also discussed with respect to AD pathology in humans. Further, this review summarizes recent findings regarding the role/participation of glial cells in pathogenesis of AD, focusing on changes in their morphology, functions, proteins and gene expression profiles. As for astrocytes and microglia, they are fundamental for the progression and outcome of AD either because they function as effector cells releasing cytokines that play a role in neuroprotection, or because they fail to fulfill their homeostatic functions, ultimately leaving neurons to face excitotoxicity and oxidative stress. Next, we turn our attention towards NG2 glia, a novel and distinct class of glial cells in the central nervous system (CNS), whose role in a variety of human CNS diseases has begun to emerge, and we also consider the participation of oligodendrocytes in the pathogenesis and progression of AD.

Feature Extraction and Identification of Alzheimer's Disease based on Latent Factor of Multi-Channel EEG,"Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disease in old age, early diagnosis will help to delay the progression of the disease. Presently, the features of brain functional diseases can be obtained with EEG analysis, but the relationship between characteristics of EEG and Alzheimer's disease has not been clearly clarified. In this work, we hypothesize that there exist default brain variables (latent factors) across subjects in disease processes, decoding latent factor from brain activity contributes to the study of cognitive impairment. To that end, this work proposes to extract characteristics of Alzheimer's disease by combing latent factors of EEG with variational auto-encoder to realize disease identification. Primarily, power spectrum characteristics is investigated and it is found that the dominant frequency of two groups is different. Further analysis reveals that latent factor distribution of Alzheimer's disease exists obvious differences with normal group in the theta frequency band. Moreover, the latent factors are projected onto the three-dimensional state space and the transient rotation of neural state is found, which shows the dynamic characteristics of latent factors. In addition, Takagi-Sugeno-Kang classifier is adopted and multiple latent factors are fed into Takagi-Sugeno-Kang classifier for decoding. Compared with linear classifier, Takagi-Sugeno-Kang fuzzy classifier has better performance in classification of energy feature from sub-frequency bands of latent factors. The accuracy of identification could up to 98.10% when the combination of energy features of four frequency bands is used as model input. Collectively, this work provides a feasible tool for identification of neurological dysfunction from the view of latent factors, especially contributing to the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.",34329166,,10.1109/TNSRE.2021.3101240,6,IEEE transactions on neural systems and rehabilitation engineering : a,101097023,4.528,0.17838266491889954,0.42474916387959866,0.4782608695652174,1.0975794317272594
"Links between COVID-19 and Parkinson's disease/Alzheimer's disease: reciprocal impacts, medical care strategies and underlying mechanisms","The impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on patients with neurodegenerative diseases and the specific neurological manifestations of COVID-19 have aroused great interest. However, there are still many issues of concern to be clarified. Therefore, we review the current literature on the complex relationship between COVID-19 and neurodegenerative diseases with an emphasis on Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). We summarize the impact of COVID-19 infection on symptom severity, disease progression, and mortality rate of PD and AD, and discuss whether COVID-19 infection could trigger PD and AD. In addition, the susceptibility to and the prognosis of COVID-19 in PD patients and AD patients are also included. In order to achieve better management of PD and AD patients, modifications of care strategies, specific drug therapies, and vaccines during the pandemic are also listed. At last, mechanisms underlying the link of COVID-19 with PD and AD are reviewed.",36717892,PMC9885419,10.1186/s40035-023-00337-1,6,Translational neurodegeneration,101591861,9.883,0.17766813933849335,0.4280936454849498,0.8963210702341137,2.168819612700086
"A life-course and multifactorial approach to Alzheimer's disease: Implications for research, clinical assessment and intervention practices","According to the dominant biomedical view, Alzheimer's disease (AD) has a precise, necessary and unifying neurobiological cause, which distinguishes it from other neurodegenerative diseases and normal ageing. However, different types of evidence specifically lead to questioning the foundations of this essentialist and category-based approach to AD. It seems more and more evident that AD represents a heterogeneous state, determined by multiple factors and mechanisms that interact and intervene throughout life. This other way of conceiving AD not only requires a change of research objectives, but also a profound modification of clinical assessment and intervention practices. It also appeals to follow the path of prevention.",27353414,,10.1177/1471301216657270,3,"Dementia (London, England)",101128698,2.624,0.17752550542354584,0.33444816053511706,0.23745819397993312,0.698204935361151
Don't forget astrocytes when targeting Alzheimer's disease,"Astrocytes are essential for CNS health, regulating homeostasis, metabolism, and synaptic transmission. In addition to these and many other physiological roles, the pathological impact of astrocytes (""reactive astrocytes"") in acute trauma and chronic disease like Alzheimer's disease (AD) is well established. Growing evidence supports a fundamental and active role of astrocytes in multiple neurodegenerative diseases. With a growing interest in normal astrocyte biology, and countless studies on changes in astrocyte function in the context of disease, it may be a surprise that no therapies exist incorporating astrocytes as key targets. Here, we examine unintentional effects of current AD therapies on astrocyte function and theorize how astrocytes may be intentionally targeted for more efficacious therapeutic outcomes. Given their integral role in normal neuronal functioning, incorporating astrocytes as key criteria for AD drug development can only lead to more effective therapies for the millions of AD sufferers worldwide.

Common therapeutic strategies for prion and Alzheimer's diseases,"A number of unexpected pathophysiological connections linking different neurodegenerative diseases have emerged over the past decade. An example is provided by prion and Alzheimer's diseases. Despite being distinct pathologies, these disorders share several neurotoxic mechanisms, including accumulation of misfolded protein isoforms, stress of the protein synthesis machinery, and activation of a neurotoxic signaling mediated by the cellular prion protein. Here, in addition to reviewing these mechanisms, we will discuss the potential therapeutic interventions for prion and Alzheimer's diseases that are arising from the comprehension of their common neurodegenerative pathways.",27279060,,10.1515/hsz-2016-0190,3,Biological chemistry,9700112,4.7,0.17652960121631622,0.3377926421404682,0.4882943143812709,1.1134762891578833
Influence of Commensal Microbiota on the Enteric Nervous System and Its Role in Neurodegenerative Diseases,"When thinking about neurodegenerative diseases, the first symptoms that come to mind are loss of memory and learning capabilities, which all resemble hallmarks of manifestation of such diseases in the central nervous system (CNS). However, the gut comprises the largest nervous system outside the CNS that is autonomously active and in close interplay with its microbiota. Therefore, the enteric nervous system (ENS) might serve as an indicator of degenerative pathomechanisms that also affect the CNS. On the other hand, it might offer an entry point for devastating influences from the microbial community or - conversely - for therapeutic approaches via gut commensals. Within the last years, the ENS and gut microbiota therefore have sparked the interest of researchers of CNS diseases and we here report on recent findings and open questions, especially with regard to Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases.",29742516,PMC6757170,10.1159/000488629,29,Journal of innate immunity,101469471,7.111,0.17652960121631622,0.7892976588628763,0.7525083612040134,1.6859772925023648
Lipid and Lipid Raft Alteration in Aging and Neurodegenerative Diseases: A Window for the Development of New Biomarkers,"Lipids in the brain are major components playing structural functions as well as physiological roles in nerve cells, such as neural communication, neurogenesis, synaptic transmission, signal transduction, membrane compartmentalization, and regulation of gene expression. Determination of brain lipid composition may provide not only essential information about normal brain functioning, but also about changes with aging and diseases. Indeed, deregulations of specific lipid classes and lipid homeostasis have been demonstrated in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Furthermore, recent studies have shown that membrane microdomains, named lipid rafts, may change their composition in correlation with neuronal impairment. Lipid rafts are key factors for signaling processes for cellular responses. Lipid alteration in these signaling platforms may correlate with abnormal protein distribution and aggregation, toxic cell signaling, and other neuropathological events related with these diseases. This review highlights the manner lipid changes in lipid rafts may participate in the modulation of neuropathological events related to AD and PD. Understanding and characterizing these changes may contribute to the development of novel and specific diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in routinely clinical practice.",31382686,PMC6696273,10.3390/ijms20153810,68,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,6.208,0.17624586820602417,0.939799331103679,0.7090301003344481,1.5353073871443503
The pathogenic effects of particulate matter on neurodegeneration: a review,"The increasing amount of particulate matter (PM) in the ambient air is a pressing public health issue globally. Epidemiological studies involving data from millions of patients or volunteers have associated PM with increased risk of dementia and Alzheimer's disease in the elderly and cognitive dysfunction and neurodegenerative pathology across all age groups, suggesting that PM may be a risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases. Neurodegenerative diseases affect an increasing population in this aging society, putting a heavy burden on economics and family. Therefore, understanding the mechanism by which PM contributes to neurodegeneration is essential to develop effective interventions. Evidence in human and animal studies suggested that PM induced neurodenegerative-like pathology including neurotoxicity, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and damage in blood-brain barrier and neurovascular units, which may contribute to the increased risk of neurodegeneration. Interestingly, antagonizing oxidative stress alleviated the neurotoxicity of PM, which may underlie the essential role of oxidative stress in PM's potential effect in neurodegeneration. This review summarized up-to-date epidemiological and experimental studies on the pathogenic role of PM in neurodegenerative diseases and discussed the possible underlying mechanisms.",35189880,PMC8862284,10.1186/s12929-022-00799-x,11,Journal of biomedical science,9421567,12.771,0.1761041283607483,0.5618729096989966,0.939799331103679,2.7722370589562484
Microglia in Alzheimer's disease: A target for immunotherapy,"Microglia are resident MÏs of the CNS that play pleiotropic functions in brain development and homeostasis.

"Investigating the Spatial Associations Between Amyloid-Î² Deposition, Grey Matter Volume, and Neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's Disease","Background:It has been proposed that amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) plays a causal role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) by triggering a series of pathologic events-possibly including neuroinflammation-which culminate in progressive brain atrophy. However, the interplay between the two pathological molecular events and how both are associated with neurodegeneration is still unclear.Objective:We aimed to estimate the spatial inter-relationship between neurodegeneration, neuroinflammation and AÎ² deposition in a cohort of 20 mild AD patients and 17 healthy controls (HC).Methods:We resorted to magnetic resonance imaging to measure cortical atrophy, using the radiotracer 11C-PK11195 PET to measure neuroinflammation levels and 11C-PiB PET to assess AÎ² levels. Between-group comparisons were computed to explore AD-related changes in the three types of markers. To examine the effects of each one of the molecular pathologic mechanisms on neurodegeneration we computed: 1) ANCOVAs with the anatomic data, controlling for radiotracer uptake differences between groups and 2) voxel-based multiple regression analysis between-modalities. In addition, associations in anatomically defined regions of interests were also investigated.Results:We found significant differences between AD and controls in the levels of atrophy, neuroinflammation, and AÎ² deposition. Associations between AÎ² aggregation and brain atrophy were detected in AD in a widely distributed pattern, whereas associations between microglia activation and structural measures of neurodegeneration were restricted to few anatomically regions.Conclusion:In summary, AÎ² deposition, as opposed to neuroinflammation, was more associated with cortical atrophy, suggesting a prominent role of AÎ² in neurodegeneration at a mild stage of the AD.",33523050,PMC8075404,10.3233/JAD-200840,6,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,4.16,0.17582091689109802,0.431438127090301,0.43812709030100333,1.023780175552719
"[Heparan sulphates, amyloidosis and neurodegeneration]","Introduction:A number of neurodegenerative disorders have been linked directly to the accumulation of amyloid fibres. These fibres are made up of proteins or peptides with altered structures and which join together in vivo in association with heparan sulphate-type polysaccharides.Aims:To examine the most recent concepts in the biology of heparan sulphates and their role in the aggregation of the peptide Abeta, of tau protein, of alpha-synuclein and of prions. The study also seeks to analyse their implications in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease and prion diseases.Development:In vitro, heparan sulphates have played an important role in the process of oligomerisation and fibrillation of amyloidogenic proteins or peptides, in the stabilisation of these bodies and their resistance to proteolysis, thereby participating in the formation of a wide range of amyloid fibres. Heparan sulphates have also been related to the internalisation of pro-amyloid fibres during the process of intercellular propagation (spreading), which is considered to be crucial in the development of proteinopathies, the best example of which is Alzheimer's disease.Conclusion:This study suggests that the fine structures of heparan sulphates, their localisation in cells and tissues, together with their local concentration, may regulate the amyloidosis processes. The advances made in the understanding of this area of glyconeurobiology will make it possible to improve the understanding of the cell and molecular mechanisms underlying the neurodegenerative process.",29130469,,,1,Revista de neurologia,7706841,1.235,0.17525558173656464,0.2040133779264214,0.21739130434782608,0.39295602462722307
[The role of steroid hormones in the neurodegenerative diseases],"An increasing number of elders in a general population and longer life expectancy have a negative outcome in the growth of dissemination of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs). The NDs like Alzheimerâs disease (AD), Parkinsonâs disease (PD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) show sex-dependent prevalence. It is considered that sex steroids could influence on the NDs occurrence. Epidemiological studies indicate that women suffer more frequently from AD, whereas men from PD and ALS. Research suggest neuroprotective effects of estrogens and confirm that factors reducing their level may have a contribution to a higher morbidity rate to NDs. Adverse effects of androgens on NDs have been noticed, however some data suggest their beneficial actions. Therefore, the understanding of the potential role of sex steroids and their receptors in the pathogenesis and course of NDs would contribute to broadening the knowledge of molecular mechanisms leading to NDs. Moreover effective prevention and treatment could be assessed in the future.",36649137,,10.18388/pb.2021_468,0,Postepy biochemii,0023525,0.0,0.1749734729528427,0.12040133779264214,0.2040133779264214,0.12906435133023406
A Promising Strategy to Treat Neurodegenerative Diseases by SIRT3 Activation,"SIRT3, the primary mitochondrial deacetylase, regulates the functions of mitochondrial proteins including metabolic enzymes and respiratory chain components. Although SIRT3's functions in peripheral tissues are well established, the significance of its downregulation in neurodegenerative diseases is beginning to emerge. SIRT3 plays a key role in brain energy metabolism and provides substrate flexibility to neurons. It also facilitates metabolic coupling between fuel substrate-producing tissues and fuel-consuming tissues. SIRT3 mediates the health benefits of lifestyle-based modifications such as calorie restriction and exercise. SIRT3 deficiency is associated with metabolic syndrome (MetS), a precondition for diseases including obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. The pure form of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is rare, and it has been reported to coexist with these diseases in aging populations. SIRT3 downregulation leads to mitochondrial dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and inflammation, potentially triggering factors of AD pathogenesis. Recent studies have also suggested that SIRT3 may act through multiple pathways to reduce plaque formation in the AD brain. In this review, we give an overview of SIRT3's roles in brain physiology and pathology and discuss several activators of SIRT3 that can be considered potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of dementia.",36675125,PMC9866791,10.3390/ijms24021615,1,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,6.208,0.17441026866436005,0.20735785953177258,0.7123745819397993,1.3877177331049706
Recent Advances in the Roles of MicroRNA and MicroRNA-Based Diagnosis in Neurodegenerative Diseases,"Neurodegenerative diseases manifest as progressive loss of neuronal structures and their myelin sheaths and lead to substantial morbidity and mortality, especially in the elderly. Despite extensive research, there are few effective treatment options for the diseases. MicroRNAs have been shown to be involved in the developmental processes of the central nervous system. Mounting evidence suggest they play an important role in the development of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. However, there are few reviews regarding the roles of miRNAs in neurodegenerative diseases. This review summarizes the recent developments in the roles of microRNAs in neurodegenerative diseases and presents the application of microRNA-based methods in the early diagnosis of these diseases.",36551041,PMC9776063,10.3390/bios12121074,2,Biosensors,101609191,5.743,0.17426970601081848,0.28762541806020064,0.5886287625418061,1.3106869072185314
Mitochondrial abnormalities in Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease: can mitochondria be targeted therapeutically?,"Mitochondrial abnormalities have been identified as a central mechanism in multiple neurodegenerative diseases and, therefore, the mitochondria have been explored as a therapeutic target. This review will focus on the evidence for mitochondrial abnormalities in the two most common neurodegenerative diseases, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. In addition, we discuss the main strategies which have been explored in these diseases to target the mitochondria for therapeutic purposes, focusing on mitochondrially targeted antioxidants, peptides, modulators of mitochondrial dynamics and phenotypic screening outcomes.",30026371,,10.1042/BST20170501,82,Biochemical Society transactions,7506897,4.919,0.17370831966400146,0.9498327759197325,0.5183946488294314,1.2779915469823473
Integrated Bioinformatics Analysis to Identify Alternative Therapeutic Targets for Alzheimer's Disease: Insights from a Synaptic Machinery Perspective,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common type of dementia, is a serious neurodegenerative disease that has no cure yet, but whose symptoms can be alleviated with available medications. Therefore, early and accurate diagnosis of the disease and elucidation of the molecular mechanisms involved in the progression of pathogenesis are critically important. This study aimed to identify dysregulated miRNAs and their target mRNAs through the integrated analysis of miRNA and mRNA expression profiling in AD patients versus unaffected controls. Expression profiles in postmortem brain samples from AD patients and healthy individuals were extracted from the Gene Expression Omnibus database and were analyzed using bioinformatics approaches to identify gene ontologies, pathways, and networks. Finally, the module analysis of the PPI network and hub gene selection was carried out. A total of five differentially expressed miRNAs were extracted from the miRNA dataset, and 4312 differentially expressed mRNAs were obtained from the mRNA dataset. By comparing the DEGs and the putative targets of the altered miRNAs, 116 (3 upregulated and 113 downregulated) coordinated genes were determined. Also, six hub genes (SNAP25, GRIN2A, GRIN2B, DLG2, ATP2B2, and SCN2A) were identified by constructing a PPI network. The results of the present study provide insight into mechanisms such as synaptic machinery and neuronal communication underlying AD pathogenesis, specifically concerning miRNAs.",34414562,,10.1007/s12031-021-01893-9,11,Journal of molecular neuroscience : MN,9002991,2.866,0.17370831966400146,0.5652173913043478,0.26421404682274247,0.7904684700592705
Role of miRNAs in Neurodegeneration: From Disease Cause to Tools of Biomarker Discovery and Therapeutics,"Neurodegenerative diseases originate from neuronal loss in the central nervous system (CNS). These debilitating diseases progress with age and have become common due to an increase in longevity. The National Institute of Environmental Health Science's 2021 annual report suggests around 6.2 million Americans are living with Alzheimer's disease, and there is a possibility that there will be 1.2 million Parkinson's disease patients in the USA by 2030. There is no clear-cut universal mechanism for identifying neurodegenerative diseases, and therefore, they pose a challenge for neurobiology scientists. Genetic and environmental factors modulate these diseases leading to familial or sporadic forms. Prior studies have shown that miRNA levels are altered during the course of the disease, thereby suggesting that these noncoding RNAs may be the contributing factor in neurodegeneration. In this review, we highlight the role of miRNAs in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Through this review, we aim to achieve four main objectives: First, we highlight how dysregulation of miRNA biogenesis led to these diseases. Second, we highlight the computational or bioinformatics tools required to identify the putative molecular targets of miRNAs, leading to biological molecular pathways or mechanisms involved in these diseases. Third, we focus on the dysregulation of miRNAs and their target genes leading to several neurodegenerative diseases. In the final section, we highlight the use of miRNAs as potential diagnostic biomarkers in the early asymptomatic preclinical diagnosis of these age-dependent debilitating diseases. Additionally, we discuss the challenges and advances in the development of miRNA therapeutics for brain targeting. We list some of the innovative strategies employed to deliver miRNA into target cells and the relevance of these viral and non-viral carrier systems in RNA therapy for neurodegenerative diseases. In summary, this review highlights the relevance of studying brain-enriched miRNAs, the mechanisms underlying their regulation of target gene expression, their dysregulation leading to progressive neurodegeneration, and their potential for biomarker marker and therapeutic intervention. This review thereby highlights ways for the effective diagnosis and prevention of these neurodegenerative disorders in the near future.",35327979,PMC8951370,10.3390/genes13030425,26,Genes,101551097,4.141,0.17342814803123474,0.7692307692307693,0.36454849498327757,1.0861030426648948
[LATE: not every dementia is Alzheimer's disease-Discussion of a new disease entity based on a case example : Current status of limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE)],"Limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 (Transactivation response(TAR)-DNA-binding protein 43 kDa) encephalopathy (LATE) has recently been characterized as a distinct neuropathological entity within the spectrum of dementia. Neuropathological alterations in the sense of LATE were already previously described as a comorbidity to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and it has been diagnosed independently from AD pathology in autopsy studies since 2008. The framework of LATE would account for the pathogenetic impact of limbic TDP-43 proteinopathy as a driver of amnestic dementia, either together with comorbid typical AD changes or as a distinct feature. The LATE possibly explains divergent clinical observations and biomarker results in patients suffering from severe amnestic impairment without biomarker evidence of AD-related amyloid and tau alterations. Whether LATE represents a distinct neuropathological entity or is part of the spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases associated with TDP-43 is currently a matter of debate. Further studies on the role of TDP-43 in the development of amnestic dementia are urgently needed. Thus, the enrichment of an amnestic phenotype in amyloid-centered therapeutic drug studies bears the risk of higher rates of patients with TDP-43 comorbidity, which could hinder the proof of efficacy in such trials. This article presents the current state of the discussion on LATE and illustrates the concept and the clinical considerations with a case study.",32409844,PMC7809002,10.1007/s00115-020-00922-z,2,Der Nervenarzt,0400773,0.0,0.17342814803123474,0.2909698996655518,0.20735785953177258,0.1622508687518512
A Genetic Validation of the Neurodegeneration Biomarkers Tau-A and Tau-C - A Mendelian Randomization Study,"Background:Disease modifying treatments for dementia are only just surfacing, and their development is still significantly hindered by the lack of validated tools for identification of subjects with subclinical disease. Much interest has been taken in developing accessible non-invasive serum biomarkers of neurodegeneration. Recent studies have identified caspase-3-cleaved tau (Tau-C), and ADAM-10 cleaved tau (Tau-A) as possible markers of preclinical neurodegenerative disease.Objectives:To explore if serum levels of Tau-A and Tau-C change as a consequence of neurodegeneration.Design and setting:Cohort study with measurement of biomarkers and genome sequencing at baseline with follow-up after an average of 14 years.Participants:Postmenopausal Danish women from the Prospective Epidemiological Risk Factor (PERF) cohort (n=4968) Methods: Genotyping data was used to perform a Mendelian randomization analysis of serum levels of Tau-A and Tau-C in relation to a diagnosis of dementia at follow-up. A dementia diagnosis was defined as a composite of an all-cause dementia diagnosis derived from the Danish National Health registries, a self-reported diagnosis of dementia and/or cognitive test scores suggestive of dementia. Serum levels of Tau-A and Tau-C were measured blinded in samples from baseline in a CAP certified lab. The association with dementia was assessed using bi-directional one- and two- sample Mendelian randomization.Results:A lead single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was identified for Tau-A (rs10414043) and Tau-C (rs429358), respectively were identified. Both were located in the APOE/C1 cluster on chromosome 19. APOE and EPOC1 variants were associated with lower levels of Tau-A and Tau-C levels - effect size -0.13, 95%CI [-0.17 - -0.09] log2 (ng/mL), p=7.05e-11 for rs10414043 association with Tau-A and effect size -0.12, 95%CI [-0.15 - -0.08] log2 (ng/mL), p=2e-11 for rs429358 association with Tau-C. When incorporating genetic data from a larger genetic study we found that Alzheimer's disease was marginally associated with a decreased Tau-A and Tau-C levels (Odds Ratio 0.97, 95%CI [0.93 - 1.00]. No association was found in the forward Mendelian randomization analysis.Conclusions:By combining genotype data with serum measurements of the novel biomarkers Tau-A and Tau-C, we conclude that Tau-A and Tau-C levels change because of neurodegeneration. We also conclude that lower serum-values of the biomarkers are associated with the presence of genetic variants commonly found in individuals suffering from late-onset Alzheimer's Dementia. These findings add to the growing data pointing towards Tau-A and Tau-C as valuable biomarkers for neurodegeneration.",37357295,,10.14283/jpad.2023.36,0,The journal of prevention of Alzheimer's disease,101638820,5.02,0.17328819632530212,0.12374581939799331,0.5384615384615384,1.1327220816747798
Alzheimer's disease genes and autophagy,"Autophagy is a process to degrade and recycle cellular constituents via the lysosome for regulating cellular homeostasis. Its dysfunction is now considered to be involved in many diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases. Many features reflecting autophagy impairment, such as autophagosome accumulation and lysosomal dysfunction, have been also revealed to be involved in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent genetic studies such as genome-wide association studies in AD have identified a number of novel genes associated with AD. Some of the identified genes have demonstrated dysfunction in autophagic processes in AD, while others remain under investigation. Since autophagy is strongly regarded to be one of the major pathogenic mechanisms of AD, it is necessary to review how the AD-associated genes are related to autophagy. We anticipate our current review to be a starting point for future studies regarding AD-associated genes and autophagy.
