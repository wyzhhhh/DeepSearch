Here, we present a multi-omic single-nucleus study of 191,890 nuclei in        late-stage Alzheimer's disease (AD), accessible through our web portal, profiling        chromatin accessibility and gene expression in the same biological samples and        uncovering vast cellular heterogeneity. We identified cell-type-specific,        disease-associated candidate cis-regulatory elements and their candidate target        genes, including an oligodendrocyte-associated regulatory module containing links        to APOE and CLU. We describe cis-regulatory relationships in specific cell types        at a subset of AD risk loci defined by genome-wide association studies,        demonstrating the utility of this multi-omic single-nucleus approach. Trajectory        analysis of glial populations identified disease-relevant transcription factors,        such as SREBF1, and their regulatory targets.

10.1111/bpa.12878,Considerations for integrative multi-omic approaches to explore Alzheimer's        disease mechanisms.,2020.0,"The past decade has seen the maturation of multiple different forms of        high-dimensional molecular profiling to the point that these methods could be        deployed in initially hundreds and more recently thousands of human samples. In        the field of Alzheimer's disease (AD), these profiles have been applied to the        target organ: the aging brain. In a growing number of cases, the same samples        were profiled with multiple different approaches, yielding genetic,        transcriptomic, epigenomic and proteomic data. Here, we review lessons learned so        far as we move beyond quantitative trait locus (QTL) analyses which map the        effect of genetic variation on molecular features to integrate multiple levels of        ""omic"" data in an effort to identify the molecular drivers of AD. One thing is        clear: no single layer of molecular or ""omic"" data is sufficient to capture the        variance of AD or aging-related cognitive decline. Nonetheless, reproducible        findings are emerging from current efforts, and there is evidence of convergence        using different approaches. Thus, we are on the cusp of an acceleration of truly        integrative studies as the availability of large numbers of well-characterized        brain samples profiled in three or more dimensions enables the testing,        comparison and refinement of analytic methods with which to dissect the molecular        architecture of the aging brain.",f4f260ee91ca415532bccc4de8d0016594d51345,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f4f260ee91ca415532bccc4de8d0016594d51345,32654306,PMC8018035,methodology,False,"Brain pathology (Zurich, Switzerland)",9216781,0.8048664331436157,0.02127659574468085,9,7.611,0.4623115577889447,0.5728643216080402,0.40524695015050477

However, genetic risk variants commonly reside in        non-coding regions and may regulate distant genes rather than the nearest gene,        as well as a gene's interaction partners in biological networks. Systems biology        and functional genomics approaches provide the framework to unravel the        functional significance of genetic risk variants in disease.

Microglia have long been considered a homogenous cell population.        The diversity of microglia has gained great interest in recent years due to the        emergence of novel single-cell technologies, such as single-cell/nucleus RNA        sequencing and single-cell mass cytometry by time-of-flight. This review        summarizes the current knowledge about the diversity/heterogeneity of microglia        and distinct microglia states in the brain of both AD mouse models and patients,        as revealed by single-cell technologies.

Although numerous LOAD-associated loci have been        discovered, the causal variants and their target genes remain largely unknown.        Since the brain is composed of heterogenous cell subtypes, it is imperative to        study the brain on a cell subtype specific level to explore the biological        processes underlying LOAD. METHODS: Here, we present the largest parallel        single-nucleus (sn) multi-omics study to simultaneously profile gene expression        (snRNA-seq) and chromatin accessibility (snATAC-seq) to date, using nuclei from        12 normal and 12 LOAD brains. We identified cell subtype clusters based on gene        expression and chromatin accessibility profiles and characterized cell        subtype-specific LOAD-associated differentially expressed genes (DEGs),        differentially accessible peaks (DAPs) and cis co-accessibility networks (CCANs).        RESULTS: Integrative analysis defined disease-relevant CCANs in multiple cell        subtypes and discovered LOAD-associated cell subtype-specific candidate cis        regulatory elements (cCREs), their candidate target genes, and trans-interacting        transcription factors (TFs), some of which, including ELK1, JUN, and SMAD4 in        excitatory neurons, were also LOAD-DEGs. Finally, we focused on a subset of cell        subtype-specific CCANs that overlap known LOAD-GWAS regions and catalogued        putative functional SNPs changing the affinities of TF motifs within LOAD-cCREs        linked to LOAD-DEGs, including APOE and MYO1E in a specific subtype of microglia        and BIN1 in a subpopulation of oligodendrocytes. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge,        this study represents the most comprehensive systematic interrogation to date of        regulatory networks and the impact of genetic variants on gene dysregulation in        LOAD at a cell subtype resolution. Our findings reveal crosstalk between        epigenetic, genomic, and transcriptomic determinants of LOAD pathogenesis and        define catalogues of candidate genes, cCREs, and variants involved in LOAD        genetic etiology and the cell subtypes in which they act to exert their        pathogenic effects. Overall, these results suggest that cell subtype-specific        cis-trans interactions between regulatory elements and TFs, and the genes        dysregulated by these networks contribute to the development of LOAD.",322682daddf1f63e289464e18d30fefcf6c804f8,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/322682daddf1f63e289464e18d30fefcf6c804f8,37789374,PMC10546724,,False,Cell & bioscience,101561195,0.7455836534500122,0.014814814814814815,0,9.584,0.0,0.6432160804020101,0.3260834340212311

A major goal in AD research is to identify new        therapeutic pathways by studying the molecular and cellular changes in the        disease, either downstream or upstream of the pathological hallmarks. In this        study, we present a comprehensive investigation of cellular heterogeneity from        the temporal cortex region of 40 individuals, comprising healthy donors and        individuals with differing tau and amyloid burden. Using single-nucleus        transcriptome analysis of 430,271 nuclei from both gray and white matter of these        individuals, we identified cell type-specific subclusters in both neuronal and        glial cell types with varying degrees of association with AD pathology.

Our current understanding on the        causes of Alzheimer's disease is limited. To develop treatments, experimental        models that represent a particular cellular phase of the disease and more        rigorous scrutiny of the cellular pathological mechanisms are crucial. In recent        years, Alzheimer's disease research underwent a paradigm shift. According to this        tendency, Alzheimer's disease is increasingly being conceived of a disease where        not only neurons but also multiple cell types synchronously partake to manifest        the pathology. Knowledge on every cell type adds an alternative approach and hope        for the efforts towards the treatment.

Expression patterns and biological        functions of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from scRNA-seq data were        validated in RNA sequencing data. DEGs in astrocytes interacted with        ferroptosis-related genes in FerrDb. CCK-8 and EdU assays were performed to        measure cell proliferation ability. ROS, Fe(2+) level, mitochondrial membrane        potentials, iron concentrations, and total iron binding capacity (TIBC) in serum        were evaluated. Y-maze and elevated maze were used to measure anxiety-like        behavior. Autonomous and exploration behaviors or learning and memory ability in        mice were analyzed using open field test and novel object recognition test.        RESULTS: Multiple clusters were identified, including oligodendrocytes,        astrocytes, OPCs, neurons, microglia, doublets, and endothelial cells. Astrocytes        were significantly decreased in AD, while oligodendrocytes and OPCs increased.        Cell-to-cell ligand-receptor interaction analysis revealed that astrocytes,        neurons, and OPCs mainly established contacts with other cells via the NRG3-ERBB4        ligand-receptor pair. GO and KEGG analyses found that astrocytes were enriched in        the ferroptosis pathway. FTH1 and SAT1 in astrocytes were identified as hub mRNAs        associated with ferroptosis. Serum iron concentration of 5xFAD mice was higher        than that of WT, and emotional and cognitive function were significantly impaired        as compared to WT. Serum iron concentration was negatively correlated with number        of astrocytes and percentage of time spent entering the novelty arm in the Y-maze        test, while it was positively correlated with percentage of time spent in the        central area. Meanwhile, number of astrocytes was negatively correlated with        percentage of time spent in the central area, while it was positively correlated        with percentage of time spent entering the novelty arm. CONCLUSIONS: Through        scRNA-seq analysis, we found that ferroptosis was activated in astrocytes and may        contribute to the pathophysiological process in the entorhinal cortex. FTH1 and        SAT1 were identified to impact astrocyte ferroptosis. Emotional and cognitive        impairment in AD was associated with astrocyte ferroptosis. Our findings provide        clues to reveal the pathophysiological processes following AD at the cellular        level and highlight potential drug targets for the treatment of AD.",fa3dd1a07176407bc2c30087985dacf4063fb1dd,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/fa3dd1a07176407bc2c30087985dacf4063fb1dd,36297287,PMC9610574,"result,background",False,"Pharmaceuticals (Basel, Switzerland)",101238453,0.6522414088249207,0.06060606060606061,18,5.215,0.6331658291457286,0.36683417085427134,0.36991484688990045

The results obtained from blood alone cannot fully reflect the        alterations of nerve cells, including neurons and glia cells, in Alzheimer's        disease (AD) brains. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate novel        potential AD biomarker candidates, through an integrated multi-omics approach in        AD. We propose a comprehensive strategy to identify high-confidence candidate        biomarkers by integrating multi-omics data from AD, including single-nuclei RNA        sequencing (snRNA-seq) datasets of the prefrontal and entorhinal cortices, as        wells as serum proteomic datasets. We first quantified a total of 124,658 nuclei,        8 cell types, and 3701 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from snRNA-seq        dataset of 30 human cortices, as well as 1291 differentially expressed proteins        (DEPs) from serum proteomic dataset of 11 individuals.

These candidate        biomarkers are related to the regulation process of the actin cytoskeleton, which        is involved in the regulation of synaptic loss in the AD brain tissue.

Gene regulatory network, a key molecular        mechanism linking transcription factors (TFs) and regulatory elements to govern        gene expression, can change across cell types in the human brain and thus serve        as a model for studying gene dysregulation in AD. However, AD-induced regulatory        changes across brain cell types remains uncharted. To address this, we integrated        single-cell multi-omics datasets to predict the gene regulatory networks of four        major cell types, excitatory and inhibitory neurons, microglia and        oligodendrocytes, in control and AD brains. Importantly, we analyzed and compared        the structural and topological features of networks across cell types and        examined changes in AD. Our analysis shows that hub TFs are largely common across        cell types and AD-related changes are relatively more prominent in some cell        types (e.g., microglia). The regulatory logics of enriched network motifs (e.g.,        feed-forward loops) further uncover cell type-specific TF-TF cooperativities in        gene regulation. The cell type networks are also highly modular and several        network modules with cell-type-specific expression changes in AD pathology are        enriched with AD-risk genes. The further disease-module-drug association analysis        suggests cell-type candidate drugs and their potential target genes. Finally, our        network-based machine learning analysis systematically prioritized cell type risk        genes likely involved in AD. Our strategy is validated using an independent        dataset which showed that top ranked genes can predict clinical phenotypes (e.g.,        cognitive impairment) of AD with reasonable accuracy.

The literature provides some        evidence of sex-specific contributions to AD. However, molecular mechanisms of        sex-biased differences in AD remain elusive. Multiomics data in tandem with        systems biology approaches offer a new avenue to dissect sex-stratified molecular        mechanisms of AD and to develop sex-specific diagnostic and therapeutic        strategies for AD. Single-cell transcriptomic datasets and cell deconvolution of        bulk tissue transcriptomic data provide additional insights into brain cell        type-specific impact on sex-biased differences in AD. In this review, we        summarize the impact of sex chromosomes and sex hormones on AD, the impact of        sex-biased differences during AD development, and the interplay between sex and a        major AD genetic risk factor, the APOE ε4 genotype, through the multiomics        landscape. Several sex-biased molecular pathways such as neuroinflammation and        bioenergetic metabolism have been identified. The importance of sex chromosome        and sex hormones, as well as the associated pathways in AD pathogenesis, is        further strengthened by findings from omics studies. Future research efforts        should integrate the multiomics data from different brain regions and different        cell types using systems biology approaches, and leverage the knowledge into a        holistic examination of sex differences in AD.

After over 30 years of intensive research, we have gained        extensive knowledge of the genetic and molecular factors involved and their        interplay in disease. These findings suggest that different subgroups of AD may        exist. Not only are we starting to treat autosomal dominant cases differently        from sporadic cases, but we could be observing different underlying pathological        mechanisms related to the amyloid cascade hypothesis, immune dysfunction, and a        tau-dependent pathology. Genetic, molecular, and, more recently, multi-omic        evidence support each of these scenarios, which are highly interconnected but can        also point to the different subgroups of AD. The identification of the pathologic        triggers and order of events in the disease processes are key to the design of        treatments and therapies. Prevention and treatment of AD cannot be attempted        using a single approach; different therapeutic strategies at specific disease        stages may be appropriate.

The complex        cellular microenvironment in the AD brain impedes our understanding of        pathogenesis. Thus, a comprehensive investigation of cell type-specific responses        in AD is crucial to provide precise molecular and cellular targets for        therapeutic development. METHODS: Here, we integrated analyzed 4,441        differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that were identified from 263,370        single-cells in cortex samples by single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq)        between 42 AD-pathology subjects and 39 normal controls within 3 studies. DEGs        were analyzed in microglia, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, excitatory neurons,        inhibitory neurons, and endothelial cells, respectively. In each cell type, we        identified both common DEGs which were observed in all 3 studies, and overlapping        DEGs which have been seen in at least 2 studies. Firstly, we showed the common        DEGs expression and explained the biological functions by comparing with existing        literature or multil-omics signaling pathways knowledgebase. We then determined        the significant modules and hub genes, and explored the biological processes        using the overlapping DEGs. Finally, we identified the common and distinct        dysregulated pathways using overall DEGs and overlapping DEGs in a cell        type-specific manner. RESULTS: Up-regulated LINGO1 has been seen in both        oligodendrocytes and excitatory neurons across 3 studies.

Most existing studies have solely focused on molecular        perturbations within each cell, but cells live in microenvironments rather than        in isolated entities. Here, we leveraged the large-scale and publicly available        single-nucleus RNA sequencing in the human prefrontal cortex to investigate        cell-to-cell communication in healthy brains and their perturbations in AD. We        uniformly processed the snRNA-seq with strict QCs and labeled canonical cell        types consistent with the definitions from the BRAIN Initiative Cell Census        Network. From ligand and receptor gene expression, we built a high-confidence        cell-to-cell communication network to investigate signaling differences between        AD and healthy brains. RESULTS: Specifically, we first performed broad        communication pattern analyses to highlight that biologically related cell types        in normal brains rely on largely overlapping signaling networks and that the AD        brain exhibits the irregular inter-mixing of cell types and signaling pathways.        Secondly, we performed a more focused cell-type-centric analysis and found that        excitatory neurons in AD have significantly increased their communications to        inhibitory neurons, while inhibitory neurons and other non-neuronal cells        globally decreased theirs to all cells. Then, we delved deeper with a        signaling-centric view, showing that canonical signaling pathways CSF, TGFβ, and        CX3C are significantly dysregulated in their signaling to the cell type        microglia/PVM and from endothelial to neuronal cells for the WNT pathway.        Finally, after extracting 23 known AD risk genes, our intracellular communication        analysis revealed a strong connection of extracellular ligand genes APP, APOE,        and PSEN1 to intracellular AD risk genes TREM2, ABCA1, and APP in the        communication from astrocytes and microglia to neurons. CONCLUSIONS: In summary,        with the novel advances in single-cell sequencing technologies, we show that        cellular signaling is regulated in a cell-type-specific manner and that improper        regulation of extracellular signaling genes is linked to intracellular risk        genes, giving the mechanistic intra- and inter-cellular picture of AD.",86ebec6082661064722fd94398c7735ff13f844c,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/86ebec6082661064722fd94398c7735ff13f844c,38741048,PMC11089696,"methodology,background",False,BMC neuroscience,100966986,0.5638583302497864,0.11940298507462686,0,3.264,0.01507537688442211,0.21105527638190955,0.2508382910947364

Here we systematically        review the state-of-the-art bioinformatics approaches to analyze single-cell        sequencing data and their applications to AD in 14 major directions, including 1)        quality control and normalization, 2) dimension reduction and feature extraction,        3) cell clustering analysis, 4) cell type inference and annotation, 5)        differential expression, 6) trajectory inference, 7) copy number variation        analysis, 8) integration of single-cell multi-omics, 9) epigenomic analysis, 10)        gene network inference, 11) prioritization of cell subpopulations, 12)        integrative analysis of human and mouse sc-RNA-seq data, 13) spatial        transcriptomics, and 14) comparison of single cell AD mouse model studies and        single cell human AD studies. We also address challenges in using human        postmortem and mouse tissues and outline future developments in single cell        sequencing data analysis. Importantly, we have implemented our recommended        workflow for each major analytic direction and applied them to a large single        nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) dataset in AD. Key analytic results are        reported while the scripts and the data are shared with the research community        through  GitHub. In summary, this comprehensive review provides insights into        various approaches to analyze single cell sequencing data and offers specific        guidelines for study design and a variety of analytic directions. The review and        the accompanied software tools will serve as a valuable resource for studying        cellular and molecular mechanisms of AD, other diseases, or biological systems at        the single cell level.",32b6be050f55381db926444a08008f15302b3b4d,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/32b6be050f55381db926444a08008f15302b3b4d,35236372,PMC8889402,"methodology,background",True,Molecular neurodegeneration,101266600,0.5565502047538757,0.013513513513513514,38,18.879,0.7939698492462312,0.8793969849246231,0.42337549195719626

Here we applied single-nucleus RNA sequencing        to entorhinal cortex samples from control and Alzheimer's disease brains (n = 6        per group), yielding a total of 13,214 high-quality nuclei. We detail        cell-type-specific gene expression patterns, unveiling how transcriptional        changes in specific cell subpopulations are associated with Alzheimer's disease.        We report that the Alzheimer's disease risk gene APOE is specifically repressed        in Alzheimer's disease oligodendrocyte progenitor cells and astrocyte        subpopulations and upregulated in an Alzheimer's disease-specific microglial        subopulation. Integrating transcription factor regulatory modules with        Alzheimer's disease risk loci revealed drivers of cell-type-specific state        transitions towards Alzheimer's disease. For example, transcription factor EB, a        master regulator of lysosomal function, regulates multiple disease genes in a        specific Alzheimer's disease astrocyte subpopulation.

Because of the rare existence and random localization of these cells        in the brain, their molecular profiles and disease-specific heterogeneities        remain unclear. Through a bioinformatics approach that allows integrated analyses        of multiple single-nucleus transcriptome datasets from human brain samples, these        rare cell populations were identified and selected for further characterization.        Our analyses indicated that these cell cycle-related events occur predominantly        in excitatory neurons and that cellular senescence is likely their immediate        terminal fate. Quantitatively, the number of cell cycle re-engaging and senescent        neurons decreased during the normal brain aging process, but in the context of        late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), these cells accumulate instead.        Transcriptomic profiling of these cells suggested that disease-specific        differences were predominantly tied to the early stage of the senescence process,        revealing that these cells presented more proinflammatory, metabolically        deregulated, and pathology-associated signatures in disease-affected brains.        Similarly, these general features of cell cycle re-engaging neurons were also        observed in a subpopulation of dopaminergic neurons identified in the Parkinson's        disease (PD)-Lewy body dementia (LBD) model.

A comprehensive investigation of cell type-specific responses and        cellular heterogeneity in AD is required to provide precise molecular and        cellular targets for therapeutic development. Accordingly, we perform        single-nucleus transcriptome analysis of 169,496 nuclei from the prefrontal        cortical samples of AD patients and normal control (NC) subjects. Differential        analysis shows that the cell type-specific transcriptomic changes in AD are        associated with the disruption of biological processes including angiogenesis,        immune activation, synaptic signaling, and myelination. Subcluster analysis        reveals that compared to NC brains, AD brains contain fewer neuroprotective        astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. Importantly, our findings show that a        subpopulation of angiogenic endothelial cells is induced in the brain in patients        with AD.

We investigated whether polygenic risk scores (PRSs)        integrated with transcriptome profiles from AD brains can explain AD clinical        heterogeneity. METHODS: We conducted co-expression network analysis and        identified gene sets (modules) that were preserved in three AD transcriptome        datasets and associated with AD-related neuropathological traits including        neuritic plaques (NPs) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). We computed the        module-based PRSs (mbPRSs) for each module and tested associations with mbPRSs        for cognitive test scores, cognitively defined AD subgroups, and brain imaging        data. RESULTS: Of the modules significantly associated with NPs and/or NFTs, the        mbPRSs from two modules (M6 and M9) showed distinct associations with language        and visuospatial functioning, respectively.

Genome-wide association studies have shown, both in microglia and astrocytes, an        increase in gene variants associated with a higher risk of developing late-onset        AD. Microglia, the resident innate immune cells of the brain, and astrocytes,        glial cells crucial for vascular integrity and neuronal support, both agglomerate        near amyloid beta plaques and dystrophic neurites where they participate in the        elimination of these harmful parenchymal elements. However, their role in AD        pathogenesis has been challenging to resolve due to the highly heterogeneous        nature of these cell populations, i.e., their molecular, morphological, and        ultrastructural diversity, together with their ever-changing responsiveness and        functions throughout the pathological course of AD. With the recent expansions in        the field of glial heterogeneity through innovative advances in state-of-the-art        microscopy and -omics techniques, novel concepts and questions arose, notably        pertaining to how the diverse microglial and astrocytic states interact with each        other and with the AD hallmarks, and how their concerted efforts/actions impact        the progression of the disease. In this review, we discuss the recent advances        and findings on the topic of glial heterogeneity, particularly focusing on the        relationships of these cells with AD hallmarks (e.g., amyloid beta plaques,        neurofibrillary tangles, synaptic loss, and dystrophic neurites) in murine models        of AD pathology and post-mortem brain samples of patients with AD.",42d90967a41570d83aa81c7c912560fac2d8a481,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/42d90967a41570d83aa81c7c912560fac2d8a481,36035256,PMC9413962,,False,Frontiers in cellular neuroscience,101477935,0.5189118981361389,0.019230769230769232,10,6.147,0.48743718592964824,0.4723618090452261,0.3073357263793805

The relative abundance        of C3:Ex.Neuron increased at 1.5 months and peaked at 4.7 months in AD mice.        Functional pathways analyses showed that the pathways positively related to        neurodegenerative disease progression were downregulated in the C3:Ex.Neuron at        1.5 months in AD mice. Based on the differentially expressed genes among the        C3:Ex.Neuron, four subtypes (C3.1-4) were identified, which exhibited distinct        abundance regulatory patterns during the development of AD.

10.1002/trc2.12373,Altered gene expression in excitatory neurons is associated with Alzheimer's        disease and its higher incidence in women.,2023.0,"INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder involving        interactions between different cell types in the brain. Previous single-cell and        bulk expression Alzheimer's studies have reported conflicting findings about the        key cell types and cellular pathways whose expression is primarily altered in        this disease. We re-analyzed these data in a uniform, coherent manner aiming to        resolve and extend past findings. Our analysis sheds light on the observation        that females have higher AD incidence than males. METHODS: We re-analyzed three        single-cell transcriptomics datasets. We used the software Model-based Analysis        of Single-cell Transcriptomics (MAST) to seek differentially expressed genes        comparing AD cases to matched controls for both sexes together and each sex        separately. We used the GOrilla software to search for enriched pathways among        the differentially expressed genes. Motivated by the male/female difference in        incidence, we studied genes on the X-chromosome, focusing on genes in the        pseudoautosomal region (PAR) and on genes that are heterogeneous across        individuals or tissues for X-inactivation. We validated findings by analyzing        bulk AD datasets from the cortex in the Gene Expression Omnibus. RESULTS: Our        results resolve a contradiction in the literature, showing that by comparing AD        patients to unaffected controls, excitatory neurons have more differentially        expressed genes than do other cell types. Synaptic transmission and related        pathways are altered in a sex-specific analysis of excitatory neurons. PAR genes        and X-chromosome heterogeneous genes, including, for example, BEX1 and ELK1, may        contribute to the difference in sex incidence of Alzheimer's disease. GRIN1,        stood out as an overexpressed autosomal gene in cases versus controls in all        three single-cell datasets and as a functional candidate gene contributing to        pathways upregulated in cases. DISCUSSION: Taken together, these results point to        a potential linkage between two longstanding questions concerning AD        pathogenesis, involving which cell type is the most important and why females        have a higher incidence than males. HIGHLIGHTS: By reanalyzing three, published,        single-cell RNAseq datasets, we resolved a contradiction in the literature and        showed that when comparing AD patients to unaffected controls, excitatory neurons        have more differentially expressed genes than do other cell types.Further        analysis of the published single-cell datasets showed that synaptic transmission        and related pathways are altered in a sex-specific analysis of excitatory        neurons.Combining analysis of single-cell datasets and publicly available bulk        transcriptomics datasets revealed that X-chromosome genes, such as BEX1, ELK1,        and USP11, whose X-inactivation status is heterogeneous may contribute to the        higher incidence in females of Alzheimer's disease.",193278a0ac0951ef4e0a139fd336ea17ac77447b,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/193278a0ac0951ef4e0a139fd336ea17ac77447b,36873924,PMC9983144,methodology,False,"Alzheimer's & dementia (New York, N.

Both astrocytes and microglia can undergo morphological and        transcriptomic changes in response to infection with human immunodeficiency virus        (HIV). While both astrocytes and microglia can be infected with HIV, HIV viral        proteins in the local environment can interact with and activate these cells.        Given that both astrocytes and microglia play critical roles in maintaining        neuronal function, it will be critical to have an understanding of their        heterogeneity and to identify genes and mechanisms that modulate their responses        to HIV. Heterogeneity may include a depletion or increase in one or more        astrocyte or microglial subtypes in different regions of the brain or spine as        well as the gain or loss of a specific function. Single-cell RNA sequencing        (scRNA-seq) has emerged as a powerful tool that can be used to characterise these        changes within a given population. The use of this method facilitates the        identification of subtypes and changes in cellular transcriptomes that develop in        response to activation and various disease processes. In this review, we will        examine recent studies that have used scRNA-seq to explore astrocyte and        microglial heterogeneity in neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's        disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis as well as in response to HIV        infection.

An important aim of these studies        is the identification of candidate genes that demonstrate congruent        disease-related alterations across the different data types measured by the        study. We developed a new method to detect such candidate genes in large        multi-omic case-control studies that measure multiple data types in the same set        of samples. The method is based on a gene-centric integrative coefficient        quantifying to what degree consistent differences are observed in the different        data types. For statistical inference, a Bayesian hierarchical model is used to        study the distribution of the integrative coefficient. The model employs a        conditional autoregressive prior to integrate a functional gene network and to        share information between genes known to be functionally related. We applied the        method to an AD dataset consisting of histone acetylation, DNA methylation, and        RNA transcription data from human cortical tissue samples of 233 subjects, and we        detected 816 genes with consistent differences between persons with AD and        controls. The findings were validated in protein data and in RNA transcription        data from two independent AD studies. Finally, we found three subnetworks of        jointly dysregulated genes within the functional gene network which capture three        distinct biological processes: myeloid cell differentiation, protein        phosphorylation and synaptic signaling. Further investigation of the myeloid        network indicated an upregulation of this network in early stages of AD prior to        accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau and suggested that increased CSF1        transcription in astrocytes may contribute to microglial activation in AD. Thus,        we developed a method that integrates multiple data types and external knowledge        of gene function to detect candidate genes, applied the method to an AD dataset,        and identified several disease-related genes and processes demonstrating the        usefulness of the integrative approach.",d24e6073db7dd32914b77af1ce3dd25de987a679,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d24e6073db7dd32914b77af1ce3dd25de987a679,32255787,PMC7138305,,False,PLoS computational biology,101238922,0.4801282584667206,0.017543859649122806,8,4.779,0.4472361809045226,0.2864321608040201,0.2611062726559467

METHODS: We developed The        Alzheimer's Cell Atlas (TACA) by compiling an AD brain cell atlas consisting of        over 1.1 million cells/nuclei across 26 data sets, covering major brain regions        (hippocampus, cerebellum, prefrontal cortex, and so on) and cell types        (astrocyte, microglia, neuron, oligodendrocytes, and so on). We conducted nearly        1400 differential expression comparisons to identify cell type-specific molecular        alterations (e.g., case vs healthy control, sex-specific, apolipoprotein E (APOE)        ε4/ε4, and TREM2 mutations). Each comparison was followed by protein-protein        interaction module detection, functional enrichment analysis, and omics-informed        target and drug (over 700,000 perturbation profiles) screening. Over 400        cell-cell interaction analyses using 6000 ligand-receptor interactions were        conducted to identify the cell-cell communication networks in AD. RESULTS: All        results are integrated into TACA (https://taca.lerner.ccf.org/), a new web portal        with cell type-specific, abundant transcriptomic information, and 12 interactive        visualization tools for AD. DISCUSSION: We envision that TACA will be a highly        valuable resource for both basic and translational research in AD, as it provides        abundant information for AD pathobiology and actionable systems biology tools for        drug discovery.

In late-stage age-related macular degeneration, we identify a        microglia-to-astrocyte signaling axis mediated by interleukin-1β which drives        angiogenesis characteristic of disease pathogenesis. We validated this mechanism        using in vitro and in vivo assays in mouse, identifying a possible new        therapeutic target for AMD and possibly other neurodegenerative conditions.

We delineate        bulk-tissue gene expression into single cell-type gene expression and integrate        clinical and pathologic traits, single nucleotide variation, and deconvoluted        gene expression for the construction of cell type-specific predictive network        models.

Pronounced gender differences have been observed both in the relative risk of        developing AD and in clinical disease manifestations. A molecular level        understanding of these gender disparities is still missing, but could provide        important clues on cellular mechanisms modulating the disease and reveal new        targets for gender-oriented disease-modifying precision therapies. We therefore        present here a comprehensive single-cell analysis of disease-associated molecular        gender differences in transcriptomics data from the neocortex, one of the brain        regions most susceptible to AD, in one of the most widely used AD mouse models,        the Tg2576 model. Cortical areas are also most commonly used in studies of        post-mortem AD brains. To identify disease-linked molecular processes that occur        before the onset of detectable neuropathology, we focused our analyses on an age        with no detectable plaques and microgliosis. Cell-type specific alterations were        investigated at the level of individual genes, pathways, and gene regulatory        networks. The number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was not large        enough to build context-specific gene regulatory networks for each individual        cell type, and thus, we focused on the study of cell types with dominant changes        and included analyses of changes across the combination of cell types. We        observed significant disease-associated gender differences in cellular processes        related to synapse organization and reactive oxygen species metabolism, and        identified a limited set of transcription factors, including Egr1 and Klf6, as        key regulators of many of the disease-associated and gender-dependent gene        expression changes in the model. Overall, our analyses revealed significant        cell-type specific gene expression changes in individual genes, pathways and        sub-networks, including gender-specific and gender-dimorphic changes in both        upstream transcription factors and their downstream targets, in the Tg2576 AD        model before the onset of overt disease.

One major reason is attributed to the        limitation of clinical ""one-size-fits-all"" approach, since the same AD treatment        solely based on clinical diagnosis was unlikely to achieve good clinical        efficacy. In recent years, computational approaches based on multiomics data have        provided an unprecedented opportunity for drug discovery since they can        substantially lower the costs and boost the efficiency. In this study, we        intended to identify potential drug candidates for different pathological stages        of AD by computationally repurposing Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved        drugs. First, we assembled gene expression data from three different AD        pathological stages, which include mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early and        late stages of AD (EAD, LAD). We next quantified the network distances between        drug target networks and AD modules by utilizing a network proximity approach,        and identified 193 candidates that possessed significant associations with AD.        After searching for previous literature evidence, 63 out of 193 (32.6%) predicted        drugs were demonstrated to exert therapeutic effects on AD. We further explored        the novel mechanism of action (MOA) for these drug candidates by determining the        specific brain cells they might function on based on AD patient single cell        transcriptomic data. Additionally, we selected several promising candidates that        could cross the blood brain barrier together with confirmed neuroprotective        effects, and subsequently determined the antioxidative activity of these        compounds.

By examining cell type-specific and cell type-agnostic AD-related        gene activity changes and their sex-dimorphism for individual genes, pathways and        cellular sub-networks, we identified both statistically significant alterations        and interpreted the upstream mechanisms controlling them. Our results confirm        several significant sex-dependent alterations in gene activity in the THY-Tau22        model mice compared to controls, with more pronounced alterations in females.        Both changes shared across multiple cell types and cell type-specific changes        were observed. The differential genes showed significant over-representation of        known AD-relevant processes, such as pathways associated with neuronal        differentiation, programmed cell death and inflammatory responses. Regulatory        network analysis of these genes revealed upstream regulators that modulate many        of the downstream targets with sex-dependent changes. Most key regulators have        been previously implicated in AD, such as Egr1, Klf4, Chchd2, complement system        genes, and myelin-associated glycoproteins. Comparing with similar data from the        Tg2576 AD mouse model and human AD patients, we identified multiple genes with        consistent, cell type-specific and sex-dependent alterations across all three        datasets. These shared changes were particularly evident in the expression of        myelin-associated genes such as Mbp and Plp1 in oligodendrocytes. In summary, we        observed significant cell type-specific transcriptomic changes in the THY-Tau22        mouse model, with a strong over-representation of known AD-associated genes and        processes. These include both sex-neutral and sex-specific patterns,        characterized by consistent shifts in upstream master regulators and downstream        target genes. Collectively, these findings provide insights into mechanisms        influencing sex-specific susceptibility to AD and reveal key regulatory proteins        that could be targeted for developing treatments addressing sex-dependent AD        pathology.",08142cc0244770cee349d2a62c44cc74f9dacf8e,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/08142cc0244770cee349d2a62c44cc74f9dacf8e,38453894,PMC10920792,,False,Cell death discovery,101665035,0.44058963656425476,0.011363636363636364,0,7.109,0.05025125628140704,0.5527638190954773,0.2271746068212636

Due to its long clinical course and lack of an effective treatment, AD        has become a major public health problem in the USA and worldwide. Due to        variation in age-at-onset, AD is classified into early-onset (< 60 years) and        late-onset (≥ 60 years) forms with early-onset accounting for only 5-10% of all        cases. With the exception of a small number of early-onset cases that are        afflicted because of high penetrant single gene mutations in APP, PSEN1, and        PSEN2 genes, AD is genetically heterogeneous, especially the late-onset form        having a polygenic or oligogenic risk inheritance. Since the identification of        APOE as the most significant risk factor for late-onset AD in 1993, the path to        the discovery of additional AD risk genes had been arduous until 2009 when the        use of large genome-wide association studies opened up the discovery gateways        that led the identification of ~ 95 additional risk loci from 2009 to early 2022.        This article reviews the history of AD genetics followed by the potential        molecular pathways and recent application of functional genomics methods to        identify the causal AD gene(s) among the many genes that reside within a single        locus.

Studies have suggested relations between        neurodegenerative diseases for many years (e.g., regarding the aggregation of        toxic proteins or triggering endogenous cell death pathways). We gathered        publicly available genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data from 177 studies        and more than one million patients to detect shared genetic patterns between the        neurodegenerative diseases on three analyzed omics-layers. The results show a        remarkably high number of shared differentially expressed genes between the        transcriptomic and proteomic levels for all conditions, while showing a        significant relation between genomic and proteomic data between AD and PD and AD        and ALS. We identified a set of 139 genes being differentially expressed in        several transcriptomic experiments of all four diseases. These 139 genes showed        overrepresented gene ontology (GO) Terms involved in the development of        neurodegeneration, such as response to heat and hypoxia, positive regulation of        cytokines and angiogenesis, and RNA catabolic process. Furthermore, the four        analyzed neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) were clustered by their mean direction        of regulation throughout all transcriptomic studies for this set of 139 genes,        with the closest relation regarding this common gene set seen between AD and HD.        GO-Term and pathway analysis of the proteomic overlap led to biological processes        (BPs), related to protein folding and humoral immune response. Taken together, we        could confirm the existence of many relations between Alzheimer's disease,        Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis on        transcriptomic and proteomic levels by analyzing the pathways and GO-Terms        arising in these intersections. The significance of the connection and the        striking relation of the results to processes leading to neurodegeneration        between the transcriptomic and proteomic data for all four analyzed        neurodegenerative diseases showed that exploring many studies simultaneously,        including multiple omics-layers of different neurodegenerative diseases        simultaneously, holds new relevant insights that do not emerge from analyzing        these data separately. Furthermore, the results shed light on processes like the        humoral immune response that have previously been described only for certain        diseases.

RESULTS: We found that differentially expressed (DE)        cell-specific genes were mostly identified as neuronal, microglial, or        endothelial in origin. However, a large proportion (75.7%) was not attributable        to specific cells due to the heterogeneity in expression among brain cell types.        Neuronal DE genes were consistently downregulated and associated with synaptic        and neuronal processes as described previously in the field thereby validating        this approach. We detected several DE genes related to angiogenesis (endothelial        cells) and proteoglycans (oligodendrocytes).

Recently, genomic and proteomic analyses, especially at the        single cell level, have reported previously unrecognized diversity within brain        cell types. The complexity of the brain microenvironment increases during disease        partly due to the immune infiltration from the periphery that contributes to        redefine the brain connectome by establishing a new crosstalk with resident brain        cell types. Within the rewired brain ecosystem, glial cell subpopulations are        emerging hubs modulating the dialogue between the Immune System and the Central        Nervous System with important consequences in the progression of brain tumors and        other disorders.

Amyloid-β (Aβ) is thought to        have an association with microglia activation and trigger neuroinflammation in        AD. However, inflammation response in brain disorders is heterogenous, and thus,        it is necessary to unveil the specific gene module of neuroinflammation caused by        Aβ in AD, which might provide novel biomarkers for AD diagnosis and help        understand the mechanism of the disease. METHODS: Transcriptomic datasets of        brain region tissues from AD patients and the corresponding normal tissues were        first used to identify gene modules through the weighted gene co-expression        network analysis (WGCNA) method. Then, key modules highly associated with Aβ        accumulation and neuroinflammatory response were pinpointed by combining module        expression score and functional information. Meanwhile, the relationship of the        Aβ-associated module to the neuron and microglia was explored based on snRNA-seq        data. Afterward, transcription factor (TF) enrichment and the SCENIC analysis        were performed on the Aβ-associated module to discover the related upstream        regulators, and then a PPI network proximity method was employed to repurpose the        potential approved drugs for AD. RESULTS: A total of 16 co-expression modules        were primarily obtained by the WGCNA method. Among them, the green module was        significantly correlated with Aβ accumulation, and its function was mainly        involved in neuroinflammation response and neuron death. Thus, the module was        termed the amyloid-β induced neuroinflammation module (AIM). Moreover, the module        was negatively correlated with neuron percentage and showed a close association        with inflammatory microglia. Finally, based on the module, several important TFs        were recognized as potential diagnostic biomarkers for AD, and then 20 possible        drugs including ibrutinib and ponatinib were picked out for the disease.        CONCLUSION: In this study, a specific gene module, termed AIM, was identified as        a key sub-network of Aβ accumulation and neuroinflammation in AD. Moreover, the        module was verified as having an association with neuron degeneration and        inflammatory microglia transformation. Moreover, some promising TFs and potential        repurposing drugs were presented for AD based on the module.

We precisely distinguished patients of AD at the transcriptome        level. METHODS: We collected 1,240 AD brain tissue samples collected from the GEO        dataset. Consensus clustering was used to identify molecular subtypes, and the        clinical characteristics were focused on. To reveal transcriptome differences        among subgroups, we certificated specific upregulated genes and annotated the        biological function. According to RANK METRIC SCORE in GSEA, TOP10 was defined as        the hub gene. In addition, the systematic correlation between the hub gene and        ""A/T/N"" was analyzed. Finally, we used external data sets to verify the        diagnostic value of hub genes. RESULTS: We identified three molecular subtypes of        AD from 743 AD samples, among which subtypes I and III had high-risk factors, and        subtype II had protective factors.

Here we describe DIALOGUE, a method to systematically uncover        multicellular programs (MCPs)-combinations of coordinated cellular programs in        different cell types that form higher-order functional units at the tissue        level-from either spatial data or single-cell data obtained without spatial        information. Tested on spatial datasets from the mouse hypothalamus, cerebellum,        visual cortex and neocortex, DIALOGUE identified MCPs associated with animal        behavior and recovered spatial properties when tested on unseen data while        outperforming other methods and metrics. In spatial data from human lung cancer,        DIALOGUE identified MCPs marking immune activation and tissue remodeling. Applied        to single-cell RNA sequencing data across individuals or regions, DIALOGUE        uncovered MCPs marking Alzheimer's disease, ulcerative colitis and resistance to        cancer immunotherapy. These programs were predictive of disease outcome and        predisposition in independent cohorts and included risk genes from genome-wide        association studies.

We introduce the scGNN        (single-cell graph neural network) to provide a hypothesis-free deep learning        framework for scRNA-Seq analyses. This framework formulates and aggregates        cell-cell relationships with graph neural networks and models heterogeneous gene        expression patterns using a left-truncated mixture Gaussian model. scGNN        integrates three iterative multi-modal autoencoders and outperforms existing        tools for gene imputation and cell clustering on four benchmark scRNA-Seq        datasets. In an Alzheimer's disease study with 13,214 single nuclei from        postmortem brain tissues, scGNN successfully illustrated disease-related neural        development and the differential mechanism. scGNN provides an effective        representation of gene expression and cell-cell relationships.

Gaining insights into why certain        regions are resistant while others are susceptible is vital for advancing        therapeutic strategies. While gene expression changes offer clues about disease        responses across brain regions, the mixture of cell types therein obscures        experimental results. In recent years, methods that analyze the transcriptomes of        individual cells (e.g., single-cell RNA sequencing or scRNAseq) have been widely        used and have provided invaluable insights into specific cell types.        Concurrently, transgene-based techniques that dissect cell type-specific        translatomes (CSTs) in model systems, like RiboTag and bacTRAP, offer unique        advantages but have received less attention. This review juxtaposes the merits        and drawbacks of both methodologies, focusing on the use of CSTs in understanding        conditions like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Huntington's disease (HD),        Alzheimer's disease (AD), and specific prion diseases like fatal familial        insomnia (FFI), genetic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (gCJD), and acquired prion        disease.

Cell-cell communications within ME play important        roles in disease progression and immunotherapy response and are novel and        critical therapeutic targets. Though many tools of scRNA-seq analysis have been        developed to investigate the heterogeneity and sub-populations of cells, few were        designed for uncovering cell-cell communications of ME and predicting the        potentially effective drugs to inhibit the communications. Moreover, the data        analysis processes of discovering signaling communication networks and effective        drugs using scRNA-seq data are complex and involve a set of critical analysis        processes and external supportive data resources, which are difficult for        researchers who have no strong computational background and training in scRNA-seq        data analysis. To address these challenges, in this study, we developed a novel        open-source computational tool, sc2MeNetDrug        (https://fuhaililab.github.io/sc2MeNetDrug/).

Motivating the need for this tool, we conducted an        initial meta-analysis of current, human AD proteomics studies. While the results        broadly corroborated major neurodegenerative disease hypotheses, cell        type-specific predictions were limited. By adapting our Formaldehyde-fixed        Intracellular Target-Sorted Antigen Retrieval (FITSAR) method for proteomics and        applying this technique to characterize AD and NS brains, we generated enriched        neuron and astrocyte proteomic profiles for a sample set of donors (available at        www.fitsarpro.appspot.com ). Results showed the feasibility for using FITSAR to        evaluate cell-type specific hypotheses.

To characterize the        dynamic cellular and transcriptomic differences in AD neuropathology, we apply        the novel concept of RNA velocity to the study of single-nucleus RNA from the        cortex of 60 subjects with varied levels of AD pathology. RNA velocity captures        the rate of change of gene expression by comparing intronic and exonic sequence        counts. We performed differential analyses to find the significant genes driving        both cell type-specific RNA velocity and expression differences in AD,        extensively compared these two transcriptomic metrics, and clarified their        associations with multiple neuropathologic traits. The results were        cross-validated in an independent dataset. Comparison of AD pathology-associated        RNA velocity with parallel gene expression differences reveals sets of genes and        molecular pathways that underlie the dynamic and static regimes of cell        type-specific dysregulations underlying the disease. Differential RNA velocity        and its linked progressive neuropathology point to significant dysregulations in        synaptic organization and cell development across cell types. Notably, most of        the genes underlying this synaptic dysregulation showed increased RNA velocity in        AD subjects compared to controls. Accelerated cell changes were also observed in        the AD subjects, suggesting that the precocious depletion of precursor cell pools        might be associated with neurodegeneration. Overall, this study uncovers active        molecular drivers of the spatiotemporal alterations in AD and offers novel        insights towards gene- and cell-centric therapeutic strategies accounting for        dynamic cell perturbations and synaptic disruptions.",37b43afb154e2344ee72e6f70200524db8fbeb09,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/37b43afb154e2344ee72e6f70200524db8fbeb09,38538816,PMC10973452,,False,Scientific reports,101563288,0.4003976583480835,0.06976744186046512,0,4.996,0.06030150753768844,0.3165829145728643,0.204558937565194

However, utilizing GWAS and        multi-omics data to identify high-confidence AD risk genes (ARGs) and druggable        targets that can guide development of new therapeutics for patients suffering        from AD has heretofore not been successful. METHODS: To address this critical        problem in the field, we have developed a network-based artificial intelligence        framework that is capable of integrating multi-omics data along with human        protein-protein interactome networks to accurately infer accurate drug targets        impacted by GWAS-identified variants to identify new therapeutics. When applied        to AD, this approach integrates GWAS findings, multi-omics data from brain        samples of AD patients and AD transgenic animal models, drug-target networks, and        the human protein-protein interactome, along with large-scale patient database        validation and in vitro mechanistic observations in human microglia cells.        RESULTS: Through this approach, we identified 103 ARGs validated by various        levels of pathobiological evidence in AD. Via network-based prediction and        population-based validation, we then showed that three drugs (pioglitazone,        febuxostat, and atenolol) are significantly associated with decreased risk of AD        compared with matched control populations. Pioglitazone usage is significantly        associated with decreased risk of AD (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.916, 95% confidence        interval [CI] 0.861-0.974, P = 0.005) in a retrospective case-control validation.        Pioglitazone is a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) agonist used        to treat type 2 diabetes, and propensity score matching cohort studies confirmed        its association with reduced risk of AD in comparison to glipizide (HR = 0.921,        95% CI 0.862-0.984, P = 0.0159), an insulin secretagogue that is also used to        treat type 2 diabetes. In vitro experiments showed that pioglitazone        downregulated glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β) and cyclin-dependent kinase        (CDK5) in human microglia cells, supporting a possible mechanism-of-action for        its beneficial effect in AD.

We propose a scalable        knockoff-based method for the analysis of common and rare variants across the        genome, KnockoffScreen-AL, that is applicable to biobank-scale studies with        hundreds of thousands of samples and millions of genetic variants. The        application of KnockoffScreen-AL to the analysis of Alzheimer disease (AD) in        388,051 WG-imputed samples from the UK Biobank resulted in 31 significant loci,        including 14 loci that are missed by conventional association tests on these        data.

METHODS: We systematically        assessed the intercellular communication networks by using a discovery snRNA-seq        dataset comprising 69,499 nuclei from 48 human postmortem prefrontal cortex (PFC)        samples. We replicated the findings using an independent snRNA-seq dataset of        56,440 nuclei from 18 PFC samples. By integrating genetic signals from AD        genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary statistics and whole genome        sequencing (WGS) data, we prioritized AD-associated Gene Ontology (GO) terms        containing dysregulated LR interactions. We further explored drug repurposing for        the prioritized LR pairs using the Therapeutic Targets Database. RESULTS: We        identified 190 dysregulated LR interactions across six major cell types in AD        PFC, of which 107 pairs were replicated. Among the replicated LR signals, we        found globally downregulated communications in the astrocytes-to-neurons        signaling axis, characterized, for instance, by the downregulation of        APOE-related and Calmodulin (CALM)-related LR interactions and their potential        regulatory connections to target genes.

The increasing worldwide life expectancy, together with the scarcity of available        treatment choices, makes it thus pressing to find the molecular basis of AD and        PD so that the causing mechanisms can be targeted. To study these mechanisms,        gene expression profiles have been compared between diseased and control brain        tissues. However, this approach is limited by mRNA expression profiles derived        for brain tissues highly reflecting their degeneration in cellular composition        but not necessarily disease-related molecular states. We therefore propose to        account for cell type composition when comparing transcriptomes of healthy and        diseased brain samples, so that the loss of neurons can be decoupled from        pathology-associated molecular effects. This approach allowed us to identify        genes and pathways putatively altered systemically and in a cell-type-dependent        manner in AD and PD brains. Moreover, using chemical perturbagen data, we        computationally identified candidate small molecules for specifically targeting        the profiled AD/PD-associated molecular alterations.

Many currently untreatable        diseases arise due to variations in, and through a combination of, multiple        stressors of genetic, epigenetic, and environmental nature. Unfortunately, how        such stressors lead to a specific disease phenotype or inflict a vulnerability to        some cells and tissues but not others remains largely unknown and        unsatisfactorily addressed. Analysis of cell- and tissue-specific interactome        networks may shed light on organization of biological systems and subsequently to        disease vulnerabilities. However, deriving human interactomes across different        cell and disease contexts remains a challenge. To this end, this opinion article        links stressor-induced protein interactome network perturbations to the formation        of pathologic scaffolds termed epichaperomes, revealing a viable and reproducible        experimental solution to obtaining rigorous context-dependent interactomes.

Here, we profile epigenomic and transcriptomic landscapes of 850,000        nuclei from prefrontal cortexes of 92 individuals with and without AD to build a        map of the brain regulome, including epigenomic profiles, transcriptional        regulators, co-accessibility modules, and peak-to-gene links in a        cell-type-specific manner. We develop methods for multimodal integration and        detecting regulatory modules using peak-to-gene linking.

We detect 9,628 cell-type-specific ATAC-QTL loci, which we integrate        alongside peak-to-gene links to prioritize AD variant regulatory circuits. We        report differential accessibility of regulatory modules in late AD in glia and in        early AD in neurons.

One-third of PD patients are diagnosed with dementia,        a pre-symptom of AD, but the underlying mechanism is elusive. Amyloid beta (Aβ)        and α-synuclein are two of the most investigated proteins, whose pathological        aggregation and spreading are crucial to the pathogenesis of AD and PD,        respectively. Transcriptomic studies of the mammalian central nervous system shed        light on gene expression profiles at molecular levels, regarding the complexity        of neuronal morphologies and electrophysiological inputs/outputs. In the last        decade, the booming of the single-cell RNA sequencing technique helped to        understand gene expression patterns, alternative splicing, novel transcripts, and        signal pathways in the nervous system at single-cell levels, providing insight        for molecular taxonomy and mechanistic targets of the degenerative nervous        system. Here, we re-visited the cell-cell transmission mechanisms of Aβ and        α-synuclein in mediating disease propagation, and summarized recent single-cell        transcriptome sequencing from different perspectives and discussed its        understanding of neurodegenerative diseases.",3605ec1cc8f875e539ddedfd1868f71176d4c254,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3605ec1cc8f875e539ddedfd1868f71176d4c254,34867177,PMC8636772,,False,Frontiers in neuroscience,101478481,0.36840569972991943,0.024096385542168676,1,5.152,0.17587939698492464,0.34673366834170855,0.1985522239348383
10.1002/med.21709,Harnessing endophenotypes and network medicine for Alzheimer's drug repurposing.,2020.0,"Following two decades of more than 400 clinical trials centered on the ""one drug,        one target, one disease"" paradigm, there is still no effective disease-modifying        therapy for Alzheimer's disease (AD). The inherent complexity of AD may challenge        this reductionist strategy. Recent observations and advances in network medicine        further indicate that AD likely shares common underlying mechanisms and        intermediate pathophenotypes, or endophenotypes, with other diseases. In this        review, we consider AD pathobiology, disease comorbidity, pleiotropy, and        therapeutic development, and construct relevant endophenotype networks to guide        future therapeutic development. Specifically, we discuss six main endophenotype        hypotheses in AD: amyloidosis, tauopathy, neuroinflammation, mitochondrial        dysfunction, vascular dysfunction, and lysosomal dysfunction. We further consider        how this endophenotype network framework can provide advances in computational        and experimental strategies for drug-repurposing and identification of new        candidate therapeutic strategies for patients suffering from or at risk for AD.        We highlight new opportunities for endophenotype-informed, drug discovery in AD,        by exploiting multi-omics data. Integration of genomics, transcriptomics,        radiomics, pharmacogenomics, and interactomics (protein-protein interactions) are        essential for successful drug discovery. We describe experimental technologies        for AD drug discovery including human induced pluripotent stem cells, transgenic        mouse/rat models, and population-based retrospective case-control studies that        may be integrated with multi-omics in a network medicine methodology. In summary,        endophenotype-based network medicine methodologies will promote AD therapeutic        development that will optimize the usefulness of available data and support deep        phenotyping of the patient heterogeneity for personalized medicine in AD.",ab7e6eeab65f853675f693b8196d34fc640cf008,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ab7e6eeab65f853675f693b8196d34fc640cf008,32656864,PMC7561446,,False,Medicinal research reviews,8103150,0.36681652069091797,0.010676156583629894,54,12.388,0.8743718592964824,0.6834170854271356,0.34798376054927005

AD pathology-associated microglial populations have been        identified with single-cell RNA-Seq, but have not been validated in human brain        tissue with anatomical context. Here, we quantified myeloid cell markers to        identify changes in AD pathology-associated microglial populations. We performed        fluorescent immunohistochemistry on normal (n = 8) and AD (n = 8) middle temporal        gyri, co-labelling the pan-myeloid cell marker, Iba1, with one of 11 markers of        interest (MOIs): CD45, HLA-DR, CD14, CD74, CD33, CD206, CD32, CD163, P2RY12,        TMEM119, L-Ferritin. Novel image analyses quantified the single-cell abundance of        Iba1 and each MOI. Each cell was gated into one Iba1-MOI population (Iba1(low)        MOI(high), Iba1(high) MOI(high), or Iba1(high) MOI(low)) and the abundance of        each population was compared between AD and control. Triple-labelling of        L-Ferritin and Iba1 with a subset of MOIs was performed to investigate        L-Ferritin-MOI co-expression on Iba1(low) cells. Iba1(low) MOI(high) myeloid cell        populations delineated by MOIs CD45, HLA-DR, CD14, CD74, CD33, CD32, and        L-Ferritin were increased in AD. Further investigation of the Iba1(low) MOI(high)        populations revealed that their abundances correlated with tau, but not amyloid        beta, load in AD. The Iba1(low) microglial population highly expressed        L-Ferritin, reflecting microglial dysfunction. The L-Ferritin(high) CD74(high)        HLA-DR(high) phenotype of the Iba1(low) population mirrors that of a human AD        pathology-associated microglial subpopulation previously identified using        single-cell RNA-Seq.

Therefore, it is necessary to systematically explore brain cell        communications when considering factors such as sex and brain region. METHODS: We        extracted a total of 1,039,459 cells derived from 28 brain single-cell        RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) or single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) datasets        from the GEO database, including 12 human and 16 mouse datasets. These datasets        were further divided into 71 new sub-datasets when considering disease, sex, and        region conditions. In the meanwhile, we integrated four methods to evaluate        ligand-receptor interaction score among six major brain cell types (microglia,        neuron, astrocyte, oligodendrocyte, OPC, and endothelial cell). RESULTS: For        Alzheimer's disease (AD), disease-specific ligand-receptor pairs when compared        with normal sub-datasets, such as SEMA4A-NRP1, were identified. Furthermore, we        explored the sex- and region-specific cell communications and identified that        WNT5A-ROR1 among microglia cells displayed close communications in male, and        SPP1-ITGAV displayed close communications in the meninges region from microglia        to neurons. Furthermore, based on the AD-specific cell communications, we        constructed a model for AD early prediction and confirmed the predictive        performance using multiple independent datasets. Finally, we developed an online        platform for researchers to explore brain condition-specific cell communications.

Its onset is        insidious and its progression is slow, making diagnosis difficult. In addition,        its underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms remain unclear. In this study,        clustering analysis was performed on single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data        from the prefrontal cortex of 48 AD patients. Each sample module was identified        to be a specific AD cell type, eight main brain cell types were identified, and        the dysfunctional evolution of each cell type was further explored by pseudo-time        analysis. Correlation analysis was then used to explore the relationship between        AD cell types and pathological characteristics. In particular, intercellular        communication between neurons and glial cells in AD patients was investigated by        cell communication analysis. In patients, neuronal cells and glial cells        significantly correlated with pathological features, and glial cells appear to        play a key role in the development of AD through ligand-receptor axis        communication. Marker genes involved in communication between these two cell        types were identified using five types of modeling: logistic regression,        multivariate logistic regression, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator        (LASSO) and support vector machine (SVM). LASSO modeling identified CXCR4, EGFR,        MAP4K4, and IGF1R as key genes in this communication. Our results support the        idea that microglia play a role in the occurrence and development of AD through        ligand-receptor axis communication.

We performed multimodal single-nuclei        analyses of post-mortem frontal cortex from RedPenMC, including transcriptomics        and global levels of chromatin marks.

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are lipid bilayer-delimited particles that are        released from almost all types of cell. Genome-wide association studies have        linked multiple AD genetic risk factors to microglia-specific pathways. It is        plausible that microglia-derived EVs may play a role in the progression of AD by        contributing to the dissemination of insoluble pathogenic proteins, such as tau        and Aβ. Despite the potential utility of EVs as a diagnostic tool, our knowledge        of human brain EV subpopulations is limited. Here we present a method for        isolating microglial CD11b-positive small EVs from cryopreserved human brain        tissue, as well as an integrated multiomics analysis of microglial EVs enriched        from the parietal cortex of four late-stage AD (Braak V-VI) and three age-matched        normal/low pathology (NL) cases. This integrated analysis revealed 1,000        proteins, 594 lipids, and 105 miRNAs using shotgun proteomics, targeted        lipidomics, and NanoString nCounter technology, respectively. The results showed        a significant reduction in the abundance of homeostatic microglia markers P2RY12        and TMEM119, and increased levels of disease-associated microglia markers FTH1        and TREM2, in CD11b-positive EVs from AD brain compared to NL cases. Tau        abundance was significantly higher in AD brain-derived microglial EVs. These        changes were accompanied by the upregulation of synaptic and neuron-specific        proteins in the AD group. Levels of free cholesterol were elevated in microglial        EVs from the AD brain. Lipidomic analysis also revealed a proinflammatory lipid        profile, endolysosomal dysfunction, and a significant AD-associated decrease in        levels of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)-containing polyunsaturated lipids,        suggesting a potential defect in acyl-chain remodeling. Additionally, four miRNAs        associated with immune and cellular senescence signaling pathways were        significantly upregulated in the AD group. Our data suggest that loss of the        homeostatic microglia signature in late AD stages may be accompanied by        endolysosomal impairment and the release of undigested neuronal and myelin        debris, including tau, through extracellular vesicles.

The progressive dementia associated with AD currently        has no cure. Although clinical trials in patients are ultimately required to find        safe and effective drugs, animal models of AD permit the integration of brain        pathologies with learning and memory deficits that are the first step in        developing these new drugs. The purpose of the Alzheimer's Association Business        Consortium Think Tank meeting was to address the unmet need to improve the        discovery and successful development of Alzheimer's therapies. We hypothesize        that positive responses to new therapies observed in validated models of AD will        provide predictive evidence for positive responses to these same therapies in AD        patients. To achieve this goal, we convened a meeting of experts to explore the        current state of AD animal models, identify knowledge gaps, and recommend actions        for development of next-generation models with better predictability. Among our        findings, we all recognize that models reflecting only single aspects of AD        pathogenesis do not mimic AD. Models or combinations of new models are needed        that incorporate genetics with environmental interactions, timing of disease        development, heterogeneous mechanisms and pathways, comorbidities, and other        pathologies that lead to AD and related dementias. Selection of the best models        requires us to address the following: (1) which animal species, strains, and        genetic backgrounds are most appropriate; (2) which models permit efficient use        throughout the drug development pipeline; (3) the translatability of        behavioral-cognitive assays from animals to patients; and (4) how to match        potential AD therapeutics with particular models. Best practice guidelines to        improve reproducibility also need to be developed for consistent use of these        models in different research settings.

Single-nuclei and single-cell RNA-seq have revealed multiple states or        subpopulations of these glial cells but lack spatial information. We have        developed a methodology of cyclic multiplex fluorescent immunohistochemistry on        human postmortem brains and image analysis that enables a comprehensive        morphological quantitative characterization of astrocytes and microglia in the        context of their spatial relationships with plaques and tangles. METHODS: Single        FFPE sections from the temporal association cortex of control and AD subjects        were subjected to 8 cycles of multiplex fluorescent immunohistochemistry,        including 7 astroglial, 6 microglial, 1 neuronal, Aβ, and phospho-tau markers.        Our analysis pipeline consisted of: (1) image alignment across cycles; (2)        background subtraction; (3) manual annotation of 5172 ALDH1L1+ astrocytic and        6226 IBA1+ microglial profiles; (4) local thresholding and segmentation of        profiles; (5) machine learning on marker intensity data; and (6) deep learning on        image features. RESULTS: Spectral clustering identified three phenotypes of        astrocytes and microglia, which we termed ""homeostatic,"" ""intermediate,"" and        ""reactive."" Reactive and, to a lesser extent, intermediate astrocytes and        microglia were closely associated with AD pathology (≤ 50 µm). Compared to        homeostatic, reactive astrocytes contained substantially higher GFAP and YKL-40,        modestly elevated vimentin and TSPO as well as EAAT1, and reduced GS.        Intermediate astrocytes had markedly increased EAAT2, moderately increased GS,        and intermediate GFAP and YKL-40 levels. Relative to homeostatic, reactive        microglia showed increased expression of all markers (CD68, ferritin, MHC2,        TMEM119, TSPO), whereas intermediate microglia exhibited increased ferritin and        TMEM119 as well as intermediate CD68 levels. Machine learning models applied on        either high-plex signal intensity data (gradient boosting machines) or directly        on image features (convolutional neural networks) accurately discriminated        control vs. AD diagnoses at the single-cell level.

However, those advances have been mostly        limited to transcriptomic data. With recent developments in single-cell DNA        methylation (scDNAm), there are emerging opportunities for deconvolving bulk DNAm        data, particularly for solid tissues like brain that lack cell-type references.        Due to technical limitations, current scDNAm sequences represent a small        proportion of the whole genome for each single cell, and those detected regions        differ across cells. This makes scDNAm data ultra-high dimensional and        ultra-sparse. To deal with these challenges, we introduce scMD (single cell        Methylation Deconvolution), a cellular deconvolution framework to reliably        estimate cell type fractions from tissue-level DNAm data. To analyze large-scale        complex scDNAm data, scMD employs a statistical approach to aggregate scDNAm data        at the cell cluster level, identify cell-type marker DNAm sites, and create        precise cell-type signature matrixes that surpass state-of-the-art sorted-cell or        RNA-derived references. Through thorough benchmarking in several datasets, we        demonstrate scMD's superior performance in estimating cellular fractions from        bulk DNAm data.

Spatially resolved transcriptomic data were        obtained from 5XFAD AD models and age-matched control mice. Differentially        expressed genes were identified using spots clustered by anatomical structures.

We identified early        alterations in the white matter (WM) of the AD model before the definite        accumulation of amyloid plaques in the gray matter (GM). Changes in the early        stage of the disease involved primarily glial cell activation in the WM, whereas        the changes in the later stage of pathology were prominent in the GM. We        confirmed that disease-associated microglia (DAM) and astrocyte (DAA) signatures        also showed initial changes in WM and that activation spreads to GM.

Recent work has identified certain        subpopulations of neurons in a few focal regions of interest, such as the        entorhinal cortex, that are selectively vulnerable to tau pathology in AD.        However, the cellular underpinnings of regional susceptibility to tau pathology        are currently unknown, primarily because whole-brain maps of a comprehensive        collection of cell types have been inaccessible. Here, we deployed a recent        cell-type mapping pipeline, Matrix Inversion and Subset Selection (MISS), to        determine the brain-wide distributions of pan-hippocampal and neocortical        neuronal and non-neuronal cells in the mouse using recently available single-cell        RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) data. We then performed a robust set of analyses to        identify general principles of cell-type-based selective vulnerability using        these cell-type distributions, utilizing 5 transgenic mouse studies that        quantified regional tau in 12 distinct PS19 mouse models. Using our approach,        which constitutes the broadest exploration of whole-brain selective vulnerability        to date, we were able to discover cell types and cell-type classes that conferred        vulnerability and resilience to tau pathology. Hippocampal glutamatergic neurons        as a whole were strongly positively associated with regional tau deposition,        suggesting vulnerability, while cortical glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons were        negatively associated. Among glia, we identified oligodendrocytes as the        single-most strongly negatively associated cell type, whereas microglia were        consistently positively correlated. Strikingly, we found that there was no        association between the gene expression relationships between cell types and        their vulnerability or resilience to tau pathology. When we looked at the        explanatory power of cell types versus GWAS-identified AD risk genes, cell type        distributions were consistently more predictive of end-timepoint tau pathology        than regional gene expression. To understand the functional enrichment patterns        of the genes that were markers of the identified vulnerable or resilient cell        types, we performed gene ontology analysis. We found that the genes that are        directly correlated to tau pathology are functionally distinct from those that        constitutively embody the vulnerable cells. In short, we have demonstrated that        regional cell-type composition is a compelling explanation for the selective        vulnerability observed in tauopathic diseases at a whole-brain level and is        distinct from that conferred by risk genes.

Although        significant progress has been made into identifying genetic variants associated        with these diseases, these studies have also uncovered that these disorders are        mostly genetically complex and thus challenging to model in non-human systems.        Improvements in such models might benefit from understanding the evolution of the        human genome and how such modifications have affected brain development and        function. The intersection of genome-wide variant information with        cell-type-specific expression and epigenetic information will further assist in        resolving the contribution of particular cell types in evolution or disease. For        example, the role of non-neuronal cells in brain evolution and cognitive        disorders has gone mostly underappreciated until the recent availability of        single-cell transcriptomic approaches. In this review, we discuss recent studies        that carry out cell-type-specific assessments of gene expression in brain tissue        across primates and between healthy and disease populations.

The field has progressed by taking the CNS as a primary research        subject - the cellular complexity and multiplicity of neuronal cell types provide        fertile ground for the increasing power of single-cell methods. Current        single-cell RNA sequencing methods can quantify gene expression with sufficient        accuracy to finely resolve even subtle differences between cell types and states,        thus providing a great tool for studying the molecular and cellular repertoire of        the CNS and its disorders. However, single-cell RNA sequencing requires the        dissociation of tissue samples, which means that the interrelationships between        cells are lost. Spatial transcriptomic methods bypass tissue dissociation and        retain this spatial information, thereby allowing gene expression to be assessed        across thousands of cells within the context of tissue structural organization.        Here, we discuss how single-cell and spatially resolved transcriptomics have been        contributing to unravelling the pathomechanisms underlying brain disorders. We        focus on three areas where we feel these new technologies have provided        particularly useful insights: selective neuronal vulnerability, neuroimmune        dysfunction and cell-type-specific treatment response.

We detected cell-proportion changes in        AD brains that are robustly replicable across the three independently assessed        cohorts.

Clinical research and genome-wide association studies have suggested a        potential contribution of the endocytic pathway to AD, with an emphasis on common        loci. However, the contribution of rare variants in this pathway to AD has not        been thoroughly investigated. In this study, we focused on the effect of rare        variants on AD by first applying a rare-variant gene-set burden analysis using        genes in the endocytic pathway on over 3,000 individuals with European ancestry        from three large whole-genome sequencing (WGS) studies. We identified significant        associations of rare-variant burden within the endocytic pathway with AD, which        were successfully replicated in independent datasets. We further demonstrated        that this endocytic rare-variant enrichment is associated with neurofibrillary        tangles (NFTs) and age-related phenotypes, increasing the risk of obtaining        severer brain damage, earlier age-at-onset, and earlier age-of-death. Next, by        aggregating rare variants within each gene, we sought to identify single        endocytic genes associated with AD and NFTs. Careful examination using NFTs        revealed one significantly associated gene, ANKRD13D. To identify functional        associations, we integrated bulk RNA-Seq data from over 600 brain tissues and        found two endocytic expression genes (eGenes), HLA-A and SLC26A7, that displayed        significant influences on their gene expressions. Differential expressions        between AD patients and controls of these three identified genes were further        examined by incorporating scRNA-Seq data from 48 post-mortem brain samples and        demonstrated distinct expression patterns across cell types. Taken together, our        results demonstrated strong rare-variant effect in the endocytic pathway on AD        risk and progression and functional effect of gene expression alteration in both        bulk and single-cell resolution, which may bring more insight and serve as        valuable resources for future AD genetic studies, clinical research, and        therapeutic targeting.",19c37f77893352f093e655302c6844b796cd54b3,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/19c37f77893352f093e655302c6844b796cd54b3,34516545,PMC8460036,"methodology,result,background",True,PLoS genetics,101239074,0.3127897083759308,0.022556390977443608,1,6.02,0.18592964824120603,0.4271356783919598,0.19481926789873155

Over 130        AD-associated susceptibility loci have been identified by genome-wide association        studies (GWAS), while whole genome sequencing (WGS) and whole exome sequencing        (WES) studies have identified AD-associated rare variants. These variants are        enriched in APOE, TREM2, CR1, CD33, CLU, BIN1, CD2AP, PILRA, SCIMP, PICALM,        SORL1, SPI1, RIN3, and more genes. Given that aging is the single largest risk        factor for late-onset AD (LOAD), the accumulation of somatic mutations in the        brain and blood of AD patients have also been explored. Collectively, these        genetic findings implicate the role of innate and adaptive immunity in LOAD        pathogenesis and suggest that a systemic failure of cell-mediated amyloid-β (Aβ)        clearance contributes to AD onset and progression. AD-associated variants are        particularly enriched in myeloid-specific regulatory regions, implying that AD        risk variants are likely to perturbate the expression of myeloid-specific        AD-associated genes to interfere Aβ clearance. Defective phagocytosis,        endocytosis, and autophagy may drive Aβ accumulation, which may be related to        naturally-occurring antibodies to Aβ (Nabs-Aβ) produced by adaptive responses.        Passive immunisation is providing efficiency in clearing Aβ and slowing cognitive        decline, such as aducanumab, donanemab, and lecanemab (ban2401). Causation of AD        by impairment of the innate immunity and treatment using the tools of adaptive        immunity is emerging as a new paradigm for AD, but immunotherapy that boosts the        innate immune functions of myeloid cells is highly expected to modulate disease        progression at asymptomatic stage.",7c93a53d47e4aecee2eecda001a4bdd239aeab75,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7c93a53d47e4aecee2eecda001a4bdd239aeab75,34708251,PMC11073066,,False,Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS,9705402,0.30923226475715637,0.0213903743315508,36,9.207,0.7889447236180904,0.6331658291457286,0.31464241207434007

While they share pathological tau        aggregation as a common feature, tauopathies are distinct from one another with        respect to predominant tau isoforms that accumulate and the selective        vulnerability of brain regions and cell types that have tau inclusions.

AD patient-derived directly induced neurons (iNs)        exhibit strong transcriptomic, epigenetic, and molecular biomarker signatures,        indicating a specific human neuronal senescence-like state. AD iN single-cell        transcriptomics revealed that senescent-like neurons face oncogenic challenges        and metabolic dysfunction as well as display a pro-inflammatory signature.        Integrative profiling of the inflammatory secretome of AD iNs and patient        cerebral spinal fluid revealed a neuronal senescence-associated secretory        phenotype that could trigger astrogliosis in human astrocytes. Finally, we show        that targeting senescence-like neurons with senotherapeutics could be a strategy        for preventing or treating AD.",fe853282fe835eb4d97ffc2d532877de0daf7224,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/fe853282fe835eb4d97ffc2d532877de0daf7224,36459967,PMC10093780,,False,Cell stem cell,101311472,0.3020821511745453,0.0,42,25.269,0.8241206030150754,0.9095477386934674,0.350674896608645

Targeting of disease-defining markers in conditions such as Alzheimer disease        (amyloid-β and tau) or Parkinson disease (α-synuclein) has been met with limited        success, suggesting that these proteins do not act in isolation but form part of        a pathological network. This network could involve phenotypic alteration of        multiple cell types in the CNS, including astrocytes, which have a major        neurosupportive, homeostatic role in the healthy CNS but adopt reactive states        under acute or chronic adverse conditions.

However, their role in tau pathology        progression in human brain has not been well described. Here, we characterized 32        human donors along progression of AD pathology, both in time-from early to late        pathology-and in space-from entorhinal cortex (EC), inferior temporal gyrus        (ITG), prefrontal cortex (PFC) to visual cortex (V2 and V1)-with biochemistry,        immunohistochemistry, and single nuclei-RNA-sequencing, profiling a total of        337,512 brain myeloid cells, including microglia. While the majority of microglia        are similar across brain regions, we identified a specific subset unique to EC        which may contribute to the early tau pathology present in this region. We        calculated conversion of microglia subtypes to diseased states and compared        conversion patterns to those from AD animal models. Targeting genes implicated in        this conversion, or their upstream/downstream pathways, could halt gene programs        initiated by early tau progression. We used expression patterns of early tau        progression to identify genes whose expression is reversed along spreading of        spatial tau pathology (EC > ITG > PFC > V2 > V1) and identified their potential        involvement in microglia subtype conversion to a diseased state. This study        provides a data resource that builds on our knowledge of myeloid cell        contribution to AD by defining the heterogeneity of microglia and brain        macrophages during both temporal and regional pathology aspects of AD progression        at an unprecedented resolution.",33ca8f3fe89fe23d59f1a2a94735869fb99e2e11,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/33ca8f3fe89fe23d59f1a2a94735869fb99e2e11,38557897,PMC10984903,"methodology,result,background",False,Acta neuropathologica,0412041,0.2989005148410797,0.05660377358490566,0,0.0,0.09045226130653267,0.1507537688442211,0.14849256840889924

Identifying common genetic variants driving differences in transcript        expression that confer AD risk is necessary to elucidate AD mechanism and develop        therapeutic interventions. We modify the FUSION transcriptome-wide association        study (TWAS) pipeline to ingest gene expression values from multiple neocortical        regions. METHODS: A combined dataset of 2003 genotypes clustered to 1000 Genomes        individuals from Utah with Northern and Western European ancestry (CEU) was used        to construct a training set of 790 genotypes paired to 888 RNASeq profiles from        temporal cortex (TCX = 248), prefrontal cortex (FP = 50), inferior frontal gyrus        (IFG = 41), superior temporal gyrus (STG = 34), parahippocampal cortex (PHG =        34), and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC = 461). Following within-tissue        normalization and covariate adjustment, predictive weights to impute expression        components based on a gene's surrounding cis-variants were trained. The FUSION        pipeline was modified to support input of pre-scaled expression values and        support cross validation with a repeated measure design arising from the presence        of multiple transcriptome samples from the same individual across different        tissues. RESULTS: Cis-variant architecture alone was informative to train weights        and impute expression for 6780 (49.67%) autosomal genes, the majority of which        significantly correlated with gene expression; FDR < 5%: N = 6775 (99.92%),        Bonferroni: N = 6716 (99.06%). Validation of weights in 515 matched genotype to        RNASeq profiles from the CommonMind Consortium (CMC) was (72.14%) in DLPFC        profiles.

Numerous gene expression profiling studies of        immunosorted CNS immune cells did not permit a clear dissection of their        phenotypes, particularly in diseases when peripheral cells of the immune system        come to play.

AD is characterized by changes in the behavior of the genome and can be traced        across multiple brain regions and cell types. It is mainly associated with        β-amyloid deposits and tau protein misfolding, leading to neurofibrillary        tangles.

METHODS: The pipeline utilized publicly available functional genomics data        sources including candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) from ENCODE and        single-nucleus (sn)RNA-seq data from LOAD patient samples. RESULTS: We catalogued        1581 SSVs in candidate cCREs in LOAD GWAS regions that disrupted 737 TF sites.        That included SSVs that disrupted the binding of RUNX3, SPI1, and SMAD3, within        the APOE-TOMM40, SPI1, and MS4A6A LOAD regions.

Decades after their discovery, the mechanisms by which these genes cause        Alzheimer's disease (AD) or promote AD progression are not fully understood.        While it is established that presenilin (PS) enzymatic activity produces        amyloid-β (Aβ), PSs also regulate numerous other cellular functions, some of        which intersect with known pathogenic drivers of neurodegeneration. Accumulating        evidence suggests that microglia, resident innate immune cells in the central        nervous system, play a key role in AD neurodegeneration. OBJECTIVE: Previous work        has identified a regulatory role for PS2 in microglia. We hypothesized that PSEN2        variants lead to dysregulated microglia, which could further contribute to        disease acceleration. To mimic the genotype of EOFAD patients, we created a        transgenic mouse expressing PSEN2 N141I on a mouse background expressing one        wildtype PS2 and two PS1 alleles. RESULTS: Microglial expression of PSEN2 N141I        resulted in impaired γ-secretase activity as well as exaggerated inflammatory        cytokine release, NFκB activity, and Aβ internalization. In vivo, PS2 N141I mice        showed enhanced IL-6 and TREM2 expression in brain as well as reduced branch        number and length, an indication of ""activated"" morphology, in the absence of        inflammatory stimuli. LPS intraperitoneal injection resulted in higher        inflammatory gene expression in PS2 N141I mouse brain relative to controls.        CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate that PSEN2 N141I heterozygosity is        associated with disrupted innate immune homeostasis, suggesting EOFAD variants        may promote disease progression through non-neuronal cells beyond canonical        dysregulated Aβ production.",111e54a7237adff73cea0e95e842b1ea1a1ac21d,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/111e54a7237adff73cea0e95e842b1ea1a1ac21d,32741831,PMC7592656,background,False,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,0.2971639037132263,0.03508771929824561,16,4.16,0.6030150753768844,0.25125628140703515,0.23132496235085406

We discover that        β-amyloid, a trigger of Alzheimer's disease (AD), promotes the formation of        pathological CREB3L2-ATF4 transcription factor heterodimers in neurons. Through a        multilevel approach based on AD datasets and a novel chemogenetic method that        resolves the genomic binding profile of dimeric transcription factors (ChIPmera),        we find that CREB3L2-ATF4 activates a transcription network that interacts with        roughly half of the genes differentially expressed in AD, including subsets        associated with β-amyloid and tau neuropathologies. CREB3L2-ATF4 activation        drives tau hyperphosphorylation and secretion in neurons, in addition to        misregulating the retromer, an endosomal complex linked to AD pathogenesis.

However, the        bulk samples analyzed in most studies are a mixture of different cell types. As a        result, the inferred co-expressions are confounded by varying cell type        compositions across samples and only offer an aggregated view of gene regulations        that may be distinct across different cell types. The advancement of single cell        RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology has enabled the direct inference of        co-expressions in specific cell types, facilitating our understanding of        cell-type-specific biological functions. However, the high sequencing depth        variations and measurement errors in scRNA-seq data present significant        challenges in inferring cell-type-specific gene co-expressions, and these issues        have not been adequately addressed in the existing methods. We propose a        statistical approach, CS-CORE, for estimating and testing cell-type-specific        co-expressions, built on a general expression-measurement model that explicitly        accounts for sequencing depth variations and measurement errors in the observed        single cell data. Systematic evaluations show that most existing methods suffer        from inflated false positives and biased co-expression estimates and clustering        analysis, whereas CS-CORE has appropriate false positive control, unbiased        co-expression estimates, good statistical power and satisfactory performance in        downstream co-expression analysis. When applied to analyze scRNA-seq data from        postmortem brain samples from Alzheimerâ€™s disease patients and controls and        blood samples from COVID-19 patients and controls, CS-CORE identified        cell-type-specific co-expressions and differential co-expressions that were more        reproducible and/or more enriched for relevant biological pathways than those        inferred from other methods.",8b1bb6ed1688ec771ae48943cc160de2426ca25c,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8b1bb6ed1688ec771ae48943cc160de2426ca25c,36561173,PMC9774209,methodology,False,bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology,101680187,0.29007506370544434,0.018518518518518517,11,0.0,0.5326633165829145,0.15577889447236182,0.19769625817733216

Although the        heritability of AD is high, the knowledge of the disease-associated genes, their        expression, and their disease-related pathways remain limited. Hence, finding the        association between gene dysfunctions and pathological mechanisms, such as        neuronal transports, APP processing, calcium homeostasis, and impairment in        mitochondria, should be crucial. Emerging studies have revealed that changes in        gene expression and gene regulation may have a strong impact on        neurodegeneration. The mRNA-transcription factor interactions, non-coding RNAs,        alternative splicing, or copy number variants could also play a role in disease        onset. These facts suggest that understanding the impact of transcriptomes in AD        may improve the disease diagnosis and also the therapies.

Single-cell RNA sequencing        (scRNA-seq) enables high-resolution identification of cells and exploration of        cell heterogeneity, shedding light on cell differentiation/maturation and        functional differences. Recent advancements in multimodal sequencing technologies        have focused on improving access to cell-specific subgroups for functional        genomics analysis. To facilitate the functional annotation of cell groups and        characterization of molecular mechanisms underlying cell trajectories, we        introduce the Pathways, Annotated Gene Lists, and Gene Signatures Electronic        Repository for Single-Cell Functional Genomics Analysis (PAGER-scFGA). Results:        We have developed PAGER-scFGA, which integrates cell functional annotations and        gene-set enrichment analysis into popular single-cell analysis pipelines such as        Scanpy. Using differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from pairwise cell clusters,        PAGER-scFGA infers cell functions through the enrichment of potential cell-marker        genesets. Moreover, PAGER-scFGA provides pathways, annotated gene lists, and gene        signatures (PAGs) enriched in specific cell subsets with tissue compositions and        continuous transitions along cell trajectories. Additionally, PAGER-scFGA enables        the construction of a gene subcellular map based on DEGs and allows examination        of the gene functional compartments (GFCs) underlying cell        maturation/differentiation. In a real-world case study of mouse natural killer        (mNK) cells, PAGER-scFGA revealed two major stages of natural killer (NK) cells        and three trajectories from the precursor stage to NK T-like mature stage within        blood, spleen, and bone marrow tissues. As the trajectories progress to later        stages, the DEGs exhibit greater divergence and variability. However, the DEGs in        different trajectories still interact within a network during NK cell maturation.        Notably, PAGER-scFGA unveiled cell cytotoxicity, exocytosis, and the response to        interleukin (IL) signaling pathways and associated network models during the        progression from precursor NK cells to mature NK cells. Conclusion: PAGER-scFGA        enables in-depth exploration of functional insights and presents a comprehensive        knowledge map of gene networks and GFCs, which can be utilized for future studies        and hypothesis generation.

Although microglial dysregulation is a cardinal feature of AD, the extensive        heterogeneity of these immunological cells in the brain has impeded our        understanding of their contribution to this disease. Here, we identify a        pathogenic microglial subset which expresses the CD11c surface marker as the sole        producer of Osteopontin (OPN) in the 5XFAD mouse model of AD. OPN production        divides Disease-Associated Microglia (DAM) into two functionally distinct        subsets, i.e., a protective CD11c(+)OPN(-) subset that robustly ingests amyloid β        (Aβ) in a noninflammatory fashion and a pathogenic CD11c(+)OPN(+) subset that        produces proinflammatory cytokines and fails to ingest significant amounts of Aβ.        Genetic ablation of OPN or administration of monoclonal anti-OPN antibody to        5XFAD mice reduces proinflammatory microglia, plaque formation, and numbers of        dystrophic neurites and results in improved cognitive function. Analysis of brain        tissue from AD patients indicates that levels of OPN-producing CD11c(+) microglia        correlate strongly with the degree of cognitive deficit and AD neuropathology.

In people aged 65 and older, it is estimated that 1 in 9 currently live with the        disease. With aging being the greatest risk factor for disease onset, the        physiological, social and economic burden continues to rise. Thus, AD remains a        public health priority. Since 2007, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have        identified over 80 genomic loci with variants associated with increased AD risk.        Although some variants are beginning to be characterized, the effects of many        risk loci remain to be elucidated. One advancement which may help provide a        patient-focused approach to tackle this issue is the application of gene editing        technology and human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). The relatively        non-invasive acquisition of cells from patients with known AD risk loci may        provide important insights into the pathological role of these risk variants.

WM changes have overwhelmingly been investigated in typical, amnestic        mild cognitive impairment and AD; fewer studies have addressed WM change in        atypical, non-amnestic syndromes. We hypothesized each non-amnestic AD syndrome        would exhibit WM differences from amnestic and other non-amnestic syndromes.        MATERIALS AND METHODS: Participants included 45 cognitively normal (CN)        individuals; 41 amnestic AD patients; and 67 patients with non-amnestic AD        syndromes including logopenic-variant primary progressive aphasia (lvPPA, n        = 32), posterior cortical atrophy (PCA, n = 17), behavioral variant AD (bvAD, n        = 10), and corticobasal syndrome (CBS, n = 8). All had T1-weighted MRI and        30-direction diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). We performed whole-brain        deterministic tractography between 148 cortical and subcortical regions;        connection strength was quantified by tractwise mean generalized fractional        anisotropy. Regression models assessed effects of group and phenotype as well as        associations with grey matter volume. Topological analyses assessed differences        in persistent homology (numbers of graph components and cycles). Additionally, we        tested associations of topological metrics with global cognition, disease        duration, and DWI microstructural metrics. RESULTS: Both amnestic and        non-amnestic patients exhibited lower WM connection strength than CN participants        in corpus callosum, cingulum, and inferior and superior longitudinal fasciculi.        Overall, non-amnestic patients had more WM disease than amnestic patients. LvPPA        patients had left-lateralized WM degeneration; PCA patients had reductions in        connections to bilateral posterior parietal, occipital, and temporal areas.        Topological analysis showed the non-amnestic but not the amnestic group had more        connected components than controls, indicating persistently lower connectivity.        Longer disease duration and cognitive impairment were associated with more        connected components and fewer cycles in individuals' brain graphs. DISCUSSION:        We have previously reported syndromic differences in GM degeneration and tau        accumulation between AD syndromes; here we find corresponding differences in WM        tracts connecting syndrome-specific epicenters. Determining the reasons for        selective WM degeneration in non-amnestic AD is a research priority that will        require integration of knowledge from neuroimaging, biomarker, autopsy, and        functional genetic studies.

To elucidate the polygenic architecture of AD        phenotypes at a cellular level, we established induced pluripotent stem cells        from 102 patients with AD, differentiated them into cortical neurons and        conducted a genome-wide analysis of the neuronal production of amyloid β (Aβ).        Using such a cellular dissection of polygenicity (CDiP) approach, we identified        24 significant genome-wide loci associated with alterations in Aβ production,        including some loci not previously associated with AD, and confirmed the        influence of some of the corresponding genes on Aβ levels by the use of small        interfering RNA.

However, through powerful advances in research tools and the use of novel cell        culture and animal models, researchers have recently begun to study the roles of        APOE4 in AD in a cell type-specific manner and at a deeper and more mechanistic        level than ever before. In particular, cutting-edge omics studies have enabled        APOE4 to be studied at the single-cell level and have allowed the identification        of critical APOE4 effects in AD-vulnerable cellular subtypes. Through these        studies, it has become evident that APOE4 produced in various types of CNS cell -        including astrocytes, neurons, microglia, oligodendrocytes and vascular cells -        has diverse roles in AD pathogenesis. Here, we review these scientific advances        and propose a cell type-specific APOE4 cascade model of AD. In this model,        neuronal APOE4 emerges as a crucial pathological initiator and driver of AD        pathogenesis, instigating glial responses and, ultimately, neurodegeneration.

The cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this        clinical phenomenon remain elusive and ill-defined. METHODS: In-depth analyses        were performed with multiple human LOAD single-nucleus transcriptome datasets to        thoroughly characterize cell populations in the cerebral cortex. ROSMAP bulk        human brain tissue transcriptome and DNA methylome datasets were also included        for validation. Detailed assessments of microglial cell subpopulations and their        relevance to sex-biased changes at the tissue level were performed. Clinical        trait associations, cell evolutionary trajectories, and transcription regulon        analyses were conducted. RESULTS: The relative numbers of functionally defective        microglia were aberrantly increased uniquely among affected females.        Substratification of the microglia into different subtypes according to their        transcriptomic signatures identified a group of female-enriched and        disease-associated microglia (FDAMic), the numbers of which were positively        associated with disease severity. Phenotypically, these cells exhibit        transcriptomic signatures that support active proliferation, MHC class II        autoantigen presentation and amyloid-β binding, but they are also likely        defective in phagocytosis. FDAMic are likely evolved from female activated        response microglia (ARMic) with an APOE4 background and compromised estrogen        receptor (ER) signaling that is deemed to be active among most subtypes of        microglia. CONCLUSION: This study offered important insights at both the cellular        and molecular levels into how ER signaling affects microglial heterogeneity and        function. FDAMic are associated with more advanced pathologies and severe trends        of cognitive decline. Their emergence could, at least in part, explain the        phenomenon of greater penetrance of the APOE4 genotype found in females. The        biases of FDAMic emergence toward female sex and APOE4 status may also explain        why hormone replacement therapy is more effective in APOE4 carriers. The        pathologic nature of FDAMic suggests that selective modulations of these cells        may help to regain brain neuroimmune homeostasis, serving as a new target for        future drug development.",95e4121223a2a8fa1eb5509ae56961c50832fa2e,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/95e4121223a2a8fa1eb5509ae56961c50832fa2e,38178204,PMC10765928,methodology,True,Journal of neuroinflammation,101222974,0.2717345654964447,0.06716417910447761,1,9.587,0.20100502512562815,0.6532663316582915,0.2365267448083124

Here, using        human post-mitotic neurons with rare familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD)        mutations, we identify hundreds of reproducibly dysregulated genes and thousands        of miswired loops prior to amyloid accumulation and tau phosphorylation. Single        loops do not predict expression changes; however, the severity and direction of        change in mRNA levels and single-cell burst frequency strongly correlate with the        number of FAD-gained or -lost promoter-enhancer loops. Classic architectural        proteins CTCF and cohesin do not change occupancy in FAD-mutant neurons. Instead,        we unexpectedly find TAATTA motifs amenable to binding by DLX homeodomain        transcription factors and changing noncoding RNAPolII signal at FAD-dynamic        promoter-enhancer loops. DLX1/5/6 mRNA levels are strongly upregulated in        FAD-mutant neurons coincident with a shift in excitatory-to-inhibitory gene        expression and miswiring of multi-loops connecting enhancers to neural subtype        genes. DLX1 overexpression is sufficient for loop miswiring in wildtype neurons,        including lost and gained loops at enhancers with tandem TAATTA arrays and        singular TAATTA motifs, respectively.

The discovery of novel AD-associated genetic        variants, particularly in coding regions and from APOE ε4 non-carriers, is        critical for understanding the pathology of AD. In this study, we carried out an        exome-wide association analysis of age-of-onset of AD with ~20,000 subjects and        placed more emphasis on APOE ε4 non-carriers. Using Cox mixed-effects models, we        find that age-of-onset shows a stronger genetic signal than AD case-control        status, capturing many known variants with stronger significance, and also        revealing new variants. We identified two novel variants, rs56201815, a rare        synonymous variant in ERN1, and rs12373123, a common missense variant in SPPL2C        in the MAPT region in APOE ε4 non-carriers. Besides, a rare missense variant        rs144292455 in TACR3 showed the consistent direction of effect sizes across all        studies with a suggestive significant level. In an attempt to unravel their        regulatory and biological functions, we found that the minor allele of rs56201815        was associated with lower average FDG uptake across five brain regions in ADNI.        Our eQTL analyses based on 6198 gene expression samples from ROSMAP and GTEx        revealed that the minor allele of rs56201815 was potentially associated with        elevated expression of ERN1, a key gene triggering unfolded protein response        (UPR), in multiple brain regions, including the posterior cingulate cortex and        nucleus accumbens. Our cell-type-specific eQTL analysis using ~80,000 single        nuclei in the prefrontal cortex revealed that the protective minor allele of        rs12373123 significantly increased the expression of GRN in microglia, and was        associated with MAPT expression in astrocytes. These findings provide novel        evidence supporting the hypothesis of the potential involvement of the UPR to ER        stress in the pathological pathway of AD, and also give more insights into        underlying regulatory mechanisms behind the pleiotropic effects of rs12373123 in        multiple degenerative diseases including AD and Parkinson's disease.",d304a67e265df13a2d37e88a6792ccbd6b42255a,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d304a67e265df13a2d37e88a6792ccbd6b42255a,33637690,PMC7910483,,False,Translational psychiatry,101562664,0.2709622383117676,0.020618556701030927,13,7.989,0.5477386934673367,0.6130653266331658,0.263656697189018

The main protein        components of these hallmarks include Aβ40, Aβ42, tau, phosphor-tau, and APOE. We        hypothesize that genetic variants influence the levels and solubility of these        AD-related proteins in the brain; identifying these may provide key insights into        disease pathogenesis. METHODS: Genome-wide genotypes were collected from 441 AD        cases, imputed to the haplotype reference consortium (HRC) panel, and filtered        for quality and frequency. Temporal cortex levels of five AD-related proteins        from three fractions, buffer-soluble (TBS), detergent-soluble (Triton-X = TX),        and insoluble (Formic acid = FA), were available for these same individuals.        Variants were tested for association with each quantitative biochemical measure        using linear regression, and GSA-SNP2 was used to identify enriched Gene Ontology        (GO) terms. Implicated variants and genes were further assessed for association        with other relevant variables. RESULTS: We identified genome-wide significant        associations at seven novel loci and the APOE locus. Genes and variants at these        loci also associate with multiple AD-related measures, regulate gene expression,        have cell-type specific enrichment, and roles in brain health and other        neuropsychiatric diseases. Pathway analysis identified significant enrichment of        shared and distinct biological pathways. CONCLUSIONS: Although all biochemical        measures tested reflect proteins core to AD pathology, our results strongly        suggest that each have unique genetic architecture and biological pathways that        influence their specific biochemical states in the brain.

We identified RORB as a marker of selectively        vulnerable excitatory neurons in the entorhinal cortex and subsequently validated        their depletion and selective susceptibility to neurofibrillary inclusions during        disease progression using quantitative neuropathological methods.

Our characterization of selectively vulnerable neurons in AD paves the way for        future mechanistic studies of selective vulnerability and potential therapeutic        strategies for enhancing neuronal resilience.",0758d48ae66d357c3c113272a660e977ce9d0bfe,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0758d48ae66d357c3c113272a660e977ce9d0bfe,33432193,PMC7854528,,False,Nature neuroscience,9809671,0.26798248291015625,0.035398230088495575,230,28.771,0.9698492462311558,0.9447236180904522,0.3817399665566863

To learn whether human AD microglia (HAM) display a similar        profile, we develop a method for purifying cell types from frozen cerebrocortical        tissues for RNA-seq analysis, allowing better transcriptome coverage than typical        single-nucleus RNA-seq approaches. The HAM profile we observe bears little        resemblance to the DAM profile. Instead, HAM display an enhanced human aging        profile, in addition to other disease-related changes such as APOE upregulation.        Analyses of whole-tissue RNA-seq and single-cell/nucleus RNA-seq datasets        corroborate our findings and suggest that the lack of DAM response in human        microglia occurs specifically in AD tissues, not other neurodegenerative        settings. These results, which can be browsed at        http://research-pub.gene.com/BrainMyeloidLandscape, provide a genome-wide picture        of microglial activation in human AD and highlight considerable differences        between mouse models and human disease.",161193b958b5ad9f3c708d4d10a0ed89678d1d84,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/161193b958b5ad9f3c708d4d10a0ed89678d1d84,32610143,PMC7422733,background,True,Cell reports,101573691,0.26798248291015625,0.0851063829787234,211,9.995,0.9597989949748744,0.6733668341708543,0.35941217243639556

However, several        experimental and computational challenges impede transcriptomics-based        deconvolution approaches using single-cell/nucleus RNA-seq reference atlases.        Cells from the brain and blood have substantially different sizes, total mRNA,        and transcriptional activities, and existing approaches may quantify total mRNA        instead of cell type proportions. Further, standards are lacking for the use of        cell reference atlases and integrative analyses of single-cell and spatial        transcriptomics data.

10.1093/nar/gkad990,ZEBRA: a hierarchically integrated gene expression atlas of the murine and human        brain at single-cell resolution.,2023.0,"The molecular causes and mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases remain poorly        understood. A growing number of single-cell studies have implicated various        neural, glial, and immune cell subtypes to affect the mammalian central nervous        system in many age-related disorders. Integrating this body of transcriptomic        evidence into a comprehensive and reproducible framework poses several        computational challenges. Here, we introduce ZEBRA, a large single-cell and        single-nucleus RNA-seq database. ZEBRA integrates and normalizes gene expression        and metadata from 33 studies, encompassing 4.2 million human and mouse brain        cells sampled from 39 brain regions. It incorporates samples from patients with        neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and        Multiple sclerosis, as well as samples from relevant mouse models. We employed        scVI, a deep probabilistic auto-encoder model, to integrate the samples and        curated both cell and sample metadata for downstream analysis. ZEBRA allows for        cell-type and disease-specific markers to be explored and compared between sample        conditions and brain regions, a cell composition analysis, and gene-wise feature        mappings. Our comprehensive molecular database facilitates the generation of        data-driven hypotheses, enhancing our understanding of mammalian brain function        during aging and disease.

Can we identify reproducible omics        signatures that differentiate between dementia subtypes? Can high-dimensional        omics data identify improved biomarkers? How can genetics inform our        understanding of causal status of dementia risk factors? And which biological        processes are altered by dementia-related genetic variation? Artificial        intelligence (AI) and machine learning approaches give us powerful new tools in        helping us to tackle these challenges, and we review possible solutions and        examples of best practice.
